{"Headline": "Whoever Wins the White House, This Year\u2019s Big Loser Is Email", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtInstead, let\u2019s examine a more basic mystery buried in the emails: Why were all these people discussing so much over email in the first place? Haven\u2019t they heard of phone calls? Face-to-face meetings in dimly lit Washington parking garage? Anyplace else where their conversations weren\u2019t constantly being recorded, archived and rendered searchable for decades to come?But everything must meet its maker, and for email, that time is nigh.The sudden exposure of the Clinton campaign email cache is perhaps the ultimate evidence that we\u2019ve all overcommitted to email \u2014 we\u2019ve put too much in it, expected too much from it, and now, finally, we\u2019re seeing the spectacular signs of its impending destruction.Email is simply not up to the rigors of modern political and business life. It lulls us into a sense of unguarded security that it never delivers. It entices us to spill our darkest secrets, and then makes those secrets available to any halfway decent hacker. There are several alternatives that could take its place, without the same pitfalls, and the Clinton cache shows why we would be wise to adopt one of them.Let\u2019s pour one out for email, which has had quite a run. Then let\u2019s move on to something else, and dance on email\u2019s grave.The latest Clinton emails come from the hacked Gmail account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. I emailed the campaign to ask about the breach and email security practices, but I got no response. (Maybe they\u2019ve shied away from email?) The campaign has refused to confirm the authenticity of the messages, which speaks to one of the shortcomings of email: It can easily be forged, so there\u2019s no good way for anyone reading those messages to confirm that they really are the Clinton campaign\u2019s.But if you assume the messages are authentic, you quickly discover even more shortcomings of email. What\u2019s most striking about the Podesta cache is how central email has been to the campaign\u2019s operations. In 2016, presidential campaigns, like all large enterprises, are far-flung operations. Lots of people in lots of different places are trying to plan things together. To the extent there\u2019s any centrality to the organization, it\u2019s in email communication.You can see why this can be handy. Having a single place to discuss everything makes teams more efficient. In the Clinton campaign, email is used as a way to convey news, to set out tactics and strategy, to theorize, to push back, to gossip. It\u2019s used in place of phone calls and face-to-face meetings; it\u2019s used as an instant messenger, a daily calendar and a collaborative whiteboard.By the second day of discussions, the thread was getting long and going nowhere, so Robby Mook, the campaign manager, proposed a quick phone call to hash out the idea. He almost apologized for suggesting a call, which he worried was too grown-up, \u201ctoo processy.\u201dThe phone call apparently happened. But in the Clinton campaign, even a phone call needed to be documented in email. So after the call, another staff member reported on the decision made during the call: to bar any donations from foreign agents.But it didn\u2019t end there. Marc E. Elias, the campaign\u2019s general counsel, then chimed in to say that he hadn\u2019t been on the call but that he opposed the ban on foreign donations, which he said would feel arbitrary.That set off another round of discussions, sparking annoyance among some people on the thread. Finally, Mr. Mook wrote in to say that thanks to Mr. Elias, he had changed his mind, and was now leaning toward taking money from foreign agents. \u201cAre you guys O.K. with that?\u201d he asked.That prompted the kicker from Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s communications director: \u201cTake the money!!\u201d she wrote from her iPhone.In the days following WikiLeaks\u2019 publication, this thread became a campaign issue. Donald J. Trump even drew attention to Ms. Palmieri\u2019s line at a rally this week.But it didn\u2019t have to be so. If they had been using some other system to communicate, they would most likely have avoided this trouble.A more modern communication system, something like Slack or HipChat, could still be hacked, but would have allowed for a central administrator to set an archiving policy. After a few days or weeks, this sort of conversation would have been erased. That\u2019s less practical for email, which by its very nature is decentralized. Once you send an email, your thread resides on every device that every recipient ever downloaded it on.But there\u2019s something even more pernicious than weak security here. The deeper problem with email is that it has never quite settled on a social mode. An email can be as formal as a legal letter or as tossed off as drive-by insult. This invites confusion. For instance, in context, Ms. Palmieri\u2019s \u201cTake the money!!\u201d doesn\u2019t sound so bad \u2014 it looks like a quick, half-cheeky way to end an overlong discussion. If it were said on a phone call or an instant message, \u201cTake the money\u201d would have sounded like an entirely normal way to end the conversation.But email comes with no expectations. Because everything else in the thread sounds serious, Ms. Palmieri\u2019s ending line can easily be colored as more sinister.In other words, limits often help. Get on the phone, make a decision, ditch your inbox. The world will be better off for it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Coke and Pepsi Give Millions to Public Health, Then Lobby Against It", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byThe beverage giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have given millions of dollars to nearly 100 prominent health groups in recent years, while simultaneously spending millions to defeat public health legislation that would reduce Americans\u2019 soda intake, according to public health researchers.The study\u2019s authors, Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University school of public health, and Daniel Aaron, a student at Boston University\u2019s medical school, scoured public records including news releases, newspaper databases, lobbying reports, the medical literature and information released by the beverage giants themselves. While some of the incidents cited in the study already have been reported by news organizations, the medical journal report is the first to take a comprehensive look at the industry\u2019s strategy of donating to health organizations while at the same time lobbying against public health measures. The study tracked industry donations and lobbying spending from 2011 through 2015, at a time when many cities were mulling soda taxes or other regulations to combat obesity.\u201cWe wanted to look at what these companies really stand for,\u201d said Mr. Aaron, the study\u2019s co-author. \u201cAnd it looks like they are not helping public health at all \u2014 in fact they\u2019re opposing it almost across the board, which calls these sponsorships into question.\u201dMr. Aaron said that the industry donations created \u201cclear-cut conflicts of interest\u201d for the health groups that accepted them.The report found a number of instances in which influential health groups accepted beverage industry donations and then backed away from supporting soda taxes or remained noticeably silent about the initiatives.Responding to the new research, Save the Children said, in a statement, that the group in 2010 had decided to focus on early childhood education, and that its decision to stop supporting soda taxes \u201cwas unrelated to any corporate support that Save the Children received.\u201dThe academy said it no longer has a sponsorship relationship with the beverage firms.\u201cThe beverage industry is using corporate philanthropy to undermine public health measures,\u201d said Kelly D. Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke, who was not involved in the new research.The American Diabetes Association accepted $140,000 from the company between 2012 and 2014. The American Heart Association received more than $400,000 from Coke between 2010 and 2015. And the National Institutes of Health received nearly $2 million from Coke between 2010 and 2014.In a statement, the heart association said the group is \u201cleading efforts to reduce consumption of sugary drinks,\u201d and the group has advocated for increased taxes on sugary drinks.\u201cTo achieve our goals, we must engage a wide variety of food and beverage companies to be part of the solution,\u201d the statement said. The soda sponsorship does not have \u201c any influence on our science and the public policy positions we advocate for.\u201dCoke referred questions about the study to their trade group, the American Beverage Association.\u201cWe believe our actions in communities and the marketplace are contributing to addressing the complex challenge of obesity,\u201d the beverage association said. \u201cWe stand strongly for our need, and right, to partner with organizations that strengthen our communities.\u201dThe beverage association said it disagreed with public health advocates \u201con discriminatory and regressive taxes and policies on our products.\u201dIn a statement PepsiCo said it is \u201cincorrectly painted as a \u2018soda company,\u2019 when only a quarter of our global revenue comes from carbonated soft drinks.\u201d\u201cWe believe that obesity is a complex, multifaceted issue and that our company has an important role to play in addressing it - which includes engaging with public health organizations and responding to consumers\u2019 demand for healthier products,\u201d the statement said.From 2011 to 2015, Coke spent on average more than $6 million per year lobbying against public health measures aimed at curbing soda consumption, according to data from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Pepsi spent about $3 million per year during that period, and the American Beverage Association spent more than $1 million each year, the study found.In 2009 alone, when the government proposed a federal soda tax to curb obesity that would help finance health care reform, Coke, Pepsi and the American Beverage Association spent a combined $38 million lobbying against the measure, which ultimately failed.Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said the paper shows that soda companies \u201cwant to have it both ways \u2014 appear as socially responsible corporate citizens and lobby against public health measures every chance they get.\u201dEditor\u2019s Note: This story was updated after publication with additional comment from PepsiCo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Split Over Donald Trump Threatens to Tilt Republican States", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byDemocrats are moving swiftly to exploit Mr. Trump\u2019s crumbling position in the presidential race, aiming to run up a big margin of victory for Mrs. Clinton and extend their political advantage into the congressional elections next month.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has concluded that at least two traditionally Republican states, Georgia and Arizona, are realistic targets for her campaign to win over. And Republican polling has found that Mr. Trump is at dire risk of losing Georgia, according to people briefed on the polls, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mrs. Clinton now holds such a strong upper hand that Priorities USA, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing her campaign, may direct some of its war chest into Senate races, two people said, and may begin broadcasting ads for those contests as soon as next week. Congressional Democrats also hope to persuade Mrs. Clinton to continue pouring money and campaign resources into states like Virginia and Colorado, where they believe her victory is assured, in order to lift other Democratic candidates.In a signal of Democrats\u2019 growing focus on the House and Senate, Mrs. Clinton used a visit on Tuesday to Miami to attack both Mr. Trump and Senator Marco Rubio, whom Mrs. Clinton blasted for what she described as his indifference to climate change.\u201cWe need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding, \u201cIt is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change, to say, \u2018I\u2019m not a scientist.\u2019\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, told reporters that she would continue to call out down-ballot Republicans. Mr. Rubio is among the Republicans whom Priorities USA may seek to defeat, if the group decides to intervene in Senate races, one strategist said.Increasingly anxious Republicans have not come up with a unified strategy for containing the damage from Mr. Trump\u2019s embattled candidacy, and several strategists and party officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they were awaiting a new round of polling before settling on a course. But, in a sign that Republicans now view the presidential race as a lost cause, several Senate candidates are preparing ads asking voters to elect them as a check on Mrs. Clinton in the White House.\u201cPaul Ryan opened borders and amnesty and bad budgets,\u201d Mr. Trump said.He declared himself a liberated man, writing on Twitter:. \u201cIt is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.\u201dShould Mr. Trump continue deriding the leaders of the institutional Republican Party, it could have profound consequences down the ballot, potentially depressing turnout by demoralizing the party or leading Mr. Trump\u2019s ardent supporters to deny their votes to Republicans who abandoned him. But there is little Republicans can do to control Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior: The party\u2019s donors have no leverage over him, he is relying largely on small donors and, at 70, he is not mindful of any future campaign.The emerging dynamic may be especially toxic for Republicans in swing states that are also home to competitive races for the House and Senate, where the party\u2019s candidates must choose between two unpalatable options: alienating much of their party\u2019s base, or standing behind a nominee who is unacceptable to most mainstream voters. The voting bloc that especially concerns Republican officials are the right-of-center, college-educated voters who usually favor Republican candidates but cannot abide Mr. Trump. These voters can make up anywhere between a quarter to a third of the party\u2019s electoral coalition.\u201cThat voter is clearly not going to vote for Donald Trump,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist who is working on several Senate races. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t vote at all, it\u2019s catastrophic for us.\u201dThe nightmare possibility for the party is that swing voters punish the party because of Mr. Trump, the anti-Trump Republicans stay at home and Mr. Trump\u2019s base casts a ballot for him and then leaves the polls. Under those conditions, Senate races in places like Pennsylvania and North Carolina could fall to Democrats, while Senate and House races in places like Missouri, Arizona and Kansas could move to the center of the battlefield.In Nevada, the Republican candidate for Senate, Representative Joe Heck, withdrew his support from Mr. Trump over the weekend, and is facing a furious backlash.Sandie Kirwin, a Las Vegas retail manager supportive of Mr. Trump, said she might now vote for a Democrat over Mr. Heck in a critical Senate race.\u201cI think of Joe Heck the same I do of any Republican not supporting Donald Trump,\u201d said Ms. Kirwin, 52. \u201cI will never support any of them, and I will do what I can to get them out of office.\u201dIn Pennsylvania, Jaye Steuterman, a registered Republican and a real estate agent in Doylestown, said she was still undecided on which presidential candidate to vote for. She said she was deeply unsettled by Mr. Trump\u2019s past comments about forcing himself on women, but that might not be enough to stop her voting for him.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s more important to me \u2014 that, or the fact that Hillary is a liar,\u201d Ms. Steuterman said.In the Senate race, she is inclined to vote for Mr. Toomey because he is a Republican, but her decision could depend on whether he supports Mr. Trump.Even the drastic step of denouncing Mr. Trump may not be enough to shield Republicans from his unpopularity. In a conference call on Tuesday with the Democratic caucus, Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that party polling found voters drawing scant distinction between Republicans who endorsed Mr. Trump and those who abandoned him out of political expediency, according to people who participated in the call, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was supposed to be private.On the same call, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat, expressed concern that Mrs. Clinton might abandon states that she is all but sure to win, but where Democrats are still locked in competitive races. Mr. Clyburn asked Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, to contact Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign to ensure it would not withdraw resources from Virginia and Colorado.\u201cMost people think the House now could be in play,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of scrambling going on to identify races that could flip if the presidential race somehow gets to a 10-point margin.\u201dLike their Republican counterparts, Democrats do not plan to make final strategy decisions until they receive new polling. But they have already begun aggressively attacking Republicans, even as those officials retreat from Mr. Trump.And outside groups supporting congressional Democrats have begun to reallocate their spending to take advantage of the shifting environment. The House Majority PAC, the principal outside group supporting House Democrats, this week made a $1.2 million reservation to contest the suburban Philadelphia seat held by Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick, who is retiring.In affluent, suburban areas, which were already trending strongly toward Democrats after the first presidential debate, Republican survival may depend on the willingness of voters to separate their feelings about the presidential race from their voting behavior in all other elections.Outside a ski shop on Tuesday in Aurora, Colo., Sharon and Les Sparks said they were disappointed by Republicans pulling away from Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Sparks described as \u201cspoiled little entitled brats.\u201d Among those lawmakers is Representative Mike Coffman, a Denver-area congressman who has been critical of Mr. Trump for months and recently called on him to end his campaign.Still, Mr. and Ms. Sparks said they would vote for Mr. Coffman, despite their frustration. \u201cThey need to unite,\u201d said Ms. Sparks, 49, a project manager in the health industry. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be in the Republican Party, you need to start standing behind the party.\u201dReporting was contributed by Julie Turkewitz, Kimberley McGee, Jon Hurdle, Emmarie Huetteman, Jennifer Steinhauer, Traci Angel and Amy Chozick.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel Defends His Most Contrarian Move Yet: Supporting Trump", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Peter Thiel likes to take the path not taken. He has paid students to drop out of college, thinks Silicon Valley is overrated, backed a plan to build cities on the high seas and helped propel an electronic form of money into general use. His contrarian approach to investing and to life has made him rich and celebrated.It took something truly conventional \u2014 donating money to a presidential candidate \u2014 to incite demands for his banishment.\u201cI was surprised by the intensity,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cThis is one of the few times I was involved in something that was not a fringe effort but was mainstream. Millions of people are backing Trump. I did not appreciate quite how polarizing the election would be in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.\u201dIn an interview on Friday, he outlined his thinking. \u201cIdeally, this will have the give-and-take of debate,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ll get some very tough questions about Trump. But I thought the best way to advance the discussion was not to have some completely contrived format. The future of this country depends on us engaging with the tough questions.\u201dOne of the things he will try to do is underline his support for Trump the candidate while distancing himself from the behavior of Trump the man. He believes it is possible to separate the two.\u201cThe millions of people who vote for Trump are not doing it because of the worst things he said or did,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. The Americans who are voting for Trump are doing it because they judge the situation of the country to be urgent. We\u2019re at such a crucial point that you have to overlook personal characteristics.\u201dMr. Thiel has been an important player in Silicon Valley since the first dot-com boom, but he has recently taken on a much more public role. He was born in Germany and came to the United States as an infant when his father, a chemical engineer, found work here. He was raised in Silicon Valley and went to Stanford, where he developed the views in his first book, \u201cThe Diversity Myth,\u201d about the multiculturalism debate on campuses, written with the entrepreneur David O. Sacks.In 1998, Mr. Thiel helped found the online payments company PayPal, an immediate success. He was the first outside investor in Facebook. Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.7 billion. Last year, he became a part-time partner at Y Combinator, a loosely defined advisory position.A handful of others in Silicon Valley have similar investing track records. Where Mr. Thiel really separates himself from his peers is his skepticism that Silicon Valley is building a better world for all. His investment firm, Founders Fund, used to begin its online manifesto with the complaint, \u201cWe wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters,\u201d a reference to Twitter. Now it says simply, \u201cWhat happened to the future?\u201dSan Francisco, Manhattan and Washington, D.C., are doing well, but the presidential campaign has laid bare the angst of many other places. Feelings of decline are rampant. \u201cMost of the millennials have lower expectations than their baby boomer parents,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cWhere I differ from others in Silicon Valley is in thinking that you can\u2019t fence yourself off. If it continues, it will ultimately be bad for everybody.\u201dThe polls have been saying Mrs. Clinton is likely to win. If that happens, \u201cthere will be a very big need to push back on the sort of happy but misleading consensus about things,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cThere will be an important role for me and others to somehow play in speaking truth to power.\u201dTo an extent, that is. \u201cIt would be a mistake and inappropriate to instantly demonize Hillary and to try and sabotage her presidency,\u201d he said. That would be repeating what happened in 2008, when the Republican Party did exactly that to President Obama.She said she turned down an investment of $500,000 \u2014 a huge sum for a small firm like Backstage \u2014 because of the investor\u2019s ties to Mr. Thiel. Ms. Hamilton did not identify the investor or respond to an email.Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, defended the company\u2019s association with Mr. Thiel, emphasizing that it did not endorse his views \u2014 and much less Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 but was striving to be inclusive toward those whose values differed from its own. Critics noted that if diversity was such a cherished value in Silicon Valley, why wasn\u2019t there more of it?Mr. Thiel said he agreed that there was a point where views became unacceptable, but argued that he was on the right side of the line.\u201cThe line cannot or should not be at a point where you\u2019re excommunicating half the country,\u201d he said. \u201cSome fringe views I hope we can tolerate. Some fringe views are beyond the pale.\u201d He said no one at Facebook or Y Combinator had asked him to censor himself, and he did not consider stepping down from either post.The donation to the Trump campaign proved much more contentious in Silicon Valley than the revelation in May that Mr. Thiel had secretly funded a lawsuit to kill Gawker, which revealed in 2007 that he was gay. Many in Silicon Valley were sympathetic to Mr. Thiel\u2019s actions.When Gawker.com was shut down in August, Mr. Thiel said he had one final thought: \u201cGood riddance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airbnb Proposes Cracking Down on New York City Hosts", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byAirbnb said on Wednesday that it was willing to crack down on individuals in New York City who rent out multiple homes, bowing to pressure from politicians and tenants\u2019 rights groups who say the company has worsened affordable housing issues in the city.The company also said, in a proposal to city officials, that it was willing to create a registry of hosts to make it easier for the state to enforce housing rules and that it would create a hotline for neighbors\u2019 complaints. It would bar hosts who violated local regulations three times, and it said it had already taken 3,000 commercial operators off its service.In June, state lawmakers voted to impose steep fines on anyone who rents out a whole apartment on Airbnb for fewer than 30 days. Such short-term rentals have been illegal since 2010. That bill was delivered to Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday. Mr. Cuomo now has 10 days to veto it or let it become law.In addition, the company, which is based in San Francisco, said it would ensure that landlords receive a cut of the revenue if renters offered their apartments through Airbnb \u2014 a sticking point for many property owners.Local politicians have for several years tried to persuade Airbnb to remove from the service people who are operating illegally, and the company\u2019s critics said its proposal validated many of their concerns.\u201cIt\u2019s a tacit acknowledgment of what we\u2019ve been saying all along \u2014 that Airbnb is dominated by commercial operators with multiple listings who are stealing our supply of affordable housing,\u201d said Neal Kwatra, the chief strategist for Share Better, a coalition of elected officials, affordable housing activists, community groups and unions aligned against Airbnb.Mr. Kwatra added that Airbnb\u2019s proposal was \u201cnothing more than the same failed P.R. stunt Airbnb has tried in every city that seeks to strengthen regulations to stem the tide of their exacerbation of the affordable housing crisis.\u201dNew York City is Airbnb\u2019s largest market in the United States. Hosts in the city generated about $1 billion in revenue, and a portion of that goes to the company.Liz Krueger, a New York state senator who is one of Airbnb\u2019s strongest opponents, called Wednesday\u2019s proposals \u201ca publicity stunt\u201d and a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to change anti-Airbnb sentiment.\u201cA bill that passed with almost unanimous support in both houses of the legislature has been sent to the governor, and I\u2019m optimistic he will sign it,\u201d Ms. Krueger said.In a conference call with reporters, Chris Lehane, Airbnb\u2019s head of public policy, presented Airbnb\u2019s battle with New York as a \u201cclassic people versus the power\u201d fight in which politicians who oppose the company are pro-special interest and anti-middle class. He called out by name Peter Ward, the powerful head of the hotel union, who is also a longtime ally of Mr. Cuomo.Still, Mr. Lehane said Airbnb wanted \u201cto proceed in a positive, progressive way\u201d with governments around the world. Airbnb hosts will present the governor\u2019s office with testimonials on how home sharing has helped them make ends meet.\u201cRegardless of the outcome,\u201d Mr. Lehane said, \u201cour work on this issue continues.\u201dMr. Lehane said Airbnb\u2019s proposed rules for home sharing in New York were the result of hundreds of conversations with different constituent groups, including landlords and tenants.Tax payments are made by hosts rather than by Airbnb, so those payments essentially redefine hosts as small hotel operators rather than as just people who share space in their homes for a small fee. New York politicians have argued that they do not want to tax illegal activity.Airbnb is fighting other legal skirmishes in cities around the world. San Francisco and Santa Monica, Calif., have both fined the company for processing illegal listings on the site. In response, Airbnb has sued both cities. A ballot measure that would have severely restricted Airbnb rentals in San Francisco was defeated last year.Airbnb has also created a way for its platform to prevent hosts in San Francisco from controlling multiple listings, a tool that will be available on Nov. 1.Airbnb has tripled in value in just two years. While it was raising its latest round of financing, which valued the company at $30 billion, regulatory issues in New York City and San Francisco were mentioned as risks to investors, according to a person with knowledge of the funding round who declined to comment on the record because the talks were private.When asked during the conference call whether regulatory issues stood in the way of a public offering of Airbnb stock, Mr. Lehane said that home sharing was too large a movement to stop and that in the next year or two, almost every big city in the world, \u201cwith the possible exception of New York,\u201d would have put in place a regulatory structure that embraced home sharing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Showgirls, Pastrami and Candor: Gloria Steinem\u2019s New York", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byLions of New YorkGloria Steinem started her career as a C.I.A. operative, got her break as a Playboy Bunny, married Christian Bale\u2019s father and now produces a show for the cable television channel Viceland, the home of \u201cBalls Deep\u201d and \u201cAction Bronson Watches Ancient Aliens.\u201d Beyond that, there are some gaps in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9.On a recent afternoon in her Upper East Side apartment, she addressed one of those gaps. She was wearing a Toledo Mud Hens T-shirt and moving gingerly because of back pain. The gap concerned Stephen Sondheim, and the time Ms. Steinem asked him to create crossword puzzles for New York magazine.\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d she asked. \u201cNobody knows that.\u201dMs. Steinem, now 82, went on to other pursuits as well.Rolling into breakfast recently, after a weekend in North Carolina promoting her book and the candidacy of Deborah Ross, a Democrat, for the United States Senate, Ms. Steinem said she had been up until 5 a.m. revising a piece for The Boston Globe about her opposition to a proposed oil pipeline on tribal lands in North Dakota.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine not working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even working; well, it\u2019s an addiction, really, but I can\u2019t imagine not doing it.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s possible that more people are requesting me to speak because they think I\u2019m going to die, given that I\u2019m 82.\u201dMs. Steinem has a disarming laugh that seems to say, \u201cCan you believe the silly thing Gloria Steinem just said?\u201d After she has spent so much time in the public eye, I asked how she would write her job description.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I have to put down something on a form I say writer, because that came first.\u201d She hunted around for another word. \u201cAnd organizer. I don\u2019t know how else to say it.\u201dMs. Steinem would also call herself a New Yorker, a fact that sometimes gets lost amid her well-traveled biography. She has lived in the same apartment for nearly 50 years, since she and a friend rented the parlor floor of what is now a duplex for $300 a month. In 1969, when she was writing for New York magazine, she considered running for city comptroller on a ticket with Norman Mailer and Jimmy Breslin, whose platform included building a monorail around Manhattan.It was, she said, a literary lark.\u201cNobody ever imagined being in office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was out of love of New York and imagining what it could be. I think somebody asked Jimmy what he would do if he won, and he said, \u2018Demand a recount.\u2019\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t live anywhere else,\u201d she said.Like a true New Yorker, she has never learned to drive.In the living room where she held the first meetings for what would become Ms. magazine in 1971, she recalled the day she fell in love with the city, on a visit from Smith College in the mid-1950s.\u201cI was walking in the theater district, and I stopped by a delicatessen,\u201d she said, \u201cand there were three or four showgirls from some Broadway show, and they were in full regalia and headdresses and makeup, and they were standing there and ordering pastrami sandwiches, and nobody gave it a second thought. And I thought, Oh, I want to live here.\u201dLater, when she moved here, she made a list of things New Yorkers did that scared her. \u201cOne was that they said things three times that we in the Midwest wouldn\u2019t say even once,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was that they told you terrible things that were wrong with them, but then didn\u2019t do anything about it. In the Midwest if you say it, you have to do something about it. One was they didn\u2019t eat standing up out of the refrigerator. One was they ate red meat. I had seen pot roast, but not red meat.\u201dShe has outlived or outlasted or out-niced many of her critics, including the newscaster Harry Reasoner, who famously said of Ms. magazine, \u201cI\u2019ll give it six months before they run out of things to say,\u201d or feminist contemporaries who accused her of hijacking the movement away from its more radical founders.\u201cI don\u2019t know how she does it,\u201d said Susan Brownmiller, author of the landmark feminist work \u201cAgainst Our Will,\u201d who has traded barbs with Ms. Steinem for four decades. \u201cAnd she is still so totally beautiful. When women went to see her, they were just relieved, because she was so calm, and she could be funny. She made a lot of women feel, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what the women\u2019s movement looks like. I can be part of that.\u2019\u201dStill, Ms. Brownmiller said, there were matters of feminist history to set straight. \u201cGuys in the media chose Gloria as our leader,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us, our hope is that eventually history will straighten this all out and say, no, Gloria came in a little later, and her very loyal supporters have backtracked that history.\u201dIn \u201cMy Life on the Road,\u201d newly out in paperback, Ms. Steinem describes a rootlessness at odds with her steadfast devotion to New York. In one 20-year span, she never went a week without being on an airplane.In her childhood, her father used to shuttle the family around the country in a trailer, buying and selling antiques along the way to support them. The closest they had to a home base was Clarklake, Mich., where her father ran a summer dance pavilion, until the fall weather chased them south toward Florida or California.\u201cLiving in trailer parks is sobering, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d Ms. Steinem said. She came to ground only after her parents split up when she was 10, and she became caretaker for her mentally ill mother in East Toledo, Ohio. She did not attend school regularly until about seventh grade.Her travels took her to Smith and then a two-year fellowship in India. When she arrived in New York for good in 1960, it was to be a journalist, as her mother once was.She also became a notable person-about-town. Time magazine, in 1969, called her \u201cone of the best dates to take to a New York party these days \u2014 or, failing such luck, one of the most arresting names to drop,\u201d adding that she had \u201clegs worthy of her miniskirts, and a brain that keeps conversation lively without getting tricky.\u201dMs. Steinem recalled those years in a less glamorous light. \u201cIf we spent $10 on a night out, we\u2019d say, \u2018Where are we going to get $10?\u2019\u201d she said. At parties, if things got too high-hat, she would say she was feeling the effects of her malaria and excuse herself.There were years of second-acting plays, then staying up with the actors because they were all full of adrenaline, and having breakfast at the Automat.\u201cI remember that we once stole groceries from a store in the Village, because we were all broke,\u201d she said. \u201cLater on I went back to pay the old guy who was running the grocery, and that was my mistake, because it meant that he was admitting that someone could steal from him. I didn\u2019t understand that. Dignity is sometimes more important than money.\u201dAs a young freelance writer, she said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t even have a word then for sexual harassment. It was just called life. It was just your job to avoid attention without alienating the editor. So there was an editor who always gave me a choice as I was leaving. I could either do something like mail his letters or I could go to a hotel room with him in the afternoon. Needless to say I mailed his letters.\u201dWhen Ms. Steinem gathered some of the movement\u2019s best writers for Ms. magazine, she was accused by Ms. Friedan of \u201cripping off the movement for private profit\u201d and by radical feminists of creating a shadow movement to undermine their own.Ms. Steinem paints the chapter as an innocent one, saying that no one in the C.I.A. ever asked her to do or say anything, and that she did not report back to the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s so interesting now, because the initials C.I.A. will make people believe anything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t like that. It just was so uncontrolled. As I remember saying at the time, if this was our grandmother\u2019s money we\u2019d be doing the same thing.\u201dThe criticism by other feminists was especially wounding. \u201cThey never called to ask me what I did,\u201d she said. \u201cThat hurt more than anything.\u201d She added, \u201cIf anybody still cares about what happened so long ago, I\u2019m happy to answer any questions.\u201dThese are lively times to be Gloria Steinem, with the possibility of the first woman elected president and the word \u201cfeminist\u201d \u2014 seen in bus-size letters on the Beyonc\u00e9 concert stage \u2014 again finding currency among young women. Her recent friends include some, like Lena Dunham and the playwright and performer Sarah Jones, who were not yet born when she started Ms. In speeches, Ms. Steinem quotes the three women who started the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThey are so far ahead of where we were, it\u2019s staggering,\u201d she said of the younger women she meets. \u201cThe only way I\u2019ve managed to express this is, I just had to wait for some of my friends to be born.\u201dHer age has made her more strategic and also freer, she said: \u201cFifty was hardest for me, because it\u2019s the end of the center of life, especially a gendered center of life. But by the time I got to be 60, it was like a new world. Society has given up because it\u2019s all about having or raising children, really, and by 60 society doesn\u2019t care that much, so you\u2019re free. Seventy was certainly about mortality. And 80 even more so.\u201d She cited a Native American observation that old age is like childhood, a time of wonder, because both are near to the unknown.\u201cGloria has been an advocate and visionary of this for decades,\u201d Ms. Shifman said. \u201cOne thing about Gloria, quintessential Gloria, is that she sees herself in community with diverse groups of women, including formerly incarcerated women. Her purpose is to ask questions and listen.\u201dOn a beautiful fall morning, Ms. Steinem seemed to lose interest in sitting still and answering questions. \u201cWant to see my bench?\u201d she said. For her 80th birthday, friends had presented her with a log bench in Central Park, near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On the short walk over, a young woman stopped Ms. Steinem to thank her for being an inspiration. A man in a taxi yelled, \u201cLove you, Gloria,\u201d and flashed a \u201cV\u201d sign. Ms. Steinem gave him a thumbs up and strode purposefully across Park Avenue.As Ms. Steinem climbed the hill toward her bench, the man sitting there appeared to know who she was.\u201cGo away, crackers,\u201d he said. Ms. Steinem continued to smile, assuring him she did not want him to move. He cursed at her and said, \u201cThat Steinem died a long time ago.\u201dDown the hill, she seemed visibly shaken, but unwilling to criticize the man, who was black. \u201cWhen you\u2019re treated as a group, you treat others as a group,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m \u2018cracker.\u2019\u201dA few days later, she emailed to say that the encounter with the man on the bench was \u201cpart of the reason I\u2019m not about to leave New York. At least we see each other and have a chance to talk and absorb what someone else is experiencing. We\u2019re not isolated in a tin can of a car or behind highways and gates.\u201d There was also the novelty of being called a cracker; a first, she wrote.In a lifetime of activism, that may be her signature. Any encounter, even hostile, could be an opportunity. It was a philosophy to live by, and perhaps, eventually, to die by. Why dwell on conflict or loss?\u201cMy funeral,\u201d she said, \u201cwill be a fund-raiser.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lloyds to Cut 1,340 Jobs as Part of a Longstanding Overhaul", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 The Lloyds Banking Group said on Wednesday that it would eliminate 1,340 jobs as part of a longstanding restructuring plan.The lender warned at the time of the summer announcement that Britain\u2019s decision in June to leave the European Union, known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d could slow the country\u2019s economy.Lloyds had 74,117 employees as of June 30. The bank said on Wednesday it would create 110 new roles across its group operations, retail, customer products and marketing, finance and risk divisions, resulting in a net reduction of 1,230 jobs.\u201cThis process involves taking difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way,\u201d Lloyds said in a news release. \u201cAll affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today.\u201dThe bank said it would try to achieve the job cuts through voluntary departures. \u201cCompulsory redundancies will always be a last resort,\u201d it said.The announcement drew the ire of unions representing Lloyds employees.\u201cWe know the outlook for banks is tough due to record low interest rates, falling revenues and the changes in technology and customer behaviors,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this \u2018death by a thousand cuts\u2019 approach does nothing to give confidence to those who will be staying with the business, trying their best to meet customers\u2019 needs and help to sustain the group for the future.\u201dThe government, which at one point held more than 40 percent of the lender, has said that it expects to recoup all of the \u00a320.3 billion that it injected into the bank during the financial crisis.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byThe most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes.Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax.Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It\u2019s called cash taxes paid \u2014 the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes.I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country\u2019s 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be.A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes.Remember: That\u2019s not just federal taxes. It\u2019s federal, state, local and foreign taxes.How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices.Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent.\u201cThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. \u201cAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.\u201dThere is another victim, too \u2014 one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can\u2019t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren\u2019t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven\u2019t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can\u2019t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon\u2019s rate.This system is cumbersome \u2014 causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance \u2014 and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors\u2019 money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they\u2019re just looking out for the rest of us.Don\u2019t be fooled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Key Senate Race Shifts to a Ground Game: Knocking on Doors", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 For all the millions of dollars spent on this election, the outcome may come down to people like Megan Blas.A 25-year-old college student who grew up in Guam, Ms. Blas spends up to 32 hours each week knocking on doors, canvassing voters and logging responses. There are hundreds like her in Nevada, which is serving as a fierce proxy fight for the ground war between outside groups supporting Democrats and Republicans. They are using advanced analytics and old-fashioned legwork to meet the most basic of election objectives: turning out the vote.For years, outside groups have been building political organizations that target voters in highly refined segments, then make a final push to get their supporters to the polls, in many cases supplanting the role once played by political parties. It has become as much science as art, with mass accumulations of data. But in the final weeks, it is human contact from people like Ms. Blas that can make the difference in a close election like the Senate race here.Ms. Blas works for a Democratic-aligned \u201csuper PAC,\u201d For Our Future, reaching out to Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders scattered across Las Vegas. One afternoon last week, she hopped out of a charcoal-gray Mazda and headed up the sidewalk past rows of identical tile-roofed condominiums, looking for the solitary dot on her cellphone map that identified a potential voter\u2019s name, age and gender.Republican-aligned groups have their own well-funded, grass-roots army. Marcos Lopez, 22, works for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group financed largely by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, which has been building an extensive get-out-the-vote operation for several election cycles. \u201cThe beautiful thing about A.F.P. I love in particular is that I never have to go against my own values and my own beliefs,\u201d Mr. Lopez said as he knocked on doors in a tidy retirement community in the warm October sunshine, a CamelBak pack strapped to his back.For many voters, the advertising that has saturated their television screens and filled their mailboxes for months has become almost white noise, and it is the personal touch of a conversation with a canvasser that can have a greater impact.\u201cAt some point, it all becomes static,\u201d said Adam Jones, Americans for Prosperity\u2019s Nevada director, spreading a messy stack of glossy campaign mailers across his desk.The Senate race in Nevada is among a handful of contests that could determine control of Congress.More than 85 percent of Nevada voters live in the Las Vegas area, a sprawling city still recovering from the 2008 housing crisis that has left a transient population. Voter rolls, particularly for Latinos, who could make up 20 percent of the state\u2019s voters, have been rendered relatively unreliable.That has not stopped the legions of canvassers, who this weekend will begin urging voters to cast their ballots early at trailers in the parking lot of their local Home Depot or Albertsons, among other locations.Much of the attention is focused on the Senate race. Republicans are hoping that Representative Joe Heck will win the seat held by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. But Mr. Reid fervently wants Democrats to keep the seat he has held for 30 years and strongly supports Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general.There are some signs that the Democrats\u2019 ground game is prevailing. By the end of September, they led Republicans in registered voters in Nevada by more than 77,000. President Obama is expected to campaign here on Sunday for Ms. Cortez Masto and his preferred successor, Hillary Clinton.It may well be voters\u2019 views of Donald J. Trump, though, that determine the outcomes.Mr. Heck recently called on the Republican presidential nominee to withdraw from the race after the release of a recording in which Mr. Trump boasted about sexually assaulting women in vulgar terms.This year many conservative groups have decided to stay out of the presidential race. In Nevada, Americans for Prosperity and the Libre Initiative, another free-market-devoted group backed by the Koch brothers, have instead focused on defeating Ms. Cortez Masto, spending more than $400,000 so far.Other groups have spent millions running ads in Las Vegas\u2019s expensive media market, investing in broader efforts to try to sway the race over voter turnout. The Senate Majority PAC, a group with connections to Mr. Reid that is helping Democratic Senate candidates, has spent more than $5.4 million here. Another super PAC with ties to the Koch brothers, the Freedom Partners Action Fund, has spent more than $7.6 million on the Senate race \u2014 more than either party\u2019s campaign committee.The appeal of outside groups is especially apparent as many Republicans struggle to reconcile their values with a presidential nominee who does not share all of theirs.\u201cWhen you invest in ideas and principles, those aren\u2019t going to let you down,\u201d Mr. Jones said.Americans for Prosperity has dispatched more than 600 unpaid volunteers in Nevada in the past two months to the doors of potentially undecided voters, armed with GPS-enabled iPads loaded with voter data and talking points about Ms. Cortez Masto\u2019s record, Mr. Jones said.For Our Future, which is affiliated with Mr. Steyer\u2019s NextGen Climate, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and three major unions, is spending to try to keep pace, with much of the money devoted to canvassing. Last week alone, the group spent more than $52,000 in Nevada, while Americans for Prosperity spent more than $28,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Some of that money is used to pay For Our Future\u2019s canvassers \u2014 $15 to $17 an hour, with health insurance.For Our Future and its local partners use MiniVAN, an app used in recent elections that provides voter registration information and allows Democratic organizers to track their canvassers in real time. As Ms. Blas went from house to house, she used her cellphone to update the app, which syncs automatically to allow other canvassers to use their information and revisit people most likely to vote for Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Cortez Masto.Success is measured in \u201cattempts,\u201d or doors knocked. By last week, For Our Future had knocked on about 376,000 doors in Nevada, according to its state officials.\u201cWe want quality and quantity,\u201d Hector Rivera, a regional field director, told a group of recruits. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people sounding like robots,\u201d he added. \u201cOr Marco Rubio.\u201dCome Election Day, canvassers will knock on the doors of those who did not cast their ballots during the 14-day early voting period to urge them to go to the polls. And while the paycheck may appeal to her, Ms. Blas, after having a door slammed in her face, said she owes much of her motivation to Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019d want to do anything I can to make sure he doesn\u2019t become president because he doesn\u2019t seem to care very much for other people besides himself,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Celebrating Seamus Heaney\u2019s Legacy, at His Birthplace", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byBELLAGHY, Northern Ireland \u2014 \u201cNo such thing as innocent bystanding,\u201d the actress Fiona Shaw said, staring fiercely at a group of people on a chilly, heavily misted morning in a farmer\u2019s field here, filled with the sounds of lowing cattle and bird calls. The Irish-born Ms. Shaw was standing on top of a hay-filled trough, reading from Seamus Heaney\u2019s \u201cMycenae Lookout,\u201d and those words \u2014 which Heaney may have meant to refer to Ireland, as much as to Aeschylus\u2019 \u201cOresteia\u201d \u2014 took on a surprising, uneasy resonance when spoken out loud.At a time of deep cuts to arts budgets all over Britain, the existence of the gleaming new HomePlace, which cost 4.25 million pounds, or about $5.26 million to build, is testament to the love for Heaney and his work in this part of the world, as well as a desire to bring visitors to this quiet, rural area between Belfast and Derry. The opening weekend\u2019s talks, poetry readings, concerts and a dramatized version of Heaney\u2019s \u201cBeowulf\u201d were packed with locals and visitors.\u201cWe think this is the most culturally significant project in Northern Ireland for a long time,\u201d said Anthony Tohill, the chief executive of the Mid-Ulster District Council, which financed the project and has agreed to meet the center\u2019s annual running costs of \u00a3500,000. (An entrance fee of \u00a37 will cover only a small portion of the costs, Mr. Tohill said.)The reaction, \u201cIt was a big commitment for us, but the reaction we got from local ratepayers was so overwhelmingly positive,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are so proud of Seamus Heaney and delighted that something was being done to keep his legacy alive.\u201d(Mr. Tohill\u2019s words were born out when on separate occasions, two taxi drivers not only commented with pleasure on the opening of the center, but also proceeded to ruminate on their favorite Heaney poems.)The center is built on the site of a former headquarters of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the British police force that occupied a contentious place in Northern Ireland during the sectarian violence. Mr. Tohill said that when demilitarization began after the peace process in the late 1990s, the council bought the site. When Mr. Heaney died in 2013, he said, it was suggested that \u201csomething should be done to honor him in his home village.\u201dAround the same time, Marie Heaney, the poet\u2019s widow, decided to donate his library to Bellaghy. Patrick Brennan, a family friend from the village who had worked on a Heaney bibliography, suggested to the Mid-Ulster council that there might be room in a building to house Heaney\u2019s books and artifacts. To his amazement, the council suggested that a new building, on the former barracks site, be dedicated to the poet and his work.\u201cSome areas have spent money on memorials dedicated to people who have died in the Troubles,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cBut a celebration of poetry, well, that\u2019s pretty much unheard-of.\u201dMichael Heaney, one of the poet\u2019s sons, who attened the opening celebrations with his mother and two siblings, Christopher and Catherine, said that the family had donated books and artifacts to the collection.\u201cIt has been a massively emotional experience, but it has been joyous,\u201d he said.The center, which has two levels with a performance space at its center, has a permanent exhibition devoted to Heaney\u2019s life and poetry, beginning with his parents, siblings (he was the eldest of nine children) and neighbors, and exploring the influences of his upbringing on Mossbawn, the family farm. Each display of photographs and text is connected to at least one poem, both printed and heard through headphones, mostly in Heaney\u2019s own voice. The verses evoke the rhythms of the rural world in which he grew up, and the tightly bound connections between language and place, nature and the wider world.\u201cReading those childhood poems, you relive it ... and marvel at how your childhood can be put in that nice language,\u201d Hugh Heaney, one of the poet\u2019s brothers \u2014 still living in Bellaghy \u2014 is quoted as saying in a display connected to the early work.Mr. Doran, who is known for imaginative programming that uses the work of a single author as a jumping-off point for widely varied projects, said that he admired the ambition of the project. \u201cThey could easily have thought they\u2019d manage the programming themselves, but they haven\u2019t compromised in aiming for something that would be bold and attractive to international visitors,\u201d he said one morning during the opening festivities, after a tour guide had taken visitors to Mossbawn, to Heaney\u2019s grave (\u201cWalk on Air Against Your Better Judgement\u201d reads the headstone) and a number of other resonant sites.\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t know until I started working with the poems was how much the work is knitted into this locale and how much it mattered to him,\u201d Mr. Doran said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court Consolidates President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s Power", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byThe judges\u2019 decision allows the court itself to approve Mr. Maduro\u2019s budget, which he is expected to present by decree on Friday. The move caps a yearlong effort by the leftist government to use the courts, which are controlled by Maduro loyalists, to neutralize the Congress.It could also forecast a more aggressive campaign by Mr. Maduro to derail the recall referendum.Since then, Mr. Maduro has presided over an economic collapse; food, medicine and electricity shortages; and rising crime.Removing Mr. Maduro was a central pledge of opposition lawmakers when they took control of the Congress in January. A vote against the president in a recall referendum, were it held this year, would prompt a new election that would challenge leftists\u2019 grip on the presidency. But if the vote was put off until next year and succeeded, Mr. Maduro would be replaced by his vice president.Mr. Maduro has called the recall effort the equivalent of a coup.On Oct. 26, the opposition will begin three days of collecting the signatures required to reach the threshold for calling the referendum \u2014 20 percent of voters.Critics have said that the government placed restrictions on the process, particularly on the number of polling sites, which will make it challenging for Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents to gather the four million signatures they need.The Supreme Court justified its budget ruling as a means to guarantee constitutional order.\u201cFor the first time in Venezuelan history, the government is going to approve its own budget,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Guerra, an opposition legislator who is the president of the finance commission. \u201cThis has always been the Parliament\u00b4s job.\u201dThe ruling by the court\u2019s constitutional chamber follows a raft of decisions against the opposition. The court has declared Congress in contempt and ruled that its laws are therefore unconstitutional. That dispute stems from the assembly\u2019s decision to seat three legislators in defiance of another ruling by the court.The courts also overturned an opposition law meant to stabilize the economy, limited lawmakers\u2019 power to remove judges, and ratified an emergency decree that legislators had rejected.In addition, judges invalidated a law that would have freed some 120 prisoners, many of them opposition politicians or activists jailed by the government during protests. The court\u2019s initial onslaught against the assembly\u2019s authority was a demoralizing blow to lawmakers who had taken power promising to free the prisoners immediately.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Code Names and Covert Meetings in AT&T\u2019s Courtship of Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported bySoon after the wheels of the Time Warner private jet touched down at Dallas Love Field airport on Oct. 11, the media titan\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, and his top lieutenants cautiously made their way to the meeting room of a nearby hangar.The temperature that morning was already rising through the 70s. The high metallic ceiling of the hangar and the roar of jet engines outside made for a very different setting than a conference room in the glass aeries of Manhattan. But the executives did not plan on staying long.Their meeting with Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of the Dallas-based AT&T, and a handful of other executives, was intended to be the final blessing to an informal courtship that had begun in August.Within hours, the two chief executives shook hands on the outlines of a deal, including a rough idea of what such a transaction would cost. The Time Warner jet then headed back to New York, with the hard work of deal making about to pick up in earnest.Eleven days later, the two companies announced an $85.4 billion merger that could reshape the media world.This account is based on interviews with multiple executives involved in the deal, some of whom were not authorized to speak publicly about the confidential negotiations.The companies had moved quietly to construct AT&T\u2019s takeover of Time Warner, relying only on top management teams and trusted advisers. Until late last week, they avoided having word seep out, and ended up announcing the acquisition just one day ahead of schedule.The secrecy \u2014 including code names and covert meetings in Washington and Nashville \u2014 was viewed as essential. Putting together AT&T, one of the country\u2019s most powerful internet providers, with Time Warner, home of HBO and Warner Bros., would be sure to raise concerns among lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups.Skepticism has since arisen from shareholders as well. Shares of Time Warner closed down 3 percent on Monday, at $86.74 \u2014 more than 19 percent off the deal\u2019s price tag of $107.50.Executives at both companies sought to reassure investors that the deal made strategic and financial sense despite its huge cost, and that it was likely to pass regulatory muster.Some industry analysts weren\u2019t so sure. \u201cVertically challenged,\u201d was the headline on a research note by the analyst Craig Moffett, a play on the term \u201cvertical integration,\u201d where a company combines with a customer, rather than a competitor. Nomura said the deal was \u201cpuzzling.\u201dMorgan Stanley analysts, however, called the deal a \u201cbold step,\u201d wondering whether the companies were \u201cswinging for the fences.\u201dYet for Mr. Stephenson of AT&T, the logic of buying Time Warner had been apparent for some time. The laconic Oklahoma native, who has spearheaded billions of dollars\u2019 worth of deals for the telecom colossus, famously maintains a lengthy list of potential acquisitions. And Time Warner \u2014 whose \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d series and Batman movies could become a cornerstone of a new media strategy at his company \u2014 was on it.Mr. Stephenson had already discussed the attractiveness of Time Warner with Peter Chernin, a veteran Hollywood mogul and a partner to AT&T in an online media venture, at a dinner on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in early August. Later, Mr. Chernin had breakfast with Gary L. Ginsberg, a top lieutenant to Mr. Bewkes, asking if the Time Warner chief would be up for meeting with his AT&T counterpart.On Aug. 25, Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes met for lunch at Time Warner\u2019s glass-and-steel complex overlooking Central Park, both men said in an interview on Sunday. The two had known each other for years and had sought to catch up on how their businesses were transforming in an age of cord-cutting and Netflix. The topic of a Time Warner takeover arose, and by the end of lunch both men walked away clear about AT&T\u2019s intentions.Over the next several days, AT&T and Time Warner began assembling their teams, careful to keep them tight to avoid leaks.AT&T turned to advisers including the investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Arnold & Porter. Time Warner looked to the bank Allen & Company and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore.Only a few top executives at each company \u2014 principally their chief financial officers, deal-making chiefs and general counsels \u2014 were brought into the project, code-named \u201cBobtail.\u201dAT&T was henceforth \u201cLily,\u201d named after the cheery sales representative in the company\u2019s latest ad campaign, while Time Warner was \u201cRabbit,\u201d a nod to Warner Bros.\u2019 Bugs Bunny.The next week, the senior executives huddled in a conference room in Arnold & Porter\u2019s Washington offices to get to know one another and begin sharing information.The teams were so tight that even the heads of HBO, Warner Bros. and Turner were kept in the dark. As a result, Time Warner executives had to be discreet in pulling together information about each business.The deal teams quietly labored in multiple cities, including New York and Dallas, as well as Nashville, a neutral location chosen specifically because it was thought that no one there would recognize AT&T or Time Warner executives.Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes kept in touch, including at another lunch at Cravath\u2019s Manhattan offices in late September. By the time that Mr. Bewkes\u2019s plane touched down in Dallas, board members at both companies were informed of the talks.Despite the complexity of a deal of this size, the negotiations were helped by the shared vision and complementary temperaments of the two chief executives. Time Warner\u2019s primary concern was price, especially since the conglomerate had turned down an $85-a-share takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox two years earlier.Of less concern was the prospect of government regulators\u2019 busting up the deal, as they did five years ago when AT&T sought to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion. The negotiating teams set the fee payable to Time Warner if the deal was blocked on antitrust grounds at just $500 million, well below the norms for a takeover of this size.AT&T executives and advisers also professed little worry about an interloper emerging with a rival bid. Still, if a competitor successfully wrested Time Warner away, the telecommunications company would receive a handsome $1.725 billion breakup fee for its trouble.So quickly had the talks deepened that by the week of Oct. 10, more banks were brought in, in large part to help arrange the financing for the takeover. AT&T enlisted JPMorgan Chase, a longtime lender, while Time Warner brought in familiar faces at Citigroup and then Morgan Stanley. Bank of America joined AT&T\u2019s team just last Thursday.That evening, Mr. Bewkes finally informed the heads of HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. The Time Warner chief spoke with Richard Plepler of HBO and Kevin Tsujihara of Warner Bros. before reaching John Martin, Turner\u2019s chief executive, who was in London.The offer from AT&T promised a healthy 35 percent premium over Time Warner\u2019s share price before the news report.But much of the Time Warner leadership team had also lived through the company\u2019s disastrous merger with AOL at the peak of the dot-com bubble. For one executive, the first reaction was: Do I want to go through a mega-merger again?Most major details had been completed by then, and the two companies\u2019 boards met \u2014 AT&T\u2019s in Dallas, Time Warner\u2019s in Manhattan \u2014 for a final vote.Much work must still be done if the deal is to close by the end of next year as scheduled, including a review by government regulators.Nevertheless, Mr. Stephenson has already begun a tour of the businesses that he may oversee by 2018, including a lunch with Mr. Martin of Turner at the Time Warner Center and a visit with Mr. Plepler at HBO\u2019s offices overlooking Bryant Park.He then boarded a plane to Los Angeles to meet with Mr. Tsujihara on Tuesday.Leslie Picker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pope Francis Navigates Orthodox Georgia\u2019s Rocky Terrain", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byTBILISI, Georgia \u2014 Pope Francis, accustomed to huge, usually adulatory crowds during his international trips, got an early taste of how his two-day visit to Georgia would be a bit different, courtesy of David Isakadze, a passionate anti-papist and a priest in the Georgian Orthodox Church.When Francis and his motorcade pulled out of the airport in Tbilisi, Georgia\u2019s capital, on Friday, Mr. Isakadze and a few dozen other protesters were waiting with banners declaring, \u201cThe pope is a heretic\u201d or \u201cAntichrist!\u201d When Francis visited a Catholic church later in the day, the protesters were there, too.Then on Saturday, Francis celebrated Mass at a soccer stadium \u2014 but only a few thousand people were in the stands, unusual even for a country with a small Catholic population. And while the Vatican expected an Orthodox delegation to attend the service as a gesture of good will, none showed up. An Orthodox spokesman blamed doctrinal differences.At the official level, Francis has been warmly received, especially by Georgia\u2019s government, which hopes that the pope\u2019s visit will help remind the world that one-fifth of Georgian territory remains occupied by separatists armed and financed by Russia after a war in 2008. The ailing leader of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Ilia II, also greeted Francis as \u201cmy dear brother\u201d and issued a statement condemning the Orthodox priests who have criticized the pope\u2019s visit.In an interview, Georgia\u2019s prime minister, Giorgi Kvirikashvili, said the papal visit was \u201cvery important as Georgia gets closer to Europe and the West in general,\u201d and he said he saw no reason for anyone to take umbrage at the pope\u2019s presence.\u201cI do not see any room for protest,\u201d Mr. Kvirikashvili said. \u201cWe should be hospitable.\u201d He noted that \u201cEurope is our home culturally and historically.\u201dUnder criticism from some conservatives who say integrating with the West would force Georgia to accept gay marriage, Mr. Kvirikashvili\u2019s government this year proposed amending the Constitution to rule out any possibility of same-sex unions one day becoming legal. The prime minister described the move, which failed, as a \u201cpolitical and marketing issue\u201d to \u201cpull our supporters away from fundamentalist or anti-Western groups\u201d that want to block closer ties to Europe.Francis has pleased Georgian leaders by affirming the country\u2019s \u201csovereign rights\u201d and calling for adherence to international law, a veiled slap at Russia\u2019s de facto control over the two breakaway regions. He also said refugees should be allowed to freely return to their homes.Georgians will go to the polls next Saturday for parliamentary elections. They feature a number of small but noisy, and mysteriously well-funded, political parties that deny pushing Russia\u2019s agenda but embrace Moscow\u2019s view that the United States and the European Union threaten traditional morality by advocating protection for the rights of sexual minorities.One senior priest in Georgia described Russian tanks that invaded his country in August 2008 as \u201cheavenly pincers to block Georgia\u2019s drive toward the West.\u201d The remark reflected the views of a minority fringe and stirred outrage.But even Patriarch Ilia, who is viewed as more pro-Western than many of his colleagues, described President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a \u201cwise leader\u201d during a 2013 visit to Moscow while blaming an unnamed third party for the short war that had disrupted \u201cbrotherly\u201d relations between Georgia and Russia.This has sometimes created differing priorities between the Georgian Orthodox Church, which has close ties to the Russian church, and the Georgian government, which broke off diplomatic relations with Moscow after the 2008 war. It also speaks to a broader trend in the Christian Orthodox world, where many churches see themselves as bulwarks against Western influence even as their governments want to draw closer to the West.Georgia\u2019s foreign minister, Mikheil Janelidze, dismissed the anti-papists as a \u201cvery minority cause\u201d that did not reflect the position of the Georgian church or the government, both of which he said embraced integration with the West. Georgia, he added, wants to become \u201ca real European state,\u201d and \u201cthis is definitely supported by the patriarch.\u201dBefore the pope\u2019s arrival, Patriarch Ilia issued a formal statement saying it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for anyone to disrupt a visit intended to help heal the rift between the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom dating to the 11th century.But Mr. Isakadze and other protesters did not heed that call. The father of eight children and a leader in the archconservative Union of Orthodox Parents, Mr. Isakadze said Orthodox Christians needed to stand together against a Catholicism he claimed was bent on expansion. He also complained that Francis had gone soft on homosexuality and was too socially liberal.But speaking on Saturday afternoon to a group of Catholic priests, nuns and laypeople, Francis repeated his position defending traditional marriage between a man and a woman. \u201cToday, there is a global war to destroy marriage,\u201d he said.He also told the audience that Orthodox Christians and Catholics were \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d and that Catholics should not try to convert them. \u201cYou must never proselytize the Orthodox,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Many of the rebel leaders were apprehended and rank-and-file soldiers defected, weakening the group.With the war over, the rebel fighters must now decide how to reintegrate into Colombian society. Some are preparing to run for office. Others simply are planning to head home to towns and villages that some of them have not visited for years, where they will seek a start as farmers or tradespeople.The reintegration of the rebels into Colombian society is perhaps the most urgent task for its leaders. Many experts warn that if the government does not find opportunities for the former guerrilla fighters, they will become easy recruits for paramilitary groups eager to fight for a piece of the drug trade.It also remains unclear how popular their leadership \u2014 pictured here at the conference\u2019s closing ceremony \u2014 will be in Colombian politics. While the group is guaranteed at least 10 seats in Congress starting in 2018, it is reviled by many Colombians who remember the bloodiest days of the war.Now, the ball is in the court of the Colombian people. On Sunday, the country will hold a referendum to ratify the agreement. Many prominent voices have mounted opposition to the measure, including Colombia\u2019s last president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe. However, polls show the referendum passing by a wide margin.If that happens, Colombians will enter an era that many have wanted.

{"Headline": "New Jersey Transit Was Under Investigation Before Fatal Crash", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byThe Federal Railroad Administration began investigating safety problems at New Jersey Transit before a fatal train crash last week, a federal rail official confirmed on Saturday.As part of the earlier railroad administration audit, dozens of inspectors visited New Jersey Transit\u2019s railroad operations in June, the official said. The federal agency often inspects railroads, but an audit is a more serious step that is not common.On Saturday, Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the safety board, said the agency would review the federal audit as part of the investigation into the crash.A spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit did not respond to a request for comment.Before the crash, the railroad administration had been considering other enforcement actions against New Jersey Transit, including a compliance agreement to require additional changes. Officials at the administration declined to comment on the audit on Saturday, citing the continuing investigation by the safety board.On Saturday, federal investigators from the safety board were working to determine the cause of the Hoboken crash \u2014 the first fatal train crash on New Jersey Transit since 1996. The train\u2019s engineer, Thomas Gallagher, was interviewed by investigators, officials said. They declined to provide details of the conversation.Investigators could not remove the train from the crash site, officials said on Saturday, because of concerns over asbestos and the structural integrity of the building; part of the roof collapsed on to the train. Officials said they did not find any signal anomalies on the tracks leading to the terminal.Officials will examine the event recorder from the train to determine how fast it was traveling, and consider several possible factors, including the engineer\u2019s actions and the maintenance on the railroad.After the crash, Mr. Christie said it was too early to know what caused the train to travel at a high speed into the station or whether the crash could have been prevented by a technology known as positive train control, which can automatically slow or stop a train. New Jersey Transit has not installed the technology, the Federal Railroad Administration said.New Jersey Transit agreed in June to pay $70,000 in penalties for 10 safety violations found by the administration, according to its 2015 enforcement report. Two of those fines were for violations of passenger equipment safety regulations, the report shows.Reports covering the last three years show that New Jersey Transit agreed, from 2013 through 2015, to pay nearly $335,000 in penalties for 33 violations of federal safety regulations found by the railroad administration. Ten of those fines were for violations of passenger equipment safety regulations, the reports show.Stephen Burkert, a spokesman for a union that represents New Jersey Transit rail workers, welcomed the federal agency\u2019s safety review.At the Hoboken Terminal on Saturday afternoon, crews prepared to clear the station of debris. The whirring of buzz saws and banging of tools filled the building as crews began to remove the rubble by hand, loading the pieces into small bulldozers.New Jersey Transit train service at the terminal has been halted since the crash. The agency has not said when it would return.Matt A.V. Chaban, Corey Kilgannon and Patrick McGeehan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, the Next Big Short", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byA Republican billionaire entrepreneur runs for president on a platform of huge tax cuts for the rich and for business and yet, when his candidacy appears ascendant, the markets swoon.When the prospects brighten for his Democratic challenger \u2014 who has not held a private sector job in more than two decades and who is proposing tax increases for the wealthy \u2014 stocks climb.This is yet another paradox of the tumultuous candidacy of Donald J. Trump: He has spent his entire career among business executives, and yet that constituency is voting with hard cash that he should not be president.I understand that Mr. Trump has pitched his campaign more to white working-class Americans. But no Republican presidential hopeful in memory has been so unpopular in the business community, as one of the prime thermometers of the private sector \u2014 the stock market \u2014 indicates.At a board meeting two weeks ago, I chatted separately with two prominent Republican businessmen. One, the chief executive of a Fortune 100 company, said that he had never voted for a Democrat but couldn\u2019t support Mr. Trump.The other, a private equity investor who had voted Republican only once, said that he was so scared of a Trump presidency that he has donated \u201cevery cent possible\u201d under the campaign finance rules to Hillary Clinton.Even before the tape of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 comments about women became public, many executives were appalled by his temperament and judgment. They also find his economic policy positions \u2013 from his trade-bashing to his budget-busting tax cuts \u2013 terrifying.According to a recent compilation by The Wall Street Journal, not a single chief executive of a Fortune 100 company has donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or endorsed him. In contrast, Hillary Clinton has received contributions from 11 of these corporate chieftains. In 2012, nearly a third of this group supported Mitt Romney, while just five donated to President Obama.As Mrs. Clinton\u2019s dominance of the first presidential debate became apparent, investors cheered; markets around the world rose and the dollar strengthened. A report from Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, estimated that a Trump victory would cause stocks to lose 7 percent, while a Clinton victory would lead to a 4 percent increase.In a poll by Bloomberg Politics (conducted in August, before Mr. Trump\u2019s recent rocky spell), 46 percent of those with more than $50,000 invested in the market preferred Mrs. Clinton, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump.They are not alone. The National Association for Business Economics surveyed 414 members, and Mr. Trump didn\u2019t even come in second. Mrs. Clinton was supported by 55 percent, while the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, received 15 percent, and the Republican hopeful trailed at 14 percent.Another group of economists is similarly unenthusiastic. A Wall Street Journal survey of 45 former members of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers found not one who would endorse Mr. Trump. (Some did not respond or wouldn\u2019t say.)At the top of business\u2019 fears is Mr. Trump\u2019s stance on trade. While Mrs. Clinton has also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Trump has taken trade-bashing to a new level, threatening retaliatory moves like putting 35 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on those from China.A recent study by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that, rather than bringing jobs back to the United States, the tariffs would result in trade wars that could cost our economy five million jobs and possibly lead to a recession.His other economic policies also often cause alarm. In repeatedly attacking the Federal Reserve as being \u201cpolitical,\u201d Mr. Trump has ignored decades of almost entirely consensus decision making by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The committee is a model of rational, nonpartisan judgment compared with the Supreme Court, which often breaks along political lines.And while businessmen surely like tax cuts \u2014 especially for themselves \u2014 they worry over the magnitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s reductions and the lack of any specificity about how he would pay for them. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Trump tax policies would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.Lastly, people in business are repelled on both moral and economic grounds by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deport more than 11 million illegal immigrants, which the conservative American Action Forum calculated would cost $400 billion to $600 billion, reduce gross domestic product by $1.6 trillion and take 20 years.All told, Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, unemployment would rise to nearly 7 percent, and about three million jobs would be lost.With metronomic regularity in his stump appearances, Mr. Trump promotes his qualifications as a billionaire businessman to fix what ails our economy. But his peers in the business world don\u2019t agree.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Romanian Artists Rethink Brancusi\u2019s Legacy", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byThe Art of CollectingSFANTU GHEORGHE, Romania \u2014 The legend of the sculptor Constantin Brancusi is more alive than ever in his native Romania almost 60 years after his death. But some artists want to dust off the ways in which he is presented today.There are different narratives. One is of Brancusi (pronounced bran-COO- zee) abroad, the student of Rodin whose work is recognized as groundbreaking around the world. But in Romania, his name is pronounced bren-COOSH, and is part of the image of the nation, adorning streets and schools and even coming up in the lyrics of a recent pop song.The campaign fell short of collecting the necessary funds by the Sept. 30 deadline. But the government, which had already allocated \u20ac5 million for the cause, promised an \u201caction plan\u201d to ensure that the sculpture \u2014 a calm, seated nude carved from limestone \u2014 remained in Romania and accessible to the public.Meanwhile, in the small Transylvanian town of Sfantu Gheorghe, just over 200 kilometers, or 125 miles, north of the capital, Bucharest, the artist Alexandra Croitoru was installing an exhibition that asked the provocative question, To whom does Brancusi belong, and most important, does he have to belong to anyone?More broadly, it is one of a growing number of small initiatives around the country that offer a new narrative on Romanian art, one that breaks with a tendency to celebrate figures of the past, deemed too conservative, at the expense of contemporary artists ready to assert themselves.\u201cThis myth of the genius artist, the modernist myth of the man genius, has faded,\u201d said Ms. Croitoru, the author of \u201cBrancusi, an Afterlife\u201d and the curator of the exhibition.She said the collection of works, previously shown at galleries in Cluj and Timisoara over the past year, was often misinterpreted as an affront to Brancusi. \u201cIt isn\u2019t about Brancusi himself, but about the reception of his work,\u201d and the use of his image in patriotic and even religious discourse, Ms. Croitoru said.The artists invited by Ms. Croitoru placed Brancusi in the context of contemporary Romania, in works made since the country emerged from decades of brutal dictatorship in 1989. The country\u2019s long transition to democracy also brought rapacious Western-style capitalism after years of isolation.\u201cBig Mac vs. Brancusi,\u201d from 2001, by the artistic team Super US, is a play on the \u201cEndless Column\u201d Brancusi erected in iron and steel in 1938 in the town of Targu Jiu. The 100-foot-tall sculpture, which still stands, has inspired countless replicas over the years, both by Brancusi himself and others.\u201cLooking for Brancusi,\u201d a film by Sergiu Sas, from 2015, shows people getting playful with Brancusi icons: kicking footballs at \u201cThe Gate of Kiss,\u201d or playing backgammon, a popular game in the country, on the \u201cTable of Silence.\u201dDan Perjovschi drew \u201cBungee Jumping\u201d in 2015, showing a figure leaping from atop the \u201cEndless Column,\u201d intended as a criticism of the ways Brancusi is interpreted in Romania. \u201cThis nation has a problem with the meaning of the infinite,\u201d Mr. Perjovschi said. \u201cBungee jumping means to throw yourself into the void, but it pulls you back, you come back, it\u2019s balance.\u201d\u201cI grew up with a nationalist Brancusi,\u201d Mr. Perjovschi added, recalling an official narrative that glorified the artist. \u201cThen I rediscovered him in museums around the world.\u201dHe supported the campaign to keep \u201cThe Wisdom of the Earth\u201d in Romania, citing what the work could mean for the country\u2019s future.\u201cOur symbols are the Palace of Parliament and the Cathedral of the People\u2019s Salvation,\u201d he said, referring to the fortress-like building in Bucharest ordered by the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and the equally huge cathedral being built directly behind it by the country\u2019s powerful church. \u201cI prefer this, something small, with a calm name that invokes modesty.\u201dIn a country where art collecting is the privilege of a select few, even more so than in wealthier Western nations, contemporary art depends largely on state financing and foreign donors. A recurring complaint from artists and curators is that spaces exhibiting contemporary art have conservative agendas, are rigid and are scarce.Both Ms. Croitoru and Mr. Perjovschi praised the energy and openness of Magma, the space hosting the Brancusi-themed exhibition. When it comes to nailing something to the wall or repainting surfaces, Mr. Perjovschi said, \u201cthe first thing you hear is \u2018no.\u2019 At Magma it\u2019s different, you can do anything.\u201dSeen from the highway, Sfantu Gheorghe, a town of 56,000, stands in stark contrast with the rolling hills that surround it. The picturesque town center, sprinkled with red-tile roofs on low-rise buildings reminiscent of the Austria-Hungary to which it once belonged, is encircled by tall, gray concrete housing blocks, a legacy of the Communist regime.Magma occupies a corner of the spacious main square and park, between cafe terraces and the town\u2019s theater. Despite the serenity of its surroundings, the space, funded by the regional council, seeks to innovate, encourage creativity and even provoke at times, as imagined by Agnes Evelin Kispal and Attila Kispal, the artist couple who run the space.\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to create a platform where unspoken things are spoken,\u201d Mr. Kispal said. Like the Brancusi exhibition, Magma has been accused of going against the established art narrative. In reality, Mr. Kispal said, the aim was to fill a void to which nobody paid attention.Whereas six years ago it was a struggle to put together a contemporary show locally, according to the creators of Magma, since that time they have hosted around 60 solo and group exhibitions.Sfantu Gheorghe is also one of few cultural centers for Romania\u2019s minority ethnic Hungarians, who live mostly in the center of the mountainous Transylvania region. To ensure the survival of their culture, the tendency has been to display works by local artists. \u201cThere is a sort of navel gazing, which is a dead end,\u201d Mr. Kispal said.Magma has broken with that tradition and brought in art that people would once have had to travel hundreds of miles to see.In an exhibition over the summer, \u201cNo Goddess of Memory,\u201d Magma questioned the concept of building monuments. Works on display challenged the artistic value of busts of figures from Hungarian history and arts, springing up as signs of patriotic pride in communities in and around Hungary.Opening up to the wider region, a video showed examples of \u201cTurbo Sculpture\u201d in the former Yugoslavia. In the absence of national heroes, many of them discredited in the Yugoslav wars, towns in the region have turned to figures from the west: pop culture with a Bruce Lee sculpture in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, or Bill Clinton\u2019s larger-than-life depiction in Pristina, Kosovo.\u201cThere is no nation in art,\u201d Ms. Kispal said. \u201cThere is contemporary fine art and those who are good, no good or mediocre at it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Needs to Make a Clean Break With the Past", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byFair GameEven after two big shuffles at the top, Wells Fargo is still working from the same playbook. And for the bank\u2019s stockholders, that could mean more frustration lies ahead.Is Mr. Sloan, an almost 30-year veteran of Wells Fargo and a seasoned insider, the best executive to lead the bank out of crisis? Some of the experts I talked to don\u2019t think so.\u201cThe whole country is watching to see if this bank is seizing the opportunity to make a clean break from doing business in a way that strains its reputation with its customers to one that enhances it,\u201d Ms. Raskin said. \u201cThis is an opportunity to bring in a new perspective at the top.\u201dMr. Sloan may indeed be a great manager. But one of the big questions looming over him is whether his long tenure at Wells Fargo is an asset or a liability.Richard Bove, a veteran bank analyst at Rafferty Capital Markets, said Wells Fargo needed an overhaul that went far beyond the scandal itself. Yes, repairing the culture that allowed the fraudulent practices to occur is a crucial task for Mr. Sloan, but that alone will not get the bank back on track.In recent years, Wells Fargo\u2019s competitors, Mr. Bove said, have vastly improved their operations by exiting significant businesses and selling off assets. Citigroup has gotten out of 30 businesses and sold off a large number of assets, he said. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have also downsized.But Wells Fargo has added lines of business during the period, Mr. Bove said, resulting in a bloated bank.\u201cThis is a company that must make massive revisions to its business model,\u201d Mr. Bove said. \u201cSomeone has to get in there and rip the company apart. Sloan is not the guy to do that.\u201dThere is also a question about Mr. Sloan\u2019s previous position as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer from February 2011 to May 2014.In that post, Mr. Sloan was required to sign periodic certifications that he had disclosed to the company\u2019s auditors and the audit committee of the board any fraud involving management or other employees that had a significant role in the company\u2019s internal controls.The pervasive opening of sham accounts, a practice in a division overseen by Carrie Tolstedt, also a top Wells Fargo executive, would certainly seem to qualify as fraud relating to the bank\u2019s internal controls. Did Mr. Sloan make disclosures about these practices to the board during his stint as chief financial officer? If not, why not? And if he did, why were the disclosures not acted on years ago?I asked these questions of Wells Fargo. A spokeswoman, Arati Randolph, emphasized that the bank had determined that the financial impact of the problematic practices was not meaningful. \u201cThe vast majority of the accounts reviewed did not generate fees or result in net income for the company,\u201d Ms. Randolph said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, it cost Wells Fargo more than $10 million to open and service those accounts, which generated the $2.6 million in fees that was returned to customers.\u201d\u201cThey likely would have named an interim C.E.O. while they conducted their search,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my opinion, that would have been very disruptive and led to more uncertainty in the market and concern among employees and customers.\u201dGiven the sad sequence of events at Wells Fargo, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Why does it take a crisis of this magnitude to get a company or its board to act on governance matters that its shareholders have been agitating about?One such matter involves who runs the Wells Fargo board. For years, the position of chairman was held by the company\u2019s chief executive, most recently Mr. Stumpf. This meant that the same person presided over the board even as he oversaw the bank\u2019s operations.Recently, companies whose chief executives also lead their boards have come under pressure from investors who think these responsibilities should be divided to ensure an appropriate balance of power. At Wells Fargo\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in April, for example, investors were once again asked to vote on a proposal that would have required an independent chairman to replace Mr. Stumpf in that role.Such a proposal has come up at the bank every year for more than a decade. Each time, Wells Fargo has recommended that shareholders nix it and each time the bank has gotten its way.This year was no different. But in arguing against the proposal, Wells Fargo made the following points. Its existing board structure, the company said, \u201cprovides effective independent oversight of management and board accountability\u201d and its governance is \u201cworking effectively as evidenced by the company\u2019s strong financial performance.\u201dWell, so much for that. On Wednesday, the company did an about-face, indicating that its governance prowess might not have been as effective as the company had contended. In his new position as C.E.O., Mr. Sloan will not become board chairman. That assignment now goes to Stephen W. Sanger, retired chief executive and chairman of General Mills, who will be assisted by Elizabeth A. Duke, a former Federal Reserve Board governor, as vice chairwoman.These two directors have a lot on their plates. They are essentially charged with waking up what has been a somnambulant board.Ms. Duke joined the Wells Fargo board only in early 2015, so she cannot be held responsible for overlooking years of problematic activities.Mr. Sanger, on the other hand, has been a Wells Fargo director since 2003. And since 2012, he has held the position of lead independent director of the bank\u2019s board. In that job, he was supposed to ensure that Mr. Stumpf was putting his shareholders\u2019 interests first.That didn\u2019t happen then, but it better happen now.An earlier version of this column misattributed a statement about practices at Wells Fargo. It was the bank, not its auditor, that had determined that the financial impact of the problematic practices was not meaningful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CenturyLink, a Network Provider, to Acquire Level 3, a Rival", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byTo those familiar with the telecommunications industry, the deal announced between CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications on Monday was not really a surprise. Both companies provide communications and services like data, voice and video transmission for large enterprises and each is trying to scrape away market share from rivals AT&T and Verizon.CenturyLink\u2019s investors were not quite convinced that acquiring Level 3 was the ticket to turn around the company\u2019s recent misfortunes, including competitive pressures from larger cable providers. Shares of CenturyLink fell 12.5 percent on Monday, while shares of Level 3 were up 3.9 percent.Based on the closing price of CenturyLink\u2019s shares from Friday, this represents a price of about $69.92 a share. Including Level 3\u2019s $10.9 billion in debt, the transaction amounts to about $36 billion. That represents a premium of almost 50 percent from Level 3\u2019s share price last Wednesday before reports surfaced of a potential deal.CenturyLink\u2019s shareholders will own 51 percent of the combined company, while Level 3\u2019s will hold the rest.\u201cThis transaction furthers our commitment to providing our customers with the network to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses,\u201d Glen F. Post III, CenturyLink\u2019s chief executive and president, said in a statement. \u201cIt is this focus on providing fiber connectivity that will continue to distinguish CenturyLink from our competitors.\u201d Mr. Post will continue to serve in his executive role of the combined company.The transaction would significantly lower CenturyLink\u2019s tax expense over the next few years. Level 3 has almost $10 billion of so-called net operating losses, a tax relief generated from periods of unprofitability.The companies also plan to achieve about $975 million a year in cost savings by eliminating duplications and improving operations, the companies said in the statement.The combined company would be based in Monroe, where CenturyLink was founded in 1968. However, they plan to keep a \u201csignificant presence\u201d in the Denver area, where Level 3 has its headquarters.CenturyLink has received financing commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley for $10.2 billion.The companies expect to complete the transaction by the end of September 2017, subject to approvals by the Federal Communications Commission, certain states and the majority of both companies\u2019 shareholders. STT Crossing, a subsidiary of ST Telemedia, which holds 18 percent of Level 3\u2019s outstanding shares, has pledged to vote in favor of the transaction.Bank of America and Morgan Stanley gave financial advice to CenturyLink, while Citigroup advised Level 3, with Lazard providing a fairness opinion. Evercore gave a fairness opinion to CenturyLink. The law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Jones Walker worked with CenturyLink, while Willkie Farr & Gallagher advised Level 3. Latham & Watkins and Credit Suisse advised ST Telemedia.An earlier version of this article misidentified the company being advised by Willkie Farr & Gallagher.

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Fights Over Fannie and Freddie, Gender Gaps, Trade Warnings", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byIn the latest round of a long-running battle between the United States government and investors in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the investors have won.A federal judge has ruled that the government improperly withheld documents from investors suing over its decision in 2012 to seize all the profits of the mortgage finance giants, abruptly changing the terms of the companies\u2019 rescue.Investors had contended that the government\u2019s surprise decision to begin extracting all profits from Fannie and Freddie was an illegal taking of private property.In the wake of the 2012 decision, the government argued that it acted to protect taxpayers from future losses because the companies were in a death spiral. But the decision to funnel the profits into the Treasury\u2019s general fund came just before Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability.Lawyers representing the government responded to the suit with unusual demands for secrecy, but the ruling decided in favor of Fairholme Funds.Since the beginning of 2011, five of the largest activist funds have nominated 174 directors, but just seven of them were women. About 60 percent of corporate boards have no female directors at all.Men were reluctant to change boardroom dynamics by bringing in women, according to Christine Shropshire, who has done research on the likelihood of male and female executives facing activist investors.\u201cWomen may be more likely to pose tough questions or engage in more intensive monitoring efforts,\u201d she noted.But that may soon change, as Dianne McKeever and Robert Longnecker, the founders of Ides Capital, set up the first activist hedge fund in the United States fronted by a woman.The fund is small, but the only public battle that Ides has fought led to Boingo, the Wi-Fi provider, adding its first woman to the board.Shares of Boingo \u2014 which has said it was already trying to recruit women onto the board \u2014 are up more than 30 percent since the company settled with Ides in June.The world is in the doldrums economically and growth is likely to remain sluggish, the International Monetary Fund has said.\u201cIt is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration,\u201d said Maurice Obstfeld, the fund\u2019s chief economist.Mr. Obstfeld took a swipe at Germany, which has already been criticized for not doing enough to stimulate European growth, saying that countries with the capacity to invest in large infrastructure should do so.\u201cThis introduces an element of uncertainty to the mix, and uncertainty is not great for investors,\u201d Mr. Obstfeld said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T Aims for an Empire in Merger Talks With Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byFor companies that sell consumers cable and internet service, merely distributing entertainment and programs is not enough. They want to own them.The media conglomerate Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN and the movie studio Warner Bros., has long been among the most prized takeover targets.It is being courted by AT&T, a telecommunications giant that lacks ownership of any of the shows and videos it delivers through its various businesses. The two are in advanced talks for AT&T to acquire Time Warner, and a deal may be announced as early as Monday, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.A merger would come at a pivotal time in the communications industry, where the giants are scrambling to create entertainment empires to maintain competitiveness as consumers increasingly embrace cheaper, digital alternatives.Regulators have been wary of allowing combinations of businesses that could create less competition and thwart innovation by start-ups, and a tie-up of AT&T and Time Warner could raise concerns. It is a bold move in an election year that will usher in a new administration and a fresh set of regulators.Time Warner is asking AT&T to pay more than $90 a share in the deal, said the people who asked not to be named because the details are still private.The transaction is not yet final and may fall apart or get delayed, said the people with knowledge of the discussions. Representatives from Time Warner and AT&T declined to comment.A combination with AT&T would be an about-face from Time Warner\u2019s strategy just seven years ago. The company divested Time Warner Cable in 2009, and Time Inc. in 2014, in order to focus on developing programs and entertainment.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Still, AT&T has historically been less aggressive than its peers in building a content empire. It was a losing bidder for Yahoo, for example.AT&T has a tendency to acquire industry leaders. In the media world that would be Time Warner and Disney, and Disney\u2019s $150 billion market valuation makes it a much larger takeover to swallow. Two other companies, Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family, have been exploring a reunification.The biggest question posed by analysts after Bloomberg News first reported the talks on Thursday is whether or not this transaction would pass regulatory muster. Regulators including the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department have historically been skeptical of similar combinations.\u201cAt best, we believe a lengthy antitrust review of T/TWX with an uncertain outcome may give both sides pause on considering a combination,\u201d Credit Suisse research analysts wrote in a note on Thursday using the ticker symbols for AT&T and Time Warner. \u201cAt worst, it may act as a barrier to a deal being proposed, in our view.\u201dAdditionally, it is an audacious move with the presidential election just around the corner, which will most likely yield a reshaping of the top regulators that will study this deal. Hillary Clinton has promised to be tough on corporate mega-powers and consolidation within industries. Most analysts have surmised that a deal between AT&T and Time Warner would carry a significant amount of regulatory scrutiny.For Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, signing a deal may be worth the risk, if AT&T is willing to pay both a high enough price and a generous breakup fee in the event that the combination is blocked, said Richard S. Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.In addition to the potential regulatory challenges, an acquisition of Time Warner would be a large one for AT&T to digest. The combined company would have about $150 billion worth of debt, with around $175 billion in annual revenue. In a low-interest rate environment, financing of such large deals has been more prudent.Some analysts are skeptical that AT&T could handle the deal. AT&T has said its \u201cplate is full\u201d in absorbing DirecTV, Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said in a note.Time Warner itself is no stranger to slicing and merging. The company is a byproduct of a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1989, which created the largest media conglomerate in the world at the time, with cable, publishing and movie assets. Seven years later, the company acquired Turner Broadcasting, bringing the cable network CNN under its wing.In 2000, Time Warner merged with AOL, a combination that has since been seen as one of the largest mistakes ever in deal making. Nine years later, Time Warner said it would spin off AOL at a fraction of its valuation after the dot-com bubble burst.These days, Time Warner\u2019s units comprise premium channels such as HBO and Cinemax, as well as Turner, which operates TBS, Turner Sports and others, in addition to CNN. Time Warner also runs Warner Bros. Entertainment, which released movies including \u201cSully,\u201d \u201cStorks\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d this year.If the deal between AT&T and Time Warner succeeds, other media and entertainment companies could become takeover targets. Many stocks in that industry gained on Friday as more reports surfaced about the deal.Time Warner\u2019s shares gained 7.8 percent on Friday to $89.48, while AT&T\u2019s declined 3 percent to $37.49.Michael J. de la Merced and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

United States, Canadian and French fighter planes flew missions from Qatar during the conflict.After the war, Qatar signed a security pact with the United States, and today it hosts the forward headquarters of the United States Central Command and aircraft involved in airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq.Sheikh Khalifa was born in Al Rayyan, Qatar, in 1932, into the House of Thani, the country\u2019s royal family since the early 19th century.He rose through the ranks of the ruling family, commanding its security forces and overseeing its civilian courts. He became the country\u2019s deputy ruler on Oct. 24, 1960, and its finance minister two weeks later.Sheikh Khalifa became the first prime minister of Qatar \u2014 then a British protectorate \u2014 on May 29, 1970, after the job was created by the emir at the time, his cousin Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali al-Thani. Sheikh Khalifa also served as finance minister and oil minister.From that point on, he was effectively the ruler. When Qatar declared independence on Sept. 3, 1971, Sheikh Ahmad was on vacation in Switzerland, and it was left to Sheikh Khalifa to issue the proclamation.Sheikh Khalifa deposed Sheikh Ahmad on Feb. 22, 1972. He announced an immediate increase in salaries for civil servants and the 15,000 members of the police and armed forces, as well as plans to modernize government administration and cut consumer prices.Oil exports boomed, making Qatar one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations per capita. (Qatar today has about 2.2 million residents, but most are workers from countries like India, Pakistan and Iran, and not citizens.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Easy Mold to Fill to Become a Latino Texas Politician", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "There are more Latino elected officials in Texas than any other state, and even though most are Democrats, they represent an electorate split along racial, ethnic, party and socioeconomic lines.Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 It was a brief but telling glimpse of the new Texas.Yet here, under the surface, was the old Texas, too. Mr. Espinosa\u2019s Grand Prairie school district is 65 percent Latino, but the seven-member school board is majority white. Mr. Espinosa is the board\u2019s lone Latino.Only one thing about Latino political power in Texas is certain: It\u2019s complicated.Texas has the second-largest Hispanic population of any state \u2014 roughly 10 million of the state\u2019s 27 million residents are Latino, second only to California\u2019s 15 million Hispanics. There are more Latino elected officials in Texas than in any other state \u2014 2,536 at the local, state and federal levels, nearly double the number in California, the state with the second-largest amount.In both states, a majority of Latinos are Democrats, but Texas Hispanics find themselves in an overwhelmingly Republican state. The Latino electorate in Texas fails to vote in large numbers, and many who are poor and uneducated are disconnected from politics.Yet at the same time, generations of Mexican-American families have built political dynasties in parts of Texas. The Velas of Brownsville are but one: Filemon B. Vela Sr. was a federal judge there; his wife, Blanca Sanchez Vela, became the mayor; and their son, Filemon B. Vela Jr., now represents Brownsville in Congress. Latinos have plenty of power in Texas \u2014 it just depends on who, what, when, where and how.To become a Latino elected official in Texas \u2014 to win a seat, to keep a seat, to simultaneously appeal to fellow Latinos and white voters \u2014 there are unspoken rules. There are ways of politically navigating a majority-minority state that struggles to fully embrace its Hispanic identity and is split along racial, ethnic, party, geographic, economic, urban and rural lines.In today\u2019s partisan world, what do two of Texas\u2019 top Hispanic Democrats have in common with its most powerful Hispanic Republican? Spotty Spanish, for starters.But all three are products of Harvard Law School and all three are symbolic of the Texas Latino political bench these days. It is packed with post-Hispanic Hispanics \u2014 academic, ambitious, lawyerly superstars who identify with their party first and their ethnicity second. Some of the most influential Hispanic Democrats and Hispanic Republicans are the Texas-born sons and daughters of immigrants, or the grandsons and granddaughters of them, but they themselves do not embody the Latino immigrant experience so much as serve as a bridge to it.State Representative Rafael Anchia, a Dallas Democrat, is a corporate-finance lawyer who was appointed by Mr. Obama to a trade-policy advisory committee. State Representative Jason Villalba, a Dallas Republican, is a corporate-finance lawyer as well, and his majority-white district includes one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Texas, Preston Hollow, which is home to former President George W. Bush. Vince Perez, a Democratic county commissioner in El Paso, studied at Georgetown University and was the communications director for former Texas congressman Silvestre Reyes, a Democrat.Some of them speak perfect Spanish, while others have had to take lessons since getting elected. Perhaps there was a time when not speaking Spanish was a liability for a Texas Latino politician, but that time is gone. Maybe it ended in San Antonio around 2011, when Juli\u00e1n Castro won re-election as mayor with nearly 82 percent of the vote. Or maybe it ended in El Paso that same year, when a county commissioner\u2019s race was heating up.Mr. Perez, the Georgetown graduate, was seeking the commissioner\u2019s seat held by Willie Gandara Jr., who criticized Mr. Perez\u2019s lack of fluency in Spanish. Mr. Gandara told reporters that Mr. Perez failed to fit the area\u2019s \u201ccriteria\u201d and that voters wanted a Spanish-speaking commissioner. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference,\u201d Mr. Gandara told ABC-7, \u201cbetween living it and not living it.\u201dMr. Perez won the election and was later named the 2016 National County Leader of the Year for his work overhauling the local criminal justice system.The state\u2019s biggest city \u2014 the cosmopolitan, left-leaning metropolis that is 44 percent Hispanic and crammed with wealth, traffic, museums and megachurches \u2014 has one Hispanic on the 16-member City Council. Houston voters have never sent a Hispanic to Congress. The school district, the largest in Texas, is majority-Latino, but only two of the nine school board members are Hispanic.\u201cMy office gets calls from Hispanics from other council districts asking for assistance,\u201d said Robert Gallegos, the sole Latino on the City Council.If Mr. Gallegos ever wants to run for mayor, one glass ceiling has been broken for him, but the other remains intact. Mr. Gallegos is gay, and it was back in 2009 that Houston became the largest city in the United States to elect an openly gay or lesbian mayor. Yet Houston, founded in 1836, has never had a Latino mayor, although San Antonio has had three since 1981.Black Houston voters have rallied behind black mayoral candidates as an energized bloc, and the city has had two black mayors in the last 18 years as a result. But Latino voters have not done the same for Latino mayoral candidates, and Hispanics make up only about 19 percent of registered voters, a far lower percentage than blacks.\u201cI am worried about stunted growth,\u201d said Adrian Garcia, the former Harris County sheriff who unsuccessfully ran for mayor last year. \u201cFor me, taking chances is what we ought to be doing.\u201dIn 2014, Ramon Romero Jr. became the first Latino elected to the Texas Legislature from Fort Worth\u2019s majority-white Tarrant County. For the first time, the Fort Worth Stockyards \u2014 a tourist attraction with cattle drives and rodeos that is home to the Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame \u2014 is represented in Austin by the son of Mexican immigrants.On a recent drive through his majority-Latino district, Mr. Romero, a wealthy businessman and Democrat, had something on his mind.\u201cI was in a little buggy with an old rancher the other day, and we were going to go up to a campfire,\u201d Mr. Romero said. \u201cAnd one of them joked \u2014 and I don\u2019t even think he even realized he said it \u2014 he said, \u2018Where\u2019s my Mexican?\u2019 We were on the buggies and we needed to open up a gate. I hear it all the time in the pool business. We\u2019re building somebody a pool and they\u2019ll say something like, \u2018No, you don\u2019t need to do that. I\u2019ll just have my Mexicans do that.\u2019 They don\u2019t even have names.\u201dLatino politicians in Texas have some of the thickest skins in the business. Bigotry, discrimination and slurs fester, overtly and subtly. Some ignore it. Some speak out. But they push on, keeping their feet planted in two worlds \u2014 a Latino culture that prizes assimilation and a white culture that believes that bigotry is a thing of the past.In a letter to supporters, Mr. Carrillo blamed his loss on his Hispanic surname.\u201cGiven the choice between \u2018Porter\u2019 and \u2018Carrillo\u2019 \u2014 unfortunately, the Hispanic surname was a serious setback from which I could never recover although I did all in my power to overcome this built-in bias,\u201d Mr. Carrillo wrote.A number of Republican officials disagreed, saying he lost because of a lackluster campaign. They pointed to the Hispanic Republicans who have won similar Republican primaries for statewide seats, including Eva Guzman, a justice on the Texas Supreme Court. But others sided with Mr. Carrillo.\u201cThey saw the Latino name,\u201d said Jason P. Casellas, an associate professor at the University of Houston and an expert on Latino representation. \u201cHe had all the support of Gov. Perry and all the establishment, but he had to face a Republican primary with mostly Anglo voters.\u201dConsider the 10 most Latino congressional districts in the country. Five are in Texas, three are in California and two are in Florida. The percentage of Hispanics in those districts ranges from 70 percent to 87 percent. There is the 34th Congressional District in South Texas, which is nearly 84 percent Hispanic and includes Brownsville. There is the 40th Congressional District in Southern California, which is nearly 87 percent Latino and includes East Los Angeles.Now picture a room, and put the 10 lawmakers who represent those heavily Hispanic districts inside. It would, not surprisingly, be populated by Hispanic men and Hispanic women, with two exceptions. Eight of the 10 most Hispanic congressional districts in America are represented by Hispanics, but two are represented by white Democrats from El Paso and Houston.That is how Latino politics operates in the state. A total of six congressional districts in Texas that are majority Hispanic have non-Latino representatives: four whites and two African-Americans.There is no clear-cut answer as to why. To some, it shows the sophistication of the Latino vote. To others, it is proof the Republican-dominated Legislature weakened Hispanic voting strength, through its redrawing of political district maps and its voter ID law, which required government-issued ID at the polls. To those non-Latino representatives, it is absurd to suggest they cannot represent Latino-majority districts as well as a Latino can.\u201cHaving grown up in a predominantly Mexican-American community, I felt like I understood the values, the family, the faith,\u201d said Representative Gene Green, the white, Democratic congressman from Houston\u2019s 29th Congressional District, which is 77 percent Hispanic. \u201cI don\u2019t think I just walked into it.\u201dIt is not just red or blue in Texas. For many Latino politicians, it is reddish-blue or bluish-red.Latino Democrats openly talk about their guns and their church. Nobody blinked in 2014, when a prominent Latina Democrat from San Antonio who was running for lieutenant governor, Leticia Van de Putte, spoke of her nuanced stance on gun rights. She opposed open carry but supported concealed carry. \u201cPete and I have guns,\u201d Ms. Van de Putte, referring to her husband, said at a Texas Tribune event. \u201cSeveral.\u201dWhen the Legislature passed some of the toughest restrictions on abortion in the country in 2013, there were six Democratic state lawmakers who voted for the bill. Five of the six were Latinos from South Texas. \u201cLatinos in my district are predominantly Catholic and in so doing are pro-traditional family, pro-life and pro-business,\u201d said State Senator Eddie Lucio Jr., a Brownsville Democrat who voted for the abortion-restrictions bill. \u201cI\u2019m one of those.\u201dMr. Villalba, the Hispanic Republican from Dallas, has at times angered liberals as well as conservatives.\u201cThe right and the left have a hard time with me,\u201d Mr. Villalba said, \u201cbut the people who I go to church with and the people I sit on the sidelines with at soccer games are supportive of me, which is why I\u2019ve been successful at winning elections.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo\u2019s New Boss Is Same as the Old Boss to Congress", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byIf Wells Fargo\u2019s board had hoped John G. Stumpf\u2019s resignation on Wednesday and the appointment of Timothy J. Sloan as the new top executive would instantly quell the bank\u2019s numerous critics, they were mistaken.Within hours of the announcement, a member of Congress and other critics were already dismissing Mr. Sloan as the wrong man to make the big changes the bank needs to move past its current predicament over the creation of as many as two million phony accounts.While the Wells Fargo board emphasized that Mr. Sloan was \u201cready to lead the company into the future,\u201d the bank\u2019s critics focused on the role that Mr. Sloan \u2014 who has spent the last 29 years at Wells Fargo \u2014 played in the bank\u2019s troubling past.\u201cI remain concerned that incoming C.E.O. Tim Sloan is also culpable in the recent scandal, serving in a central role in the chain of command that ought to have stopped this misconduct from happening,\u201d Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said in a statement.For his part, Mr. Sloan did not signal in his first hours as chief executive that he intended to make any bold shifts. He praised the tenure of Mr. Stumpf and said he planned to pursue largely the same strategy in restoring the bank\u2019s reputation that his predecessor had begun.Mr. Sloan\u2019s most recent role was as Wells Fargo\u2019s president and chief operating officer, positions he took in November 2015. During his 11 months in those jobs, he oversaw several major business lines, including the community banking unit, where employees were still being fired for creating fake accounts earlier this year.Even as regulators were digging into the problems this summer, Mr. Sloan, 56, remained a staunch defender of cross-selling, telling an interviewer in June that the \u201cfundamental strategy we have is not going to change.\u201dIt was Mr. Sloan who informed Wells Fargo\u2019s former head of community banking, Carrie Tolstedt, this past summer that the bank was \u201cmoving in a different direction\u201d from the way her unit had been run, Mr. Stumpf said. Ms. Tolstedt was allowed to retire and collect millions in additional compensation, rather than be fired. (The bank\u2019s board has since clawed back $19 million of her pay.)For all the early doubts about Mr. Sloan, banking analysts say, cleaning up the mess at Wells Fargo would be an uphill job for anyone to undertake.Prosecutors in three states have begun investigations, and state treasurers in Illinois and California have pulled business with Wells. Hillary Clinton denounced the bank on the campaign trail.Overcoming this rancor now falls to Mr. Sloan, an Ohio native and father of three grown children, who is known for his dry wit and direct manner.He made no pronouncements on an overhaul of the Wells Fargo culture. In a brief interview on Wednesday, Mr. Sloan said, \u201cWe are going to enact the changes that have already been announced,\u201d including ending the sales goals in the retail bank that former employees and others \u2014 including lawmakers and regulators \u2014 blamed for the problems.Mr. Sloan added that it was important that he not interfere with the board and its internal investigation into the fake accounts and the bank\u2019s handling of them.Some former employees in Wells Fargo\u2019s bank branches said in interviews that nothing would improve until the bank renounced the corporate culture where Mr. Sloan was groomed.That culture, they said, emphasizes selling as many new accounts as possible, often at the expense of providing good service to customers.\u201cI don\u2019t see that happening unless they get rid of all the top corporate executives,\u201d said Julie Miller, who worked at Wells Fargo for eight years in Allentown, Pa., until being fired in 2013 for not meeting her sales goals. \u201cThey all created the bank\u2019s culture of leading by fear and intimidation.\u201dBut some of the changes that Wells has made in the last month appear to be taking hold. One Wells Fargo teller in Texas, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she feared losing her job, said that she felt freed from previous pressure to meet sales goals and could for the first time focus entirely on making sure her customers were satisfied.On Thursday, Wall Street analysts were also more willing to give Mr. Sloan the benefit of the doubt, saying that he had largely avoided any direct role in the scandal, except for his brief time overseeing Ms. Tolstedt last year. By then, they said, the bank was dealing with the problem and cooperating with regulators.As the bank\u2019s former chief financial officer, Mr. Sloan interacted frequently with investment analysts, who until recently regarded Wells Fargo as the best-run big bank in the country.A graduate of the University of Michigan, Mr. Sloan is known for his sense of humor and for having a pricklier personality at times than the usually pleasant and polished Mr. Stumpf.\u201cTim Sloan can have some sharper edges,\u201d said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. \u201cWells Fargo might need that right now.\u201dMr. Sloan lives with his wife in the Los Angeles area and spends the workweek at the bank\u2019s corporate offices in San Francisco.One area Mr. Sloan might target as he figures out the bank\u2019s strategy going forward: Wells Fargo\u2019s outsized network of bank branches.Even as other large banks have been paring back branches as more customers transact online, Wells still runs roughly 6,000 branches \u2014 which is about 30 percent larger than Bank of America\u2019s network.While Wells also offers digital banking services, the bank has used its bank branches to successfully cross-sell products to customers as they come in the door. With the shift away from cross-selling, the bank may not need so many branches.Mr. Stumpf, who got his start in retail banking, was seen as more wedded to the branch network. Mr. Sloan\u2019s expertise in wholesale banking and corporate finance, analysts said, may make him more willing to trim the bricks and mortar.From now on, a great share of employees\u2019 compensation will hinge on whether they have improved the customer\u2019s experience, not on how many accounts they created.\u201cChanging these fundamentals doesn\u2019t take a whole lot of time,\u201d said Mike Moebs, a former executive at Wells Fargo, who now runs an economic and financial research firm.Advertisement"}

Pence: Face-Off in Farmville!", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byEditorial ObserverSuch an exchange would be particularly illuminating on the Republican side.Even to many in his own party, Mr. Pence, a former congressman and the sitting Indiana governor, struck a Faustian bargain by joining the Trump ticket. But he has tried to articulate a different set of principles, in contrast to dead-enders like Rudolph Giuliani, Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie. If Mr. Trump loses, Mr. Pence will likely be part of a rump of Republican leaders left to pick up the pieces and focus the party in a more positive direction.Left largely on his own while the Trump inner circle fights fires (and each other), Mr. Pence has been trying to reassure conservatives and evangelicals that he\u2019ll represent them. A social conservative, his anti-abortion, anti-gay stances are deeply at odds with many Americans\u2019 views. At the same time, he has rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the family of an American Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, and distanced himself from Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cbirther\u201d campaign.Though he says he\u2019s against Obamacare, as governor he backed the Medicaid expansion that was central to it. He has waffled on the legal fate of 11 million undocumented immigrants, but he has not come out in favor of deporting them. He can legitimately claim firsthand experience and some successes confronting the hollowing-out of the American manufacturing economy. Mr. Pence may in fact be in a better position than Mr. Trump to reinforce the ticket\u2019s appeal to working-class voters, given Mr. Trump\u2019s recent preoccupation with personal attacks and bizarre tweets.Mr. Kaine, the junior senator from Virginia and its former governor, will field the first question of the debate from Elaine Quijano of CBS News, the moderator. At some point he\u2019ll surely attack Mr. Trump\u2019s income tax filings. But it might be more interesting, given his fluent Spanish and service as a missionary in Honduras, to hear a clearer articulation of the Clinton campaign\u2019s vague promise of \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d What would that legislation contain, and how could it succeed?Mr. Kaine could also spell out more fully why Mrs. Clinton reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The campaign says it had to do with specific weaknesses in the agreement, but her turnabout still mystifies many voters.The debate is set in Mr. Kaine\u2019s home state, Virginia, known for weak laws on influence peddling. What are Mr. Kaine\u2019s ideas for fulfilling a pledge to carry out tougher campaign finance laws?This is the only time the vice-presidential nominees will debate before the election.

{"Headline": "Exxon Concedes It May Need to Declare Lower Value for Oil in Ground", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 Exxon Mobil, in a concession to market and regulatory pressures, said Friday that it might be forced to write down the value of some of its oil and gas assets in Canada and elsewhere if energy prices remain low through the end of the year.The company has long insisted that it has been adequately accounting for the value of its oil and gas reserves \u2014 even as many other petroleum companies have taken big write-offs to reflect a two-year price slump.On Friday, though, the company acknowledged that it faced what could be the biggest accounting revision of reserves in its history. Exxon Mobil might have to concede that 3.6 billion barrels of oil-sand reserves and one billion barrels of other North American reserves are currently not profitable to produce.The way Exxon Mobil accounts for the value of assets still in the ground has made the company a target of inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman.Mr. Schneiderman, along with many energy experts, has criticized Exxon Mobil for being slow to take into account the impact of anticipated future government actions to curb climate change, which may force energy companies to leave at least some fossil fuels untapped in the ground.On Friday, Exxon Mobil seemed ready to acknowledge that the value of its assets might change.\u201cWe anticipate that certain quantities of currently booked reserves such as those associated with our Canadian oil sands will not qualify as proven reserves at year-end 2016,\u201d Jeff Woodbury, Exxon Mobil\u2019s vice president for investor relations, said during a conference call.Mr. Woodbury added that if current price levels persist, other oil and gas operations in North America may have to be written down, although he indicated that they could also be put back on the books if prices recovered sufficiently.In August, the S.E.C. requested company documents and explanations about the value of Exxon Mobil\u2019s reserves, but it has not publicly commented on its inquiry. Exxon Mobil has promised to comply fully with the agency\u2019s requests and has expressed confidence that it has met its legal and accounting requirements.The company has resisted Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s broader investigation into its accounting and its past public positions on climate change. The New York attorney general contends that Exxon Mobil has misled the public, even as the company\u2019s own scientists were warning about the climate impacts of greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Other oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil\u2019s rivals Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, have lowered valuations by more than $50 billion since oil prices plunged from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to the current price of around $50 a barrel.In contrast, Exxon Mobil resisted write-downs, saying that it conservatively valued its assets on a long-term basis and that price volatility was normal in commodity markets.Exxon Mobil\u2019s oil sand reserves in Canada\u2019s Alberta province are a prime target for a write-down because they are particularly expensive to mine. Investments in oil sands have been slowing, and several oil companies have given up on the resource. Turning oil sands into a usable form of petroleum requires heavy processing and refining.Because Exxon Mobil\u2019s earnings on oil and gas exploration and production have been in decline, said Brian Youngberg, a senior energy analyst at Edward Jones, \u201cit is increasingly hard for it to demonstrate its reserves as economical in today\u2019s world of more moderate oil prices.\u201d\u201cScrutiny will continue to rise on this issue,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Youngberg said, \u201cespecially when it updates its reserves in early 2017.\u201dWith the world\u2019s oil industry producing over a million barrels a day more than global demand, few analysts expect oil prices to rise much through the end of the year \u2014 even though the expectation that the OPEC cartel may freeze or cut production in the coming months has moderately stabilized prices in recent months.Oil prices were as low as $30 a barrel in February. On Friday, West Texas Intermediate oil, a benchmark, was trading just above $49.The Exxon Mobil announcement came as the company reported third-quarter earnings of $2.7 billion, a 38 percent drop from the comparable period last year. Exxon Mobil has now reported two full years of quarterly declines as a result of low energy prices and recent drops in production and in profit margins on petroleum refining.Shares of Exxon Mobil stock were down more than 2 percent in early afternoon trading on Friday.Exxon Mobil\u2019s dividend payments continue to exceed profits, which means the company is borrowing and selling assets to finance its payments to shareholders. At the same time, cuts in capital spending are hurting the company\u2019s ability to maintain production.\u201cAlthough earnings may have bottomed,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, a senior Oppenheimer & Company analyst, \u201cExxon Mobil is not out of the woods yet and needs a much higher oil price to regain its balance.\u201dExxon Mobil is far from the only oil company that is suffering from low oil and natural gas prices. ConocoPhillips this week reported a third-quarter loss of $1 billion, as income fell 13 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zymergen Raises $130 Million in New Round of Financing", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over its three-year life, Zymergen has focused on helping genetically engineer tiny microbes, while using advanced computing to help better automate the process.Now the start-up has attracted a big round of financing to help expand its work.Zymergen said late Monday that it had raised $130 million in its latest round, led by the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank. The company also added two high-profile directors: Steven Chu, the former energy secretary, and Deep Nishar, a senior executive at SoftBank.Others in the round include the returning investors Data Collective, True Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Innovation Endeavors, Obvious Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures. New investors include Iconiq Capital, Prelude Ventures and Tao Capital Partners.From the beginning, Zymergen has used robotics and machine learning to better manipulate microbes used in processes like industrial fermentation, making customers\u2019 operations more efficient. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Joshua Hoffman, says its technology will ultimately help in a more important task: producing new materials unconstrained by the limits of traditional petroleum-based manufacturing.Its main components include robotics, which helps eliminate human error, and machine learning, which is meant to help find more advanced patterns that could lead to scientific breakthroughs.\u201cThe human ability to understand and predict what\u2019s happening is really limited,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. Zymergen\u2019s approach, he said, amplifies the work of industrial scientists and frees them to work outside traditional approaches.To illustrate, he pointed to the differences between Yahoo in its early days, which relied on human curators to organize web content, and Google, which from the start drew on complicated algorithms to make searching more powerful.Mr. Hoffman described the new financing, despite its technically being a \u201cseries B\u201d round, as one equivalent to a later-stage growth round at a more mature company. Zymergen, based in Emeryville, Calif., employs just under 200 people. He declined to discuss the company\u2019s financial performance, other than to say that it was producing revenue and was on a path to profitability.Such is the promise of Zymergen that in about four months it drew support from the likes of SoftBank \u2014 better known for its telecommunications network in Japan and its control of Sprint in the United States \u2014 and Dr. Chu, who shared a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997.\u201cWe are investing in Zymergen because they are a pre-eminent bioengineering company and the market leader,\u201d Mr. Nishar of SoftBank said in a news release.Dr. Chu, who was introduced to Zymergen via a former lieutenant from the Energy Department who also knew Mr. Hoffman, said the start-up\u2019s offerings could help produce new materials beyond plastics, helping create more sustainable products.\u201cIf you can really control an organism to produce something, your palette of materials is greatly enlarged,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.And, he added jokingly, the company was \u201capplying machine learning to something other than selling you things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That company, called Bridan Realty III, (from a combination of the Koffler sons\u2019 first names), then charged the school a marked-up rent that was roughly twice what the company was actually paying for the property.An audit of Michael, Brian and Daniel Koffler by the state\u2019s Department of Taxation and Finance also revealed that the three together had failed to report millions of dollars in income from K3 Learning, then known as MetSchools, and its related companies.Michael Koffler purportedly made a $12 million loan to MetSchools, which allowed him to claim a $12 million loss on his personal tax returns. The Taxation and Finance Department could find no proof that he had made such a loan.In addition, MetSchools and other related companies claimed $1.6 million of the family\u2019s personal expenses as deductible business expenses. The expenses included rental payments on a New York City apartment, department store purchases, car loan payments, utility and maintenance payments on the family\u2019s vacation home in Westhampton Beach, Long Island, and purchases made in Westhampton Beach and St. Barts, the Caribbean island.Reached by phone, Michael Koffler\u2019s wife, Lori, said the family did not wish to comment.\u201cWe won\u2019t allow special education programs to be exploited for personal financial gain,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. \u201cThese defendants used their programs as a way to defraud the government and cheat on their taxes \u2014 sticking law-abiding New Yorkers with the bill in the process.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the schools owned by K3 Learning.

{"Headline": "Poverty in Unexpected Places", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byEditorialGrinding poverty in the United States has long been synonymous with the Deep South, where low wages, poor health and diminished opportunity are more pervasive than in other parts of the country.That does not mean poverty in California and the West is as grim as in Mississippi and the South. Southern poverty is associated with greater material hardships than are experienced elsewhere, including hunger. (The West includes the 13 westernmost states; the South is a group of 16 states that includes Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, plus Washington, D.C.)The high alternative poverty rate in the West is driven largely by rising rents in California, where industries like technology, finance and entertainment have attracted well-paid workers who bid up housing costs. As rent increases have steadily outpaced wage growth in the last several years, housing costs as a share of total family income have swelled to more than 50 percent for nearly 30 percent of Californians, according to an analysis of Census data by the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality. The results are overcrowding, bad housing, the inability to afford other essentials, frequent evictions and other features of poverty.Similar dynamics are at work elsewhere, notably in Hawaii, New York and Washington, D.C. In effect, high and rising incomes at the top of the economic ladder are impoverishing those with modest pay who are clinging to the lower rungs.Market forces, however, are not the whole story. Another culprit is public policy, which at both the state and the federal levels has failed to soften the effect of the market through law and regulation, including zoning, renters\u2019 rights and other legal protections.The market is not going to cure itself of widening income inequality and the poverty it helps create. Bolstering federal rental subsidies, especially for families with children, is one good place to start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Inquiry Into Mayor de Blasio Is Said to Focus on Whether Donors Got Favors", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byA federal investigation into Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s campaign fund-raising has zeroed in on whether donations were exchanged for beneficial city action in about a half-dozen cases, according to people with knowledge of the inquiry.Prosecutors have subpoenaed thousands of emails and documents from the New York mayor, his senior aides, city agencies, lobbyists, his 2013 campaign, donors to the campaign and to the nonprofit formed to advance his political agenda, the Campaign for One New York \u2014 as well as the group itself, which several people with knowledge of the inquiry said played a central role in many of the matters being scrutinized.Still, after more than six months of digging into the mayor\u2019s dealings, the inquiry has yet to uncover sufficient evidence to warrant criminal charges that Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, or his aides took official action for donors in exchange for contributions to his nonprofit or to his campaign.The matters under scrutiny, the people said, involve, among others, a company whose soundstages are used to film television shows such as \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and \u201cBlue Bloods\u201d that wanted to expand its operations, and that depends on city permits; those connected to a lucrative development deal on the site of a former hospital that needed city approvals; a popular restaurant and wedding site that was negotiating a new lease with the city; and a garbage bag company seeking a city contract.Two donors are now cooperating with the investigation, several people with knowledge of the inquiry said. Investigators recently secured the assistance of Harendra Singh, owner of Water\u2019s Edge restaurant in Queens, who has been indicted on unrelated federal fraud and bribery charges. Mr. Singh had met with senior officials in City Hall about issues involving his restaurant, and was close to resolving them when he was arrested last year, two people with knowledge of the inquiry said.Mr. Singh and Mr. Rechnitz were cooperating with the inquiry \u2014 which is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the office of the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara \u2014 in an effort to seek leniency for their own crimes, several of the people said. Spokesmen for Mr. Bharara\u2019s office and the F.B.I. declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Singh did not return several calls seeking comment.The focus on the roughly half-dozen cases comes as investigators appear to have concluded that several other fund-raising or related matters that had been under federal scrutiny, or were the subject of state or local inquiries, now seem less likely to yield criminal charges, according to several of the people, who include defense lawyers, city officials, political consultants and others with knowledge of the matter.City officials and lawyers representing some of the subjects of the investigation, however, contend that it has focused on what they characterize as the traditional business of politics and government: donors supporting the mayor and later seeking what they said was his legitimate help on issues of interest to them.A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio said in a statement that the administration was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that its members had acted appropriately at all times. \u201cWe don\u2019t do pay-to-play,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOut of an interest of protecting the integrity of an ongoing review, we can\u2019t comment further at this stage.\u201dAs for the issues still being scrutinized, several lawyers for subjects of, and witnesses in, the fund-raising inquiry and others with knowledge of it have said the Campaign for One New York has drawn increasing attention. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss what is being examined by the authorities.The nonprofit shut down in March; Mr. de Blasio said it had served its purpose of pushing for passage of universal prekindergarten and an affordable housing plan. At the time, the group was the subject of an inquiry by the Joint Commission for Public Ethics, a state agency that enforces the lobbying law, and a formal complaint filed with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board.Some of the earliest and most generous donors to the Campaign for One New York are among those whose contributions \u2014 along with their actions and those of the mayor and members of his administration and campaign staff \u2014 are under scrutiny, several people with knowledge of the inquiry said.The first two donations to the group, made on Jan. 24, 2014, just weeks after Mr. de Blasio was sworn in, were for $25,000 each and came from Broadway Stages, the soundstage company seeking to expand, and the company\u2019s president, Gina Argento.By then, Ms. Argento and her company were well known to the mayor. She was the second-largest bundler of contributions for his 2013 run \u2014 city records show she brought in over $100,000 for the campaign and transition \u2014 and even spent $250 to rent the costumes that Mr. de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, wore at a 2014 Halloween party for children at Gracie Mansion. (The company said it also paid for costumes for more than 100 children from homeless shelters who attended the party.)One of Ms. Argento\u2019s companies also gave $10,000 to the Putnam County Democratic Committee in October 2014, when the mayor was urging his donors to support Democratic efforts to wrest control of the State Senate.Broadway Stages also gave $35,000 to the Mayor\u2019s Fund to Advance NYC, a charity that is led by Ms. McCray. Ms. Argento served on the group\u2019s advisory board until July.John J. Ciafone, a lawyer who is married to Ms. Argento and represents her and Broadway Stages, would not confirm the existence of a federal inquiry, but said that neither she nor the company had engaged in wrongdoing. Neither, he said, had sought help from the administration for Broadway Stages\u2019 expansion plans, which include new soundstages in Brooklyn and on Staten Island, in exchange for its contributions.\u201cBroadway Stages and Gina Argento has not gotten a penny from the city for any of these projects \u2014 not a penny!\u201d he said.Mr. Ciafone suggested that his wife and the company had been pressured to donate. Their business, he said, relied directly on the discretion of the mayor\u2019s office, which issues film permits from the film commissioner.\u201cThey put a lot of pressure on people like Broadway Stages and I\u2019m sure the other film people to give money to the mayor, to give money to C.O.N.Y.,\u201d he said, referring to the mayor\u2019s nonprofit.Mr. Ciafone said there could be \u201crepercussions in terms of not contributing,\u201d adding, \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand that.\u201dMr. Ciafone said the pressure had not come from Mr. de Blasio himself, but rather \u201cfrom several people \u2014 fund-raisers, staff fund-raisers, several people on behalf of the mayor\u201d whom he could not name.He also denied suggestions that Ms. Argento had engaged in a so-called straw donor scheme, saying Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign had attributed donors to her whom he said she had not solicited.Investigators believe that Mr. Singh used a straw donor scheme in a bid to support the mayor, several of the people said.Mr. Singh, his associates and relatives gave more than $50,000 to the 2013 campaign and held two fund-raisers at Water\u2019s Edge, which is on city-owned land in Long Island City.The city moved to evict him in early 2015, after an audit concluded that he had underpaid his rent and owed $1.8 million in back rent and fines. He challenged the findings and sued to delay the eviction; at the same time, he sought help from City Hall, the people said.Although some city officials argued that Mr. Singh did not deserve a new lease until he was a tenant in good standing, he worked out a deal to reduce his arrears and fines. It was nearly complete when he was arrested on the unrelated charges in September 2015, the people said.Other matters still under scrutiny include the sale of Long Island College Hospital and the awarding of a city contract for mint-scented garbage bags billed as repelling rats, the people said.In the hospital sale, prosecutors are examining the role of Mr. de Blasio and other officials; the mayor\u2019s nonprofit; and a health care union, 1199 S.E.I.U., which gave the nonprofit $250,000 in 2014.In the case of the garbage bag contract, investigators are examining whether two $50,000 contributions by the company\u2019s owner to the nonprofit resulted in the award of a city contract to another company that bought $3 million worth of rat-repelling bags.Advertisement"}

It has been more than a decade since a Hollywood studio made a major movie critical of China\u2019s authoritarian government.\u201cThese acquisitions, as well as many more cofinancing arrangements, allow Chinese state-controlled companies a significant degree of control over the financing and content of American media that raises serious concerns about how this may be used for propaganda purposes,\u201d Mr. Culberson said in the letter, dated Oct. 6, to John P. Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security. The letter also mentioned recent Hollywood purchases by other Chinese companies.A spokeswoman for Wanda North America said Friday in an e-mailed statement, \u201cWanda has and will continue to comply with all applicable U.S. law in connection with its media and entertainment investments in the United States including without limitation making the appropriate filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.\u201dShares held in the name of a niece of one Politburo member, Wang Zhaoguo, multiplied in value by more than 1,000, from less than $500,000 at the time they were acquired in 2007 to more than $600 million in early 2015, the Times investigation found.Wang Jianlin, a longtime Communist Party member, was a delegate to the 2007 congress that chose the next generation of party leaders, including Mr. Xi. From 2008 to 2013, he was a member of the standing committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, a high-level advisory body to China\u2019s legislature. A company owned by an employee of the son-in-law of the body\u2019s chairman at the time, Jia Qinglin, had acquired a stake in Mr. Wang\u2019s family holding company only weeks before the 2007 party conclave, The Times found.By early 2015, those shares were worth more than $250 million, and a stake in Wanda\u2019s Chinese cinema company that was owned by the son-in-law\u2019s investment company was worth more than $130 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Debt, Diversion, Distraction", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "There was a time, not long ago, when deficit scolds were actively dangerous \u2014 when their huffing and puffing came quite close to stampeding Washington into really bad policies like raising the Medicare age (which wouldn\u2019t even have saved money) and short-term fiscal austerity. At this point their influence doesn\u2019t reach nearly that far. But they continue to play a malign role in our national discourse \u2014 because they divert and distract attention from much more deserving problems, depriving crucial issues of political oxygen.What\u2019s so bad about this kind of deficit scolding? It\u2019s deeply misleading on two levels: the problem it purports to lay out is far less clearly a major issue than the scolds claim, and the insistence that we need immediate action is just incoherent.So, about that supposed debt crisis: right now we have a more or less stable ratio of debt to GDP, and no hint of a financing problem. So claims that we are facing something terrible rest on the presumption that the budget situation will worsen dramatically over time. How sure are we about that? Less than you may imagine.Yes, the population is getting older, which means more spending on Medicare and Social Security. But it\u2019s already 2016, which means that quite a few baby boomers are already drawing on those programs; by 2020 we\u2019ll be about halfway through the demographic transition, and current estimates don\u2019t suggest a big budget problem.Why, then, do you see projections of a large debt increase? The answer lies not in a known factor \u2014 an aging population \u2014 but in assumed growth in health care costs and rising interest rates. And the truth is that we don\u2019t know that these are going to happen. In fact, health costs have grown much more slowly since 2010 than previously projected, and interest rates have been much lower. As the chart above shows, taking these favorable surprises into account has already drastically reduced long-run debt projections. These days the long-run outlook looks vastly less scary than people used to imagine.Still, it\u2019s probably true that something will eventually have to be done to bring spending and revenues in line. But that brings me to the second point: why is this a crucial issue right now?Are debt scolds demanding that we slash spending and raise taxes right away? Actually, no: the economy is still weak, interest rates still low (meaning that the Fed can\u2019t offset fiscal tightening with easy money), and as a matter of macroeconomic prudence we should probably be running bigger, not smaller deficits in the medium term. So proposals to \u201cdeal with\u201d the supposed debt problem always involve long-term cuts in benefits and (reluctantly) increases in taxes. That is, they don\u2019t involve actual policy moves now, or for the next 5-10 years. So why is it so important to take up the issue right now, with so much else on our plate?Put it this way: yes, it\u2019s possible that we may at some point in the future have to cut benefits. But deficit scolds talk as if they offer a way to avoid this fate, when in fact their solution to the prospect of future benefit cuts is \u2026 to cut future benefits.If you try really hard, you can argue that locking in policies now for this future adjustment will make the transition smoother. But that is really a second-order issue, hardly deserving to take up a lot of our time. By putting the debt question aside, we are NOT in any material way making the future worse.And that is a total contrast with climate change, where our failure to act means pouring vast quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, materially increasing the odds of catastrophe with every year we wait.So my message to the deficit scolds is this: yes, we may face some hard choices a couple of decades from now. But we might not, and in any case there aren\u2019t any choices that must be made now. Meanwhile, there are genuinely scary things happening as we speak, which we should be taking on but aren\u2019t. And your fear-mongering is distracting us from these real problems. Therefore, I would respectfully request that you people just go away.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Their Own, Afghan Forces Strain to Combat Taliban Offensives", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 As Afghan forces struggle to break a weeklong Taliban siege of central neighborhoods in the provincial capital of Kunduz, insurgents are also stepping up pressure on urban centers in western and southern Afghanistan, officials said Sunday.Still, Afghan and Western officials say, the inexperienced Afghan forces, operating largely on their own now that the NATO mission has drawn down to an advisory role, have so far held their own despite being stretched to defend several areas simultaneously.\u201cSince August, the Taliban have made seven attempts to take cities inside Afghanistan,\u201d said Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, who visited Lashkar Gah with senior Afghan leaders on Saturday. \u201cEvery one of these attempts has failed.\u201dBut local officials in the cities facing the Taliban threat described a chaotic defense. Farid Ahmad Bakhatwar, the chief of the Farah provincial council, said Sunday that Taliban fighters had entered the Barang Tot area late Saturday, but that airstrikes had stemmed their advances. The city was in a panic, he said, with most shops closed and people fleeing.He expressed concern that Afghan forces had abandoned some check posts without a fight, in some cases without firing \u201ca single bullet.\u201d\u201cIf they had not been bombed by the air force, they would have captured the city last night,\u201d Mr. Bakhatwar said of the Taliban.Muhammad Asif Nang, the governor of Farah Province, said that airstrikes had killed about 60 insurgents on Sunday and that the city was not at risk of falling. In three days of fighting, 18 members of the security forces were killed and seven were wounded, Mr. Nang said.In Helmand, the Taliban fighters have probed several points around Lashkar Gah, said Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor. He said the fighting, which ebbs and flows, had been intense all night and then subsided during the day.\u201cThe defense minister and NATO commander visited Lashkar Gah yesterday and promised they will launch an operation, but it has not started yet,\u201d Mr. Zwak said Sunday.Complicating the work of the Afghan forces, the Taliban have, in many areas, cut off the main highways as well as smaller roads leading to security check posts, often pinning down the Afghan forces and disrupting resupply efforts. The Afghan Air Force, lacking sufficient aircraft, is stretched thin.Early in their siege of Kunduz, which began last Monday, the Taliban cut off highways leading into the city, which briefly fell to the insurgents in a similar offensive last year. On Friday, a convoy carrying Afghan reinforcements for the city came under fire in neighboring Baghlan Province, and about a dozen vehicles were destroyed by the Taliban.On Sunday, two Afghan Army helicopters trying to resupply a base cut off by the Taliban outside Baghlan\u2019s provincial capital came under fire, and one aircraft crashed. At least seven Afghan soldiers on board were killed, the Afghan Defense Ministry said.While the Interior Ministry said its forces had made progress in clearing the Taliban from at least three parts of Kunduz City, residents reported little change in the situation. Fighting slowed after Saturday night, only to pick up again late Sunday.\u201cHeavy fighting is still underway in Kunduz City,\u201d said Ghulam Rababani Rabbani, a member of the provincial council. \u201cThe Taliban did not retreat from any area.\u201dThe plight of residents displaced by the fighting continues to worsen. The United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Sunday that about 24,000 displaced people had arrived in cities near Kunduz, as well as in Kabul, the national capital.Afghan officials said the number was much higher. In neighboring Takhar Province alone, about 8,000 families, or roughly 50,000 people, had arrived since the fighting began, said Yasin Zia, the governor.\u201cThe emergency committee is trying to provide basic aid, but this is above our ability,\u201d Mr. Zia said. \u201cThey prepare food for 2,000 people for a lunch, and then 5,000 people show up.\u201dPresident Ashraf Ghani, in a televised address, promised to provide aid for Kunduz\u2019s displaced residents and those in other parts of the country.Those who remain in Kunduz face a bleak situation, lacking food, water and electricity, Mr. Ghani said.Najim Rahim and Zahra Nader contributed reporting from Kabul, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}

We sent reporters to five campuses to examine the new measures.Supported by\u201cGive me that,\u201d she said, snatching a bag of white wine from a female classmate in a Michigan T-shirt who was holding the bag aloft and guzzling from the nozzle.\u201cYou don\u2019t want no problem, no problem with me,\u201d the song warned, and it was clear that no one wanted any problem with Ms. DeCocker, either.For the second time that morning, she had foiled a round of Slap the Bag, the popular pastime of chugging cheap wine out of a plastic bladder liberated from its box. Under the new university rules to combat drinking, it is prohibited.Drinking games with red Solo cups of beer, \u201cpregaming\u201d with Fireball shots, swigging 190-proof grain alcohol punch on the way to blacking out: It\u2019s party time at college campuses across the country, even when there is no football game.To capture the uneasy balance between the forces promoting alcohol and those trying to control it, The New York Times sent reporters to five campuses. Here is what they found:Michigan\u2019s Greek system promised to self-police, and this semester a new set of rules was introduced for game days, when this city teems with tens of thousands of students decked out in the university\u2019s colors of maize and blue. Ms. DeCocker and the other student volunteers \u2014 in conspicuous orange shirts \u2014 were putting the restrictions to the test on this crisp, sunny Saturday, as Michigan prepared to play Penn State. They were determined to inspect each fraternity party.Caroline Alford, 22, a senior from Los Angeles, explained what qualified as a violation. Handles of alcohol being passed around. Kegs. People on the roof. A lack of \u201csober monitors,\u201d fraternity members who abstain from drinking and supervise the party.As the monitors passed a dilapidated house where students were drinking beer on a front porch, one pointed at the ambassadors. \u201cThey\u2019re here to shut down the vibe!\u201d he shouted. Ms. Alford did not flinch.The patrol arrived at a party at Sigma Phi Epsilon. Three students sat on the roof, their sneakers dangling off the side. \u201cCan you get the people off the roof?\u201d Andy Tripp, another ambassador, asked one of the members.Tyler Bryant, the chapter president of Kappa Sigma, nervously surveyed a party outside his fraternity, where rust-colored Keystone Light cans littered the grass.\u201cWe have that negative stereotype, and we\u2019re trying to reverse it,\u201d he said, pausing to admonish a partygoer who had lightly doused a reporter and another guest with beer. JULIE BOSMANMr. Jacob, holding a Budweiser, had gathered near other students who waited in lines during the third quarter. Beer sales would soon end.\u201cOur friend just got stopped,\u201d said Savannah Renshaw, 21, a senior from Dayton, as she stood with Mr. Jacob and other friends. \u201cSecurity came up to her and said, \u2018Can I see your ID?\u2019\u201dNearby, a young woman leaned over a garbage can. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been there,\u201d said her boyfriend, who claimed she had not been drinking. In the stands, a similar mess was being cleaned up with disinfectant.Unlike most other Big Ten universities, critics said, Ohio State succumbed to the allure of additional revenue.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a wise thing, as we\u2019re trying to teach our kids to moderate and to enjoy both alcohol and nonalcohol activities,\u201d said Mr. Schlissel, the Michigan president.But Mr. Jacob, a finance major, noting the Ohio State stadium\u2019s nearly 105,000 seats, said, \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a huge potential market.\u201dSome students said that because the rules permitted the purchase of two beers at a time, it was relatively easy to buy for a friend, then hand it over in the stands without detection.A university spokesman, Christopher Davey, said that could occur even if only one beer were sold at a time, and that the university was also enforcing the law. Ten people at the Rutgers game were cited in and around the stadium for offenses related to providing fake IDs, underage drinking and furnishing alcohol to minors, he said.Officials at Ohio State say there have been no major incidents related to its beer sales.But as he left the game, W. Carlton Weddington, 46, a former state representative from Columbus, warned: \u201cAt the end of the year, when the national championship is on the line, things get rowdy. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d STEPHANIE SAULOn a recent night, sitting in an unmarked police car and wearing plain clothes, Sgt. Larry Cuzzi and two officers with the university\u2019s police department staked out a liquor store inside a grocery at the edge of campus.Boston University does not have a football team, but other local sporting events, including one of the final games for the Red Sox star David Ortiz, known as Big Papi, provided ample reasons for a party \u2014 not that students needed one.The officers had not been parked five minutes when one, Nancy O\u2019Laughlin, spotted her first targets: two lanky young men, one wearing an empty backpack \u2014 a red flag because it suggests that one might be purchasing on behalf of the other. She bolted out of the car and waited to ask them for IDs as they left the store.\u201cThey\u2019re not really afraid of the courts,\u201d said Sergeant Cuzzi, a 20-year veteran of the force who runs its alcohol enforcement program. \u201cBut they are afraid of the university.\u201dIn addition to revoking scholarship money, the university can take away student housing and impose athletic sanctions on students caught buying alcohol for anyone under 21, or with fake IDs.Before the program started in 2011, officers were calling ambulances for more than 300 students a year because of drunkenness \u2014 the majority of them freshmen. Those numbers have dropped by nearly half, but binge drinking and the problems that come with it, including sexual assaults, have not disappeared.One night earlier, the officers had sent six dangerously drunk students to the hospital by ambulance. Officer O\u2019Laughlin had found one of them, an 18-year old woman, naked and unresponsive inside a fraternity house.At the liquor store, Officer O\u2019Laughlin pulled one of the young men by the shoulder as they left. He had a backpack full of beer. Both said they were 21, presenting IDs to prove it, so the officers let them go.But as the night went on, the officers issued summonses to half a dozen underage students, including two freshmen carrying wine and a pair of convincing fake IDs, complete with holograms.As 11 p.m. approached, closing time for liquor stores, Officer O\u2019Laughlin spied a young man wearing skinny jeans and a backward cap urinating on a gate outside the market.Glassy-eyed and slurring his words, the young man said he was 19. After giving Sergeant Cuzzi some attitude \u2014 \u201cWhatever you say, man \u2014 you\u2019re the law\u201d \u2014 he was handcuffed. Later the officers would send him to the hospital to sober up. CAITLIN DICKERSONPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 It\u2019s long been known as the scary path, a wooded shortcut between fraternity houses renowned for its convenience and its lack of lighting. At the end of the path is the Dumpster near which a young woman was sexually assaulted last year by Brock Turner, a Stanford swimmer, after a night of heavy drinking at the Kappa Alpha fraternity.On a recent October evening, another party at Kappa Alpha was in full swing.Fraternity brothers crushed cans of Natural Light in drinking games at a row of long wooden tables. Music coursed through the building, a mansion with a golf cart out front.But some here, particularly women, said the move would drive drinking behind closed doors, into dorm rooms where rape was more likely to occur. So far this fall, at least two women have reported sexual assaults in campus housing.\u201cThe website focused on stopping women from drinking hard alcohol,\u201d said Stephanie Pham, 20, a junior from Monterey Park and the founder of a campus anti-assault group, Stanford ASAP. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Stanford focus on discouraging rapists from raping?\u201d(The university\u2019s new programs include an overhaul of its assault investigation process and a 90-minute seminar for freshmen that covers sexual consent.)On campus, several students said their resident advisers had announced that they would not enforce the liquor rules.Susannah Meyer, 19, a sophomore from Manhattan, said she\u2019d already seen students downing extra liquor before parties for fear they wouldn\u2019t find it later. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Nothing is going to be there when I go out, so I have to get it done now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the attitude \u2014 a sense of urgency.\u201dBut Mr. Castro is encouraged. During the first three weeks of the quarter, Stanford had three alcohol-related hospital transports of students.It normally has three or four times as many. JULIE TURKEWITZThe D.J.\u2019s music pulsated, and a crowd of students danced, some on the tables.The line to enter had snaked around the corner before dawn, with students awaiting the Kilroy\u2019s game-day tradition of a breakfast buffet.Fourteen bartenders were ready at 7 a.m. to make mixed drinks \u2014 Sex on the Beach, Kamikaze, Woo Woo, Peaches \u2019n\u2019 Cream, Girl Scout Cookie, Blue Suede Shoes, Liquid Cocaine, Alabama Slammer, Water Long Island.A $5 cover charge pays for the buffet and a T-shirt. Drinks are extra.On home game days, there are more sexual assaults at universities, particularly in the first couple of months of classes.This fall, Indiana imposed a rule prohibiting hard liquor at its fraternity houses after several accusations of sexual assault last year and a sex tape from one house, which was shut down.Kilroy\u2019s, which rents its Kirkwood location from the Indiana University Foundation, was cited for serving alcohol to an underage person in the Spierer case. Since then, its ownership has changed hands, and students say there has been increased enforcement of underage drinking. Kilroy\u2019s manager, Ross Freeman, did not respond to requests for comment.As the evening progressed, the floor at Kilroy\u2019s grew slippery with beer and grime, and the restrooms emitted telltale odors of overindulgence.\u201cThey drink early,\u201d said Chief Michael Diekhoff of the Bloomington Police Department. \u201cThey may or may not go to the game. Then they\u2019ll take a nap. Then they\u2019ll get up and start again.\u201d STEPHANIE SAULAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consultant With Ties to Donald Trump Linked to Offer to Hide Source of Donations", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byA video posted on Monday by a British newspaper appeared to show a Republican consultant with ties to Donald J. Trump offering to disguise the source of contributions to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d intended to aid Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.United States law strictly forbids foreign nationals from making contributions to candidates, political parties or PACs. And Mr. Benton has a checkered history: Last month he was sentenced to two years of probation for his role in a 2012 scheme to make secret payments to an Iowa state senator in exchange for an endorsement.But the video does not show how the reporters identified themselves and reflects only snippets of the reporters\u2019 conversations with Mr. Benton, making it difficult to verify exactly what Mr. Benton had offered or whether any laws were broken.Mr. Benton stopped formally working for the super PAC last spring, after his conviction in the endorsement-buying scheme. Dan Backer, a lawyer for Great America, suggested that Mr. Benton had exaggerated his ties to the super PAC and said that Mr. Benton had no authority to solicit contributions.\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that someone who used to work for the organization decided to leverage that former relationship for his own purposes,\u201d Mr. Backer said. \u201cWe did not take, we did not solicit, we did not accept any foreign contributions directly or indirectly.\u201dMr. Backer acknowledged that the undercover reporters first contacted Eric Beach, the PAC\u2019s co-chairman, who referred them to Mr. Benton. But Mr. Backer said it was for Mr. Benton to advise the supposed donors on legal activities they could conduct in the United States.In the video, shot during a meeting at a New York hotel, Mr. Benton can be seen saying, \u201cI\u2019ll send money from my company to both.\u201d The video then cuts to another shot, with Mr. Benton agreeing that money would move from his firm into a nonprofit. In neither case does the video show the full exchange.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Artist\u2019s Eye to the Sky, Transformed at MoMA PS1", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byThe three-year renovation of James Turrell\u2019s beloved skyspace at MoMA PS1 might have tried even the patience of the Quakers who inspired it.Now the installation is again going on view \u2014 but not exactly as visitors may remember it.The newly renovated room opens to the public on Saturday at noon, and the first in a series of sunset programs, in which LED lights, now controlled by a computer, gradually brighten to contrast with the darkening sky, will begin around 6:30 that evening. (The artist has created a new program of modulating colors.) After about an hour, the oculus appears not as a window to the outside, but as an Ellsworth Kelly-esque black square on the ceiling.But is the installation a new work of art? That question took MoMA PS1 about two years to answer, Mr. Eleey said. At issue was whether the updates were substantial enough to change the very nature of the piece.In an interview, Mr. Turrell said that the \u201cMeeting\u201d of today was closer to his intention. With the renovations, he added, \u201cthe piece has gone on and become more than it was, and it is exactly what it was.\u201dMr. Eleey said: \u201cThe renovation improved upon certain aspects of the infrastructure, the benches you sit on, the light fixtures \u2014 and also allowed James to refine aspects of the aesthetic experience. But it is not a new work. For James, the work consists of our encounter with the open sky, in this particular place.\u201dThe first complication began as Mr. Turrell started to install the piece. Alanna Heiss, the museum\u2019s founder, invited him to create the skyspace in a third-floor classroom in the late 1970s. She told him the ceiling was about six inches thick. It turned out to be 42 inches.It took years, and a lot of Mr. Turrell\u2019s money, to finish. He made the roof himself. Occasionally, he would sleep under the open roof in a tent. In the end, he said, he had made \u201cthis perfect space with the perfect sky\u201d amid what was then the grit of Long Island City, Queens.There was a drain in the center of the floor, which was necessary during the piece\u2019s early years because the oculus\u2019s steel could be operated only by hand on the roof, and rain often made its way inside. In the late 1990s, the drain was covered by a layer of concrete, which led to a reduction in the seat height of the benches. In the latest renovation, they have been restored to their earlier height \u2014 and, more important to the artist, his original plans.Mr. Turrell said that \u201cMeeting\u201d was a turning point in both his career and the history of PS1. Klaus Biesenbach, the museum\u2019s director, said that the piece begot a wave of skyspaces, has become \u201cmore and more revered\u201d over time and continues to influence artists.\u201cIt is still a very radical statement,\u201d Mr. Biesenbach said. \u201cIt shocks you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flush and Dominant, Australia\u2019s Banks Come Under Pressure", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Dr. Benjamin Koh felt it was obvious what his employer wanted: to avoid paying the claim of a terminally ill customer.His employer, the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country\u2019s biggest bank, asked Dr. Koh to check out the customer, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. \u201cThey asked me to back them up and see if there was a loophole to justify rejecting the claim,\u201d said Dr. Koh, then the insurer\u2019s chief medical officer.The customer\u2019s physician left no doubt. The patient, he said, was on morphine and would be lucky to last even a few days.Dr. Koh cites that example as one of many that he says showed his employer was systematically trying to refuse or delay legitimate insurance claims. Fired shortly after he complained to its board, he took his accusations public \u2014 and added to a growing storm in Australia over the size, power and conduct of the country\u2019s four big banks.Long politically protected and immensely profitable, Australia\u2019s big banks are now facing the biggest public outcry in a generation. The banks dominate Australian financial life, from credit cards and savings accounts to pensions and business services.Still, Australia stands out. At a time when the world is considering what to do about banks that are too big to fail, Australia offers a glimpse of just how big \u2014 and how dominant \u2014 they can become.Politicians from both of Australia\u2019s major parties say the banks have used their position to profit on the backs of the country\u2019s spenders and borrowers. At a gala in April to celebrate the 199th birthday of one bank, Malcolm Turnbull, the country\u2019s prime minister, said, \u201cOur bankers have not always treated their customers as they should.\u201d His government has vowed to increase funding for the local banking regulator and force bank chiefs to appear before lawmakers.The opposition Labor Party wants to get even tougher. Mr. Turnbull is \u201cnow inviting them to lunch in Canberra once a year so he can wag his finger at them,\u201d Bill Shorten, the party\u2019s leader, told reporters. \u201cThis is a friendly catch-up, not an investigation.\u201dThe banks have apologized for some infractions but have largely defended their role, citing their stability and their role in the country\u2019s long spate of uninterrupted economic growth.As a result, the banks capture 3 cents in pretax profit of every $1 spent in the economy, estimates David Richardson, an economist who has studied the industry at the Australia Institute, a policy think tank. \u201cOne way or another, the banks are making monopoly profits,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere is no competition in Australia.\u201dAdding to the sense of public anger, Australian officials extended $11 billion in financing to the banks during the global financial crisis. The banks have also benefited from low rates that some politicians say they are not fully passing on to borrowers.Australia\u2019s corporate regulator is suing three of the banks \u2014 Westpac, National Australia and Australia and New Zealand \u2014 over claims that they manipulated Australian interest rates to bolster profits. The government cited a transcript of internal Westpac phone calls quoting the head of Westpac\u2019s treasury department, Colin Roden, telling a colleague, \u201cWe\u2019ve got so much money on it we just had to do it, right?\u201dA spokesman for Westpac said none of its employees had broken the law. He declined to make Mr. Roden available for an interview.National Australia Bank and ANZ have also denied any wrongdoing. But ANZ fired several traders named in the investigation after discovering what it said were disparaging remarks about women and casual remarks about drugs in employee emails and chats.Some customers have also accused the banks of selling them products they did not need \u2014 accusations that have drawn the attention of lawmakers. They accuse the lenders of giving their employees big incentives to sell products like mutual funds to unwitting customers. \u201cIt causes deep conflict within the services arm of the bank,\u201d said Josh Mennen, a lawyer at the law firm Maurice Blackburn, which is suing the bank on behalf of several clients.Those incentives occasionally led to outright misconduct, according to a parliamentary inquiry. In one case, a Commonwealth Bank salesman forged a couple\u2019s signatures and transferred some of their retirement savings into high-risk shares, contributing to a 65 percent fall in the portfolio and forcing them onto welfare, one witness said. The bank apologized in 2014 for what it said was widespread inappropriate selling of financial products and offered customers free reviews of its financial advice.CommInsure, a unit of Commonwealth Bank, has been a top target of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, a securities regulator. The regulator is investigating claims that the insurer used outdated medical definitions to avoid paying claims, pressured doctors into denying claims, deleted medical files and left whistle-blowers exposed, according to the commission\u2019s chairman, Greg Medcraft, a former Wall Street banker.\u201cThe banks need to have a culture their customers can believe in,\u201d he said in an interview.The day before Commonwealth Bank\u2019s chief executive was due to answer questions from legislators, the bank said it had updated its medical definitions for heart attacks and severe rheumatoid arthritis. The change means that 17 customers whose insurance claims were denied will be paid, and that 38 more could be after further investigation by the bank.\u201cWe have done wrong by some customers in that business and other businesses,\u201d the chief executive, Ian Narev, told a parliamentary committee. \u201cThe goal is to put things right.\u201dThe government investigation, and lawsuits by former customers, were largely tied to the controversy set off by Mr. Koh, the former chief medical officer of CommInsure, the insurance arm of Commonwealth Bank.By the time he was asked to check whether the man suffering from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease was really sick, Dr. Koh already believed that the company was deliberately delaying claims from terminally ill customers to get out of paying them. \u201cIt was distressing for me,\u201d Dr. Koh said, adding that the customer\u2019s physician \u201cwas basically reading his last rites.\u201dCommInsure fired Dr. Koh last year for sending clients\u2019 files to his private email address, a step he said was necessary to document the bank\u2019s behavior. He is suing under whistle-blower protection laws.Carlos Tejada contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe May Finally End Its Painful Embrace of Austerity", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 As Europe has grappled with the trauma of a devastating financial and economic crisis, policy makers have consistently relied on one approach to managing the damage \u2014 budget austerity.Shrink government spending by trimming pensions and cutting social programs, the logic runs, and the markets will gain confidence in the tough-minded people in charge. Confident markets make for happy markets. Money will pour in, and good times will roll.Even as prosperity has remained painfully elusive across much of Europe, leaders have time and again renewed their faith in the virtues of this harsh medicine.Until now.Some policy makers are flashing tentative signs that they may be prepared to slacken their grip on public coffers to spur growth and improve the lot of ordinary people suffering joblessness and diminished wealth. In the clearest sign of this shift, the heavily indebted Italy is increasingly inclined to challenge Germany \u2014 the guardian of austerity \u2014 to loosen European purse strings.The development comes after Britain\u2019s stunning vote to abandon the European Union, an angry rebuke of the economic elite within struggling communities, and as populist, anti-immigrant movements across the Continent gain traction.Above all, the change could be an antidote to years of dogmatic European policies, replacing a failed effort to generate economic growth through cutting spending with a focus on bolstering investment.\u201cAusterity is out of the discussion in a way,\u201d said the Italian finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, during a recent interview in Rome. \u201cWe need to bring more growth and more jobs to Europe.\u201dThe most obvious place the new dynamic is unfolding is in Britain.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.Before the June 23 vote for \u201cBrexit,\u201d the man in charge of the budget, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, was publicly pursuing the aim of delivering a budget surplus by 2020. The target required cuts.But as the political class absorbed the ballot result, interpreting it as a demand for redress from communities reeling from high unemployment and wage stagnation, Mr. Osborne acknowledged that his goal could no longer be achieved.His successor, Philip Hammond, has raised the ante.Budget cutting has given way to fresh spending in large part because of fears of the economic consequences of Britain\u2019s potentially tortuous European divorce proceedings. Investment is expected to slow, reflecting grave uncertainty. British exports could be threatened. High-paying finance jobs could shift from Britain to other countries in Europe.But any fair conversation about austerity must reckon with a complex reality: There are great divergences between the rhetoric of policy-making and the actual spending of money.In Britain, Mr. Osborne presented himself as a courageous guardian of the treasury, intent on making cuts to balance the books. At the same time, he ran budget deficits that were proportionately larger than those in France, where a Socialist government, supposedly intent on handing out loot unencumbered by arithmetic, was in power.In the United States, the Obama administration responded to the Great Recession with a $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill \u2014 a mixture of tax cuts and increased government spending. Its economy proceeded to recover more vigorously than Europe\u2019s, giving rise to the notion that stimulus was at work on the American side of the Atlantic, while austerity prevailed across the water.That story, however, is overly simplistic.In Washington, bickering over the size and duration of many social programs \u2014 emergency unemployment benefits, food stamps and housing supports \u2014 effectively curtailed the scope of these efforts. In Europe, a vastly more generous social safety net limited the impacts of joblessness.Any alteration to European economic policy inevitably involves Germany. The region\u2019s largest economy, it wields outsize influence over the levers of economic policy.The European Union maintains rules limiting budget deficits and public debt burdens. Countries that exceed the limits are subject to negotiations over the consequences.To Germany, those rules are immutable (unless Germany is the one asking for some slack). The German economic view, analysts say, is dominated by moralistic judgments and a grave fear of inflation. Deficits reflect weakness of will and undermine the value of money. Prosperity comes from discipline and sacrifice.German voters have expressed alarm at any possibility that their abundant savings might be used to rescue reckless borrowers on the Mediterranean. This trait has been most on display as Germany has demanded sharp cuts in government spending as a condition for successive bailouts of Greece by European authorities. But it has similarly colored German demands for strict adherence to the limits on deficit spending by Spain, Portugal and other crisis-assailed European nations. (And never mind, critics charge, that most troubled European economies landed there not because of too much public spending, but because of disastrous private borrowing \u2014 often extended by German banks.)Germany, economists say, is effectively combating a phantom: The real threat is not inflation, but the opposite \u2014 deflation, or falling prices. When prices are dropping, that means demand for goods and services is weak, and that reduces the incentive for businesses to expand and hire.Faced with such a downward spiral, the traditional economic playbook calls for government to step in and spend money, even if that entails running deficits. Construction projects, for example, put cash into the pockets of construction workers, who then spread their wages through the economy.\u201cOn the merits, Spain, Italy and France should be ganging up on the Germans and outvoting them and strong-arming them,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England, and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cFor whatever reason, they don\u2019t get there, and I genuinely don\u2019t understand it.\u201dItaly is now making a run at it.Last month, its prime minister, Matteo Renzi, accused Germany of putting European interests at risk by refusing to allow more government spending.In a series of recent interviews in Rome, top Italian officials outlined intentions to liberate Europe from austerity.\u201cIf you want to close this divide and you want to persuade your citizens that there is opportunity in the internationalization of the economy and innovation, you need to invest a lot,\u201d said the Italian minister of economic development, Carlo Calenda. \u201cThe question is whether you do it within the European rule or whether you break the European rule. What we are trying to do is to stay within the European rule.\u201dBut not forever, Mr. Calenda added. Greece confronted Germany loudly and directly as it submitted to wrenching cuts as a condition of the bailouts. Italy is mounting a quieter challenge, operating within the rules while finding favorable interpretations that allow greater spending.\u201cWe do think there is space to maneuver in order to change the European rule,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we will be in a situation where we need to act in a stronger way, especially on fiscal space, then we will take that into consideration.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Buying at a Used Car Auction? What You Don\u2019t Know Could Kill You", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byOn Tuesday, two reporters from The New York Times visited a car auction held in Queens by the New York City Department of Finance.It was a lesson in how consumers can purchase cars that have deadly defects and how sellers have few obligations to disclose those defects to the public.The department was auctioning 20 cars, which had probably been abandoned or towed, to a group of about 50 bidders. The vehicles were in various states of disrepair and no one had even bothered to remove trash from the interiors.The vehicles\u2019 inclusion in the database denoted that the recall problems had not been fixed.The auctioneer at the sale made clear that all of the cars would be sold as is, even if they had been recalled. Buyers had to pay in cash, he said, and all sales were final.\u201cThere\u2019s no buyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d the auctioneer, Dennis Alestra, announced through a loudspeaker. The warnings are reinforced on the Finance Department website, which says that \u201cPurchasers have no legal recourse against the city.\u201dBut as the first cars were auctioned, there was no mention of the specific safety defects.Three of the cars had the faulty Takata airbags, which have led to the largest automotive recall in United States history. An additional three cars, made by General Motors, had an ignition switch that could suddenly cut off a vehicle\u2019s power, a defect that has killed more than 100 people and led to a $900 million penalty for the automaker.The cars up for auction on Tuesday sat in a sea of defeated-looking vehicles in an outdoor lot, where potential buyers milled around to conduct cursory inspections.A man in a Yankees sweatshirt asked The New York Times to leave because Mr. Z Towing, where the auction was held, was private property. The reporters then observed the proceedings on the nearby sidewalk through a fence.Bidding started low, and some cars sold for just a few hundred dollars.Auctions like this \u2014 fast-paced, cash-only, as is \u2014 tend to dispose of cars that have seen far better days. Sometimes, the buyers are licensed dealers who plan to flip the vehicles quickly. Other times they are sold for parts.But too often, consumer lawyers and safety advocates say, they are sold to low-income consumers who can afford to spend only a few hundred dollars on a car, and need one badly enough that they will take a risk.Unlike new cars, used cars have no federal requirement that sellers disclose safety recalls or fix dangerous defects, although some state and local regulations offer consumers some protections.But enforcing those protections can be tricky, and sometimes happens only after someone has been harmed, requiring lawsuits for wrongful death or negligence.\u201cIt\u2019s illegal for a dealer to knowingly or negligently sell an unsafe car,\u201d Ms. Shahan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of, how many layers of enforcement can you add?\u201dOf 20 vehicles listed on this auction notice from the New York City Department of Finance, 10 are recalled models.The National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group whose members include used-car dealers, advises companies to fix recalled vehicles when possible and to disclose defects, according to Shaun Petersen, the senior vice president for legal and government affairs.The New York City Department of Finance, along with many other sellers of used vehicles, says that it is up to consumers to ensure that what they are buying is safe.A spokeswoman for the department, said that protecting consumers was a priority.\u201cState law and individual judicial orders require that the city auction off incurred property, whether it\u2019s a car, a lawn mower, or a piece of jewelry,\u201d Sonia Alleyne, the spokeswoman, said. \u201cThis requirement makes no exemption for inoperable or broken equipment, including recalled cars.\u201dSafety experts say that more can be done to protect consumers, like disclosing recalls and fixing defects before cars are sold.The online database of recalls is not perfect \u2014 you can search for only one car at a time, and users can get temporarily logged off the system after more than a handful of searches \u2014 but safety advocates say that sellers of recalled cars have no good excuse not to use it.Dealers are required to repair recalled vehicles free, even after a car has been sold multiple times. That applies to drivers who own, say, a 2001 Honda Civic \u2014 the same model car that was involved in the death of 50-year-old Delia Robles when she collided with a pickup truck last month.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazilian Lawmaker Who Led Impeachment of President Is Arrested", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Eduardo Cunha, the former speaker of Brazil\u2019s lower house of Congress who engineered the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff this year, was arrested Wednesday on corruption charges, federal prosecutors said.Mr. Cunha, until recently one of the country\u2019s most powerful and feared politicians, was taken into custody in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, and flown to Curitiba, in the southern state of Paran\u00e1, where he could stand trial, according to a statement by the prosecutors\u2019 office.Mr. Cunha is facing multiple allegations, including accusations that he took as much as $40 million in bribes for himself and his allies from the state oil company, Petrobras. He also faces money-laundering charges as well as accusations that he interfered with the authorities\u2019 investigation, prosecutors said.Mr. Cunha said in a statement on Wednesday that there was no justification for his arrest, and he called it \u201can absurd decision.\u201dThe arrest was ordered by Judge Sergio Moro, who is overseeing many of the cases related to the Petrobras investigation. Prosecutors requested Mr. Cunha\u2019s detention, saying that he was a flight risk and a threat to the investigation.His ouster stripped him of the legal protections against prosecution he had enjoyed as a legislator.His arrest allows prosecutors and Judge Moro to counter mounting criticism that they were singling out politicians from Ms. Rousseff\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, some political analysts say.With the possibility looming that another Workers\u2019 Party figure, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, could be arrested in the coming weeks \u2014 he faces multiple charges and awaits trial on corruption and obstruction of justice charges \u2014 Mr. Cunha\u2019s arrest could be seen as a way for Judge Moro to calm his critics.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any excuses anymore,\u201d Mr. Santoro said. \u201cIf Cunha is in jail, they can go on and arrest everybody else.\u201dThe arrest continues a remarkable fall for Mr. Cunha, who was one of Brazil\u2019s most powerful figures and helped finance the campaigns of hundreds of legislators.Mr. Temer and many of his allies distanced themselves from Mr. Cunha after Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment.But now with the arrest of Mr. Cunha, members of Brazil\u2019s political elite are undoubtedly concerned that he will cooperate with prosecutors and implicate others in the Petrobras case. Since the investigation began more than two years ago, prosecutors have used arrests as a way to press suspects to sign plea-bargain agreements and advance their prosecutions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the 2016 Debate Between the Running Mates", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byThe campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then I\u2019ll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, it\u2019s been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.(APPLAUSE)Gentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment\u2019s notice? Senator Kaine?This is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I\u2019m proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud to be her running mate.Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It\u2019ll be whether we can make somebody\u2019s life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer \u2014 it\u2019s going to be about results.And she said to me, you\u2019ve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You\u2019ve been a city councilman and mayor. You\u2019ve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people\u2019s lives.And that\u2019s what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I\u2019m so proud of her.And, Senator Kaine, it\u2019s an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just \u2014 I also want to say \u2014 I want to say thanks to everyone that\u2019s looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.For the last seven-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve seen America\u2019s place in the world weakened. We\u2019ve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being \u2014 being with us tonight.So to answer your question, I would say I \u2014 I would hope that if \u2014 if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I\u2019m going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that\u2019s to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I\u2019ve served in the Congress of the United States, where \u2014 where I\u2019ve led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I \u2014 I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that \u2014 that lifetime of experience.Hillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it\u2019s always been about putting others first. And that\u2019s a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.Donald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, \u201coff the backs of the little guy.\u201d And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States.It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I can\u2019t imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish \u201cme first\u201d style of Donald Trump.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He\u2019s brought an extraordinary business acumen. He\u2019s employed tens of thousands of people in this country.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)Under Secretary Clinton\u2019s leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.(CROSSTALK)Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence?That\u2019s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually \u2014 he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we\u2019ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that\u2019ll put the American worker first, and you\u2019ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that\u2019s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump\u2019s plan will do, then we\u2019re going to have the resources to meet our nation\u2019s needs at home and abroad, and we\u2019re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.Hillary and I have a plan that\u2019s on the table that\u2019s a \u201cyou\u2019re hired\u201d plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can\u2019t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we\u2019ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who\u2019ve benefited as we\u2019ve come out of recession to pay more.Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that\u2019s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession \u2014 the deepest recession since the 1930s.Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump \u2014 why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.Look, what \u2014 what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that\u2019s all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We\u2019re in the...(CROSSTALK)Those tax returns that were \u2014 that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what\u2019s called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.We have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we\u2019ll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.Here\u2019s what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We\u2019re going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we\u2019ll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.(CROSSTALK)Do we ask too much of police officers in this country? And how would you specifically address the chief\u2019s concerns? Senator Kaine?I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.Here\u2019s what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it\u2019s safer for the communities and it\u2019s safer for the police.That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don\u2019t work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll focus on community policing. We will focus on \u2014 and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.I\u2019m a gun-owner. I\u2019m a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I\u2019ve got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we\u2019re going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won\u2019t have the tragedies that we did.One of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn\u2019t survive the scourge of gun violence.We can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.Police officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It\u2019s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.Donald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It\u2019s probably \u2014 probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order.But they also \u2014 they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as \u2014 as a reason to \u2014 to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of \u2014 of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop.I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith \u2014 Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I \u2014 we \u2014 we mourn with those who mourn. We \u2014 we grieve with those who grieve. And we\u2019re saddened at the loss of life.But Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where \u2014 where she used \u2014 when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there\u2019s implicit bias in everyone in the United States. I just think...The guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school. And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.But when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a \u2014 they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked. The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)I worked when I was Congress on a second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice. But what \u2014 what \u2014 what Donald Trump and I are saying is let\u2019s not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement. We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...And I just want to talk about the tone that\u2019s set from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He\u2019s called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don\u2019t like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn\u2019t hero because he\u2019d been captured. He said African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.If you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can\u2019t have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I just \u2014 again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.But I \u2014 Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It\u2019s probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.And Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And \u2014 and once we have accomplished all of that, which will \u2014 which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we\u2019ll deal with those that remain.But I have to tell you, I just \u2014 I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago. KAINE: These were Donald\u2019s \u2014 hold on a second, Governor.(CROSSTALK)I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you\u2019ve said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn\u2019t have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It\u2019s \u2014 she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.I mean, it\u2019s extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another \u201cism\u201d on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this \u2014 this insult-driven campaign, I mean...(LAUGHTER)Immigration. There\u2019s two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You\u2019ve got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.That\u2019s our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you\u2019re born here, but your parents don\u2019t have documents, they want to eliminate that. That\u2019s another 4.5 million people.These guys \u2014 and Donald Trump have said it \u2014 deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe...(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just \u2014 we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the \u2014 the violence that\u2019s besetting our cities. The reality is that there\u2019s heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don\u2019t have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.Donald Trump has said we\u2019re going to move those people out, people who\u2019ve overstayed their visas. We\u2019re going to enforce the law of this country. We\u2019re going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we\u2019ve done all of those things, that we\u2019re going to reform the immigration system that we have...When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can\u2019t imagine how you could defend that.But there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there\u2019s only one candidate who can do it, and it\u2019s Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That\u2019s seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.And she\u2019s got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here\u2019s her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we\u2019ve got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she\u2019ll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.Second, we\u2019ve got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That\u2019s the Hillary Clinton plan; she\u2019s got the experience to do it.Donald Trump. Donald Trump can\u2019t start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a plan. He said, \u201cI have a secret plan,\u201d and then he said, \u201cUm, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.\u201d And then he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan.\u201d And finally he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to fire all the generals.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have a plan.But he does have dangerous ideas. Here\u2019s four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain\u2019s no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we\u2019ll only work together with Israel if they pay \u201cbig league.\u201dThird, he loves dictators. He\u2019s got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...I\u2019d love to hear Governor Pence tell me what\u2019s so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.We\u2019ve weakened America\u2019s place in the world. It\u2019s been a combination of factors, but mostly it\u2019s been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you \u2014 and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.(CROSSTALK)But the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it\u2019s overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.My heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009.But because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I\u2019d give her a hug and tell her we\u2019re never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.And a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.I mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don\u2019t bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.But also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.But the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that\u2019s how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical.That\u2019s why Donald Trump\u2019s claim that he wants to \u2014 that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)And the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America \u2014 the greatest nation on Earth \u2014 just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins \u2014 look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.It begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We\u2019ve got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.But about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.And secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.There\u2019s a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.And Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it\u2019s clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.The Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don\u2019t know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.I\u2019ll tell you what offends me...So get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\u2019s hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women \u2014 young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn\u2019t support the fight against terror.(CROSSTALK)And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we\u2019re not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to \u2014 we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm\u2019s way.But, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump\u2019s idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that\u2019s who Governor Pence\u2019s running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)(CROSSTALK)She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia. And we\u2019ve done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we\u2019ve put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn\u2019t know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time. America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason. They should wonder \u2014 when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America\u2019s bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump\u2019s bottom line that he\u2019s going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do. And I know he\u2019s laughing at this, but every president...And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that \u2014 Syria is imploding. You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo. ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa. It is \u2014 ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier \u2014 I get all that \u2014 in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure. I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...(CROSSTALK)When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I\u2019ve said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that\u2019s stating painful facts. That\u2019s not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That\u2019s an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...She\u2019s not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy. But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals. This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re not going to have the \u2014 the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power. We\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to go back to the days of peace through strength.But I have to tell you that \u2014 that all this talk about tax returns \u2014 and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up. It must have \u2014 must have...(CROSSTALK)Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff. Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process. They cannot make financial contributions. But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars. And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation. When you talk about all these \u2014 all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton \u2014 you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning \u2014 the reason...Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.But let\u2019s compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He\u2019s refused to do it.His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It\u2019s putting money into Donald Trump\u2019s pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won\u2019t share with the American public what he\u2019s doing and what those conflicts are.(LAUGHTER)You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. I\u2019m on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this \u2014 virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. They\u2019re starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.So we\u2019re working together with China, and we need to. China\u2019s another one of those relationships where it\u2019s competitive, it\u2019s also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, \u201cWomen\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d They didn\u2019t want her to say that, but she did.But she\u2019s also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take.The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China. I\u2019m not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don\u2019t believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don\u2019t raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that.When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I\u2019m not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.And I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn\u2019t feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.That was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don\u2019t feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine\u2019s sincere faith. I truly do.The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I\u2019m also very pleased at the fact we\u2019re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you\u2019re going to be pro-life, you should \u2014 you should be pro- adoption.But what I can\u2019t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view \u2014 and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally \u2014 but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.And I cannot \u2014 I can\u2019t conscience about \u2014 about a party that supports that. Or that \u2014 I know you\u2019ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to \u2014 wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn\u2019t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.So let\u2019s talk about abortion and choice. Let\u2019s talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That\u2019s something we trust American women to do that.And we don\u2019t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren\u2019t even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.(CROSSTALK)But here\u2019s \u2014 there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who\u2019s standing for the right to life. It\u2019s a principle that \u2014 Senator Kaine \u2014 and I\u2019m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you \u2014 it\u2019s a principle that you embrace.And I have appreciated the fact that you\u2019ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that\u2019s not Hillary Clinton\u2019s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are \u2014 we\u2019re better for it. We can \u2014 like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...That\u2019s what we ought to be doing in public life. Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...But we do have to bring the country together. So here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And I\u2019m really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.She was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for \u2014 TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.Because I think it\u2019s fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened America\u2019s place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it\u2019s going to take leadership to do it.The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback.And Donald Trump\u2019s entire career has been about building. It\u2019s been about \u2014 it\u2019s going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and \u2014 when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we\u2019re going to have a stronger America.When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. They\u2019re going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we\u2019ll have the kind of unity that\u2019s been missing for way too long.This concludes the vice presidential debate. My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching. Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.From Farmville, Virginia, I\u2019m Elaine Quijano of CBS News. Good night.An earlier version of this article, transcribed and provided by the Federal News Service, quoted incorrectly from an exchange between Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana over comments from Donald J. Trump. Mr. Kaine said, \u201cyou want to use a big tar brush against Mexicans on that?,\u201d not \u201cyou want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Curious Plan to Fight Climate Change: Buy Mines, Sell Coal", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Tom Clarke, a nursing home owner, concocted a strategy to cut carbon emissions by gaining control of millions of tons of coal reserves and multiple mines.Supported byFAIRVIEW, W.Va. \u2014 The coal was piled about as high as it could go, spilling down to the railroad tracks and towering over the elevator shaft. A yellow bulldozer pushed the mound to make room for more. From a distance on this rainy day, the black heap looked like a giant whale about to swallow the mine whole.The word underground was that Federal mine No. 2 would soon have to close. It was early April, and the mine was running out of storage space. There were not enough buyers for all the coal.A few months earlier, this problem would have belonged to Patriot Coal, one of the nation\u2019s largest coal companies, which used to operate the Federal mine, built near a meandering mountain stream called Miracle Run.But this was not Patriot\u2019s problem anymore. Nor was it the problem of the hedge funds and other investors that had lent the company millions.When Patriot filed for bankruptcy in 2015 \u2014 its second time in three years \u2014 environmentalists and regulators were prepared for the company to figure out ways to shunt liabilities and maximize returns. But no one could have envisioned what happened next.Patriot handed over millions of dollars of environmental obligations to a nonprofit company run by a man named Tom Clarke, who owned a chain of nursing homes and a tourist attraction that had fallen behind on its bills. Until that day in April, Mr. Clarke, 61, had never been in a coal mine.Patriot sold not only the troubled Federal mine to Mr. Clarke, but also several other mines that were no longer in operation, including a sprawling surface mine carved from the top of a mountain in southern West Virginia. Mr. Clarke\u2019s new company agreed to clean up the shuttered mines and reclaim the land that had been ravaged.As part of the deal, the miners\u2019 union invested $10 million in the Federal mine operation, which was supposed to keep producing coal for Mr. Clarke to sell. But the mine has struggled from low coal prices.\u201cIt was a spectacular deal for Patriot,\u201d said Patrick McGinley, a law professor at West Virginia University who has been involved in cases against coal companies since 1970s. \u201cThis company has had complete success in divesting itself of all liabilities of every kind, including environmental liabilities, which are the hardest to shed.\u201dWhy then, would someone like Mr. Clarke want to take over a troubled mine and the environmental obligations that Patriot Coal was seeking to get rid of? As improbable as it may seem, Mr. Clarke said the Patriot deal had played to his advantage \u2014 helping start his grand plan to remake coal mining into a greener industry.He is not only reclaiming Patriot\u2019s mines that are no longer in use. He has come up with a model, he said, for how the industry can keep producing coal, while reducing its impact on the climate.The plan involves creating pollution credits by planting or preserving trees around the world to offset the carbon emitted from burning coal. For every ton of coal he sells, Mr. Clarke attaches some of the credits.Mr. Clarke has had trouble, however, persuading buyers of his coal, like utilities and steel companies, to pay extra for the credits.Mr. Clarke hoped electric utilities would be able to count his green-coal credits toward the carbon-emissions goals that the Obama administration has set for states in its Clean Power Plan, now before a federal court. But administration officials have effectively ruled that out.That hasn\u2019t stopped Mr. Clarke\u2019s company from acquiring more mines. In addition to Patriot, Mr. Clarke has made deals over the last 11 months with several other struggling coal companies, gaining control of multiple underground mines, millions of tons of coal reserves and thousands of acres of surface mines.He has even tried bidding on steel mills to create a captive buyer for his coal bundled with carbon credits. Now he is in the market for utilities, for the same reason.While the Federal mine has cut back on production, some of his other mines are poised for a rebound. Demand for metallurgical coal \u2014 which is used for making steel \u2014 has roared back in recent months. One of the companies he founded with a longtime coal executive, ERP Compliant Fuels, is now one of the largest producers of metallurgical coal in North America.\u201cI am the guy that is trying to work from within,\u201d Mr. Clarke said. \u201cThe goal is to have a big enough footprint to drive our environmental philosophy home.\u201dIf this were a movie about the American coal industry, Mr. Clarke would be the character who goes completely off script.For decades, the battle lines around coal have been clear. The companies are fighting to protect their diminishing business. Many environmentalists, meanwhile, are trying to limit coal production permanently and force the industry to clean up the damage it has inflicted on forests, rivers and lakes.The debate over coal on the campaign trail is also predictable \u2014 Donald J. Trump has vowed to bring back lost mining jobs and roll back overzealous environmental regulations, and Hillary Clinton is promising to help mining communities transition out of coal and into new industries.Environmental groups can almost smell victory. Many of the nation\u2019s largest coal companies have filed for bankruptcy. Natural gas is pulling even and may surpass coal as the top power source in the United States.The industry\u2019s decline is forcing states to deal with how to clean up the mines and who should pay for it. In West Virginia alone, 300,000 acres of forest \u2014 an area half the size of Rhode Island \u2014 have been damaged by mountaintop mining, by one estimate.After some challenges, Mr. Clarke\u2019s reclamation work has been meeting regulatory standards and even exceeding expectations by some measures, one West Virginia official said.In January, Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin of West Virginia lauded Mr. Clarke in his state-of-the-state address for helping develop \u201cnew and innovative ideas.\u201d Mr. Clarke is donating a reclaimed former Patriot mountaintop mine to the state to build an industrial park.\u201cTom is a real visionary,\u201d said Robert McAtee, one of several coal industry veterans who have come to work with Mr. Clarke. \u201cHe stepped in when no one else would.\u201dMr. Clarke says he relies on the expertise of several seasoned coal executives to run his mining operations.But environmentalists worry that Mr. Clarke is breathing new life into a polluting industry and that he is incapable of handling the huge mess the coal companies have handed him. In August, several environmental groups granted Mr. Clarke an extension on a court order to treat polluted runoff from a former Patriot mine, saying his \u201cstart-up capital was less than expected.\u201dShould Mr. Clarke\u2019s company run into financial trouble, environmentalists worry that the cost of reclaiming the mines could fall to West Virginia taxpayers. Unlike Patriot, Mr. Clarke has few deep-pocketed Wall Street investors that the state could pressure to cover the costs, they say.\u201cThese are strange days,\u201d said Peter Morgan, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, who has been challenging the coal industry over water pollution issues for years. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Tom Clarke\u2019s intentions are. But I am skeptical he can pull it off.\u201dBankruptcy is like a chess game in which companies seek to minimize liabilities and creditors look to maximize profits. Over the years, Patriot has played like a grandmaster.The company was founded in October 2007 from a spinoff of the coal mining giant Peabody Energy. From the start, Patriot was loaded with liabilities.Peabody gave Patriot 13 percent of its coal reserves but 40 percent of its obligations to pay for health care for thousands of retired miners. In short, Patriot took over many of the company\u2019s unionized mining operations in Appalachia, while Peabody kept its nonunion operations in the West.\u201cThe legend in the coal fields is that Patriot was set up as a liability dump,\u201d said Kevin Barrett, a lawyer at Bailey & Glasser, who represents the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection in the coal bankruptcy cases. \u201cIt was destined to fail.\u201dIn a statement, Peabody said: \u201cPatriot Coal was highly successful when it became an independent, publicly traded company nearly a decade ago,\u201d adding that its market capitalization quadrupled in less than a year.But in July 2012, Patriot failed as predicted.A few weeks before it filed for bankruptcy, the company, which is based in St. Louis, took steps to improve its chances in court, according to the union. Patriot created two subsidiaries in New York City, allowing its case to be heard there. The United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan was viewed as favorable to corporations looking to cut their debts.After the coal miners\u2019 union objected, the case was moved to St. Louis.On that first trip through bankruptcy, Patriot was able to deal with its health care obligations after a separate fund was created to administer the benefits.Health care was not Patriot\u2019s only issue, though. The company faced huge costs for cleaning up selenium \u2014 a harmful coal byproduct \u2014 that was seeping into water sources downstream from its mines.While industries readily used bankruptcy to shed labor and pension obligations, it was unclear whether coal companies could do the same with reclamations and water remediation.In 1986, the Supreme Court blocked a New Jersey company from abandoning its oil waste processing plants in bankruptcy, citing a threat to public health and safety. But it was unclear whether the judges in the coal bankruptcy cases would rule that defunct mines posed the same pressing health threat.In the end, Patriot was able to emerge from its first bankruptcy without dealing with most of its environmental liabilities.By 2015, the American coal market was in a deep slide, as utilities and manufacturers increasingly turned to natural gas and demand from China cooled. One after another, mining companies, including Patriot, declared bankruptcy.\u201cEverybody knew what to expect in Round 2,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. \u201cThey would try to sell their best assets and leave their biggest environmental problems behind.\u201dThe Natural Bridge is a rocky arch towering 215 feet above a small creek in southwestern Virginia.Thomas Jefferson bought the property from King George III of England for 20 shillings. Today, it is owned by a nonprofit company started by Mr. Clarke. He bought the bridge in 2014, using a $9.1 million loan from the State of Virginia.Mr. Clarke planned to revitalize flagging ticket sales to the bridge, then hand over the property as a state park. But his plans ran into trouble early on. Visitors dwindled, and he defaulted on his state loan. He had to use proceeds from selling coal and land to help get caught up on his bills.In September, Mr. Clarke handed over management of Natural Bridge to the state. His nonprofit group, called the Virginia Conservation Legacy Fund, will still own the property until it pays back the loan. Some state officials praised Mr. Clarke\u2019s work preserving the property but also had to give him more time to pay back his debt.Mr. Clarke compares his struggles to those of the former president, who also ran into financial trouble at one point. \u201cI sort of felt like I am having my Jeffersonian moment,\u201d Mr. Clarke said.Relentlessly upbeat, with a near permanent smile and the soothing voice of a public radio announcer, Mr. Clarke has spent a career trying to turn around an eclectic assortment of companies. He has bought troubled nursing homes, a forest preserve in Belize and a restaurant in Roanoke, Va. \u2014 a \u201cphilanthropub\u201d that was supposed to dedicate its profit to Africa until it closed down in March 2015.In the 1990s, he turned one of his companies, Lenox Healthcare, into a $400-million-a-year business \u2014 one of the largest nursing home chains in the country. His former business partner at Lenox, Lawrence B. Cummings, called him a master at bolting together impossible business transactions. \u201cHe showed again and again an ability to put together deals that other people couldn\u2019t.\u201dLenox was a juggernaut, Mr. Clarke said, until it went bankrupt in 1999. Mr. Clarke said he began to rethink his life\u2019s goals. He went hiking in South America, where he met his wife, Ana, a native of Venezuela.They moved to Virginia, converted his remaining nursing homes to nonprofits and placed them under a new company, Kissito (pronounced kiss-E-tow) Healthcare. He became interested in poverty issues in Africa and began raising money and building a maternity hospital in Ethiopia.Mr. Clarke said he realized that many of the problems like drought and extreme floods in Africa were caused by climate change. Back in Virginia, Mr. Clarke said, he decided to take aim at the coal industry\u2019s contribution to carbon emissions.Too often, Mr. Clarke said, the debate over the future of coal is infected with what he called tribalism \u2014 a conviction that you are either with the mining industry, or against it. He said he was trying to find some middle ground.Mr. Clarke\u2019s first foray into the coal industry came when he took a job in late 2014 with Jim Justice, a wealthy West Virginia businessman who had built a fortune partly on coal. Mr. Clarke\u2019s job was to assist Mr. Justice and his Southern Coal Corporation in dealing with hundreds of environmental violations at mines across Appalachia.While results are difficult to track, some environmental groups acknowledge that Mr. Clarke\u2019s work had an appreciable impact on the Justice properties. A Democrat, Mr. Justice is running to become West Virginia\u2019s next governor. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment.One of Mr. Clarke\u2019s believers is Chandler Van Voorhis, a founder of C2I, a company outside Washington. C2I\u2019s business is planting trees. The trees soak up carbon dioxide, converting it to wood and leaves. An acre of trees can convert 156 tons of carbon over a 20-year period, Mr. Van Voorhis said.C2I plans to reforest a million acres in the southern Mississippi River Valley and sell the carbon offsets to companies to reach pollution-reduction goals. Together, Mr. Clarke and Mr. Van Voorhis sketched a plan to bundle C2I\u2019s carbon offsets with coal.Their plan faced some steep challenges including this one: There was no natural market for coal bundled with pollution credits because of its higher cost.Undaunted, Mr. Clarke hired an investment banker and lawyers to hatch his idea.\u201cWall Street\u2019s a pretty cynical place,\u201d said Tim Hess, a real estate developer in Virginia, who introduced Mr. Clarke to his banking contacts. \u201cBut when you see somebody with that kind of passion and integrity, if there\u2019s a way to make business sense out of it, I think people lean forward.\u201dPatriot Coal\u2019s executives and advisers first met Mr. Clarke around the start of the company\u2019s second bankruptcy case in May 2015.For this second bankruptcy filing, Patriot chose to file in Richmond, Va., where restructuring experts say some judges are eager to move large bankruptcy cases through quickly. The choice turned out to be a fortunate one.During the first day of bankruptcy hearings, Mr. Clarke said he happened to be in Richmond for a meeting with state officials when he wandered over to the federal courthouse. \u201cIt just amazed me how quickly they rushed through everything,\u201d Mr. Clarke recalled of the proceedings.The best mines would be sold to Blackhawk Mining, a coal company in Kentucky, which would run the properties with financing from some of Patriot\u2019s lenders. The less valuable mines would be placed in a separate \u201cliquidating trust.\u201d The sole purpose of that trust would be to clean up water pollution and reclaim the mines.West Virginia officials felt comfortable with this arrangement because they could pressure Patriot\u2019s hedge fund lenders to contribute money to the trust for reclamation work, said Mr. Barrett, the lawyer for West Virginia\u2019s environmental protection agency. Equally important, regulators could hold Patriot\u2019s top executives liable for completing the mine cleanup. If they failed, the government could deny them mining permits until the work was completed.\u201cIt was incredibly important to them personally, because these liabilities would follow them,\u201d Mr. Barrett said.But Mr. Clarke was proposing something else entirely. His nonprofit company would assume Patriot\u2019s environmental and reclamation obligations. And ultimately, the deal would release former executives from liability.At first, regulators and advisers to Patriot didn\u2019t know what to make of Mr. Clarke. He had no experience. He had no traditional bank financing. When he came to meet Patriot\u2019s management for the first time, he brought his young daughter with him. A company secretary watched her while he met with the executives for hours at the Charleston airport.Many people involved in the negotiations assumed that Mr. Clarke had the financial backing of Mr. Justice, but that wasn\u2019t the case.Initially, state regulators did not consider Mr. Clarke a realistic option. So when Patriot signaled last summer that it was going to make a deal with Mr. Clarke, Mr. Barrett said, \u201cwe were floored.\u201dShortly before a crucial court hearing, a major piece of Mr. Clarke\u2019s financing fell through. Patriot\u2019s lawyer and investment bankers scrambled to keep the deal from falling apart.In the end, Patriot agreed to effectively lend Mr. Clarke $5 million, and the coal miners\u2019 union also stepped in with money. Surety companies that had insured Patriot\u2019s reclamation obligations agreed to release millions in cash so Mr. Clarke could start the work.Regulators and environmental groups worried that if the state held up the deal, Patriot could threaten to liquidate its properties, leaving no money for reclamations.\u201cIt was the least bad outcome,\u201d Mr. Morgan of the Sierra Club said.Even if Mr. Clarke\u2019s venture proves short-lived, Mr. Morgan said, he has already completed a good deal of reclamation work. Mr. Clarke said his fund has spent about $28 million on the work to date.As insurance, Patriot\u2019s lenders contributed $12.5 million to backstop the reclamation work in case Mr. Clarke failed. The state also has some control over the account that Mr. Clarke uses to pay for reclamation work.For Mr. Clarke, the Patriot agreement opened the door to other deals. He took over reclamation obligations from Walter Energy, another mining company that had declared bankruptcy. He also picked up more viable mines and a coke processing plant from Walter. This spring, his company vied to take over an entire coal company, Alpha Natural Resources, but the bid was not accepted in the bankruptcy case.\u201cFor someone with zero experience to come into this complex and troubled industry proposing the sort of things he is proposing is astonishing,\u201d said Mr. McGinley, the law professor. \u201cI give him the benefit of the doubt. But I don\u2019t see where it is going.\u201dIt was raining when Mr. Clarke and a clutch of miners rode a cavernous elevator 734 feet down to the dank shafts of Federal mine No. 2 last spring. At the bottom, the men boarded trains that clanked and jerked along wooden tracks through a maze of silent tunnels, empty except for the occasional mouse scurrying. The trains passed emergency shelters and ventilation shafts pumping cool air from above.This is the miners\u2019 45-minute commute to the coal seam, where they shave off thousands of tons of black rock each week.\u201cI am proud of you,\u201d Mr. Clarke told some of the miners.As part of the deal with Patriot, the coal miners\u2019 union invested $10 million and took a 20 percent stake in the Federal mine, which Mr. Clarke says he is doing everything he can to keep open even though it doesn\u2019t break even.When he bought the Federal mine from Patriot, Mr. Clarke said he expected to sell its coal for at least $50 a ton. Recent shipments have sold for just above $40 a ton, he said. On some weeks, the mine has had to operate on a three-day schedule because of the low demand for thermal coal, which is used to produce electric power.Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, said the union expected production to improve at the mine when the broader coal market recovered.Still, Mr. Clarke\u2019s company has shifted away from thermal coal and is hunting for mines that produce the much more valuable metallurgical coal used in steel production. Last month, an ERP-affiliated company acquired a set of huge surface mines in British Columbia out of bankruptcy.Unlike many of the Patriot mines that Mr. Clarke acquired to clean up, these new mines are capable of pumping millions of tons of new coal onto the market each year and he\u2019s projecting big profits next year.Ultimately, Mr. Clarke hopes to offset all of the expected emissions from the coal he is producing with pollution credits. But right now, he is offsetting only 10 percent. That worries environmentalists. \u201cIt\u2019s all I can afford,\u201d he said.Mr. Clarke says he has been absorbing the costs personally until he can persuade utilities and steel mills to agree to pay for credits. He is hoping that states, led by West Virginia, will allow utilities to pass through the costs of his credits to ratepayers. Those discussions are continuing, he said.\u201cCoal isn\u2019t the villain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe villain is excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and we have to find ways to deal with it.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the businessman Tom Clarke\u2019s plan to cut carbon emissions by selling pollution credits with each ton of coal misstated the amount of time it takes an acre of trees to convert 156 tons of carbon. The process occurs over a period of 20 years, not in one year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Telescope to Seek Earthlike Planet in Alpha Centauri System", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byA scientific research consortium on Tuesday announced plans to build and launch a privately financed telescope the size of a small washing machine in hopes of finding an Earthlike planet in the Alpha Centauri system, one of our closest cosmic neighbors.To be built by the end of the decade, the telescope is the type of mission that NASA rarely undertakes, experts noted: tightly focused and cheap, leading to momentous discoveries \u2014 or possibly nothing at all.The two stars of the Alpha Centauri system are both similar to the sun, the closest such stars at 4.37 light-years away. The proposed telescope, with a mirror only about 20 inches across, would be able to make out Earth-size planets orbiting in the stars\u2019 so-called habitable zone, where temperatures are warm enough for liquid water to flow at the surface and, hypothetically, for life to thrive.NASA\u2019s Kepler mission has discovered more than 1,000 confirmed planets orbiting distant stars.But Proxima Centauri is much smaller and dimmer than our sun, and the planet, even if similar in size to Earth, would not be particularly Earthlike. It orbits much closer to the star, likely with one side perpetually in daylight and the other eternally dark. Because the planet is so close to its star, the proposed telescope would not be able to study it.So far, most exoplanets have been discovered indirectly, deduced by slight perturbations in the light traveling from a star \u2014 by a slight dimming when the exoplanet passes between its star and Earth, or by wobbles in the light\u2019s wavelengths caused by the gravitational pull of an unseen exoplanet.If astronomers could photograph a planet directly, they could start to look for specific wavelengths of light that serve as fingerprints of specific molecules. Detection of oxygen in the atmosphere would argue for photosynthesis and plants, for example.Dr. Morse said the proposed telescope, called Project Blue, would most likely cost $25 million to $50 million, perhaps one-third the cost of a NASA mission with similar goals. That is still a lot of money, and not easily raised.Crowdfunding through small individual donations might cover some of the early design work, he said, but \u201cwe do have to approach high-net-worth individuals and foundations.\u201d Participating institutions, like the SETI Institute and the University of Massachusetts Lowell, could also offer in-kind contributions to the project rather than cash.The idea of a telescope pointed at Alpha Centauri is not new. Ruslan Belikov, a scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., has been working for years as principal investigator on the Alpha Centauri Exoplanet Satellite, or ACESat, developing the technology needed to pick out planets in a binary star system.The ACESat project has not won NASA approval, however. Eduardo Bendek, ACESat\u2019s deputy principal investigator, estimated that there was a 15 percent chance that there are no planets in the habitable zones of the two Alpha Centauri stars. \u201cNASA is very averse to that risk,\u201d he said.To reduce the chances of discovering nothing, the ACESat team proposed a mission that would examine not just Alpha Centauri but also a few other nearby stars. But expanding the mission \u2014 plus other considerations to reduce risks \u2014 increased the price tag.Dr. Belikov and Dr. Bendek declined to provided specific figures, but said the total budget fit under the required $175 million cost cap when they submitted the proposal to NASA\u2019s Small Explorer astrophysics program in 2014.Instead, NASA selected three other missions for further study. ACESat remains unbuilt, and the next opportunity to submit a proposal is most likely in 2019, Dr. Belikov and Dr. Bendek said.\u201cI can\u2019t speak for NASA,\u201d Dr. Beikov said, \u201cbut speaking personally, I\u2019m excited about the possibility of doing space missions privately.\u201dSo far, privately financed space missions have met with limited success. Competitors in the Google Lunar X Prize, to send the first private spacecraft to the moon, have had trouble finding backers. Planetary Resources, a Seattle company aiming to mine asteroids, withdrew a plan for a crowdfunded space telescope, sending back contributions collected on Kickstarter.Another project, Lunar Mission One, intended to send a robotic lander to the moon\u2019s south pole, successfully raised about $1 million via Kickstarter, but probably needs more than 600 times as much to pull it off.BoldlyGo is also pursuing two more ambitious projects \u2014 a larger space telescope, and a spacecraft to collect samples from the Martian atmosphere and bring them back to Earth \u2014 that have not yet gotten off the ground.Dr. Morse, who once ran NASA\u2019s astrophysics division, agrees that Project Blue will not be easy, but says it is possible. For more than a century, he notes, astronomers have relied on the generosity of rich benefactors.\u201cAll we\u2019re doing is borrowing the model that ground-based astronomy has been using literally since the time of John Quincy Adams,\u201d Dr. Morse said. \u201cWe think that quest is worthy, and we\u2019re going to try to do it with private funding.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about plans to build and launch a privately financed telescope to look for an Earthlike planet in the Alpha Centauri system misstated the size of the mirror of the ACESat telescope proposed by scientists at the NASA Ames Research Center. It is 18 inches in diameter, not 59.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let the Lessee Beware: Car Leases Can Be the Most Binding of Contracts", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byWheelsWHEN Allie Mangel learned that she was losing some of her vision because of a rare condition called Susac\u2019s Syndrome, the last thing on her mind was figuring out how to make her car lease payments.After her doctor notified the California Department of Motor Vehicles last November that she should not be allowed to drive, and her license was subsequently suspended, leasing a Ford Edge at $347 a month became an unnecessary expense.Or so she thought.Ms. Mangel, 24, a youth programming coordinator in San Diego, discovered that even though she was not legally allowed to drive, she was still legally obligated to make her lease payments.\u201cFord Credit and the dealer told me that the only way I could get out of the lease was to die or join the military,\u201d Ms. Mangel said.She had learned the hard way what many people may not realize, even though leasing has become an increasingly common and seemingly affordable alternative to buying a car. A car lease agreement is like any other contract. And unless specific reasons are stated in the agreement allowing the lessee to end the lease, the signer must make the payments, whether one can drive or not.After her diagnosis, Ms. Mangel was in the hospital for three weeks and out of work for a total of five, and running short of money.\u201cI was a mess,\u201d Ms. Mangel recalled. \u201cI was going through all these things and Ford would not budge. I was in tears and didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201dMs. Mangel had signed a lease agreement spelling out the terms of the contract, and ending the lease early without penalty was not covered.The rules are the rules, according to Margaret Mellott, a spokeswoman for Ford Motor Credit.\u201cAll Ford Credit lease agreements state very clearly the obligations when one turns in a car before the end of a lease agreement,\u201d Ms. Mellott said. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any exceptions being made.\u201dFord Credit and most other vehicle leasing companies do give lessees options for breaking the contract. But the terms can be severe.Ms. Mangel could have returned the vehicle to the dealer, and then paid the difference between the amount owed on her payments and the value of the car if sold at auction. In her case, that would have been an unbearable burden: about $15,000.Or she could have tried to sell her lease to a third party through a lease-swapping company. But with membership and lease transfer fees, that would have also cost her more than she could afford.\u201cA friend tried to do that,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cand he received no interest after it being listed for weeks.\u201dSome lessors may demand payment of all the remaining payments, plus penalties. If the lessee decides simply to walk away from the lease and have the vehicle repossessed, the person\u2019s credit rating will suffer.Leasing a vehicle, of course, is not the same as purchasing one. Rather, it\u2019s more akin to renting an apartment; as with any rental, one never actually owns the property.Under a vehicle lease, the lessee agrees to make payments for a fixed number of years. Those payments equal the difference between the agreed-upon value of the car when first leased and its predicted residual wholesale value at the end of the lease, plus interest.Because the entire value of the car is not being financed, the payments are less on a monthly basis than they would be if the vehicle were purchased over the same period. That is a main reason that leasing is so popular: It lets consumers drive cars that are more expensive than those they might be able to afford to buy.When the vehicle is returned at the end of the lease, the only additional costs are those incurred if the vehicle was driven more than the maximum agreed-upon mileage, any amount due for damage beyond normal wear and tear, and any turn-in fees. The lessee may also decide to purchase the vehicle, for that contracted residual value.One reason car leases tend to be so inflexible is that the deal is a three-party contract: The dealer signs the lease with the customer, and then assigns the contract to a leasing company. Leases can be voided if the original agreement was made under untruthful conditions \u2014 if the lessee is a minor, for example, or does not possess a valid driver\u2019s license. In those cases, the leasing company would not want to be part of a fraudulent contract.\u201cThis is not as rare as one would think \u2014 people do fraudulent deals all the time,\u201d said Randall McCathren, managing director of the Association of Consumer Vehicle Lessors, a trade group.In addition, if the lease terms or the vehicle was misrepresented, the lessee can try to void the lease under each state\u2019s laws on unfair and deceptive acts and practices, Mr. McCathren said.But in a legally struck deal, even death will not necessarily free one from a lease obligation. Typically, the dead person\u2019s estate becomes liable for the obligation, although some car finance companies will make exceptions.Still, it never hurts to try to seek concessions.\u201cIt absolutely pays to contact the leaseholder and try to work out some consideration,\u201d Mr. McCathren said. He noted that leasing companies will typically defer payments if a lessee is in the hospital for a limited period of time.Only one action will guarantee that someone is able to break any company\u2019s vehicle lease. Under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a person who has enlisted in the armed services and is to be assigned to a location outside the continental United States for more than six months can terminate a vehicle lease without penalty.But for those who are not joining the military, the best bet for getting out of a vehicle lease is to try to sell it to a third party.Companies like Leasetrader.com and Swapalease.com act as brokers, and for a fee will try to match lease sellers and buyers.Some leasing companies, including Ford Motor Credit and Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, will allow a lease obligation to be forgiven upon the death of the lessee. Under Mercedes\u2019s Customer Bereavement Program, when the company learns of the death of a lessee, it sends a condolence letter to the family, as well as a leather journal and pen to help it manage the estate\u2019s obligations.If the Mercedes lease account is current, the family can choose to return the vehicle within 10 days and owe nothing further. If the family decides to keep leasing the vehicle and the new lessee meets credit criteria, no transfer fee is charged.Ford Motor Credit\u2019s Peace of Mind program allows the family of a deceased lessee, with a death certificate, to return the vehicle within 60 days of the death, and the lease obligation will be excused. Notifying the company of the death also prevents any company collection activity over the next several weeks.Ms. Mangel, as things turned out, was more fortunate than she had expected.

Investing? Interest rates? I think the Fed does something important? Totally lost on me. I am aware that these things exist, but that is the extent of my financial acumen.Not good. But there is help. Let\u2019s meet Ron Lieber.(This chat has been edited and condensed.)Now, about those percentages. Ten percent is a pretty good number for people in their 20s. And if your employer offers a matching contribution (tossing some money in, up to a certain point), that 10 percent might effectively turn into 12 percent or 14 percent, which is really good.Some people do invest outside of their retirement accounts, but I\u2019d probably focus more on putting that money away for retirement or use it for paying down student loans, perhaps.The most important thing \u2014 LET\u2019S USE THE ALL-CAPS KEY HERE \u2014 do not mess around with credit card rewards unless you\u2019re paying your bill on time (every month) and in full (every month). Late fees and interest charges will cost you more than you\u2019ll gain from any card reward.But there\u2019s some pretty good evidence that people who do all their everyday spending on cards spend more than they would if they used cash.The card industry is trying reallllly hard to get you to use credit instead of debit. Why? Two reasons. 1) The merchants pay more to the banks to accept their credit cards than they do to accept their debit cards, in general. 2) If you spend more than you have, then you start paying interest. Ergo, more profit for the banks than if you used debit.They want you to lose. And I want you to be an unprofitable customer \u2014 in everything, always. It\u2019s the mission of my column \u2014 all Your Money readers are above average!Thank you so much for doing this chat, Ron.

{"Headline": "Used Cars Slip Past Recall Safeguards, Putting Drivers in Danger", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byThe outdoor lot of Mr. Z Towing in Flushing, Queens, looked like an automotive graveyard.A beat-up Pontiac Grand Prix, one of 20 towed or abandoned cars that the New York City Department of Finance was auctioning on Tuesday, came with a Popeyes fried chicken box on its dashboard. Others were scuffed and dented. The cars did not even have keys.The airbag defect claimed another life last month, a 50-year-old Riverside, Calif., woman whose 2001 Honda Civic had been sold three times at auto auctions much like the one in Queens, before her son bought it from an acquaintance. The woman, Delia Robles, was on her way to get a flu shot when her car collided with a pickup truck.The death has highlighted a group of drivers especially vulnerable to dangerous vehicles: second, third or even fourth owners, who purchased their vehicles in transactions far removed from the protections offered to buyers of new cars.There is no explicit federal requirement that sellers of used cars fix problems related to safety recalls, or even disclose the recalls, the way new-car dealers must. Efforts to introduce tougher laws for used cars have languished in Congress, under lobbying pressure from the used-car industry.Auctions, whether by governments or dealers, represent the least regulated rung of the industry, often dealing in higher-risk cars that are sold to the most vulnerable consumers, said Bernard Brown, a consumer protection lawyer in Kansas City, Mo., who has closely followed auto auction companies.\u201cAuctions are where dealers who would be uncomfortable selling damaged and defective cars directly to their customers will unload to other dealers who do want to sell them,\u201d he said.\u201cIt would typically be dealers who sell to the less educated, less car-savvy, poorer, English-challenged, credit-challenged consumers,\u201d Mr. Brown said.While the country\u2019s largest trade groups for sellers of used vehicles say they encourage their members to disclose and fix recalled vehicles, they stop short of requiring it.\u201cWe certainly advise, from a best-practices standpoint, that if a fix is available then our dealers follow that process,\u201d said Shaun Petersen, a senior vice president at the National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, a trade group whose members include used-car dealers. \u201cAnd if a fix is not available, then certainly it\u2019s in your best interest and best practice to disclose.\u201dMs. Robles\u2019s son, Jose Contreras, 26, bought his mother\u2019s car a year ago from Ivan Henderson, a man he met playing pool.Last month, during a fender-bender, the car\u2019s airbag exploded, propelling metal parts that killed Ms. Robles, who worked the 5 a.m. shift as a breakfast attendant at a Hampton Inn.\u201cShe was my best friend,\u201d Mr. Contreras said of his mother, in text messages, from his home in Riverside. \u201cHer grandkids were her world.\u201dHonda said it had sent out more than 20 notices since that model was first recalled in 2008, warning that its driver-side airbag could rupture.Instead of being fixed, the Honda was resold at least three times since the recall \u2014 at auctions in 2010 and in 2015, then by Mr. Henderson, who bought the car at an auction then sold it to Mr. Contreras for $2,100.The estimated trade-in value of Ms. Robles\u2019s car, which had clocked 139,000 miles, was about $1,450, assuming it was in fair condition, according to Kelley Blue Book.Safety advocates say that Mr. Henderson and the sellers before him should never have sold a recalled car without disclosing the defect or getting the airbag replaced at a Honda dealer at no cost to the owner.Vendors like Carfax also provide detailed car history reports for a fee.Despite the lack of explicit federal laws on recalled used cars, a patchwork of state consumer protections and laws already effectively prohibits the sale of dangerous vehicles, some safety advocates and lawyers say.\u201cAnytime they conceal a material defect, that\u2019s fraud,\u201d said Rosemary Shahan, the president of the nonprofit Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety.But in New York State, government agencies are exempt from the \u201cas is\u201d rule, providing a loophole for the city\u2019s Department of Finance auctions.Some companies like CarMax, one of the country\u2019s largest used-car dealers, advertise that their vehicles pass rigorous safety tests \u2014 even if the cars have unrepaired problems for which recalls have been issued. CarMax says it discloses recalls.Still, Ms. Shahan and others argue, advertising a recalled vehicle as safe is misleading.The vast universe of used-vehicle sales has created challenges for reaching owners of recalled vehicles, said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Though automakers are required by law to make an effort to contact a car\u2019s current owner about a recall, the owners of used cars that have changed hands several times can be hard to track down.\u201cThe people who own 15-year-old vehicles don\u2019t generally have a direct relationship with the dealers,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cHow do you get to those people? Is the address data up-to-date?\u201d And, he said, do they know that fixing recalls is free?The task is especially critical for defective Takata airbags, which contain a compound that breaks down over time, making them increasingly prone to rupturing.Defective airbags made by Takata have been tied to 12 deaths and more than 180 injuries in the United States alone. The ensuing recall \u2014 the largest in automotive history \u2014 has turned out to be messy, confusing and frustrating for car owners.But the cars were being sold \u201cas is,\u201d even if they were under recall, the auctioneer, Dennis Alestra, announced through a loudspeaker. \u201cAll sales are final,\u201d he warned.The city checks whether cars have been stolen or salvaged but does not look at whether a car has been recalled, said Patrick Edwards, a Department of Finance official. \u201cWe\u2019re not responsible for any safety issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAll buyers, the risk is on them.\u201dIn a statement, Sonia Alleyne, a spokeswoman for the department, said that protecting consumers was a \u201cpriority\u201d and that the agency was \u201copen to working with state lawmakers to improve\u201d the auction process.Juan Carlos, a retired mechanical engineer who had his eye on a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan, knew to be wary. \u201cThese cars are from the street,\u201d he said, \u201cso you\u2019re taking a chance.\u201dBut Mr. Henderson, who bought the car that killed Ms. Robles in California, said he was shocked to learn only after her death about the car\u2019s safety issues.He bought the car at a wholesale auction run by Manheim, part of Cox Automotive, which also runs the vehicle research and valuation company Kelley Blue Book.\u201cThey just said \u2018as is,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI knew nothing about the car.\u201dA spokesman for Manheim, which processes 7.5 million cars a year, said the company encouraged sellers to disclose recall information. There was \u201cno realistic way\u201d for the company to force dealers to disclose safety defects, said the spokesman, Chintan Talati.Honda said it had been looking for the car\u2019s owner.On top of the 20 mailed notifications, the automaker made more than 90 phone calls to the vehicle\u2019s previous owners, a Honda spokesman, Chris Martin, said.And while Honda said it had sent recall notices to two addresses associated with Ms. Robles, Mr. Contreras said he did not know about them. Honda said it had been unable to find Ms. Robles\u2019s phone number.Honda never managed to elicit a response from Ms. Robles. When she drove to a clinic to get a flu shot on her day off last month, she hit a Chevy pickup that turned in her path.It was an accident that Ms. Robles should have walked away from. But her airbag ruptured violently.She was taken to a nearby hospital but later died from her wounds, according to the Riverside Police Department. She left behind three children and three grandchildren.\u201cShe had just such a bright spirit,\u201d said Monica Sanchez, front office manager at the Hampton Inn where Ms. Robles had worked for five years.Ms. Robles had come to know the regulars, Ms. Sanchez said, including one guest whom she greeted every morning with a bowl of strawberries, which he liked to eat.After the accident, the hotel staff made a photo collage of Ms. Robles. It hangs near the kitchen, for all the guests to see.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

Carter said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThat means treating them fairly and equitably, honoring their service and sacrifice, and keeping our word.\u201dNearly all of the soldiers took the bonuses in good faith and were unaware of the misspending until notices arrived in the mail years later.Some had to repay more than $20,000 and a few more than $40,000. Many had wages garnished and racked up penalties and other debt trying to pay back the bonuses.\u201cIt is unthinkable to me that the Department of Defense\u2019s first reaction is to punish service members who fulfilled their end of the deal,\u201d Brian Duffy, the national commander of the 1.7-million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a statement. \u201cThis is how you destroy all faith in a Pentagon that is supposed to have your back.\u201dMr. Carter said Wednesday that he had ordered his department \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d to temporarily cease all efforts to collect on the debts. The Pentagon plans to set up a finance team by January to review cases. The team would offer \u201ca streamlined, centralized process that ensures the fair and equitable treatment of our service members and the rapid resolution of these cases,\u201d Mr. Carter said.\u201cUltimately, we will provide for a process that puts as little burden as possible on any soldier who received an improper payment through no fault of his or her own,\u201d Mr. Carter added. \u201cAt the same time, it will respect our important obligation to the taxpayer.\u201dThe National Guard initially said nearly 10,000 soldiers were affected, but the Pentagon said Wednesday that the number was closer to 2,000.Audits prompted by the criminal case turned up thousands of soldiers who had improperly received cash incentives. But many of the cases were technicalities, such as a sergeant who had received a bonus for re-enlisting as a biomedical repair specialist, but was then involuntarily deployed as a supply specialist and was stuck repaying a $10,000 bonus.Guard members began receiving collection notices in 2012. Some refused to pay. Some sued. Still others were pushed into financial distress by payment notices demanding more than $1,000 a month, and racked up late fees and interest.In 2014, the National Guard asked Congress to pass a law forgiving some of the debt, but Congress balked at the cost. Since the Los Angeles Times article was published, however, top lawmakers have lined up to demand a fix.Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, who served in the Marine Corps in Iraq and Afghanistan, called the repayment policy \u201cdisgraceful and insulting.\u201dIn a letter to Mr. Carter, he added, \u201cI ask that you utilize your authority to influence a solution, including a possible legislative fix if determined necessary, that\u2019s in the best interest of the individuals and families impacted.\u201dMajor veterans groups demanded that the Pentagon not only stop collecting on the bonuses, but also reimburse what soldiers had repaid.\u201cIt is unthinkable that these brave Americans who stepped forward when others did not after the 9/11 attacks are being left high and dry by their leadership,\u201d said Paul Rieckhoff, the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. \u201cThe fact that our government would ask for it to be repaid with interest is simply unacceptable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How an Aesthete\u2019s Eye Can Help a Doctor\u2019s Hand", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byFor eight years, Bonnie Pitman has been battling a rare, incurable lung infection. Frequent hospitalizations took such a toll on her that she had to step down from her dream job as director of the Dallas Museum of Art, and she uses a breathing apparatus to open her airways several times a day.Some might find her condition utterly discouraging. But in days filled with medical care, Ms. Pitman has found uplift from art, leading her to redirect her more than 40 years of experience as a museum educator and leader toward extending the influence of art on the practice of medicine.\u201cThe hardest part of being chronically ill is that you\u2019re not in control of your body,\u201d Ms. Pitman said. \u201cBut you can control your spirit.\u201dMs. Pitman is widely viewed as a galvanizing force in the fledgling \u2014 and still debated \u2014 field of medical humanities programs, which promote the close observation of artworks as a way of improving the clinical diagnostic skills of medical students. Collaborations between doctors and art educators have multiplied in recent years, despite lingering skepticism from people in both professions.For the last two years, Ms. Pitman has taught an observation course in partnership with a doctor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School and with educators at the Dallas Museum of Art, where she resigned as director in 2011. And after researching the range of such collaborations nationwide, Ms. Pitman brought together 130 educators and doctors involved in 60 programs to share their teaching strategies and evaluation methods at a conference she organized in June at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\u201cIt\u2019s a launching pad,\u201d Ms. Pitman said. \u201cI see this as one of the most important changes in the way art museums can interact with their publics and that medical schools can utilize community resources.\u201dAddressing the gathering at MoMA on the first morning, Ms. Pitman spoke of how more sophisticated imaging techniques, lab tests and computers have diminished direct observational interaction between doctors and patients. \u201cIn my very extensive time in the hospital, residents using iPads would interview me and leave and never even look at me in the eye,\u201d she said.Dr. Bhavika Kaul, who took an observation course as a student and now jointly teaches it at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, credited art observation with helping her catch a patient\u2019s misdiagnosis during her residency. \u201cWhen I walked in the room, the first thing I noticed was the patient, who had been in the hospital without sun exposure, was 10 shades darker than her family members,\u201d she said. \u201cI immediately diagnosed her with adrenal insufficiency.\u201d\u201cThe course had taught me to see beyond just the vital signs and the labs,\u201d she recalled.Ms. Pitman mapped out the second day of her conference around interactive teaching demonstrations in the galleries at MoMA, the Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At MoMA, Dr. Katz led an exercise intended to improve communication in patients\u2019 medical teams.Participants were asked to find a work of art that reflected a professional or personal value that they held dear and to share the stories with one another as they moved between artworks like a medical team on rounds. \u201cIt opens up conversations that might not happen in the context of the hospital, moments of connection and commonality,\u201d said Corinne Zimmerman, Dr. Katz\u2019s partner from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.Many doctors spoke of the continuing difficulty of getting support for art programs from hard-nosed scientific faculty members at medical schools. Dr. Katz finances his programs largely with money raised from grateful patients.Joel Howell, a professor at the University of Michigan Medical School, in Ann Arbor, said, \u201cI\u2019ve been asked what is the return on investment by a senior leader of our medical school.\u201d To persuade skeptics, Dr. Howell said, data is needed that goes beyond the evaluations completed by students who opt to take the classes.Also advocating more rigorous research is Jay Baruch, director of the clinical arts and humanities program at Brown University\u2019s medical school, who cautions against overselling the courses\u2019 benefits.\u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for us to say we\u2019re going to make students more empathetic by spending time in the art museum,\u201d he said. \u201cI count on their families, their religious groups, the furry creatures in the forest to make them empathetic.\u201dIf the clear goal of these programs for the medical schools is to make better doctors, some might ask what the goal is for the museums. \u201cThis creates new narratives for us to think about in the use of our collections that moves beyond art history,\u201d Ms. Pitman said with the cheerful determination of an evangelist.\u201cThe stories of being born, aging, dying \u2014 for art museums, it\u2019s a very powerful bridge to the audiences that we serve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wells Fargo Isn\u2019t the Only Firm That Needs a Lesson", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byFair GameUnder siege for setting up thousands of phony customer accounts to generate fees, Wells Fargo has taken a beating in Congress and the court of public opinion. Several states have piled on, announcing that they are temporarily cutting their business ties with the bank.Using the power of the purse to hold a wayward behemoth to account is a good thing. But if state officials want to teach financial firms a lesson in honesty, why stop at Wells Fargo?Many other big players in finance need this kind of instruction, too. For example, securities regulators have accused some of the nation\u2019s top private equity firms of putting their interests ahead of their clients\u2019. Why don\u2019t state pension officials refuse to do business with them?In settling the case, Apollo agreed to return fees of $40.3 million to clients. By contrast, Wells Fargo returned improper fees of $2.6 million.I asked Apollo if it had received flak of any kind from its public pension fund clients after the S.E.C.\u2019s findings. Charles Zehren, its spokesman, declined to comment.But in an Aug. 23 letter to clients, Apollo played down the S.E.C.\u2019s action. It said the problematic practice was common in private equity and that it had disclosed fee specifics to advisory committees at each fund. \u201cIt is important to recognize that Apollo did not admit to any wrongdoing in this settlement,\u201d it said.That may well be. But consider the steps being taken against Wells Fargo for its offenses.Because Mr. Chiang sits on the Calpers board, I thought he might want to suspend its business dealings with Apollo. After all, Calpers has a fiduciary duty to public employees whose retirement accounts it manages. It invested $800 million in Apollo Fund VII, a portfolio cited in the S.E.C. enforcement action.In an email to Mr. Chiang\u2019s office, I asked whether he\u2019d put Apollo into the penalty box as he\u2019s done with Wells Fargo. No response. O.K. What about the other public pension fund officials who invest with Apollo? They, too, are charged with ensuring that the retirements of teachers, sanitation workers and bus drivers are managed with integrity. After Apollo\u2019s fiduciary breaches, will they stop investing with the firm?I asked this of the 13 public pension funds that, like Calpers, had invested at least $100 million in the Apollo VII portfolio. That list included funds benefiting teachers in California, Illinois, Ohio and Texas; public employee retirement systems in Colorado, Florida, Maryland, New York state, Oregon and Wisconsin, and funds benefiting firefighters and police officers in New York City.Some funds didn\u2019t respond; one declined to comment. And some said they had responded to the S.E.C. case by increasing their demands for fee transparency from Apollo and other investment managers. That\u2019s not enough to move the accountability needle.Others like Calpers and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System told me they were monitoring the Apollo situation. Fine, but isn\u2019t that their job?Matthew Sweeney, a spokesman for the New York State comptroller and overseer of the Common Retirement Fund, seemed to indicate that assessing an investment firm\u2019s potential return took a higher priority than weighing a manager\u2019s integrity.\u201cThe fund will continue to review all investment opportunities based on their ability to meet its standards of risk and return,\u201d he said in a statement. Apollo says that the VII fund has had strong returns since its inception in 2008.In response to my questions, other pension officials said that some ethical flaws were to be expected or that Apollo had been transparent about its fees. \u201cGiven the size and breadth of our portfolio and our investment manager network, it is likely that there will be occasional lapses,\u201d Dennis D. MacKee, spokesman for the Florida Board of Administration, said in a statement. \u201cTo the extent these occur, the forthrightness with which they are addressed, both to remedy any damage done and prevent recurrence, is what we focus on,\u201d he said.The view these fiduciaries took on Apollo\u2019s breach could not be clearer: There\u2019s nothing here. Move along.Neither is there evidence that Apollo is having difficulty raising money. On a conference call last month, Scott Martin Kleinman, Apollo\u2019s lead partner of private equity, said that a new fund, Apollo VIII, had been a hit with investors. \u201cThe feedback we\u2019re getting is folks are very, very pleased,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should assume pretty soon, we\u2019re going to be getting ready to go with Fund IX.\u201dSo let\u2019s recap. In the Wells Fargo case, bad behavior generated $2.6 million in improper fees that the bank had to return to customers. In the Apollo matter, bad behavior generated $40.3 million in improper fees that the firm had to return to clients. Wells Fargo was subject to a major spanking by two state officials. Apollo was subject to none.Prosecutors have failed to hold financial firms accountable in recent years, stoking a perception that the system is rigged in favor of big and powerful entities that generate immense wealth for their executives. That pension fund officials are also failing only confirms that view.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

Nikki Haley of South Carolina said on Sunday that she had lifted evacuation orders for four counties, including Charleston.But residents in four other counties \u2014 Beaufort, Georgetown, Horry and Jasper \u2014 were still urged to stay away.\u201cWe had a lot of rain, for many hours,\u201d said Capt. Bob Bromage, the public information officer for the Sheriff\u2019s Department in Beaufort County, southwest of Charleston. \u201cWe had flooding, we may have had some surge that we\u2019re not aware of yet, we have downed trees, we have reports of downed trees on houses already.\u201dGov. Rick Scott of Florida said on Saturday that the state had suffered \u201cunbelievable amounts of beach erosion,\u201d as well as damaged roads, flooding and felled trees.But Mr. Scott, who flew along the coastline to survey storm damage, said the storm\u2019s consequences could have been far worse.\u201cThe first thing we can say is we are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,\u201d he said. \u201cI worried the whole time that even though the track was off our coast, that it would turn in and have a direct hit at some point.\u201dState and local officials said they were trying to expedite recovery.\u201cWe\u2019re going to ride each other hard,\u201d said Lenny Curry, the mayor of Jacksonville. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ride our utilities, we\u2019re going to ride all of our workers to get this community back together as quickly and as safely as possible.Still, Mayor Charlie Latham of Jacksonville Beach asked for patience.Why do weather agencies and the news media keep getting the forecasts so wrong and overstate the severity of hurricanes? Is this some kind of insurance liability issue, where they are afraid of getting sued if they don\u2019t paint a \u2018doomsday\u2019 picture? \u2014 JimThe conservative approach isn\u2019t about liability, Jim, it\u2019s about saving lives. The storm track that Matthew has followed has been well within the range of possibilities that the National Hurricane Center has been talking about all along. This is still a dangerous storm, and just because some stretches of the Florida coast have not been hit as catastrophically as was possible, that does not mean the rest of Florida or Georgia or South Carolina are in the clear.Marshall Shepherd, the director of Atmospheric Sciences Program, University of Georgia, has been fiercely defending the warnings on Twitter, and I\u2019ll let him do the talking here:Chris W. Landsea, science and operations officer for the National Hurricane Center, said that while the storm has weakened somewhat, it is now spread over a larger area, and \u201ca larger hurricane can cause more storm surge,\u201d and a larger wind field; the wind damage, in other words, can be felt over a larger area. So a slightly weaker but larger storm is \u201ckind of a wash, as far as impacts,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But if the Federal Reserve pushes rates higher and if the debt markets turn more volatile, then the money available to finance such big-ticket acquisitions will become more expensive.And if cheap credit starts to fade away, that would be expensive to AT&T. Currently, the company will need to refinance about $9 billion a year, Moody\u2019s estimates.But AT&T can easily handle its current debt load. The company has an investment grade rating, meaning it is perceived to be among the healthiest companies, with a smaller probability of default.Despite the size of the Time Warner purchase, AT&T says it will have no trouble taking on the additional debt. The two companies say that as they become integrated, they will be able to bring down the ratio of net debt to 2.5 times the combined entity\u2019s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, at the end of the first year after closing. That would be only slightly higher than AT&T\u2019s current leverage.And that modest increase may not penalize the company much, said Walter Piecyk, a telecommunications analyst with BTIG.\u201cThis thirst for yield has provided very cheap cash, which they\u2019ll be able to use to finance this deal even with an increase in leverage,\u201d Mr. Piecyk said in a telephone interview.In the takeover of Time Warner \u2014 the parent company of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. \u2014 AT&T plans to use its own stock to fund half of the $85.4 billion purchase price, and will spend some of its cash on hand and issue new debt for the rest of it.AT&T and Time Warner said in their announcement that they expected the deal to close before the end of next year. Shareholders, the Justice Department and possibly the Federal Communications Commission would need to approve the deal.AT&T has an 18-month commitment for an unsecured bridge loan representing about $40 billion. JPMorgan Chase accounts for about $25 billion of that, according to people who have been briefed on the terms. Bank of America is handling the remaining $15 billion, these people said.These loan commitments, however, are more like insurance policies, and not intended to be used. AT&T will seek new debt closer to when the deal closes. That may not be for another year or so, creating some interest rate risk if there is a big change in the markets.\u201cThey\u2019ve gone to the ends of the earth to raise debt already,\u201d Mr. Stodden of Moody\u2019s said. \u201cBut how much more capacity does the market have is a good question.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But voters should not assume that the candidates are equally capable of delivering results.The ability of any president to carry out a plan for repairs and new projects costing hundreds of billions of dollars depends on how the plan meshes with the administration\u2019s other tax and spending proposals. An infrastructure overhaul cannot be done in isolation.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach has a shot at doing some good; Donald Trump\u2019s approach would be fiscally untenable.Of course, Mr. Trump claims that his tax cuts would largely pay for themselves by unleashing economic growth of 4 percent annually. That goal is well above the roughly 2 percent to 3 percent average of the past 50 years and, even under the rosiest assumptions, would be achievable only by increasing the labor force through more immigration, which Mr. Trump clearly opposes.To avoid the large deficits that would result from the combination of tax cuts and more borrowing, Mr. Trump would have to make brutal spending cuts in other areas of the budget. Another problem is that enormous borrowing could attract foreign investors to American debt. The downside would be a stronger dollar that would make American exports less attractive, thereby increasing the trade deficit \u2014 precisely what Mr. Trump has been railing against.There\u2019s an indisputable need for investment in America\u2019s aging infrastructure.

{"Headline": "Even Math Teachers Are at a Loss to Understand Annuities", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byPublic SacrificeEven a well-caffeinated person with an advanced degree in math would have a hard time deciphering a 53-page contract called \u201cYour Flexible Premium Indexed and Declared Interest Deferred Annuity Policy.\u201dMelanie Panush Lindert, a 66-year-old elementary school dance teacher in Los Angeles, was sold one of these mind-numbingly complex products last year through her workplace retirement account. The same agent had sold her three other annuity contracts over the previous eight years, including another within her retirement savings plan \u2014 a so-called 403(b) \u2014 which is offered to employees of public schools, colleges, religious groups and nonprofits.Annuities can be hard to fully grasp even in their simplest configuration, where you hand a pile of money to an insurance company, then receive a guaranteed stream of annual income for life. But schoolteachers and other people doing good works are often left to trudge through a morass of contracts tied to some of the most arcane investments, sold by representatives who may not fully understand the inner workings themselves.It \u201cseemed like a good way to make more money,\u201d said Ms. Lindert, who started teaching when she was 53 and said she hoped to retire next year. For now, she teaches five classes a day, three days a week, to elementary schoolchildren at three schools. She brings her own speakers, drums, scarves and an iPod with 400 hours of music, along with a light lunch.Certain types of annuities can serve as a useful retirement tool for some savers seeking a stream of guaranteed income. But many teachers already receive pensions providing a steady income base.The type of annuity in Ms. Lindert\u2019s account, a so-called fixed index annuity, is particularly complex. In theory, these are appealing: They provide a guaranteed minimum interest rate; they let investors participate in the market\u2019s gains up to a certain ceiling; and they promise that buyers will not lose money when the market dives.Still, how do investors know whether the product is appropriate for them?\u201cNo agent selling these or investors buying these has the foggiest idea of how these work,\u201d said Mr. McCann, who reviewed Ms. Lindert\u2019s contracts.But indexed annuities have to make sense for at least some investors, right? Perhaps for the incredibly risk averse? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, without hesitation. \u201cNever.\u201dThough it appears that investors have some exposure to the stock market, he says many are left with a return they could have achieved with a supersafe bond portfolio, without paying an obscured 2.5 to 3 percent annual fee charged by the annuity provider. \u201cThey are all Rube Goldberg machines,\u201d he said.In her case, Ms. Lindert was advised to annuitize her first contract \u2014 which paid a minimum interest rate of 3 percent \u2014 and direct the stream of income into the new annuity, which paid a minimum of 1 percent. The other investment options provided were also far less generous \u2014 shockingly so, Mr. McCann added. \u201cThis switch is really awful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good for the insurance company. But it\u2019s really bad for the investor.\u201dThe new policy did include a so-called guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit \u2014 for an additional fee of 0.7 percent annually \u2014 which promises a certain level of lifetime income. But Mr. McCann said his analysis found that the new policy was still less valuable than the first.Then, there\u2019s the matter of surrender charges. Ms. Lindert would have owed a penalty for 15 years after signing her original contract \u2014 set on a sliding scale starting at 14 percent \u2014 if she wanted to withdraw more than 10 percent of her account\u2019s \u201caccumulation\u201d value. The policy she bought last year, also issued by Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, has a nine-year surrender period, with a penalty fee starting at 8.25 percent.The American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group that represents annuity issuers and life insurers, echoed that point, noting that guarantees come at a cost so insurers can make good on their promises.\u201cAnnuities are among the most highly regulated products,\u201d Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the group, said, \u201cwith disclosure being a key consumer protection.\u201dSlightly more than half of all 403(b) assets, approaching $900 billion, have been invested in fixed annuities \u2014 which promise either a minimum rate of annual growth or interest based on changes in a market index. Another 25 percent were in variable annuities that invest in mutual funds, according to Investment Company Institute data as of March. The remaining 23 percent were invested in traditional mutual funds.In contrast, about 60 percent of 401(k) assets, which totaled $4.75 trillion, were invested in mutual funds, with only a small share in variable annuities. Despite the risks from short-term market declines, a diversified mix of stock and bond funds is generally less costly and provides a significantly greater return over time.Under that plan, run by TIAA, she has access to low-cost Vanguard funds. She chose to redirect her new contributions into one that invests up to 65 percent in bonds, with the remainder in stocks.But most of her money is still tied up in four annuities that she does not understand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outside Money Favors Hillary Clinton at a 2-to-1 Rate Over Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byA dozen different organizations raised over $200 million through the beginning of October and since May have spent more than $110 million on television, digital, and radio ads in support of Hillary Clinton, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission through Thursday.The Democrats\u2019 success this year reflects, in part, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s close personal ties to her party\u2019s elite donors and her allies\u2019 willingness to exploit the 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case far more aggressively than President Obama did.But the Democrats are also deeply indebted to one man: Mr. Trump, whose provocations and tirades \u2014 along with a loud crusade against his own party\u2019s donors \u2014 have virtually shut off what once promised to be a half-billion-dollar spigot of outside money.\u201cEveryone thought that we would be outspent, that there would be significant operations built at the presidential level for the other candidate,\u201d said Guy Cecil, a former Clinton aide who heads Priorities USA Action, the main hub of big Democratic giving. \u201cThat obviously hasn\u2019t happened.\u201dThe biggest groups set up or expanded by conservatives since Citizens United \u2014 including American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, and the network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch \u2014 are absent from the presidential campaign, focusing instead on protecting Republicans in Congress.13 Photos\u201cUnlike President Obama four years ago, Clinton embraced the outside money game and shrewdly empowered a single group to carry her message,\u201d said Steven J. Law, the president of American Crossroads and its sister organizations, \u201cin contrast to the boardwalk arcade of groups supporting Trump.\u201dCitizens United paved the way for independent groups that could raise unlimited amounts of money from unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to spend on elections, as long as they did not coordinate with individual candidates or parties. Republican donors moved quickly to seize on the ruling, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the last three national elections, while Democrats struggled to persuade their donors to invest in \u201csuper PACs\u201d at the same scale.Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals for the Republican nomination were backed by an array of super PACs and outside groups set up by their allies and former aides, seeming to set the stage for even greater spending in 2016. But Mr. Trump unexpectedly triumphed, exploiting his knack for free publicity and relying on his own fortune and money from grass-roots supporters. In part because of that success, Mr. Trump was slow to incorporate super PACs into his general election strategy.By contrast, Mrs. Clinton began personally courting donors for outside groups almost as soon as she entered the campaign in spring 2015.The Democrats\u2019 tentpole is Priorities USA, a five-year-old super PAC that has access to the party\u2019s biggest donors and the implicit blessing of Mrs. Clinton, and is now on track to raise $173 million by Election Day. That is more than any equivalent Democratic effort in history, including the controversial big-money groups set up by wealthy liberals a decade ago to unseat President George W. Bush. The PAC is closely coordinating with environmental and labor activists and other organizations set up to harness support from veterans, African-Americans and Latinos.In twice-monthly meetings at a Democratic law firm in downtown Washington, officials at Priorities have convened representatives of a dozen super PACs and progressive organizations to carve out swing-state turf and share intelligence from organizers on the ground. Several have pooled money with Priorities USA to purchase television and digital advertising through the same media firms, allowing smaller groups to get better rates. (Other left-leaning organizations, including labor unions and a super PAC founded by the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, have separately spent significant money on field organizing.)Priorities USA has shared the cost of some major campaigns with Emily\u2019s List, the leading progressive group aimed at electing Democratic women. The super PAC has also given smaller groups access to its digital and video creative studio or shared its own television spots with other organizations to run under their own names.In early October, for example, a super PAC controlled by the Service Employees International Union began a $3 million Spanish-language campaign targeted at Latino voters in southern Florida and Nevada. The ads, which featured Hispanic families and accused Mr. Trump of bringing \u201chate, divisiveness and disrespect into our homes,\u201d was originally produced by a team at Priorities USA.Democratic officials said the partnership had yielded better and more authentic advertising and outreach. A group called the Latino Victory Fund, which has run $400,000 in advertising backed by Priorities, advised the group on how to vary voice-over accents depending on where the ad was running: Cuban-inflected Spanish for spots airing around Miami, Mexican-American accents and word usage for Nevada.\u201cSometimes we\u2019ve come up with concepts for ads, both digital and television,\u201d said the fund\u2019s interim director, C\u00e9sar J. Blanco. \u201cIn other instances, Priorities has developed a concept and shared it with us. They\u2019ve shared with us data and polling. It\u2019s been a really great partnership.\u201dBehind that partnership is an astonishing concentration of liberal wealth. More than two-thirds of the total money that groups supporting Mrs. Clinton have raised \u2014 $133 million \u2014 comes from just 30 families.Donald Sussman, a hedge fund investor and longtime liberal donor, has donated $19 million to Priorities USA, among the largest amounts any left-leaning donor has ever given to a single super PAC. Members of the billionaire Pritzker family, which founded the Hyatt hotel chain, have contributed $14 million to Priorities and other pro-Clinton groups. The liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros has given $13.5 million, far more than he gave to support Mr. Obama four years ago.As most of the big Republican groups have stayed away from the presidential race, a small constellation of groups run by Trump allies has sprung up in their place, raising $46 million since the beginning of the cycle.The National Rifle Association, one of the few traditional conservative allies to get behind Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, has put $20 million into a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump and other Republicans. But many of the new Trump groups are getting into the game late, when advertising rates have skyrocketed, and they are competing against one another for donors and turf, sometimes even cannibalizing Mr. Trump\u2019s own fund-raising.Mr. Trump has attracted some generous individual supporters, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission through last week. The casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have donated $10 million to groups running advertising against Mrs. Clinton. Bernard Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot, has provided $7 million to a pair of pro-Trump super PACs.A surprisingly small donor to Mr. Trump is Robert Mercer, a New York hedge fund executive. Mr. Mercer and his family have invested millions of dollars over the years in conservative advocacy groups and media outlets, some of which are now among Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest supporters. But Mr. Mercer has been relatively parsimonious with the cash he has put into a Mercer-controlled super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, contributing just $2 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Federal Investigators Search for Cause of Deadly Hoboken Train Crash", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "Supported byHOBOKEN, N.J. \u2014 Federal investigators have still not inspected the train that slammed into a busy transportation hub here, killing a woman and injuring more than 100 others, because of the extensive damage at the scene of the crash, officials said on Friday.A day after the crash set off a panic at the station during the morning commute, federal investigators have provided few answers about why the train careened into a wall. On Friday evening, officials said that they had not yet interviewed the train\u2019s engineer or examined most of the train.Jim Southworth, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, said he had not sent investigators into the front of the train because of concerns over asbestos and the structural integrity of the building. The damage from the train\u2019s impact caused part of the terminal\u2019s roof to collapse.\u201cBecause of the asbestos, because of the unsettled structures that we\u2019re not sure about, I\u2019m not allowing anybody to go in there,\u201d Mr. Southworth said at a news conference. \u201cNone of the evidence in there is perishable, so I have the time to go in there.\u201dFederal investigators said they could not estimate when the historic station, Hoboken Terminal, might reopen or when they would remove the train from the tracks, prompting questions over how long New Jersey Transit\u2019s train service to the station might remain suspended.Officials were still working to schedule an interview with the train\u2019s engineer, Thomas Gallagher, who was injured on Thursday, said Bella Dinh-Zarr, the vice chairwoman of the safety board. The results of his toxicology report were not yet available, she said.While investigators removed the event recorder from the locomotive in the rear of the train, they were not able to download the information on it and sent it to the manufacturer for assistance. The recorder is an important device that can reveal how fast the train was traveling.The safety board planned to spend as many as 10 days at the scene of the crash as part of the investigation, which could take a year to complete. The board will review several possible factors, including the engineer\u2019s actions, the train\u2019s maintenance and the railroad\u2019s tracks and signals.The train\u2019s crew had been cooperative, and investigators were scheduling interviews with two other train crew members \u2014 a conductor and a brakeman, officials said.At the station, part of the collapsed roof was resting on top of the front of the train.\u201cAs you can imagine we don\u2019t want anyone to go in there until it\u2019s completely stable,\u201d Ms. Dinh-Zarr said.Another obstacle facing investigators is the likely presence of asbestos inside the 109-year-old Beaux-Arts building that houses Hoboken Terminal, Ms. Dinh-Zarr said.A commuter train crashed into Hoboken Terminal at about 8:45 Thursday morning.On Friday, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey told reporters that New Jersey Transit had an exemplary safety record. Still, he added, \u201cNo accident is acceptable, and so we have to get to the bottom of what happened, and I promise you that we will.\u201dThe closing of Hoboken Terminal, which serves six New Jersey Transit rail lines, forced commuters to make do with contingency plans provided by New Jersey Transit, the third-busiest commuter rail system in the country. New Jersey Transit officials said they could not restart service until receiving approval from the safety board.If train service at the station remains suspended for days or weeks, many New Jerseyans could be forced to consider painful travel options and heavy crowds on other train lines and buses.Veronica Vanterpool, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a rider advocacy group, said she hoped train service would resume by next week. But she had concerns over how quickly the railroad could bounce back since it has been facing financial problems and other issues.\u201cIf it were the M.T.A., I think service could be restored relatively quickly, but I think N.J.T. has had so many operational challenges,\u201d Ms. Vanterpool said in reference to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York\u2019s subways and commuter rail.On Friday morning, many commuters braved long and complicated commutes into New York and other areas, facing a confusing slate of schedule changes, delays and cancellations with a mixture of weariness, frustration and stoicism.Many, like Maulik Pokiya, were determined not to let the disaster keep them from getting where they needed to be. Mr. Pokiya was a passenger on the train as it plowed into Hoboken Terminal, watching out the window of the second car as electrical wires were being ripped loose from their holds and were flashing sparks. The terror had yet to fade from his mind.Though he was given the option to work from home, Mr. Pokiya was back on another train on Friday. He climbed aboard in Oradell, N.J., and was joined by his brother, who usually takes a later train but was providing emotional support.\u201cSince I was safe, I\u2019m not worried,\u201d Mr. Pokiya said. \u201cI was feeling scared, but anything can happen.\u201dStephen Schroeder, who was in the train\u2019s first car when it crashed \u2014 the quiet car where cellphones are supposed to be on mute and conversation kept to a minimum \u2014 was similarly unbowed.\u201cI thought about working from home, but I just prefer being in the office,\u201d said Mr. Schroeder, a resident of Park Ridge who works for a software company.He looked out the window of the bus as it crossed the marshes along the Hackensack River on the New Jersey Turnpike. It was a far cry from the day before.\u201cI saw the roof collapse and people were screaming,\u201d he said. \u201cOne guy kicked out the emergency exit, and I told him to be careful.\u201dMr. Schroeder said he did not think he would ride in the first car anymore, as had been his habit.Those with less visceral connections to the crash had a simpler aim: to get to work on time. At the Secaucus Junction station, people walked and jogged to catch connecting shuttle buses.Donald Pantelli had allotted an additional two hours to make it to work. \u201cHopefully, the boss will be understanding,\u201d he said. Though he had expected to take a bus to Hoboken, Mr. Pantelli found himself rerouted to Jersey City.\u201cIt is what it is; we have to make these adjustments in life,\u201d he said.Beverley Terry, riding the shuttle from Secaucus to Jersey City, said she missed the train that crashed because she was running late, an echo of Sept. 11, 2001, when she had been late to her job at the World Trade Center.\u201cI had to come in today,\u201d Ms. Terry said. \u201cIt\u2019s like my mother told me: You always get back on that horse.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the officials were noncommital about whether more money would be forthcoming.\u201cWe have worked in good faith for years to help the co-op get onto firm footing,\u201d said Anthony Hogrebe, a spokesman for the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. \u201cWe are staying in close contact with them to understand their needs, and the cause of the overruns.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that the city\u2019ll continue to work with Sunrise to have a worker-owned cooperative in the Bronx,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will set the model for keeping low wage businesses together, even after their neighborhood has been rezoned.\u201dCity officials regarded the 62-acre auto repair enclave as an eyesore whose dusty streets flooded when it rained, but Willets Point was home to about 225 mostly Latino-owned businesses and 1,700 workers who earned anywhere from $80 to $140 a day.Those kinds of industrial, blue-collar jobs have not fared well amid the city\u2019s rising tide of luxury housing and gentrification over the past 20 years.\u201cThere\u2019s no institutional commitment in the city to preserving industry,\u201d said Tom Angotti, a professor of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College. \u201cBut it\u2019s been shown time and again that diverse economies are more resilient.\u201dThe Sunrise Cooperative also sued the city, settling in 2015, after the city agreed to provide the group with $5.8 million to move collectively to the Bronx warehouse.Marco Neira, president of Sunrise, said the group wanted to replicate the critical mass of auto-related businesses at Willets Point that had attracted customers who knew they could find a good deal by hunting from shop to shop for the best price.Mr. Neira said he wanted to avoid what happened to printers in Manhattan, many of which failed after being forced to leave the printing district around Canal and Hudson Streets in the 1990s. Some relocated to Long Island City, where they are being forced out by development again.\u201cAll the printers in the buildings around me have been told to get out in the next year,\u201d said Howard Weinstein, president of Candid Litho Printing, which moved to Long Island City 10 years ago and is moving again, possibly out of the city. \u201cThe number of apartment buildings going up here is out of control.\u201dMembers of the Sunrise Cooperative said that their building in Hunts Point \u2014 and industrial section close to the Interstate 278 that is home to the city\u2019s produce and fish markets \u2014 is unlikely to face the same sort of gentrification.The price of converting the property has soared because of delays and the cost of constructing in accordance with building and fire codes. Sunrise has exhausted its own money as well as $7.6 million in city relocation financing. Sunrise estimates that it needs another $2 million to pay outstanding bills and finish construction and $1 million more for operating costs in the first year.Former Willets Point business owners like Mr. Chasi and Jorge Molina, who owned the House of Shocks, often set up shop in front of the now-vacant Iron Triangle shops with compressors, tool bags and spare parts piled into the back of pickup trucks or vans.\u201cI have some customers, maybe 100, waiting for the shop to open,\u201d said Robert Aguilar, who immigrated to New York from Mexico and owned Veterans Auto Repair. \u201cIn a good year, I made $70,000. I had been looking to buy a house. But now: nothing. What money there is goes for food and rent.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Problem With Elizabeth Warren", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI refer of course to Elizabeth Warren, our senior senator and, as it were, the nation\u2019s unelected regulatory czar. Ms. Warren\u2019s latest provocation was to send a letter to President Obama this month demanding the removal of Mary Jo White, chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ms. White, she said, had demonstrated her unsuitability for the role by failing to have the S.E.C. draft rules requiring corporations to disclose details of their political spending.Perhaps Ms. Warren has come to believe the chatter that her pointed criticism of John G. Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, during his appearance in September before the Senate Banking Committee, was responsible for his resignation this month. But there is no good evidence of that.The turf encroachment over the S.E.C. was not the first for Ms. Warren, a high-decibel champion of regulation who in 2014 scotched what would have been a very good appointment to an important post at the Treasury Department. In that instance, as with her comments about Ms. White, her power grab demonstrated a deep confusion about the proper role of regulation.The S.E.C. was established in 1934, in the shadow of the Wall Street crash, for the very specific and very important role of protecting markets. It does this, first, through mandated disclosure of corporate earnings, and second through enforcement.Despite some slips, American securities markets remain the world\u2019s most trusted, mainly because most companies\u2019 operations are accurately represented by their public filings. When the S.E.C. has landed in trouble, it has usually been because it has wandered from its charter and ignored its bread-and-butter responsibility (see Madoff, Bernie). This kind of overreach is, in effect, what Ms. Warren is advocating now in her criticism of the S.E.C. chairwoman.Instead of involving itself in the politicized issue of campaign spending, the S.E.C. should be thinking about core issues on its own turf. For example, given a spate of judicial reversals of insider-trading convictions, does the agency need a new approach \u2014 or should it seek new legislation to combat insider trading? Another: With retail investors flocking to index funds, does the agency fully understand the risks if investors should start to flee such funds en masse? And do investors understand the risks?In addition to these concerns, the S.E.C. faces continual pressure on its budget from a skeptical and unappreciative Congress. The last thing it needs is political grandstanding from Ms. Warren.Roger Lowenstein, a director of the Sequoia Fund, is the author, most recently, of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Nuclear Cover-Up", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWhy did it do this? Because the project isn\u2019t just about energy: It\u2019s also a stealth initiative to bolster Britain\u2019s nuclear deterrent.For years, the British government has been promoting a plan to build two so-called European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) at Hinkley Point C, in southwest England.No working version of the reactor exists. The two EPR projects that are furthest along \u2014 one in Finland, the other in France \u2014 are many years behind schedule, have hemorrhaged billions of dollars and are beset by major safety issues.The lead builder of the EPR, the French utility company Electricit\u00e9 de France, faced a mutiny this year: Its unions fought the Hinkley Point project, fearing it might bring down the company. E.D.F.\u2019s chief financial officer has resigned, arguing that it would put too much strain on the company\u2019s balance sheet.But the British government continues to act as though it wants the Hinkley project to proceed at almost any price.If the Hinkley plan seems outrageous, that\u2019s because it only makes sense if one considers its connection to Britain\u2019s military projects \u2014 especially Trident, a roving fleet of armed nuclear submarines, which is outdated and needs upgrading. Hawks and conservatives, in particular, see the Trident program as vital to preserving Britain\u2019s international clout.For proponents of Trident, civilian nuclear projects are a way of \u201cmasking\u201d the high costs of developing a new fleet of nuclear submarines, according to the report. Merging programs like research and development or skills training across civilian and military sectors helps cut back on military spending. It also helps maintain the talent pool for nuclear specialists. And given the long lead times and life spans of most nuclear projects, connections between civilian and military programs give companies more incentives to make the major investments required.One might say that with the Hinkley Point project, the British government is using billions of Chinese money to build stealth submarines designed to deter China.One can certainly say that the British government is using an ill-advised civilian nuclear energy project as a convoluted means of financing a submarine program.The British government must be more transparent about its military spending, if only so that those expenditures can be measured against the needs of other public programs. According to the Science Policy Research Unit study, the government itself estimated in 2015 that renewing the Trident deterrent force will cost nearly $38.5 billion. In comparison, the deficit of the National Health Services for the fiscal year 2015-6, a record, was about $3 billion.Hiding the true costs of a project like Trident by promoting a questionable and ruinous project like Hinkley Point C distorts the economics of both the defense and the civilian energy sectors. It also skews energy policy itself.If Britain\u2019s energy policy were solely about energy, rather than also about defense, the nuclear sector would be forced to stand on its own two feet. And the government would have to acknowledge the growing benefits of renewable energy and make hard-nosed comparisons about cost, implementation, environmental benefits and safety.Britain\u2019s defense policy should not be allowed to undermine the country\u2019s energy policy: That, too, is about national security.Peter Wynn Kirby is a nuclear and environmental specialist at the University of Oxford.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rare New Jersey Swing District, House Race Becomes a Brawl", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byRIDGEWOOD, N.J. \u2014 With a barrage of negative ads and copious outside spending, the congressional race in a crescent of Norman Rockwell-style suburbs and tidy rural villages in northern New Jersey represents one of the region\u2019s most bare-knuckle political fights.The Fifth Congressional District, extending across North Jersey from the Delaware River to the Hudson River, is the state\u2019s one potential swing district, with roughly the same number of voters registered in each party, making it a tempting target for Democrats hoping to cut into or even overcome the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in a topsy-turvy political year.In the past, Mr. Garrett, who wields considerable influence as a member of the Financial Services Committee and the chairman of its Subcommittee on Capital Markets, has handily dispatched Democratic challengers, repelling their attacks on his conservative positions and mores.But he has never faced a rival as well financed as Mr. Gottheimer, who has been helped by his deep connections within the Clinton circle and his experience in the corporate and technology worlds.Through the end of September, Mr. Gottheimer had received contributions of almost $4 million, roughly double the nearly $1.9 million in contributions to Mr. Garrett\u2019s campaign.And perhaps more than in other years, Mr. Garrett has provided plenty of ammunition to his opponent.Last year, Politico reported that Mr. Garrett had irked fellow Republicans when he refused to pass on donations to the National Republican Congressional Committee because of its support for gay candidates.Mr. Garrett, a conservative Christian, is also a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage, and takes a strict stand against abortion.Mr. Gottheimer has hammered him over those positions and a series of seemingly ideologically motivated votes in Congress, many of them reflecting a strong fiscal conservatism.He points to, among others, Mr. Garrett\u2019s vote against an enormous spending bill that contained funding to assist emergency medical workers who fell ill after the Sept. 11 attack at the World Trade Center.The charges have resonated and forced Mr. Garrett onto the defensive.In a telephone interview, Mr. Garrett said that he supported assistance to the emergency medical workers but objected to other elements of the huge spending bill it was included in, leaving him the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote against it.And he called the reports that he had opposed gay candidates \u201cridiculous.\u201d\u201cI support anyone\u2019s right to run for public office,\u201d he said. \u201cI support my fellow Republican candidates.\u201dHe faulted Mr. Gottheimer for raising the issue, saying it distracted from other topics important to voters, including job creation, the economy and security issues.\u201cThis is something that came up over a year ago and my opponent has used it just to lie,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cThis lie and other lies and they just continue to be spread, whether he advertises on TV or billboards or hires an airplane to spread his lies. It\u2019s really outrageous.\u201dMr. Gottheimer said that his opponent\u2019s votes and positions are fair game.\u201cThe Tea Party extremism does not reflect the values of our district,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said. \u201cIf you want to get things done we\u2019ve got to get rid of the obstructionists.\u201dMr. Gottheimer has benefited from hefty spending by super PACs, fueled partly by reaction to Mr. Garrett\u2019s conservative positions. They include the Democratic Party-aligned House Majority PAC and the National Association of Realtors Political Action Committee. Mr. Garrett has pushed to end the federal government\u2019s role in supporting the mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants, a stand opposed by the Realtors group.Voters have been bombarded by ads, mailings and campaign phone calls.\u201cAt least 50 percent of the time my phone rings it\u2019s something related to the election. Gottheimer. Garrett. And I get Trump calls all the time,\u201d said Karen Abraham, who was watching her two children play in a school playground in this suburb. Most of the television ads were negative, Ms. Abraham said, adding, \u201cIt makes you glaze over after a while.\u201dThe harshest salvo has come from Mr. Garrett, in a television ad that resurrects a 2007 lawsuit, filed by a woman in Washington, who claimed she was mistreated in the condominium building where she lived, and where Mr. Gottheimer was on the board.The ad accuses Mr. Gottheimer of assaulting the woman, harassing her and forcing her to move.Court papers and interviews with two of the lawyers involved in the case tell a different story. The lawsuit, which was eventually withdrawn without a settlement, describes an episode in the building\u2019s lobby in which Mr. Gottheimer allegedly raised his voice and wagged his finger in the woman\u2019s face, an encounter described as an \u201cassault.\u201d\u201cThere was nothing to any of these allegations,\u201d said Richard F. Silber, a lawyer who represented another person named in the lawsuit. \u201cThe allegations were that he wagged his finger at her. Who brings a lawsuit about that?\u201dThe district is the only one in the state with relative parity between the two political parties. It has roughly the same number of registered Democrats and Republicans among voters, about 140,000 in each party, according to the New Jersey Division of Elections. About 216,000 registered voters in the district do not have a party affiliation. Here, as elsewhere, the outcome of the undercard may depend in part on how voters react to the bitter presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.While some Republican leaders have rejected Mr. Trump, Mr. Garrett has not wavered; he has said he will vote for him, including after hearing Mr. Trump\u2019s recorded statements about groping women\u2019s genitals.\u201cAs a father, as a husband, I said at the time that I\u2019m outraged by the statements and disagree with him vehemently,\u201d Mr. Garrett said. \u201cAt this point in time, though, we have to look at the issues and we cannot have a continuation of failed foreign policy and failed economic policy and that\u2019s what Hillary Clinton will bring about.\u201dMr. Gottheimer has received some surprising endorsements.Meg Whitman, a Hewlett-Packard executive and Republican fund-raiser who has been outspoken in her opposition to Mr. Trump, endorsed Mr. Gottheimer. Ms. Whitman backed Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey for president before he dropped out of the Republican nomination contest and endorsed Mr. Trump.Mr. Gottheimer has also received the endorsement of the New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association, a response to Mr. Garrett\u2019s vote against the budget that included aid for World Trade Center emergency medical workers.Mayor Harry Shortway of Vernon Township, a Republican, said that he had previously voted for Mr. Garrett, but that after meeting with both candidates he had decided to endorse Mr. Gottheimer, who seemed to him more responsive to the township\u2019s needs. It was turned down when it sought a federal grant to pay for a new fire truck, he said, and Mr. Gottheimer had pledged to help get the financing.\u201cI don\u2019t see the federal tax dollars coming back into the area,\u201d Mr. Shortway said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With a Fine Looming, Deutsche Bank Is Still Issuing Debt", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsDeutsche Bank has received a cautious vote of creditor confidence. The German lender is issuing expensive debt. That shows it can get access to markets, despite a feared $14 billion American regulatory fine. It is less powerful a signal than buying debt back, as Deutsche Bank did in February \u2014 but at least it shows that investors do not fear losses that could eat into senior debt.The German bank is issuing like gangbusters. It sold $3 billion of five-year bonds on Friday, and it has just raised an additional $1.5 billion, after an investor wanted more. The bank\u2019s motives may be largely practical: It needs to issue about $30 billion of bonds by the end of the year, and by the end of June it was two-thirds of the way through.Yet even prosaic actions take on extra significance in light of the bank\u2019s potential $14 billion fine, and reports it may need a bailout, or that clients have been cutting their exposure. A bond issue shows that the bank can get access to markets, reinforcing its \u20ac215 billion pile of liquidity.When the bank bought back debt in February that showed that it thought the market was temporarily mispricing its debt and that it had ample liquidity. It also created capital, by retiring debt below book value.The bond issue also does little to reassure investors\u2019 concerns over Deutsche Bank\u2019s profitability. The bank is paying a spread of 290 basis points more than Treasuries, a level that is uncomfortably high for a large trading house, as higher financing costs eat into the counterparties\u2019 returns.Still, it shows that investors are pretty confident that the bank will not be declared insolvent, that senior creditors will be protected even if instruments further down the capital hierarchy get hosed, and that Deutsche has raised its capital significantly since the last financial crisis. There is good reason: Even a maximum $14 billion fine should not cause Deutsche Bank to breach minimum capital ratios, and it has $15 billion of hybrid and subordinated that could recapitalize it before senior bonds take a hit. Deutsche is still fighting fires, but its back is not against the wall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Excellent Books on Long-Term Investing", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfIt is easy to forget personal investing fundamentals when stock prices hit new highs one week, fall sharply the next and then rise again in no reliable pattern, as they have been doing this year. So now is an ideal time to reread \u2014 or perhaps pick up for the first time \u2014 three excellent books by people who are particularly good at explaining the building blocks of a solid portfolio.In the first of these, Andrew Tobias promises in his title that he is offering \u201cThe Only Investment Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\u201d ($15.95, Mariner Books). And in the book, which has been continually updated since it was published in 1978, he covers a great deal of important territory, although some of the advice by now may sound familiar. He includes nostrums like this: Buy only investments you understand. If the projected return sounds too good to be true, stay away. You\u2019re going to have to take some risk and buy stocks to stay ahead of inflation. Never forget the impact taxes can have on returns.Solid counsel, but it is not why the book is worth reading. Mr. Tobias\u2019s ideas about saving money \u2014 you can\u2019t build a portfolio without savings \u2014 are his real gems. And the reason for that is his approach. He combines humor \u2014 it starts with the dedication, \u201cto my broker \u2014 even if he has, from time to time, made me just that\u201d \u2014 with common sense presented in an uncommon way.For example, you may already know that you shouldn\u2019t carry credit card debt, because the interest rates can drain what you are able to sock away; you can lower your insurance premiums by increasing deductibles (allowing you to save more) and buy in bulk when items you consume frequently are on sale.But when Mr. Tobias explains it, doing things like this seem as if they would be financial brilliance on your part instead of drudgery.\u201cWhy put $1,000 into the stock of some utility and earn $40 in annual taxable dividends if you can put the same money into insulation and save $350 \u2014 tax-free \u2014 on your utility bill?\u201d he asks.But what should you do if you actually save money by following Mr. Tobias\u2019s suggestions? John C. Bogle has some good ideas in \u201cThe Little Book of Common Sense Investing\u201d (Wiley, $24.95).Let\u2019s get the negatives out of the way first. Mr. Bogle can be hectoring. (\u201cYou ignore these rules at your peril.\u201d) And, perhaps because it was published a decade ago, the idea of owning international stocks or bonds gets little attention.That said, in clear, convincing fashion he lays out a solid strategy for getting \u201cyour fair share of stock market returns.\u201d That isn\u2019t difficult, he writes. \u201cSuccessful investing is all about common sense.\u201dAmong his common-sense ideas:\u25a0 Since timing the market is virtually impossible, you should buy and hold stocks.\u25a0 Being diversified minimizes risk.\u25a0 Because transaction costs and brokerage fees can eat up a significant portion of your returns, invest heavily through low-cost index funds.That last isn\u2019t surprising since Mr. Bogle is founder and former chief executive of Vanguard, the mutual fund company known for its index funds. But he argues everyone should be a fan of the funds.\u201cSimple arithmetic suggests, and history confirms, the winning strategy is to own all the nation\u2019s publicly held businesses at very low cost,\u201d he writes. \u201cBy doing so you are guaranteed to capture almost the entire return they generate in the form of dividends and earnings growth. The best way to implement this strategy is indeed simple: buying a fund that holds this market portfolio. Such a fund is called an index fund.\u201dOf course, one reason most of us try to create a solid portfolio is so we can live the kind of life we want when we get older. The final book grabs me partly because of my age. And as I wrote two years ago, I found two things appealing about \u201cThe Charles Schwab Guide to Finances After Fifty\u201d(Crown Business, $26), written by Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz.First, Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz thoroughly answers her target market\u2019s most common questions. For example, if you are 50 and older, don\u2019t have much money stashed for retirement and wonder what you should do, she says start saving at least 40 percent of your income immediately.Conversely, if you are in good financial shape as retirement looms, you may wonder whether you should pay off your mortgage. Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz, a certified financial planner, shows you how to do the arithmetic to decide. You multiply your current mortgage interest rate \u2014 say 4 percent \u2014 by your tax bracket. Let\u2019s assume 30 percent. That means your mortgage is only costing you 2.8 percent (since you get to deduct the interest you pay).So, paying it off is equivalent to a 2.8 percent risk-free return. If you are pleased with that, especially since you know you will own your house free and clear, pay off your mortgage. If you think you can earn more elsewhere, keep paying the loan and invest the money you would have used to pay off the mortgage.The other nice thing is that Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz \u2014 the daughter of Charles Schwab, the founder of the mutual fund company that bears his name \u2014 treats her readers like adults who know the personal finance basics.For example, she says, when it comes to retirement planning, you need to answer only three questions: What do you expect to spend each year in retirement? How much money will you need in savings/investments to support that spending? And how much more do you need to save to get from here (where you are now) to there (the point where you can fund the retirement you want)?If your projections show you coming up short, she says, you should postpone retirement. That \u201cwould allow you to build a bigger retirement portfolio and shorten the time you\u2019ll rely on savings,\u201d she says, and it could also increase your Social Security benefits.These three books are at the top of my list. If I expanded it, I would include \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d by Benjamin Graham (Collins Business Essentials, $8); \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d by Jeremy J. Siegel (McGraw-Hill, $40) and \u201cMaking the Most of Your Money Now\u201d by Jane Bryant Quinn (Simon & Schuster, $35).They, too, are worth a second read, or a first if you haven\u2019t had the pleasure.Advertisement"}

Melting sea ice and a rising ocean affect its coasts. Longer, warmer summers are changing plant life in the interior, and are bound to affect the lives of insects. But even though bees are by far the most important pollinators for tundra plants, some of which, like berries, are traditionally prized by Alaska natives, not enough is known about bee populations and behavior even to spot change when it occurs. That\u2019s what the team hopes to remedy.It is the group\u2019s third day in the field, and my first, and although the site is actually buzzing with bees, it seems that bee hunting is like fishing. No matter where you go and when you get there, someone always says, \u201cYou shoulda been here yesterday.\u201d Or the day before that.Another researcher, Jessica Purcell, an assistant professor in the entomology department at Riverside, said that at the Arctic Circle two days ago, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t shake a net at a flower without catching a bee.\u201dShe and her husband, Alan Brelsford, both newbies to the bee business, caught 40 each. \u201cWe had to let some go,\u201d said Dr. Brelsford, who is starting at Riverside this fall as an assistant biology professor.Traveling the Dalton Highway in search of Bombus polaris, the Arctic bumblebee.Here, the bees aren\u2019t quite that numerous, and the hunters are every bit as intense as siblings on an Easter egg hunt.Two of them are actually siblings. Dr. Woodard\u2019s brother, Bren, an ex-Marine and devoted participant in military history re-enactments, carries a shotgun when there is a concern about grizzlies, but it doesn\u2019t seem to interfere with his bee hunting. He ranges far and wide, as does Jeff Diez, a plant ecologist and the grizzled veteran of the group. He has been at the university for three years.The bee stalkers run and pounce, swiping hand-held nets like the ones butterfly collectors use, calling out, \u201cBee!\u201d or \u201cGot one!\u201d when they are successful. They pop them into plastic tubes and bring them to Michelle Duennes, a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Woodard\u2019s lab for identification.As the team gets ready to move on, Dr. Duennes takes a few plastic tubes from Dr. Woodard\u2019s brother, whose reputation as a bee hunter grows with each day\u2019s successes.\u201cYou\u2019re like the bee whisperer,\u201d Dr. Duennes tells him.All the scientists are under 40. They don\u2019t take themselves too seriously. Dr. Diez tolerates constant teasing about his Australian bush hat, and to her many tattoos, Dr. Woodard has added one of a bee larva. Dr. Duennes is a roller-derby devotee who goes by the apt nom de guerre Polly Nator.The trip is being financed by a university grant to encourage collaboration among young scientists.\u201cWe\u2019re at a special place in our careers,\u201d Dr. Woodard said.They hadn\u2019t been in the field together, but given the available grants, \u201cwe said, well what\u2019s the craziest thing we could think of doing?\u201d The answer: going north to Alaska to scout the condition of bumblebees in the Arctic, where climate change is occurring at a rapid rate.Besides, Dr. Woodard says, she has been interested in expanding beyond her recent work of studying proteins in bee brains.\u201cI\u2019m really lab oriented,\u201d she says, standing in a cloud of mosquitoes with a bug net over her head, mountains in the background and the dust of eighteen-wheelers on the narrow highway a few hundred yards away.\u201cI\u2019m trying to get out more.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the pandas of the insect world,\u201d Dr. Woodard says. \u201cThey\u2019re big and fuzzy. People can see them. They move a little slower.\u201dThere are 250 species, a small fraction of the world\u2019s 20,000 bee species. Genetic studies suggest that they first appeared on the Tibetan plateau, where the greatest variety still exists. But they have spread around the Northern Hemisphere and into South America.They are social insects. While honeybees may congregate in insect cities of 100,000 bees or more, bumblebees live in the equivalent of small towns, with colonies of 50 to a few hundred.Almost all bumblebee colonies last for just one season. As cold weather approaches, female workers, the queen and male drones die. Only fertile females that have mated \u2014 queens in waiting \u2014 seek refuges under the tundra, sometimes in old mouse burrows, where they outlast the winter in a state of torpor. In the spring, they emerge to start the whole cycle over.Bumblebees are the only bees that live in the high Arctic. They have adapted to the darkness and cold of wintertime that dips to 60 below zero and then to the explosion of growth and pollination under summer\u2019s midnight sun.And that\u2019s why the bee hunter caravan is on the Dalton Highway.Some changes to the climate are already obvious. Willows are taking advantage of a milder climate to spread north to areas where only the low-lying plants and lichens of the tundra had lived before. Moose follow the march of the willows.And there are gaps in the knowledge of Arctic bees that need to be filled. The group on this expedition wants to help build up information on current populations and behavior against which to measure change.It doesn\u2019t just stay warm enough to fly. Dr. Heinrich suggested in his research that a spring queen warms up her ovaries to jump-start the production of eggs to be fertilized with sperm stored in her body since the previous fall.But by the end of the day at the Chandalar Shelf, no one has yet found a bee they can identify as polaris.She removes the guts to study later for bacteria and viruses they may harboring, and places them in a solution that preserves them for genetic study. The bee bodies go into ethanol.As she works, she recounts some of the day\u2019s events, including one bee that she thought might be a polaris, but turned out not to be. She wanted to make sure she caught it, so she grabbed it through the net to make sure it didn\u2019t escape. She thought, \u201cI don\u2019t care if it stings me. But then it did. And then I was like, \u2018Ow, ow, no, I do care.\u201dThe station is a remote scientific outpost dotted with soft-sided dormitories shaped like Quonset huts, outhouses on stilts and labs in rectangular modular buildings. Showers, while hot, are limited to two per week, maximum two minutes each.The cafeteria provides unlimited do-it-yourself sandwiches, coffee, snacks and ice cream. The regular meals are hearty and delicious. There are no mosquitoes in the cafeteria, so we don\u2019t have to solve the problem of how to lift a mosquito net over our heads to get food into our mouths. The station also has a sauna, set on the shore of icy Toolik Lake. It is clothing optional, we are told during orientation, with men\u2019s, women\u2019s and late evening coed hours.But with the luxury, the bees disappear. For two days, we try sites in and around the station. Here and there someone finds a bee, but they seem to have mostly disappeared.Other scientists at Toolik say that earlier in the year several large snowstorms, with warming spells in between, wiped out nesting attempts by migrating birds, drowning the nests and freezing chicks and eggs. Something similar may have happened to the bees.But on July 4, I watch as Dr. Duennes identifies the first Bombus polaris. Once the trip is over, and the researchers do genetic testing at the University of California, Riverside, they will realize that they found more than 40 Bombus polaris bees along the way, but they don\u2019t yet know that.The first Bombus polaris bee is a gift. A researcher who has been using fine mesh nets to capture birds has also caught a number of bees by accident. She gladly turns over two dozen or so.The bees have been in a cardboard box, and their hairs have become matted, making it impossible to see the color markings that identify them. Dr. Duennes and Ms. Watrous set up a bee-fluffing salon in a back room of the station\u2019s recreation building.In another room, Dr. Woodard and the three other professors plot the grant application that will grow out of this trip, a pursuit of Bombus polaris they hope will take some of them to Greenland and to Ellesmere Island.First the bee dressers wash the bees with soap and water. Then they rinse them and wash the bees in ethanol. They dry the bees with paper towels and tease the hairs apart with corners of paper towel.I admire the transformation, and Dr. Duennes holds up one of the restored bees and says, in a cartoon voice, \u201cI feel like a whole new bee!\u201dBumblebees come in many color combinations of yellow, brown, black and red, and only experts can tell one species from another. In some cases, only a microscopic examination of the male genitalia or DNA analysis can provide a definitive identification.But one restored bee has telltale dark color in a yellow patch on its side. Dr. Duennes and Ms. Watrous compared it to illustrations in a guidebook. They won\u2019t say what they think until they bring Dr. Woodard in to examine the bee.While waiting for Dr. Duennes to set up lines of bees for her impromptu Bombus test, I take advantage of the downtime to play foosball with Dr. Diez. He crushes me, and keeps bringing up this ignominy for the rest of the trip.Even though the long road to Prudhoe Bay is ahead, and a longer road back, when Dr. Woodard picks the right bee out of the lineup, Dr. Duennes is exultant.\u201cI am almost certain that\u2019s polaris!\u201dAfter scrupulously considering every possible objection to the identification, everyone in the group raises a glass to Dr. Duennes\u2019s toast: \u201cExtreme bees, extreme people.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of the rusty patched bumblebee. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the species as endangered in September; the agency did not classify it as such.Advertisement"}

Although the opposition controls the country\u2019s congress, Mr. Maduro and his allies dominate all the other institutions of government, including the courts and the electoral commission.Mr. Maduro, blamed by many Venezuelans for the country\u2019s economic collapse, has described the recall effort as a coup attempt.\u201cWe put up with abuses and we asked the people for patience, but they have crossed the line,\u201d said a furious Mr. Capriles, who is typically more measured in his public remarks. In a show of unity, he was surrounded by the leaders of other opposition parties.The electoral commission based its decision, announced late Thursday, on rulings by four regional courts that had accepted challenges to the validity of signatures that were collected earlier in the referendum process.At the same time, a court ordered eight opposition leaders, including Mr. Capriles, to remain in the country.The opposition was preparing a three-day campaign beginning Wednesday to gather the nearly four million signatures required to trigger the referendum, roughly 20 percent of voters.Instead, Mr. Capriles called on Venezuelans to begin a \u201cnational mobilization\u201d that day. \u201cWe said it, if they take away the right of the people, we were going to take Venezuela,\u201d he said.But he was short on specific proposals, promising only a special legislative session on Sunday.There was urgency to the referendum schedule. A majority vote, if the referendum to remove Mr. Maduro had been held this year, would have forced a new presidential election. Delaying it until next year would mean that Mr. Maduro\u2019s vice president would serve as president until 2019.As the electoral commission announced its decision, Mr. Maduro left for a Middle East tour to bolster support for oil production cuts that could raise prices.Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, a researcher at the Center for Development Studies at the Central University of Venezuela, said the commission had heightened the country\u2019s political conflict.\u201cThe government kicked the chessboard over, and now we\u2019re in another game,\u201d she said.Patricia Torres reported from Caracas and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

Sloan, with three new senior executives and an expanded financial-technology group reporting to him. That ostensibly puts Mr. Sloan in even better position to succeed the company\u2019s chief executive and his boss, John G. Stumpf. It is not clear, however, why an executive so closely linked to the fake-accounts scandal should lead the company.Mr. Sloan has been a member of Wells Fargo\u2019s operating committee for most of this decade, including the period when the bank started to fire 5,300 people for their roles in opening two million bogus bank and credit card accounts. His involvement might have been somewhat excused had he stayed head of commercial or wholesale banking, where he spent most of his career.As chief administrative officer from 2010 to 2011, however, Mr. Sloan\u2019s role included overseeing Wells Fargo\u2019s human resources and reputation management. He then became finance chief for three years. And one of his direct reports when he was promoted to chief operating officer last year was Carrie Tolstedt, who ran the offending community-banking division until earlier this year.That makes Mr. Sloan a member of the inner circle that would have known about the wrongdoing from its early days and tried to deal with it. This group hardly covered itself in glory: It was still handing out pink slips in 2016, five years after the first bankers were shown the door. Mr. Stumpf and Ms. Tolstedt have already ceded compensation for the mess. Investigations by the board and regulators may yet implicate Mr. Sloan and others.Mr. Stumpf has no more than two years left at the helm, based on the company\u2019s retirement-age rules. If it sticks with its internal heir apparent after all the dust settles on the rot at Wells Fargo, the bank will have to make the case for him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "General Electric Plans to Merge Its Oil and Gas Division With Baker Hughes", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byAs oil and gas companies work their way through the worst slump in their industry in more than two decades, General Electric is making a huge move to bolster its own business that serves those companies.The industrial conglomerate announced on Monday a deal to merge its oil and gas division with fellow services provider Baker Hughes, seeking to create a new giant in the field that could ride any recovery in oil prices.\u201cWe can weather the cycle in the short term and we will be very well positioned to lead the industry going forward,\u201d Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.\u2019s chief executive, told analysts.The complex transaction, coming months after the collapse of Baker Hughes\u2019s planned merger with another oil field services company, Halliburton, will create a much bigger provider of equipment and services across the entire span of oil production, from drilling to pipelines to refineries.Putting together G.E., which manufactures newer equipment and technology for the industry, and Baker Hughes, which has been a leading provider of traditional equipment like drill bits and pumps as well as other services, is meant to create a bigger rival to the likes of Schlumberger. Combined, the new company would have had revenue of $32 billion last year, compared with Schlumberger\u2019s $35.5 billion.It is meant both to give G.E. a significant stake in the oil business, especially if oil prices recover, while providing Baker Hughes shareholders with stock in a bigger, healthier company and a hefty cash dividend.\u201cThere was an unbelievable industrial logic,\u201d Mr. Immelt said in an interview. \u201cWhen we look back, both investor groups got something.\u201dStill, shares of Baker Hughes fell 6.3 percent on Monday, while G.E. shares slipped 0.4 percent.The deal takes place against the backdrop of the continued struggles in the oil industry. The slide in oil and natural gas prices forced exploration and production companies to decommission two-thirds of their drilling rigs, which the service companies operate along with hydraulic fracturing, piping, trucking, water, electrical and environmental operations. Schlumberger and Halliburton together have laid off a total of 85,000 workers since late 2014.While companies are now slowly deploying more rigs, as the price of oil has stabilized in recent months, technological improvements and economic necessity have made operations more efficient, driving down costs and the period of time necessary to drill a well. That may hurt the revenues of service companies in the future, along with tightening regulations and heightened environmental activism over rising concerns about climate change.More than 100 North American service companies have filed for bankruptcy over the last two years as the price of oil plummeted to under $50 a barrel from over $100 a barrel. In the last six months, 48 service companies have filed for bankruptcy, according to the Dallas law firm Haynes and Boone, including such industry leaders as Key Energy Services, Basic Energy Services and C&J Energy Services.\u201cThe margins for services have been razor thin and in some cases nonexistent,\u201d said Jonathan Garrett, principal analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. \u201cBut when you have companies of this size get together, there is a lot you can do with respect to cost reductions, and even in a more modest growth scenario begin to improve those margins.\u201dIn recent weeks, oil prices had strengthened on expectations that OPEC would either freeze or cut production when cartel members meet in late November. But prices fell on Monday after a meeting in Vienna on Saturday between OPEC countries and several outside producers, including Russia, Mexico and Brazil, failed to come up with an agreement to cooperate.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.The troubles in the oil market weighed on Baker Hughes\u2019s effort to merge with Halliburton, a deal that was announced in late 2014. As the two companies attempted to win the approval of antitrust regulators, they held discussions about potentially selling assets to G.E.After the Halliburton proposal fell apart this past spring, G.E. and Baker Hughes kept talking. G.E., which first entered the energy business two decades ago and built its operations in part through acquisitions, sought to bulk up what has been a relatively small division compared with Schlumberger, Baker Hughes or Halliburton.The industrial colossus wanted to retain a stake in the business. And so in meetings arranged on two continents \u2014 from Florence, Italy, to Houston to G.E.\u2019s campus in Crotonville, N.Y. \u2014 Mr. Immelt and a Baker Hughes team led by its chief executive, Martin Craighead, and the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Kimberly A. Ross, hammered out what became an unusual deal.Under the terms of the transaction, General Electric will fuse its oil and gas \u2014 and provide $7.4 billion in cash \u2014 with Baker Hughes, creating a new publicly traded partnership. G.E. would own 62.5 percent of the new company, while Baker Hughes shareholders would own 37.5 percent and receive a special dividend of $17.50 a share financed by the new cash.One potential issue hanging over the transaction is whether government regulators will approve the deal, since they blocked the merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes.Executives at both companies maintain that G.E.\u2019s move will not pose an antitrust issue, since the two businesses share little overlap.\u201cWe\u2019ve turned the page on that in so many ways,\u201d Mr. Craighead said of the Halliburton deal.Still, the companies said that they would be willing to sell off assets to assuage regulators\u2019 concerns, with an eye on completing the union by the middle of next year.Combining the two businesses is expected to add to G.E.\u2019s 2018 earnings by about 4 cents a share, while yielding an estimated $1.6 billion in cost savings by 2020.Lorenzo Simonelli, the head of G.E.\u2019s energy business, said the cost savings alone justify the merger, even if oil prices do not climb into triple digits again anytime soon.Mr. Craighead added: \u201cI\u2019d say the genius of this transaction is that, in its framework, it takes the timing risk off the table. No one knows where oil prices are going.\u201dLeading the business \u2014 referred to by the companies as the new Baker Hughes \u2014 will be Mr. Simonelli. Mr. Immelt will be chairman of the enlarged company\u2019s board and Mr. Craighead will be vice chairman.The new company will maintain dual headquarters in Houston and in London, the existing home of G.E.\u2019s oil and gas business.G.E. also said on Monday that it planned to sell its water business, which includes water treatment equipment.G.E. took advice from Centerview Partners and Morgan Stanley, and legal counsel from Shearman & Sterling. Baker Hughes relied upon Goldman Sachs and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell.An earlier version of this article misidentified the company with which G.E. kept talking this spring after the Halliburton proposal fell apart. It was Baker Hughes, not Halliburton.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Next Big Tech Corridor? Between Seattle and Vancouver, Planners Hope", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byVANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Seattle and Vancouver are like fraternal twins separated at birth. Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with eco-conscious populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers.Yet 140 miles of traffic-choked roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest.Now the political, academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring them closer together, with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America.\u201cVancouver has a lot more in common with Seattle than we do with Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, anywhere else in our country,\u201d Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, said in an interview. \u201cWe should make the most of those cultural commonalities.\u201dWhether their grand vision of a \u201cCascadia innovation corridor\u201d \u2014 which borrows its name from the region\u2019s Cascade mountain range \u2014 ever materializes, leaders on both sides of the border have motives for getting cozier immediately. American tech icons like Microsoft, with voracious needs for global engineering talent, are expanding their Vancouver offices, partly because of Canada\u2019s smoother immigration process.For its part, Vancouver wants to bring more American technology companies to the city in hopes of spinning out future entrepreneurs who will expand its comparatively small base of technology companies.\u201cWe have San Francisco real estate prices with the incomes of somewhere between Reno and Nashville,\u201d said Andy Yan, acting director of the city program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.On the thrumming streets of downtown Vancouver, signs of the Seattle region\u2019s growing economic ties to the city are hard to miss. A rectangular glass and steel office building with a large Microsoft sign occupies nearly an entire city block, sitting atop a large Nordstrom store (another Seattle brand).Microsoft says it invested $120 million in its new offices in Vancouver, which opened in June, and expects to spend $90 million more annually on wages and other operating costs. It plans to employ nearly 750 people in the city.Microsoft is hiring Canadians for the facility, but the country\u2019s more open immigration policies were an important factor in its investment, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview. Microsoft and other tech companies have long complained that the United States education system does not produce enough computer science graduates, forcing them to rely on immigrants from India, China and elsewhere.Foreign workers in the United States can wait about three times as long for a work visa as those in Canada do, the Boston Consulting Group estimates. And the prospect of Donald J. Trump winning the presidency has raised concerns among tech companies, because of the Republican candidate\u2019s comments about further restricting immigration to the United States.\u201cRight now, there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty about open immigration,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Last month, officials and executives from both cities huddled in a Vancouver hotel to discuss how to enable people, ideas and capital to flow more freely between them, as heedless of the international border separating the cities as a pod of orcas swimming in the sea.At the Cascadia conference, Ms. Clark and Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, signed an agreement to deepen the ties between Vancouver and Seattle, including more research collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and Satya Nadella, its current chief executive, talked about globalization and education.One proposal to deal with traffic between Vancouver and Seattle was for a high-speed rail line that would whisk travelers at more than 200 miles an hour between the cities in 57 minutes (it can take four hours or more by car). The details on financing the project \u2014 which could cost an estimated $30 billion or more \u2014 have not been worked out.With roots in timber and shipping, Vancouver\u2019s economy has diversified in recent decades with the growth of film and video game production. The city claims a tech \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 a start-up valued at over $1 billion \u2014 in Hootsuite, which makes social media tools.But Vancouver remains a relative small fry in tech, with about $1.78 billion in venture capital flowing into local tech start-ups in the last decade, compared with about $8.9 billion in Seattle, the research firm Pitchbook estimates.The housing market is showing signs of cooling off, though it is not yet clear how much of that is because of the tax. The total number of homes sold in the area in August dropped 26 percent from a year earlier and price growth has slowed, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Dennis Pilarinos, chief executive of Buddybuild, a Vancouver maker of developer tools for mobile apps, says affordability has been less of a problem for young tech workers, who may be willing to rent smaller apartments and live with roommates. But when start-ups get bigger, many struggle to recruit senior executives with families, said Mr. Pilarinos, who previously worked for Microsoft and Amazon in Vancouver.\u201cCompanies tend to run into scaling issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up with fewer Microsofts or Amazons.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Health Plan Costs to Increase by an Average of 25 Percent, U.S. Says", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Premiums for midlevel health plans under the Affordable Care Act will increase by an average of 25 percent next year, while consumers in some states will find significantly fewer insurance companies offering coverage, the federal government said Monday.But the Obama administration said three-fourths of consumers would still be able to find plans for less than $100 a month with the help of federal subsidies.The open enrollment period under President Obama\u2019s signature health law begins on Nov. 1, but consumers got their first look at their options on Monday. Consumers who go without insurance next year could face possible tax penalties of $700 a person or more.In many parts of the country, the available options are sure to become part of the political conversation in the election season\u2019s closing days. And the rising costs and shrinking options all but ensure that the next president will need to make significant adjustments to the health law, something both Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have promised.The average increase of 25 percent in benchmark premiums on the federal exchange compares with increases of 2 percent in 2015 and 7 percent this year. Major insurers have pulled out of the public marketplace in many states, citing multimillion-dollar losses, and state officials have approved rate increases of 25 to 50 percent or more for some insurers that remain.For a 27-year-old consumer, in the prime age group sought by insurers, the average monthly premium for a benchmark plan would be $302 next year, up from $242 this year, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services.\u201cWhile the president\u2019s allies in Washington will try to spin the numbers, families across the country will be forced to figure out how to pay for such unaffordable insurance,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who is an opponent of the Affordable Care Act and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over much of the law.The administration minimized the marketplace\u2019s troubles. Officials said people could lower their costs by seeking income-based subsidies in the form of tax credits and by switching to less expensive plans. While some markets will have few choices, consumers nationwide will see an average of 10 plans per insurer. Plans vary in cost and cover different doctors, hospitals and drugs.The Times would like to hear from Americans who are signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThe number of people eligible for tax credits will increase\u201d as premiums rise next year, and the amount of assistance will also increase, Kevin Griffis, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said.Under the federal health law, insurance plans are classified in four levels: bronze, silver, gold and platinum, depending on the amount of coverage.\u201cIf every returning consumer nationwide selected the lowest-cost plan within the same metal level they picked last year, average premiums \u2014 taking into account financial assistance \u2014 would fall by $28 per month, or 20 percent, compared with 2016,\u201d Kathryn E. Martin, an acting assistant secretary of health and human services, said.Laura M. Schlett, 44, of Brandon, Miss., a suburb of Jackson, said she was losing coverage because her insurer, UnitedHealth, was pulling out of the public marketplace there, as in many other states.Ms. Schlett said that she received a subsidy of $110 a month and spent $240 a month for health insurance with a $3,000 deductible this year.\u201cI can\u2019t afford to get sick after paying for the health insurance,\u201d Ms. Schlett said.In Phoenix, only one insurer, Health Net, a subsidiary of Centene, is listed on HealthCare.gov, and it is offering only four plans for 2017. A Phoenix family of four with income of $62,000 a year could obtain a premium tax credit of $1,079 a month next year, but would still owe $342 a month, or roughly $4,100 a year, and the policy has an annual deductible of $14,100 for the family, according to HealthCare.gov.In Raleigh, N.C., 18 plans are available for 2017 from two insurers, but the premiums could be a substantial expense for some consumers. For a 53-year-old man with income of $53,000 a year, the cheapest midlevel silver plan will cost $714 a month, or $8,568 a year, according to the federal website, and no subsidy would be available.But a man of the same age with income of $25,000 a year could get a subsidy of $639 a month, reducing his premium to $75 a month, or $900 a year.In Eugene, Ore., the cheapest silver plan available to a 35-year-old man has a full, unsubsidized premium of $348 a month, or $4,176 a year, and an annual deductible of $3,000. A total of 14 plans are available from two insurers.In Charleston, W.Va., consumers have a choice of 16 plans offered by two insurers. For a 40-year-old woman, the cheapest silver plan has a full, unsubsidized premium of $505 a month, or $6,060 a year, and an annual deductible of $6,150. If the woman has annual income of $30,000, she could get a subsidy of $326 a month, but would still owe premiums of $179 a month, or about $2,150 a year.Stabilizing the insurance marketplace could be a major challenge for Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for president, if she wins, as opinion polls suggest she will.The assurances by the Obama administration on Monday differed in tone from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks on the campaign trail. She has supported the Affordable Care Act, but denounced \u201cskyrocketing out-of-pocket health costs\u201d and said the federal government should have the power to block or modify unreasonable rate increases so coverage would be more affordable.Advertisement"}

His father retired as a professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center, where he chaired the romance languages department.Mr. DiCamillo first noticed Ms. Kennedy running on a treadmill at a gym in the West Village in 2012.\u201cI was very impressed with her speed and athleticism, and she was extremely beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people walk and talk on their phones when they are on the treadmill, but she was sprinting. I was intrigued and captivated at the same time.\u201d\u201cHe introduced himself and was just about to make his big move on me when we were interrupted by my mom, who called me on my cell,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cI told him I had to take the call and asked if he could watch my stuff, and I guess that kind of took the wind out of his sails.\u201dBut she returned a half-hour later to find that Mr. DiCamillo was not about to give up.\u201cHe didn\u2019t waste any time, he came right over and asked if I wanted to go out for a drink sometime,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cHe seemed nice and I thought he was really cute, so I said: \u2018Sure, why not. I\u2019ll give you my number.\u2019\u201dLater that week, they met at a wine bar in the West Village, where they both lived.\u201cI thought he was adorable and very funny,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cWe talked about dorky things like Nintendo and \u2018Lord of the Rings,\u2019 but I came to find out later that he is not really as big a fan of those things as I am, or half as dorky as I am. He was just being nice.\u201dBut Ms. Kennedy had a serious side to her that Mr. DiCamillo admired.\u201cShe is very well read, very worldly and extremely intelligent,\u201d he said.In the summer of 2014, Ms. Kennedy said that she and Mr. DiCamillo \u201cquickly became a family\u201d after she adopted Boomer, a rescued black lab/pit bull mix. In September of that year, they visited Italy and Ireland together, and the next month, he took her to a Michigan football game.\u201cIt was freezing out there and those Michigan fans are nuts,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said. \u201cBut we had the best time.\u201dOn Dec. 30, 2015, which was Mr. DiCamillo\u2019s birthday, he shocked Ms. Kennedy by proposing at the Top of the Standard lounge in Manhattan.\u201cHow could she refuse me?\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my birthday, and she was my gift.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Rodrigo Duterte and Philippines May \u2018Pivot\u2019 Away From U.S.", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, one of America\u2019s closest allies in Asia, has said he wants to reduce American military influence in his country and build closer ties with China.But he has stopped short of offering to do what China would like most: scrapping an accord that gives the United States access to five military bases in the Philippines.Mr. Duterte has expressed doubts about whether the United States would come to the aid of the Philippines in a military showdown, and on the eve of his departure for Beijing he said he would be looking to buy Chinese weapons in his fight against terrorism.Thailand, another American ally in Southeast Asia, has also increasingly turned toward China, raising the prospect that Washington faces frayed ties with two of its longstanding partners in the region.How well China succeeds with Mr. Duterte will send signals throughout the region, where robust economic relationships with China are vital for most countries even as they fear its growing military clout \u2014 and its push for control of the South China Sea.In particular, Mr. Zhu said, China would like the Philippines to stop American use of an air base at Palawan, an island about 100 miles from the disputed Spratly Islands, where China has built three military bases.The Palawan base significantly enhances the ability of American forces to project power into the disputed South China Sea, and anything that jeopardized that access would complicate United States military planning.President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has a reputation for frank speechmaking that often angers the international community.He has said he wants the Chinese to construct a railway in his home province of Mindanao, and from the capital, Manila, to Mindanao. A Chinese businessman has financed a huge drug rehabilitation center scheduled to open next month, a project that Mr. Duterte praised as a symbol of Chinese friendship.A large contingent of Philippine businessmen accompanying Mr. Duterte is expecting the Chinese to lift bans on more than two dozen fruits, imposed by Beijing four years ago in retaliation against the former government for its stance on the South China Sea.How smoothly the talks proceed may depend on how well the two leaders, the rough-talking and ad hoc Mr. Duterte, 71, and the tightly scripted Mr. Jinping, 63, get along.Early on, Mr. Duterte showed his desire to improve relations with China by appointing Santiago Sta. Romana, a former bureau chief for the American ABC television network in Beijing, as his new ambassador to Beijing.Mr. Romana, 68, commonly known as Chito, lived in Beijing from 1971 until his retirement from ABC in 2010. On his return to Manila, he called for a more nuanced approach to China as head of the Philippine Association of Chinese Studies.\u201cThe Philippines is shifting from a very close and tight alignment with the United States that made it seem we were part of the anti-China coalition,\u201d Mr. Romana said in an interview. \u201cThe pendulum may swing toward China. The alliance with the U.S. will stay. Relations with China were frozen from 2013, but now we will resume all types of dialogue.\u201dChina has denounced the decision and vowed to ignore it. In contrast, the tribunal ruling seems to be one issue on which Mr. Duterte is consistent: He has said the Philippines will abide by it.In its ruling, the tribunal said that both Philippine and Chinese fishermen had traditional fishing rights at the shoal, and that China had interfered with those rights by blocking access for the Philippine fishermen.The notion of the Philippines granting China sovereignty over Scarborough Shoal may be a step too far for Mr. Duterte: He has said that it belongs to the Philippines, and that he would even drive a Jet Ski to plant the national flag there.Left unsaid by Mr. Wu was China\u2019s ambition to start reclamation work at Scarborough Shoal and transform it into a military platform.Such construction by China had been expected in the wake of the tribunal\u2019s decision. But that plan appears to have been postponed by the election of Mr. Duterte.China would meddle with Mr. Duterte\u2019s ties to the United States by extending generous economic inducements and offering a deal on the South China Sea, he said. But on one important item, Mr. Duterte would almost certainly prove an obstacle.\u201cDuterte is putting China on the spot,\u201d Dr. De Castro said. \u201cIf they do military construction at Scarborough Shoal, that would drive Mr. Duterte back to the United States.\u201dYufan Huang contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Costa Rica", "Date": "2016-09-28", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate21 PhotosA THREE-BEDROOM HOME OVERLOOKING LAKE ARENAL IN COSTA RICA $995,000 This two-level home, completed in 2014, is in a gated development in Nuevo Arenal, a small town on the north shore of Lake Arenal in the northern highlands of Costa Rica. Built of concrete and steel on just under a half-acre, the 3,000-square-foot house has extensive views of the 33-square-mile lake and the Tilar\u00e1n mountain range.The main one-bedroom home occupies the top floor. Two private guest suites are on the lower level, along with a shared common area that could be used as a den or rec room, said Trent Deushane, an owner of Team Realty, in Nuevo Arenal. His business partner, Javier Ruiz, was the architect for the house, which is being sold furnished.The attached two-car garage provides entry, as does the arched doorway at the main entrance, which opens into a large foyer with a powder room. The L-shape living area is open, with a back wall of windows and glass doors that open onto a terrace. The great room has a large fireplace and looks out over a saltwater pool. The adjoining dining area is also open to the kitchen, which has granite counters, a center island, two granite sinks and travertine stone floors. A pantry provides a second refrigerator and additional storage.The master suite has two walk-in closets, a laundry room and a bath with a tub, a shower, an enclosed toilet and double sinks. A door leads outside to a private garden shower.The deep covered veranda across the back of the house has beamed Spanish cedar ceilings, ceiling fans and floors made of coralina, a fossilized stone from the Dominican Republic.The guest suites on the lower level have separate entrances, making them particularly suitable for long-term stays, Mr. Deushane said. Each has a bedroom, a full bath, a kitchenette and a covered veranda, along with access to a second laundry room.The pool has an infinity-edge waterfall that drops down to the guest level. The flow can be turned up or down through a pumping system.The gated development has 35 lots in all; 12 are still available, at prices ranging from $35,000 to $110,000, according to Mr. Deushane. All utilities are underground.Development along the shoreline is restricted, so Lake Arenal is very clean and quiet. (It was dramatically expanded in the 1970s to allow for a hydroelectric dam that continues to supply electricity.) A park in central Nuevo Arenal \u2014 a three-minute drive \u2014 provides lake access and has a legal boat ramp. The shoreline tends to be muddy, so people often go out in a boat to swim, Mr. Deushane said.There are no fuel docks on the lake, and boating activity largely consists of fishermen and kayakers, said Robert Lux, an owner of Moran Real Estate, in Nuevo Arenal. The windy west end of the lake is known for windsurfing and kite-surfing.The area shares its name with the Arenal Volcano, an active stratovolcano that, while in a passive phase since around 2010, continues to be a highly popular tourist attraction. About a 45-minute drive from Nuevo Arenal, the volcano is within a 30,000-acre national park with a viewing observatory and hiking trails. The tourist town of La Fortuna at its base has multiple commercial hot springs facilities.The closest international airport is in Liberia, roughly a 90-minute drive. But the airport in San Jos\u00e9, which is twice as far, tends to have cheaper flight options, so some residents choose to go there, Mr. Deushane said.MARKET OVERVIEWWhile the housing market in the lake area has improved this year after a long, recession-induced slump, it\u2019s still \u201ca tremendous buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Mr. Lux said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of real estate for sale.\u201dCosta Rica does not have a multiple listing service, so sales volume and price data are not easily tracked.Prices in the lake area tend to be more moderate than in the popular beach towns along Costa Rica\u2019s Pacific coast. American-style homes start at around $160,000, Mr. Lux said. The handful of properties priced at or over $1 million front the lake.Foreign buyers commonly spend between $250,000 and $400,000 for a two- or three-bedroom home in a gated development.\u201cPeople rarely buy over $500,000 here,\u201d Mr. Lux said. \u201cMost of them are retirees. They\u2019ve sold homes in the States and don\u2019t want to invest that much in a foreign country.\u201dWHO BUYS IN NUEVO ARENALNuevo Arenal is increasingly popular with retirees from the United States and Canada. The climate is pleasant, without the very high temperatures found in some other parts of the country, and the cost of living is lower than in the beach towns, partly because homes do not have to be air-conditioned, Mr. Lux said. What\u2019s more, he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t get hurricanes. We do get a lot of rain, but no flooding.\u201dHe estimated that 20 percent of the population in the broader lake area comes from the United States, Canada, France, Germany and Belgium.Foreigners may apply for residency, which allows them to come and go more easily, and to receive government health benefits. In order to qualify, applicants must meet one of three requirements: have at least $200,000 invested in Costa Rican real estate, be receiving at least $1,000 a month in Social Security benefits, or be willing to deposit $60,000 in a Costa Rican financial institution, according to Gonzalo Viquez Jr., a real estate lawyer in San Jos\u00e9. The approval process usually takes six to 18 months, he said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Costa Rica, Mr. Viquez said. \u201cBut I always tell my clients, don\u2019t leave your brain in the plane,\u201d he added. \u201cDo your due diligence.\u201d In particular, he said, buyers should make sure that a title search is done to check for any liens or encumbrances, and that the property is walked by a surveyor to confirm boundary lines.Buyers should hire their own notary \u2014 in Costa Rica, all notaries are lawyers \u2014 rather than use the one who represents the seller. Legal fees are typically around 1.25 percent of the purchase price, Mr. Viquez said.Foreign buyers often form a corporation to purchase property, partly because it makes transfers easier. \u201cThat way, it won\u2019t get stuck in a probate procedure if something were to happen,\u201d he said.Most buyers pay cash; Mr. Viquez recommends having funds wired to an escrow company. Mortgages are not easy to obtain, and interest rates are high compared to those in the United States. However, these days more sellers are offering their own short-term financing, usually for periods of one to five years, he said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; col\u00f3n ($1 = 550 col\u00f3n). The United States dollar is widely accepted.TAXES AND FEESBuyers pay government transfer fees of about 2.4 percent of the purchase price or the appraisal, whichever is higher, Mr. Viquez said. These fees are often split between buyer and seller.Property taxes are extremely low, at 0.25 percent of the declared value of the property, which is based on land and construction costs, not the appraised value, Mr. Deushane said. The annual taxes on this property are between $900 and $1,000. Homeowner association fees are $50 a month.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Secret Doors and Hidden Rooms", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported by360 ViewI have a recurring real estate dream in which I find an extra room in my home, tucked behind a door I have never noticed before.The d\u00e9cor inside is usually worn and dated, with shag carpeting, wood paneling and terrible lighting. But the room\u2019s potential never escapes me. All my clutter troubles are solved. Finally, I have space.Then I wake up to a reality shared by many New Yorkers: There are no hidden rooms to house all the junk currently shoved in those plastic bins under the bed.There must be others. How else did Eloise putter around the Plaza Hotel with such ease in those children\u2019s stories? And how did Katie Holmes miraculously appear with a shopping cart in Whole Foods in Chelsea without ever walking through the front door?But such things are not just the stuff of imagination and intrigue. Last year, Sandra Williams and Frank Milliron bought and renovated a two-family Victorian in Ditmas Park. During the project, their contractor tore out a wall on the second floor, and to their surprise, revealed unfinished space behind it. The space had a sloped ceiling beneath the dormered roof and amounted to a sprawling unfinished attic, measuring 23-by-11 feet. An ambitious homeowner could raise the roof, which is over six feet at its highest point, and make it a full-height room \u2014 or a small child could use it as a hide-out. \u201cWe saw the space and thought \u2018This is magical,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Williams.The couple already had whimsical aspirations for the home, building a tiny door in the back of their daughter\u2019s bedroom closet that opened into the back of their own. \u201cWe thought it was really cool if I could disappear through the closet,\u201d said Ms. Williams, who likened the doorway to the wardrobe in C. S. Lewis\u2019s \u201cThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u201dFor Ms. Williams, the discovered room became another opportunity to create a home \u201cwith quirks\u201d for their daughter Emme Milliron, who is now 3. (The family now also has a 5-month-old son, Owen Milliron.)The discovered space could have become a playroom, complete with a door disguised as a bookshelf, like \u201can eerie Victorian entrance to a secret room,\u201d said Ms. Williams, who works in fashion and has a clear flair for the dramatic. Mr. Milliron is a property manager.Secret spaces are not just in the past. Some developers have designed hidden doors and passages into their recent projects.\u201cThrough a secret door, they can experience another world,\u201d said Robert Vecsler, the president of residential development for Silverstein Properties, which developed the 82-story tower.Indeed, the stairwell feels like a threshold between two worlds \u2014 an innocuous space where the serene black-and-white marble lobby of the condo ends and the boisterous energy of the hotel begins.It\u2019s not just New Yorkers who want to disappear into other worlds. Films and books are rife with fantastical destinations. Harry Potter\u2019s Hogwarts School exists in a world accessible by an invisible train platform. What would \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d be without the rabbit tunnel? \u201cThe Secret Garden.\u201d \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby.\u201d \u201cClue.\u201d \u201cPanic Room.\u201d The list goes on.\u201cHumans all are on a quest for a secret space,\u201d said Elizabeth Goodenough, a lecturer at the University of Michigan and the editor of \u201cSecret Spaces of Childhood\u201d (University of Michigan Press, 2003). Without such retreats, \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of not growing or developing into our true selves.\u201dThroughout history, hideaways have not just been a novelty, they have also provided a lifeline for people fleeing war, persecution and slavery. I grew up hearing tales of my great-grandmother hiding in a spot beneath the floorboards of her home during pogroms in Odessa. We would never have had Anne Frank\u2019s diary if not for the attic that, for a time, shielded the Frank family and their companions from their terrible fate.Consider the Underground Railroad. Its very name conjures an image of a clandestine tunnel winding its way through the American landscape. Stories of hollows tucked behind walls and in the cellars of old homes have become part of a collective (and sometimes unreliable) narrative.\u201cThat would seem very likely to me,\u201d said Dr. Sinha, largely because the church\u2019s first pastor, Henry Ward Beecher, \u201cclearly was involved with the fugitive slave issue.\u201dIn an era of mass government surveillance, hacked emails and Facebook over-sharing, secret hideaways take on a new significance. \u201cWe live in an age of surveillance and insecurity, so that idea of hiding has taken on a kind of scary potential,\u201d said Dr. Goodenough.Others have something to hide, like the New Yorker who asked Mr. Humble to disguise a laundry room to conceal her washer and dryer from the super, since the building prohibited such appliances.These spaces do not come cheap. Sara Nainzadeh spent $25,000 adding a camouflaged door designed by Creative Home Engineering in her three-bedroom apartment on 15th Street and Fifth Avenue.Walk inside her master bedroom, and the wall-length bookshelf looks unassuming enough. But tug on a copy of Shel Silverstein\u2019s \u201cA Light in the Attic\u201d and a portion of it swings open, revealing another full bedroom. Ms. Nainzadeh, who works in finance, uses the room as an office and stores her safe there. Mostly, she likes having a retreat. \u201cSometimes I lock myself in there and relax,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in there, you really don\u2019t hear anything else going on in the apartment.\u201d\u201cI never have enough space for books,\u201d said Mr. Watson, whose portraits of luminaries like Alfred Hitchcock, Andy Warhol, B.B. King and David Bowie have filled the pages of numerous books and magazines. The photographer claimed another 72 square feet of space for his collection by adding shelves to an 8-foot-high door separating the library from the guest room. Still, stacks of books are piled around the apartment, and even more are in storage.Sitting in the library, you would never know that part of the wall-length bookshelf opens. When overnight guests come to visit, some are baffled after he brings them to his library. \u201cI\u2019ve actually had a relative say, \u2018Where\u2019s the bed?\u2019 \u201d And that\u2019s when he surprises them, pushing open part of the wall of books to reveal a serene bedroom behind it.\u201cIt\u2019s quite fun because it\u2019s so unexpected,\u201d said Robby Browne, an associate broker with Corcoran Group, the listing agent for Mr. Watson\u2019s apartment, which has been on the market since January. \u201cIf you shut the door, you feel like you\u2019re in a whole other world.\u201dI asked Mr. Watson if he planned to incorporate any covert escape routes into the museum. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is a secret passageway from the museum to my house.\u201dFor some people, the notion that you might be able to have a private world all your own can be hard to resist \u2014 it\u2019s like a game of hide-and-seek, but for grown-ups. \u201cEvery guy wants to be James Bond,\u201d said Mr. Humble of Creative Home Engineering. \u201cThe secretive element of it is just alluring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But to others, despite a raft of powerful exhibits on the oppression of indigenous peoples in Canada, the museum could do more to address the nation\u2019s uncomfortable truths about its past and present dealings with the descendants of the land\u2019s original inhabitants.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the museum reflects a fundamental problem in Canada,\u201d said Craig Benjamin, an indigenous rights campaigner for Amnesty International. \u201cCanada has long turned a blind eye to extreme violations of indigenous people\u2019s rights. The national conversation about the depths of the crime \u2014 and the urgency of redress \u2014 is only just beginning to happen.\u201dThe first national museum built outside Ottawa, the Canadian capital, the structure is an architectural tour de force, a hulking edifice of limestone and glass, designed to resemble a cloud wrapped around a mountain and topped by a gleaming spire said to symbolize hope.The museum, the brainchild of a Winnipeg media magnate who was inspired by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., was largely financed by private donors.Rather than commemorate a specific event or regional history, the museum aims to educate visitors about the meaning of human rights through an array of themes, such as the struggle for legal rights in Canada and freedom of expression. \u201cIt can never be all people want it to be,\u201d said Maureen Fitzhenry, a museum spokeswoman.Unlike in the United States, where the struggles of Native Americans, who make up less than 2 percent of the population, only occasionally enter the national debate, the issues facing aboriginal Canadians are a prominent and highly politicized aspect of society.Rather than having a single exhibit highlight the subjugation of indigenous peoples and detail its contemporary impact, the museum weaves such issues into broader narratives about the fight for justice.Its largest gallery, Canadian Journeys, examines the \u201csteps and missteps on the road to greater rights for everyone in Canada,\u201d according to the museum\u2019s marketing materials. Booths include stories on gay rights, the nation\u2019s Japanese internment camps during World War II, the reclamation of land by the aboriginal Inuit, the Underground Railroad and a devastating film on residential schools that shows former Prime Minister Stephen Harper making an official apology in 2008.But such curation has done little to quell the frustration of activists like Ms. Gazan, 44, whose father was a Dutch Holocaust survivor and whose mother is a member of the Wood Mountain Lakota Nation, based in the neighboring province of Saskatchewan.\u201cAs a Jew, I see my history acknowledged, but as an indigenous person, I see my history left up to debate,\u201d she said last month as she walked through a gallery devoted to the Holocaust.Critics say little in the museum addresses the continuing discrimination. \u201cYou get a sense that in the past there were some mistakes and everything\u2019s fine now,\u201d said Karen Busby, director of the Center for Human Rights Research at the University of Manitoba.Rita Johnson, a planner who helped design the exhibits before the museum opened, said museum officials, fearing for their jobs, demanded that employees tone down or remove unfavorable content.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what\u2019s in here given the amount of pre-emptive censorship,\u201d she said while strolling through the museum recently.Museum officials deny allegations of political interference. They say that the content went through a yearslong development process devised to ensure a nonpartisan narrative, and that what is on display reflects the need to incorporate a broad range of global topics. Ms. Fitzhenry, the museum spokeswoman, cited the dozens of exhibits that showcase past and current aboriginal issues.\u201cWe talk about government apologies as acknowledgments of historic wrongs,\u201d she said, \u201cbut do not imply that these constitute sufficient redress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Carlyle Group Turns Focus From Hedge Funds to Lending", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byProminent public pension funds have turned their backs on hedge funds, and so have a few big insurance companies. Now, one of the world\u2019s biggest private equity firms, the Carlyle Group, is walking away, too.Carlyle told investors this week that it was pivoting away from its hedge fund investments, once worth $15 billion. Speaking to investors, the Carlyle co-founder William E. Conway Jr. said the firm\u2019s performance in hedge funds did not meet the expectations of its investors. \u201cAnd when our performance falls short, it is critical for both our fund investors and for the firm that we deal with the consequences,\u201d Mr. Conway said.Six years ago, with its coffers swelling, Carlyle turned to hedge funds as part of a move to diversify from the core business of buying companies and taking them private. It took stakes in hedge fund firms that invested in corporate bonds, commodities like natural gas and coal, and emerging markets, taking a cut of the fees investors paid to the fund firms.But that experiment soured, and for the last two years Carlyle\u2019s hedge fund investments have weighed down its bottom line. After a strategic review, Carlyle, which manages $169 billion, decided to close its hedge fund chapter and focus more on direct lending. It joins a growing list of investors who are reducing their exposure to hedge funds or getting out completely, faced with high fees and weak performance or even losses.Over all, hedge funds have underperformed the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for seven consecutive years. The average hedge fund returned 4.14 percent this year through September, according to the Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, the broadest gauge of hedge fund performance. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index gained 8 percent over that period, accounting for reinvested dividends.Against this backdrop, more investors are leaving. On Wednesday, Rhode Island voted to pull $585 million of its money out of a handful of hedge fund firms. The Kentucky Retirement Systems decided this month to withdraw its hedge fund investments over the next three years. And the New Jersey Investment Council said it planned to take nearly $2 billion out of hedge fund investments. Insurance companies like MetLife and the American International Group have asked funds for their money back, too.More than $50 billion has flowed out of the industry this year, according to Hedge Fund Research. In the latest financial quarter investors took $28 billion, the biggest quarterly outflow since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, the research firm said.Carlyle\u2019s first big investment in a hedge fund firm was Claren Road Asset Management, which was founded by four star Citigroup traders in December 2010. Carlyle took a majority stake. A few months later, it bought a stake in the Emerging Sovereign Group (E.S.G.), which started with a seed investment from Julian H. Robertson, the billionaire investor.But over the last two years, nearly $8 billion has flowed out of Claren Road. It is bracing for another $1 billion to be withdrawn in the next few quarters. This year, it announced plans to cut ties with E.S.G., selling its majority stake in the $3.5 billion hedge fund. Last year, Carlyle split with the Vermillion founders Chris Nygaard and Andrew Gilbert after deciding to redirect the business toward commodity financing and away from managing money. By the end of the year, its assets in hedge funds are expected to total just $1 billion.Carlyle may still face challenges in its global markets strategies unit, and its pivot to lending from hedge funds has been met with some skepticism. During a phone call with analysts after its third-quarter earnings announcement this week, an analyst from JPMorgan Chase questioned whether Carlyle\u2019s experiment in hedge funds might be repeated in its new venture into lending.\u201cI think in hindsight, you were late to hedge funds, made significant investments and it didn\u2019t end well,\u201d the analyst said, adding, \u201cWhy is this different?\u201dIn response, Mr. Conway emphasized that Carlyle had better expertise in private markets, its traditional business, than in the public markets in which its hedge fund investments were mainly invested.Christopher W. Ullman, a spokesman for the firm said: \u201cWe\u2019re building on well-established firmwide strengths. This is a long-term strategic commitment. Credit is an attractive asset class and always will be.\u201dA picture caption on Friday with an article about the Carlyle Group\u2019s decision to pivot away from hedge fund investments transposed the names of the Carlyle executives shown.

{"Headline": "The Limits of Deutsche\u2019s Troubles Show Reform Is Working", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsDeutsche Bank\u2019s jitters have revived memories of 2008.As in that turbulent autumn eight years ago, investor confidence in one of the world\u2019s largest lenders has been shaken. Deutsche\u2019s share price has dropped, and hedge funds are reported to be withdrawing spare cash. The assurances of the chief executive, John Cryan, that the bank has \u201cstrong fundamentals\u201d echo the illusory reassurances issued by the bosses of Lehman Brothers and Royal Bank of Scotland before those institutions failed.Yet despite its many problems, Deutsche is far better equipped to absorb a shock than it was eight years ago. So is the financial system as a whole. This is because of the efforts of bank regulators.After the collapses and bailouts of 2008, watchdogs set out to make the banks more resilient. They forced lenders to raise more capital and maintain greater reserves of liquid assets that could be sold in a panic. They reduced links between banks by forcing derivatives into centralized clearinghouses. And they embarked on the legal and administrative challenge of ensuring that even a large lender could be safely allowed to fail.This push is far from perfect and far from complete: Regulators are still squabbling over the way banks measure their capital requirements. So far, no large lender has been allowed to fail.Nevertheless, to see how standards have been raised, look at Deutsche\u2019s balance sheet. At the end of June 2007, just before the crisis began to ripple through global capital markets, it had Tier 1 capital of 26 billion euros ($29 billion) and total assets of 1.9 trillion euros. Nine years later, its balance sheet is slightly smaller, but its Tier 1 capital has almost doubled to 48 billion euros. Deutsche can absorb bigger losses before putting its depositors\u2019 cash at risk.Liquidity buffers have also been bolstered. In a note to employees on Sept. 30, Mr. Cryan said the bank had liquid assets of more than 215 billion euros \u2014 cash and securities that can be sold quickly if depositors or counterparties ask for their money back. Back in 2007, that figure was just 65 billion euros \u2014 though liquidity regulation was so patchy that Deutsche did not report its reserves in a single number at the time.Then there are capital-like instruments designed to absorb unexpected losses. Deutsche has issued about 5 billion euros\u2019 worth of bonds that can be written down if its equity falls below a minimum level. Those securities have fallen in value since it emerged that the Justice Department was threatening the bank with a $14 billion fine over mortgage securities. But there is little sign of panic. Compare that with 2009, when Deutsche\u2019s decision not to redeem a hybrid bond prompted a marketwide sell-off in similar forms of bank debt.Deutsche\u2019s problems have had relatively few reverberations in other corners of finance. Despite many headlines questioning the stability of the bank, which the International Monetary Fund says is the biggest contributor to systemic risk, there are few signs that Deutsche\u2019s problems are spreading to other lenders. The bank\u2019s shares have fallen 11 percent since news of the pending Justice Department settlement emerged. The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index is down less than 1 percent over the same period.It is possible that, as in 2007, investors have failed to recognize the severity of the situation. But it is more likely that years of planning and stress testing \u2013 by regulators and by banks themselves \u2013 have given the system better shock absorbers.Regulators cannot rest on their laurels, though. Unlike in 2008, Deutsche\u2019s problems do not stem from the quality of its assets. Rather, the bank faces concerns about its future profitability, which in turn affects its ability to absorb a large fine.Second, there is no suggestion at present that Deutsche will cease to function. So markets are likely to be spared what would be the ultimate test, one in which regulators decide that a big bank should be wound down.Third, regulators have contributed to Deutsche\u2019s woes. The same rules that force it to hold more equity have also undermined its capital markets business, driving down its return on equity and making it harder for the bank to attract fresh capital. Negative interest rates in the eurozone have depressed margins. And it was the prospect of an enormous fine imposed by American authorities that prompted the latest crisis.Despite superficial parallels with 2008, Deutsche\u2019s woes appear contained. That is a testimony to eight years of trying to make banks and the broader financial system safer. If a broader crisis is averted, it will be in part because the new rules are working as they were meant to.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Matthew\u2019s Toll Rises; Flooding Hits North Carolina", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported by\u25a0 More than 650,000 customers remain without electricity, according to local utilities, with about half of those in North Carolina and Virginia.Mr. McCrory said Tuesday that an enormous swath of North Carolina was in turmoil.\u201cCertain parts of the state were going through recovery at this point in time,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cCertain parts of the state were still going through ongoing floods. And now we have other parts of the state that are about to deal with some very serious circumstances, especially along two of our major rivers.\u201dMr. McCrory said that state officials were especially worried about residents in and near Goldsboro, Greenville and Rocky Mount, where flooding was expected throughout the week. And with North Carolina\u2019s fatality count rising, often because of vehicles that become submerged, Mr. McCrory pleaded with residents to avoid driving through flooded areas.\u201cIf we say the water\u2019s coming and we say do not drive through that water, we mean it,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cDo not go through water. We\u2019ve had over 10 people killed as a result of that. We are not messing around, and we do not want to put people at risk to save you once you\u2019ve made that decision.\u201dHe continued: \u201cToo many people have died, and we don\u2019t want anymore to die. Yet there are going to be conditions during the next 72 hours which will be extremely dangerous.\u201dThree people are missing, the governor said.Mr. McCrory also said that a state trooper had fatally shot a man in Lumberton on Monday night after \u201ca confrontation.\u201d The governor said that state officials were investigating the shooting and that it had occurred in a flooded area that emergency workers were trying to traverse in a Humvee.\u201cAll we know is there was a confrontation and a shooting that has resulted in a man\u2019s death in very, very difficult circumstances,\u201d the governor said.More than 2,000 people have been rescued since the flooding began in North Carolina, nearly 100 people by aircrews. Evacuation orders were widespread, and the state authorities moved nearly 800 inmates from a prison near the Neuse River.The governor said it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that about 50 or 60 people were resisting demands that they leave a part of Moore County where a dam was at risk of failing.\u201cGet out,\u201d Mr. McCrory said. \u201cGet out now.\u201dThe White House said on Monday night that President Obama had signed a federal disaster declaration for 31 counties.Mr. McCrory said on Tuesday that about 282,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, and parts of Interstate 40 and Interstate 95 remained closed.A federal judge on Monday extended Florida\u2019s voter registration deadline by one day, delivering a quick legal victory to Democrats who argued that the storm had upended plans to draw more people into the political process in one of the nation\u2019s most closely contested states.In a strongly worded ruling, Judge Mark E. Walker of Federal District Court in Tallahassee said residents would be allowed to join the voter rolls until 5 p.m. Wednesday.\u201cThis case pits the fundamental right to vote against administrative convenience,\u201d Judge Walker wrote. \u201cOf course, the State of Florida has the ability to set its own deadlines and has an interest in maintaining those deadlines. But it would be nonsensical to prioritize those deadlines over the right to vote, especially given the circumstances here.\u201dSeveral rivers in eastern North Carolina broke out of their banks on Monday, after weekend rainfalls of up to 16 inches in places, the National Weather Service reported. Some rivers reached record heights, and in some places, the waters are expected to keep rising for days as the floods move downstream.The Cape Fear River south of Fayetteville crested on Monday at more than 26 feet above flood stage; farther downstream, near Chinquapin, the river was forecast to rise through Wednesday.To the northeast, the Neuse River reached more than eight feet above flood stage near Goldsboro on Monday, and it was projected to rise another two feet, peaking on Tuesday near its record. Downstream, near Kinston, the Neuse rose more than seven feet above flood stage and was expected to climb five feet more, not cresting until Saturday.The Lumber River at Lumberton rose four feet higher than it had ever been measured. The Little River at Manchester broke its previous record by three feet.Storm surge and battering waves can devastate beaches and the dunes behind them. When Hurricane Matthew raked the coasts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, it carved away some beaches \u2014 though it left others relatively untouched.Brevard County, Fla., home to Cocoa Beach, the Kennedy Space Center and other tourist attractions, lost about one million cubic yards of sand from its 72 miles of beaches, said Virginia Barker, the county\u2019s natural resources management director. While the number is large, the damage was less than that caused by Hurricane Sandy or the storms that passed through in 2004 and 2005. Matthew \u201cwas more of a glancing blow,\u201d Ms. Barker said.It helped that the storm hit at a very low spot in the tide cycle, she said, and that the storm moved quickly. Also, she said, it was especially fortunate that \u201cour beaches were in really good shape before the storm,\u201d with beach and dune replenishment programs in place since 2000. \u201cWe talk about them being \u2018sacrificial sands,\u2019\u201d she said, a kind of environmental crumple zone to blunt storm damage.Environmental officials in states farther north said their coastal evaluations were still underway. Mary-Kathryn Craft, a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, said that early reports indicated that \u201cerosion is rather extensive throughout the coast,\u201d and that many state beaches \u201cwere already experiencing significant sand deficits and chronic erosion.\u201d10 PhotosAdvertisement"}

Trump hasn\u2019t released his tax returns, we don\u2019t know exactly what portion of his fortune he has sent the federal government. But in the second presidential debate, he confirmed that there were a number of years where he paid nothing at all.But conservatives who want to starve the government actively obscure the reality of how it works.It\u2019s also that we\u2019ve bought into the myths that we could get such things with a much smaller footprint and that we earn all our money without anyone\u2019s help.Conservatives such as Ronald Reagan, Newt Gingrich and, more recently, Paul Ryan have subscribed to a worldview in which the government could easily step out of the way and allow private entities to provide those benefits. Few taxes would be needed to fund the government in that case. Social insurance against poverty and tragedy could be covered by charities, they argue; the stock market, for instance, could take care of Social Security.While voluntary charitable organizations doled out most of the social insurance before the New Deal, they constituted a threadbare network that quickly snapped under the pressure of the Great Depression. The same happened during the Great Recession: Private charitable giving from individuals, corporations and foundations fell as the economy faltered; it was the government that stepped in to cushion the worst of the blows.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rodrigo Duterte and Xi Jinping Agree to Reopen South China Sea Talks", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, agreed on Thursday to resume direct talks on disputes in the South China Sea after years of escalating tension, a sign of warming relations with Beijing.The announcement came during Mr. Duterte\u2019s state visit to China, as he repeatedly sought to distance the Philippines from the United States, a treaty ally. Mr. Duterte, speaking to business leaders shortly after meeting with Mr. Xi, openly declared a \u201cseparation from the United States.\u201dHe refrained, however, from saying that he would revoke a 70-year-old treaty alliance with Washington and made no indication of doing what China would like most: scrapping an accord that gives the United States access to five military bases in the Philippines.The decision to reopen discussions on the South China Sea after a hiatus of several years offers the promise of de-escalating tensions in the South China Sea, an issue that has strained Washington\u2019s relationship with Beijing.\u201cThough we come to your country close to winter, it is the springtime of our relationship,\u201d Mr. Duterte told Mr. Xi in their talks afterward, according to reporters who were allowed to observe part of their meeting.The president, in his remarks to the business forum on Thursday, suggested that the separation would extend to the \u201cmilitary, not maybe social, but economics also. America has lost.\u201dHe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve realigned myself in your ideological flow, and maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin.\u201dA day earlier, Mr. Duterte struck a similarly resistant tone before a group of Philippine citizens living in China. \u201cTime to say goodbye, my friend,\u201d he said of the United States.\u201cI will not go to America anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cI will just be insulted there.\u201dRevoking the alliance with the United States would alienate Philippine citizens \u2014 and the military \u2014 which has strongly favored Washington.Although Mr. Duterte, who took office in June, is popular at home, the people there hold more positive attitudes toward the United States, the former colonial power, than the president does.It is unclear when talks on the South China Sea would start or what their focus would be.On Thursday, the two sides agreed to establish a joint coast guard committee on maritime cooperation, a potentially significant step because Chinese Coast Guard vessels have been keeping Philippine fishing boats from Scarborough Shoal.In a gesture to Philippine fishermen, China\u2019s vice foreign minister, Liu Zhenmin, said China would provide assistance with aquaculture and the commercial processing of fish, an issue that Mr. Duterte has emphasized. Mr. Liu said that the countries\u2019 relationship was back to \u201cfull recovery\u201d and that they would hold talks on broader defense and security issues, which had also been halted under Mr. Aquino.\u201cBoth sides agreed that the South China Sea issue is not the sum total of the bilateral relationship,\u201d Mr. Liu said.On the investment front, China agreed to finance infrastructure in the Philippines, lifted the embargo on the import of tropical fruits, including mangoes, and said it would start encouraging its tourists to visit after removing a travel advisory on the Philippines.But Mr. Duterte told reporters that he would not raise joint exploration with China for oil and gas in the South China Sea, a venture that Beijing would like.He would have to consult with Parliament before broaching the possibility, he said.The Chinese have gone out of their way to offer Mr. Duterte wide access to top leadership. Later Thursday, Mr. Duterte was set to meet with Prime Minister Li Keqiang and two other members of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s all-powerful Standing Committee. By the time he leaves China, Mr. Duterte will have met with four of the committee\u2019s seven members, including Mr. Xi \u2014 an unusual honor for a visiting leader.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Major New Book Takes on the Power Struggle at Ground Zero", "Date": "2016-09-27", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The moments on Sept. 11, 2001, when two planes smashed into two towers are seared in our minds, frozen in our memories. The attack happened in minutes, but the rebuilding may take a generation and cost the G.D.P. of a small country. According to Lynne B. Sagalyn\u2019s \u201cPower at Ground Zero: Politics, Money, and the Remaking of Lower Manhattan,\u201d current \u201capproved costs\u201d for rebuilding run to $25.5 billion.On the 15th anniversary of the attack, Sagalyn has produced an authoritative history of this mega-project on America\u2019s most hallowed building site. Her \u00adstory teaches us how and why America has changed since 1931, when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey could build the George Washington Bridge \u2014 the world\u2019s longest suspension bridge at the time \u2014 in 49 months.Sagalyn, a professor at Columbia University Business School, has a keen sense of both politics and urbanism. She wrote \u201cTimes Square Roulette,\u201d the definitive book on rebuilding Times Square. With \u201cPower at Ground Zero,\u201d she covers 15 years of battling and building in 900 pages of extraordinary and insightful detail, poring through the primary documents and interviewing many of those involved.The public commentary on the rebuilding process at ground zero has typically veered between left- and right-wing morality tales. To the left, the delays reflected the greed of a private developer, Larry Silverstein. To the right, the delays reflected the bumbling of a public agency, the Port Authority. Sagalyn\u2019s history pulls us away from vilifying particular individuals \u2014 always easy, and rarely right \u2014 toward understanding how divided control of the site ensured endless delay: \u201cThe public-private ownership interests of the World Trade Center that had been so proudly finalized just six weeks prior to 9/11 created a flawed structure for rebuilding once the complex lay in ruins.\u201dDuring the mid-20th century, American city-building was relatively fast because projects were often steered by one individual, like the mighty Robert Moses or Austin J. Tobin. Sagalyn writes that Silverstein was able to build a new tower at 7 World Trade Center by 2006 because \u201cno public review process was necessary; he only needed the Port Authority\u2019s approval as owner of the land.\u201d As a democracy, we can no longer tolerate the broken eggs of Moses\u2019 omelets; untrammeled power has been replaced by the need to placate scores of stakeholders. Our consultative procedures reduce abuse, but even in normal circumstances, they can add years to the building process.Ground zero was no ordinary site, and control was particularly divided: \u201cEveryone was in charge, so no one was in charge,\u201d as an editorial in The Daily News put it. The site was legally shared by the Port Authority, which owned the land, and Larry Silverstein, the developer who held a 99-year lease. The Port Authority is beholden to the governor of New York, who appoints the agency\u2019s executive director, but whose objectives change depending on who is in office. The mayor of New York City had a say, and so did representatives of the victims\u2019 families, architectural critics and the New York City police.The first fight, over the site plan and memorial design, was a virtual melee, featuring a number of actors battling for different causes. Seeking the speed that can come from unified leadership, Gov. George E. Pataki summoned John Whitehead out of retirement to lead the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Whitehead was a 79-year-old veteran of Omaha Beach, Goldman Sachs and the State Department. He and the Port Authority sought safe hands for ground zero and hired the \u201carchitecturally conservative\u201d firm of \u00adBeyer Blinder Belle to produce plans.Architectural critics howled even before the firm had begun to draw their plans. \u201cWhere does the press cross the line between presenting the news to inform the public and aiming to become a player by advocating a particular vision \u2014 other than on the editorial page?\u201d Sagalyn wonders. The first set of plans, which tried to accommodate the Port Authority\u2019s desire for 10 million square feet of office space, was \u201csavaged\u201d by the press.Whitehead retreated and returned with a new, more consultative process that eventually produced Studio Daniel Libeskind\u2019s master plan, a compromise between memory and merchandise, a cocktail of architecture, finance and permeable urban form. Sagalyn reminds us that \u201ccity building calls for art-like understanding of the fabric of a place, but a city is not a blank canvas to paint at will.\u201dIf anything, the process for designing the memorial was even more contentious. Would the slurry wall, the \u201csurviving element of the 9/11 attack,\u201d remain? Would there be a memorial pit or grade-level memorial space? Would there be a cultural center? Would the names of rescue workers who died in the attack be set apart? Tempers ran high. Delays were inevitable, but the process ultimately produced an emotionally affecting space that reminds us of the terrible loss of Sept. 11.Once the design wars were over, new battles began, largely pitting the Port Authority against Larry Silverstein, two parties \u201cwho acted as competitors more than partners even though they needed one another.\u201d Silverstein had billions from the insurance payout, but he was \u201cthe consummate economic actor,\u201d who wanted to redevelop the site slowly and with subsidies. The Port Authority needed to placate its political masters, who wanted speed, press approval and a shining symbol of New York\u2019s rebirth.The first phase was a battle over buildings, which ended in 2006 when Silverstein ceded control over One World Trade Center, the former Freedom Tower, to the Port Authority. He kept the right to build three towers, in addition to 7 World Trade Center. The next phase was the battle over money and blame, in which Silverstein fought for subsidies and argued with the Port Authority over who was responsible for the lengthy delays in construction. Arbitration ultimately forced the two parties to agree on a building schedule in 2010.In Sagalyn\u2019s telling, Silverstein\u2019s reluctance to build swiftly was understandable. The downtown office market couldn\u2019t absorb so much space so quickly, especially after the first signs of a financial crisis in 2007. A public-private partnership just wasn\u2019t going to work well when the interests of the two parties sharply diverged, and \u201crebuilding the Trade Center site was crippled by conflict.\u201dSagalyn admires individuals who work for the Port Authority, especially the executive director Chris Ward, who \u201cpossessed the right stuff to tackle the crisis at ground zero,\u201d but the institution as a whole comes off as plagued by bad governance and overwhelmed by having far too much on its plate. Collectively, the agency seemed to value the press adulation that came from selecting a star architect for its PATH terminal more than the opinions of ordinary commuters who would pay for the cost overruns when Calatrava\u2019s \u201cpraiseworthy icon\u201d became \u201ca constantly critiqued, overblown statement of the Port Authority\u2019s institutional self.\u201dAmong the many \u201cwhat ifs\u201d that crop up during the book is what might have happened after the 2002 attempt of Mayor Bloomberg to wrest control over the site. He offered the land under New York City\u2019s two airports, which were operated by the Port Authority, in a swap for ground zero. If the deal had gone through, the mayor\u2019s office might have used eminent domain to kick out Silverstein and turn the World Trade Center site into the signature project of the Bloomberg era.Would that have produced a better outcome? We can\u2019t know. But ambiguous control rights have made long delays inevitable at ground zero, as well as at every development project that needs to go through years of community review and political haggling. Ground zero was worth arguing over. In other cases concerning residential building, the delay can mean less construction and therefore higher housing costs. Sagalyn has written a great epic of political wrangling and real estate. We now need to ponder its larger meaning.Edward L. Glaeser, the Fred and Eleanor Glimp professor of economics at Harvard, writes frequently on cities and economic growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fight Between Goldman Sachs and Libyan Fund Shadows Lawyer", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Within days of arriving in Tripoli in July 2008 to work on behalf of Libya\u2019s new sovereign wealth fund, Catherine McDougall, a young Australian lawyer, was swept off on a journey into the desert.Ms. McDougall, a fund official and some of his friends set out early in the morning. Cutting across wide swaths of empty desert, their white station wagon roared down paved roads at nearly 90 miles an hour. The next day, they feasted on camel tagine and took tea on the roof of an ancient house.For Ms. McDougall, then 26, it was the start of a wild and bewildering ride that six weeks later would end up with her being pulled out of Libya by her employer, the powerhouse London law firm Allen & Overy. The law firm told her it would be initiating a disciplinary proceeding against her after a complaint from the Libyan general counsel. Rather than face that, Ms. McDougall says, she resigned.A spokesman for the law firm declined to comment for this article.Eight years later, her assignment in Libya for Allen & Overy continues to shadow her. Her experience, she says, shows the lengths that Western firms will go to keep a new but potentially lucrative client happy. Lawyers, used to working on deals and contracts for companies in London or New York, are whisked to unfamiliar and sometimes hostile surroundings to serve clients in new frontiers of finance. And when a prestigious investment bank and a giant oil-rich wealth fund ultimately came to clash in Libya, Ms. McDougall found herself becoming collateral damage.After a spell of working for DLA Piper as a lawyer in Abu Dhabi and later teaching yoga to Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Ms. McDougall came into the public eye this year.She was called as a witness in a case that the fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, had brought against Goldman Sachs. The dispute centered around losses the sovereign wealth fund sustained on a series of complex financial transactions in 2008. Ms. McDougall worked on the trades during her six-week stint in Tripoli.The trial in a London court between the Libyan wealth fund and Goldman portrayed the elaborate dance that banks engage in as part of an effort to curry favor with valuable clients. For example, the court heard that the Goldman bankers had pushed for a younger brother of the former deputy chairman of the wealth fund, Mustafa Zarti, to be included in the bank\u2019s summer analyst internship program.But a Goldman human resources official pushed back, according to court filings, saying: \u201cWe have so few slots here this year we are not using them for candidates that aren\u2019t here on merit.\u201dIn the end, Goldman tailored a program for the young man. The internship was among the enticements used to win influence over the Libyan Investment Authority, the fund argued in court. That influence, the fund claimed, helped push it into improper investments that led to $1.2 billion in losses.But the judge overseeing the case, Justice Vivien Rose of the High Court, last week rejected the claim and ruled in Goldman\u2019s favor.In her judgment, she remarked on Ms. McDougall, saying that although she considered her to be a generally truthful witness, she did not have a \u201cbalanced understanding of the dynamics of the delicate situation\u201d that existed at the wealth fund.\u201cMs. McDougall fairly accepts that she may not have understood fully the politics within the L.I.A. at this very sensitive time and recognizes that some senior people within the L.I.A. thought that she adopted an unhelpfully aggressive stance when speaking to the Goldman Sachs people on behalf of the L.I.A.,\u201d Justice Rose wrote.In a telephone interview from her home in Brisbane, Australia, Ms. McDougall expressed frustration on what the judge had to say.A London court judged that the Wall Street firm hadn\u2019t taken advantage of the inexperienced sovereign wealth fund.\u201cI am the only witness to have been found to be aggressive,\u201d she said.\u201cMr. Zarti, who is alleged to have threatened Goldman Sachs and told its bankers to leave the country, was not characterized as aggressive,\u201d she noted. A Goldman executive, Andrea Vella, who is now Goldman\u2019s co-head of investment banking for Asia excluding Japan, was said to have banged his shoe in anger during a meeting with a Goldman salesman who was working with the Libyans. In his court testimony, Mr. Vella switched between saying he did not remember thumping his shoe in anger and claiming that the incident never happened.Since the judge\u2019s ruling on Friday, Ms. McDougall said that two offers of employment that she had received from London law firms were rescinded. She declined to name the law firms.\u201cI was this young girl who came in with good intentions to be the best lawyer for my client,\u201d she said. Instead, \u201cI was caught in the middle of the explosive disintegration of the relationship between Goldman Sachs and the L.I.A.\u201dMs. McDougall trained as a lawyer in Australia and, in August 2006, moved to London to join Allen & Overy, where she worked on a number of oil and gas deals in the Middle East. She barely spoke Arabic.Soon after arriving in Tripoli, she says, she realized that the documents that had been drafted to support the derivatives trades were not suitable for a sovereign wealth fund.As she pushed back, she provoked irritation among the Goldman bankers and was met with friction from the fund\u2019s general counsel, she says.\u201cAt the start, Goldman Sachs thought, \u2018Here\u2019s someone who is going to be able to sign off on these trades,\u2019\u201d she said. Over time, though, it became \u201cclear to me that the L.I.A. did not understand what they had bought\u201d from Goldman.The judge, however, said in her ruling that although some might have regarded the trades as unsuitable, \u201cif they were unsuitable, they were no different from many other investments that the L.I.A. made.\u201dMs. McDougall\u2019s stint in Libya ended abruptly in August 2008, when the general counsel complained about her to an Allen & Overy partner.In an email, the general counsel said he was annoyed in part by a request by her to leave Libya to attend a meeting her law firm was holding in Madrid. Just a day earlier, she was in a car accident and was taken to a hospital, where, she says, she was held down against her will and given an injection.She says the general counsel asked her to hand over her passport and she refused, resulting in a screaming match. When she called partners in London and told them she wanted to leave, she says, \u201cthey told me if the client wants you to stay, you have to stay.\u201dA few days later, a partner at her law firm phoned Ms. McDougall and said Allen & Overy was pulling her out of Libya.\u201cCould I just reiterate that you should not speak to anyone prior to leaving the office today,\u201d the partner wrote her in an email after the call. \u201cThe team are keen that your departure should be as low-key as possible. Just pack up your things and go.\u201dMs. McDougall remembers sitting on the beach on her last day in Tripoli with Mr. Zarti\u2019s assistant, Sofia Wellesley, who is now married to the singer James Blunt. \u201cSofia said,\u201d according to Ms. McDougall, \u201cthis is a terrible day for the L.I.A. Allen & Overy is never going to send anyone out here again.\u201dBut a few days later, the law firm dispatched another associate to work with the Libyan Investment Authority in Tripoli. As he was leaving, Ms. McDougall says, she gave him her remaining dinars and her Lonely Planet guide to Libya.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Builds $150 Million War Chest, Doubling Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump entered the homestretch of the campaign at a pronounced financial disadvantage to Hillary Clinton, according to figures Mr. Trump\u2019s team released on Saturday, and far below the self-funding goal he set for himself earlier in the race.After raising $100 million in partnership with Republican Party organizations in September, Mr. Trump and committees linked to his campaign began October with $75 million in cash on hand. Mrs. Clinton raised $154 million in September and began October with roughly $150 million in the bank, her campaign said, twice as much as Mr. Trump.Still, Mrs. Clinton will have a huge war chest for last-minute advertising and organizing at a time when she has regained her lead in public opinion polls and Mr. Trump is openly feuding with his party and mired in accusations that he groped women.The monthly figure was a record for Mr. Trump and provided evidence of his powerful appeal among grass-roots donors: The campaign now estimates that 2.6 million people have given to his campaign. But it was only a small improvement over his fund-raising in July and August, suggesting he might have peaked.Moreover, Mr. Trump has so far not followed through on promises to spend $100 million of his own fortune on the campaign. In September, he contributed $2 million, his usual amount since he became the Republican nominee, leaving him roughly $44 million short of his goal.Mr. Trump also said he would blitz Mrs. Clinton with $100 million in advertising, but he has spent about $32 million, according to two Republican media buyers, although they have reserved substantial additional advertising in swing states.\u201cOur ad spending strategy has not changed,\u201d Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, wrote in an email. \u201cMr. Trump continues to make significant contributions to his campaign.\u201dMr. Trump is not starved for cash and could still make additional investments in television and turnout to increase his chances on Nov. 8. But his campaign has been marred by disagreements with Republican organizations in some key states.On Saturday, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign cut ties with Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, a pivotal swing state. A Trump aide accused Mr. Borges of publicly undermining Mr. Trump to promote his own ambitions to run for chairman of the Republican National Committee.In a letter to other Ohio Republicans, the aide, Robert Paduchik, said Mr. Borges had spent the past week on a \u201cself-promotional media tour with state and national outlets to criticize our party\u2019s nominee.\u201dStill, Mr. Paduchik added that he expected the Ohio Republican Party to keep covering payroll costs that it had been paying on behalf of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.Some leading Republican donors have tried an awkward straddle, providing money to a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that is focused on attacking Mrs. Clinton but is said to be aiming its fire to achieve maximum benefit for Republican House and Senate candidates endangered by Mr. Trump\u2019s slide.That group, called Future45, received $5 million from the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson in September and the same amount from his wife, Miriam. An additional $2.3 million came from Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder, and other donors, including the coal magnate Joe Craft.But disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday hinted at fragmentation and disarray among outside groups that support Mr. Trump and have competed with one another for dollars and turf.While Mr. Trump\u2019s sons and advisers have appeared at fund-raisers for two groups \u2014 Great America PAC and Rebuilding America Now \u2014 at least three additional super PACs have organized in apparent support of him.One, called Save America From Its Government, was founded by Andrew Beal, a banker and real estate investor who is a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisory team. According to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Beal gave $2 million to the group in September, nearly all of the money it reported raising.A fourth group, a committee called American Horizons, was attacked by the Trump campaign this summer for promoting a \u201cDinner With Donald\u201d contest that Mr. Trump had neither authorized nor agreed to. The complaints do not appear to have affected fund-raising: American Horizons raised $750,000 from July to September, a third of it from donors giving hundreds of dollars each.The committee has spent just $12,000 on expenditures backing Mr. Trump. But the biggest chunk of spending, about $400,000, went to fees to a consulting firm owned by the PAC\u2019s treasurer.David Streitfeld contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Money Flows Down Ballot as Donald Trump Is Abandoned by Big Donors (Even Himself)", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byWith Donald J. Trump facing a potential rout at the hands of Hillary Clinton, a river of cash from some of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest donors has begun to flow down to Senate and House races in the final days of the 2016 campaign.Disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday revealed tens of millions of dollars in late donations and transfers to Republican \u201csuper PACs\u201d focused on down-ballot races, suggesting a significant last-ditch effort to protect Senate and House candidates against Mrs. Clinton\u2019s surge. Relatively little new money has come into outside groups supporting Mr. Trump.And Mr. Trump appears to have lost the support of his biggest donor: himself.Mr. Trump contributed no cash and just $31,000 worth of rent and staff salaries to his campaign in the first three weeks of October, a fraction of the $2-million-a-month self-funding pace he had set since winning the Republican presidential nomination.As of mid-October, according to the disclosure, Mrs. Clinton was raising $2.8 million each day and had $62 million in her campaign account, four times as much as Mr. Trump.\u201cI hear that people are concerned that Hillary\u2019s going to be president, so you\u2019d better get Republicans in the Senate so you have a firewall,\u201d said Stanley Hubbard, a Minnesota billionaire who became one of the country\u2019s biggest Trump donors this year. \u201cI think people are done giving. It\u2019s too late.\u201dThursday\u2019s filings are a clear sign that the Republican establishment has all but abandoned Mr. Trump \u2014 a painful concession that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s electoral advantage may be insurmountable. And the biggest beneficiaries are Republicans in the Senate and the House, who have been goaded by Democrats in recent weeks to declare allegiance to the Republican nominee or renounce him.In the first three weeks of October, ESA Fund, a super PAC tied to the family of Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder, took in $5.5 million, more than half of it from Mr. Ricketts\u2019s wife, Marlene. The group\u2019s advertising in that time has focused on the Senate races in Louisiana and New Hampshire and a House race in Nevada.The Wisconsin roofing magnate Diane Hendricks, whom Mr. Trump named to his economic policy council in August, poured $4 million this month into a lesser-known group called the Reform America Fund. The super PAC\u2019s chief focus in the past two weeks has been attacking Russ Feingold, the former Democratic senator who is seeking to reclaim his old seat from Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin.And the Senate Leadership Fund, a group closely tied to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, took in $18 million during the first three weeks of October, much of it transferred from an affiliated nonprofit group that does not disclose its donors. On Thursday night, the group announced that it had taken in an astonishing $25 million during the past week; the source of that money will remain secret until after Election Day.\u201cFor the past few weeks, Democrats have been pouring money down ballot as they appear to view the presidential race as being in the bank,\u201d said Ian Prior, a spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund. \u201cFortunately our donors were willing to saddle up and ride into the final battle of the election to try and hold the Senate, even against tough odds.\u201dDemocrats have also enjoyed a late surge of money into groups supporting Senate candidates. Senate Majority PAC, a group founded by former aides to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, reported raising $19.2 million during the first three weeks of October, much of it from wealthy liberals who are also investing in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.The group is resuming advertising in Florida, where the Democratic Senate candidate, Representative Patrick Murphy, has struggled in recent weeks against Senator Marco Rubio.\u201cWith the success of our fund-raising, we\u2019re able to put additional resources into the state,\u201d said Susan McCue, the group\u2019s co-chairwoman.The few conservative billionaires who rallied around Mr. Trump appear to have closed the spigot. Rebuilding America Now, which took in $4.4 million from a few wealthy Republicans in September, raised $214,000 in the first weeks of October. Make America Number 1, a super PAC controlled by the family of the New York investor and multimillionaire Robert Mercer, raised just $25 \u2014 which seems, at first glance, like a typo by Mr. Mercer\u2019s standards.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Are Women in F.B.I.\u2019s Top Ranks?", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe pulled out all the stops,\u201d said Ms. Hess, who as head of the bureau\u2019s science and technology branch oversees more than 6,000 F.B.I. employees.Inside the F.B.I., women in particular look up to Ms. Hess, and not just because they have nicknamed her the \u201crocket scientist\u201d with a degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from Purdue University. She is also the first woman to head the science branch \u2014 one of few female agents commanding such an important job at the F.B.I., a clubby agency where men are more predominant in senior positions than they were even three years ago.Ms. Hess, 50, put it simply: \u201cThere is a lack of women in leadership roles.\u201dToday at the F.B.I., women hold 12 percent of 220 senior agent positions, including nine who run field offices in places like Los Angeles; Oklahoma City; Louisville, Ky.; and Knoxville, Tenn. That is a decline from 2013, when women held about 20 percent of senior agent jobs and 15 women ran field offices.\u201cIt seems to be going backwards,\u201d said Janice K. Fedarcyk, now retired, who ran the New York office, with about 2,000 employees, from 2010 to 2012. \u201cThey need to do something to turn that around.\u2019\u2019\u201cThe big challenge we\u2019ve been confronting over the last two years is, how do we get women and people of color\u201d to join the F.B.I., Mr. Comey said last Sunday at a conference of police chiefs in San Diego. \u201cThat\u2019s been our big trouble, and I\u2019ve described it as a crisis.\u201dIn response, the F.B.I. put a plan in place to try to increase the overall number of female agents to 33 percent. The bureau will also soon start providing field offices with recruitment data, something it had never done. That will allow the F.B.I. to track where it has successfully recruited employees and perhaps tie the data to performance reviews and bonuses.\u201cOur ability to be believed is at risk,\u201d Mr. Comey said in a speech earlier this year. \u201cThe F.B.I. must be able to stand on any corner in the U.S. or before any jury and be believed.\u201dBut for women in the bureau, Ms. Pasenelli, who died this year, was a trailblazer.\u201cIt opened the door for a lot of women to think about the possibilities,\u201d said Stephanie Douglas, who in 2012 became the first woman to run the F.B.I.\u2019s national security branch. Ms. Douglas, who worked with prosecutors to investigate the destruction of C.I.A. videotapes that depicted the torture of terrorism suspects overseas, retired in 2013.F.B.I. officials say they cannot explain completely the step backward for women in leadership roles at the bureau, but they say retirements and the timing of openings are partly responsible. David Schlendorf, assistant director for the F.B.I.\u2019s human resources division, called it a \u201cworrisome\u201d trend, although not intractable.\u201cI am optimistic we can do better,\u201d said Valerie Parlave, Mr. Schlendorf\u2019s boss, who in 2013 became the first woman to run the Washington field office.Women cite three important reasons so few of them are in the F.B.I.\u2019s senior ranks.First, the F.B.I.\u2019s path to promotion is often less appealing to women, more than a dozen former and current female agents said. F.B.I. agents can be transferred at a moment\u2019s notice, which often requires leaving a family behind. Traditionally, that has meant that men in the bureau have to uproot without their children and spouses for long stretches of time, a sacrifice women may be less willing to make.Ms. Douglas, who does not have children, said that she once moved from San Francisco to Washington in four days and that she relocated four times from 2005 to 2013. Each time a call came, she feared that if she said no, she might not get another chance.\u201cThe bureau is incredibly competitive,\u201d Ms. Douglas said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take advantage of that opportunity, somebody else will.\u201dSecond, women say the F.B.I. does not have enough high-ranking female role models or mentors. Although women hold senior agent jobs, a woman has never been in charge of a large F.B.I. operational division like counterterrorism, which in the post-9/11 world has been dominated by men who went on to bigger jobs \u2014 including the F.B.I.\u2019s No. 2 position, deputy director. A woman has never been deputy director, or director.Ms. Fedarcyk, the former head of the New York field office who was also the top agent in charge of terrorism in Los Angeles and managed the bureau\u2019s effort to track terrorism financing, said her success was, in part, because people took an interest in her work and helped her along the way.\u201cI had a great career,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of different reasons why that is the case. Some women don\u2019t want to take that next step. Some guys don\u2019t want to take that next step. I was fortunate coming up in the bureau. I had strong mentors.\u201dA third problem, women say, is that far fewer women apply for top F.B.I. jobs than men. For every dozen or so applicants for a senior job, Ms. Hess said, only one or two are women.In part, that is because there are fewer women in the agency to begin with, but women also shy away from applying for top F.B.I. jobs, Ms. Hess said, for the same reason that many men do: They see sitting behind a desk, even with more seniority and pay, as inferior to what many consider the dream job of agent \u2014 working the streets, meeting with informants, making cases and putting criminals in jail.\u201cThat\u2019s the reason you come into the bureau,\u201d said Ms. Hess, who once worked violent crimes, gangs and drugs and briefly ran F.B.I. counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan. \u201cNot to push paper.\u201d This month, Ms. Hess will take over the office in Louisville, the eighth move in her career.At the F.B.I., there have been many challenges for women. Female agents have repeatedly sued the F.B.I. for sexual harassment and discrimination. This year, a former agent accused her male co-workers in the Denver office of behaving inappropriately and making disparaging comments. According to the lawsuit, a male agent was overheard talking about a female colleague: \u201cI hope she quits. She can stay home in the kitchen.\u201dBeverly Andress, who joined the agency in 1983 and retired in 2006, recalled that she was often introduced as a \u201cfemale agent\u201d rather than just an agent. \u201cYou have to have a good sense of humor,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s world.\u201dF.B.I. officials say that if the numbers are looked at as an average over the last decade, the agency has a better record of women in senior agent positions \u2014 about 16 percent \u2014 than other federal law enforcement agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Only the Secret Service had a slightly higher percentage of women in senior agent positions.Female agents say they will know the F.B.I. has made progress when a woman is finally put in charge of counterterrorism, criminal investigations, counterintelligence or is appointed as deputy director. For now, the stars in those divisions are overwhelmingly male.\u201cWe are playing catch-up,\u201d said Voviette Morgan, a senior agent who runs the bureau\u2019s internal investigations section and is a seasoned counterterrorism investigator. \u201cIn 2016, I hate the fact we say firsts.\u201d\u201cWe are behind the curve,\u201d Ms. Morgan added. \u201cThere is no doubt about it.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs\u2019s Asia Pacific Chairman to Retire", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One of Goldman Sachs\u2019s top bankers in Asia is planning on retiring after nearly three decades at the firm.Mark Schwartz, who is chairman of Goldman\u2019s Asia Pacific region and a vice chairman of the firm, will retire at the end of the year, the firm said in an internal memorandum on Monday.His departure comes as Goldman faces challenges in Asia, particularly a slowdown in investment banking in the region for all Western firms. Goldman is expected to lay off a significant number of its bankers in Asia. (Mr. Schwartz\u2019s plans were unrelated to those issues.)He has catered to some of the firm\u2019s biggest clients, including the Alibaba Group of China and SoftBank of Japan. Mr. Schwartz was one of Goldman\u2019s point men on Alibaba\u2019s $25 billion initial public offering, the biggest on record, and was on hand at the New York Stock Exchange when the Chinese e-commerce behemoth began trading.Over his career, Mr. Schwartz became an influential member of Goldman\u2019s inner circle, spearheading some of the firm\u2019s biggest businesses. He joined Goldman in 1979 and later founded the firm\u2019s high-yield debt department. He was made partner in 1988. He later led its global debt capital markets business from 1991 to 1997.Mr. Schwartz later moved to Asia, becoming president of Goldman Sachs Japan and then assuming the chairman role for the Asia Pacific region from 1999 to 2001. He then left the firm in 2001 to work for George Soros\u2019s hedge fund, later becoming its chief executive from 2003 to 2004.The banker then co-founded MissionPoint Capital, an investment firm focused on clean energy, before returning to Goldman as chairman of the Asia Pacific region, but moved the position to Beijing.\u201cMark\u2019s leadership, expertise and focus on client service have been invaluable in further integrating our activities across Asia Pacific, building on previous successes and advancing our leading franchise in the region,\u201d Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman\u2019s chief executive, and Gary D. Cohn, the firm\u2019s president, wrote in the internal memo.\u201cOver the years, Mark has demonstrated an unwavering focus on supporting and enhancing Goldman Sachs\u2019 culture, reminding us that the caliber of our people, combined with our history of serving clients, has differentiated us in our efforts to build successful businesses across geographies.\u201dUpon retiring, Mr. Schwartz will become a senior director.After 27 years of distinguished service, Mark Schwartz, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific and vice chairman of the firm, has decided to retire at the end of the year. We are pleased that he will become a senior director at that time. Ken Hitchner will remain president of Goldman Sachs in Asia Pacific Ex-Japan and Masa Mochida will continue to serve as president of Goldman Sachs Japan.Throughout most of his tenure at Goldman Sachs, Mark played an instrumental role in shaping our strategy in Asia Pacific, first as president of Goldman Sachs Japan from 1997 to 1999, based in Tokyo, and later as chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific, a role he held until 2001. He reprised that role in 2012 and relocated to Beijing. Mark\u2019s leadership, expertise and focus on client service have been invaluable in further integrating our activities across Asia Pacific, building on previous successes and advancing our leading franchise in the region.Over the years, Mark has demonstrated an unwavering focus on supporting and enhancing Goldman Sachs\u2019 culture, reminding us that the caliber of our people, combined with our history of serving clients, has differentiated us in our efforts to build successful businesses across geographies. As a member of the Pine Street Board, he helped develop the Pine Street Leadership Program for managing directors, among other Goldman Sachs training programs. In addition, Mark has hired, trained and mentored many of our professionals in Asia Pacific, helping to develop a new generation of leaders in the region.Mark first joined Goldman Sachs in 1979 as an associate in the Public Utility Finance Group in the Investment Banking Division. He moved to Fixed Income in 1985, when he founded the High Yield Department. Mark then headed the Global Debt Capital Markets Department from 1991 to 1997 when he assumed his leadership roles in Asia Pacific.Mark left the firm in 2001. He became a senior advisor to Soros Fund Management in 2002, where he later served as president and chief executive officer from 2003 to 2004. He then became chairman of MissionPoint Capital Partners, an investment firm he co-founded with a focus on the low-carbon economy, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of both MasterCard Inc. and SoftBank Corp.When Mark returned to Goldman Sachs in 2012, he re-joined the Management Committee. He is also a member of the Growth Markets Executive Group. Previously, Mark was a member of the Partnership Committee, the Commitments Committee and the Recruiting Committee. He was named partner in 1988.Outside the firm, Mark is a trustee of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and a member of the Executive Committee of the Morgan Stanley Children\u2019s Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian. He is also a trustee at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and serves on the Board of Directors of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard University.

{"Headline": "A Frog Dies in Atlanta, and a World Vanishes With It", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI was among a group of biologists who discovered this species in 2005 in the canopy of a cloud forest in central Panama. We documented a remarkable behavior never seen in any other animal. The males stayed with their tadpoles in small water-filled cavities high in the trees. These tiny arboreal ponds lacked sufficient food for the tadpoles, so the male would lower himself into the water, allowing his offspring to rasp the skin from his back for nutrition.In this way, this species was able to perpetuate itself in the only place on the planet it was known to exist, near the town of El Valle de Ant\u00f3n. At the time of our discovery, nearby forests were being cleared for luxury vacation homes and it seemed now only a matter of time before the developers would reach the mountains where these frogs glided from tree to tree, catching air with their extensive toe webbing.But what proved to be a more pernicious threat was also afoot, destroying amphibian populations throughout the forests of Central America: an infectious skin disease called amphibian chytridiomycosis that had been unleashed among wild amphibians almost certainly by human activity. Dozens of frog and toad species were driven extinct.That\u2019s why we were in Panama in 2005. We were on a salvage mission, hoping to catch representatives of as many threatened amphibian species as we could in advance of the epidemic. Our plan was to place them in breeding programs and reintroduce them into the wild after the scourge had passed.We named our discovery after the noted conservationists George B. Rabb, the former director of the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, and his biologist wife, Mary.Within two years, the frog had all but disappeared. No further trace of it has been found in the wild since, despite persistent searches by Panamanian colleagues.Now we seem to have moved to its actual extinction. The planet is permanently changed. This frog\u2019s ecological role among the animals and plants with which it evolved has been lost, along with whatever other secrets it carried.Snakes, bees, starfish, corals, great apes and bats are suffering similar incursions and have become victims of pathogens spread unwittingly by human travel, commerce and other activities. These emerging infectious diseases have become a hallmark of our age.The trajectory of this latest threat is familiar: Asian salamanders popular as pets were found to carry this fungus without getting sick, but it proved lethal to wild salamanders in Europe.Fortunately, some populations of amphibians now appear to be evolving tolerance to these novel chytrid fungi, so they are recovering despite our own too-little, too-late, too-uninformed conservation efforts. For other populations, captive breeding programs are helping to usher some species through the storm of diseases.Amphibians have shown us that reactive attempts in conservation may be ineffective. Indeed, the demise of so many amphibians was one of our early indications of what many biologists believe is a sixth major extinction now underway.Emerging infectious diseases in wildlife, spread by global trade and transit, represent a real and present danger. Governments must aggressively police that threat with their powers to stop imports of nonnative species that could imperil native wildlife and plants.In addition, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service should finance its international programs to protect amphibians at the level of projects to safeguard elephants, rhinos, tigers, great apes and marine turtles. Those undertakings received roughly five times more than the agency\u2019s amphibian efforts in 2015.As a scientist, I like to be right, but in this case, I hope I\u2019m wrong. There is a chance that a population of Rabbs\u2019 frogs remains hidden in the Panamanian forest. But if it is extinct, as the evidence suggests, this species will most likely remain a largely unknown casualty of the Anthropocene, another example of how we continue to ignore, if not deny, the threats of emerging infectious diseases to the other creatures that share our planet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom Win Nobel in Economics for Work on Contracts", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byDr. Holmstrom, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has had a particular influence on executive pay practices. Dr. Hart, a professor at Harvard, has contributed to the debate about the outsourcing of public services like prisons and garbage collection.\u201cModern economies are held together by innumerable contracts,\u201d the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the prize, said Monday morning. \u201cTheir analysis of optimal contractual arrangements lays an intellectual foundation for designing policies and institutions in many areas, from bankruptcy legislation to political constitutions.\u201dThe prize committee in recent years has shied away from grand economic theories, instead rewarding economists who develop careful insights about smaller questions. Macroeconomics, the field devoted to those broader questions, has fallen into something of an existential crisis in recent years. There is, for now, greater certainty about the value of work on a smaller scale.\u201cMuch of economics from the noneconomist perspective is about how governments run fiscal policy and monetary policy,\u201d said Patrick Bolton, an economist at Columbia University. \u201cThis is really thinking about economics from the ground up, from the small to the large.\u201dDr. Holmstrom\u2019s work has focused on employment contracts. Companies would like managers to behave as if they owned the place: working hard and minding costs while taking smart risks. Employees, on the other hand, would like to be paid as much as possible while working no harder than necessary. And performance is difficult to assess.Economists since Adam Smith have grappled with the conflicts inherent in the relationship between owners and employees. Dr. Holmstrom\u2019s work, beginning in the late 1970s, presented evidence that companies should tie pay to the broadest possible evaluation of an employee\u2019s performance. In later work, he focused on the benefits of simple contracts that mixed base pay with limited incentives.Dr. Hart\u2019s work begins from the observation that contracts are incomplete instruction manuals. They cannot specify what to do in every case. Instead, they must stipulate how decisions should be made.Dr. Holmstrom, speaking via an audio connection to a news conference hosted by the academy, said he had been \u201cvery surprised and very happy\u201d to get the news. Asked how his day was going, he said there was \u201ca sense of things being surreal.\u201dDr. Hart said he had hugged his wife, roused his son from sleep and spoken by phone with Dr. Holmstrom, a close friend whom he has known for years.\u201cI woke at about 4:40 and was wondering whether it was getting too late for it to be this year, but then fortunately the phone rang,\u201d Dr. Hart said.One implication of Dr. Holmstrom\u2019s work is that it makes sense to withhold some compensation for a time, to evaluate the results of a manager\u2019s work.Companies have turned increasingly to this kind of deferred compensation, particularly for senior executives.But his influence on compensation practices is limited. He has argued, for example, that companies should tie such evaluations to the stock market performance of their industry rather than focusing solely on the company\u2019s own stock price. It makes little sense to reward an executive for gains that reflect a broader change in the industry\u2019s fortunes, or to punish executives for setbacks beyond their control. But such advice has not become common practice.How eight winners got the word.Dr. Hart, in his own work, has explored the limits of contractual relationships.Consider the case of an electric company that needs to rewrite its contract with a coal mine because its needs have changed. Under some circumstances, Dr. Hart has shown, the utility would have been better off owning the mine from the beginning, to control the relationship.In other cases, contracts make more sense than ownership. Cities should outsource garbage collection, for example, Dr. Hart said in an interview on Monday.There is always a balance, he said, between saving money and losing control. The critical issue, he said, is often the extent to which a contract can account for unexpected challenges.\u201cA government wouldn\u2019t contract with a private company to carry out its foreign policy because it\u2019s just too difficult to specify in a contract how to carry out foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be crazy.\u201dDr. Holmstrom, 67, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and speaks Swedish well enough to answer questions in that language at Monday\u2019s news conference.In the early 1970s, he was working for a Finnish company that wanted to use computers to improve productivity. Dr. Holmstrom, sent to Stanford on a one-year fellowship, concluded that the real challenge was not programming but providing employees with proper incentives.He stayed to earn a Ph.D., and has been a professor at M.I.T. since 1994.\u201cHe will not let go until he\u2019s understood what you have to say,\u201d Dr. Bolton said. \u201cAnd most of the time, your argument fails. Which is an unpleasant experience as a student. But when you succeed, it gives you an incredible confidence.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the professor who said he was \u201cvery surprised and very happy\u201d to get the news of the Nobel award. It was Dr. Holmstrom, not \u201cDr. Holt.\u201d (There is no Dr. Holt among the winners.) Also because of an editing error, the article misidentified the developer of rules for executive pay.

{"Headline": "Specter of Trump Loosens Tongues, if Not Purse Strings, in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-10-16", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 After years of scorning the political process, Silicon Valley has leapt into the fray. The prospect of a President Donald J. Trump is pushing the tech community to move beyond its traditional role as donors and to embrace a new existence as agitators and activists.Getting involved in politics used to be seen as clashing with Silicon Valley\u2019s value system: You transform the world by making problems obsolete, not solving them through Washington. Nor did entrepreneurs want to alienate whatever segment of customers did not agree with them politically.Such reticence is no longer in style here.\u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of nerds not used to having a lot of limelight,\u201d said Dave McClure, an investor who runs a tech incubator called 500 Startups. \u201cBut to quote Spider-Man, \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019\u201dAn initial group of donors pledged $50,000; the goal was to ask the \u201cnerdz\u201d for small donations to match that sum. They have not come through yet. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of optimistic we\u2019ll get the other $50,000 in a few weeks,\u201d Mr. McClure said.That relatively slow pace reflects Silicon Valley\u2019s shifting position: Even as it becomes increasingly free with its opinions, it has been less free with its checkbook. The most recent data, from late August, shows Mrs. Clinton taking in $7.7 million from the tech community, according to Crowdpac, a start-up that tracks donations. By that point in 2012, Crowdpac says, President Obama had raised $21 million from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of the business networking site LinkedIn, offers a snapshot of Silicon Valley\u2019s evolving approach to politics.Mr. Hoffman\u2019s outright donations, however, have been smaller this election cycle. In May, he gave $400,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Asked if there was more recent giving that had not shown up in federal election records, Mr. Hoffman cryptically responded in an email, \u201cLooking at some PACs, etc.\u201d He declined several opportunities to elaborate.Even as Priorities USA has raised $133 million this election cycle, far exceeding its total in 2012, its tech contributions have dwindled. The only familiar tech name this time around is John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, who gave $500,000.When he wrote the op-ed, he was uncertain about donating money to Mrs. Clinton, saying only that it was \u201cprobable.\u201d A spokeswoman said Sunday that Mr. Case gave $25,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund.Mason Harrison, Crowdpac\u2019s head of communications, offered a possible reason for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s less-than-robust support. \u201cDonors give to support candidates they love, not to defeat candidates they fear,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton is not as enthusiastic toward Silicon Valley and its disruptive ways. In a speech in the summer of 2015, she noted that start-ups in the \u201con-demand or so-called gig economy\u201d \u2014 Uber, Airbnb and their ilk \u2014 were \u201cunleashing innovation\u201d but also \u201craising hard questions about workplace protection and what a good job will look like in the future.\u201dThe Clinton campaign declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not respond to a query.If Silicon Valley\u2019s political involvement outlasts this unusual election, the tech community may start contributing more to the process than commentary and cash.\u201cNot only are tech people going to be wielding influence, but they\u2019re going to be the candidate,\u201d Mr. McClure said. \u201cReid Hoffman, Sheryl Sandberg\u201d \u2014 the chief operating officer of Facebook \u2014 \u201cand a bunch of other folks here have political aspirations.\u201dBut perhaps being vocal is a temporary condition after all. The venture firm CRV was in the spotlight at the end of August with its blunt anti-Trump message, which included the earthy epithet. A few weeks later, it cleaned up its website. The partners went from employing a publicist to seek out attention to declining interviews.\u201cWe reached everyone we wanted to reach, and hopefully influenced opinions,\u201d said Saar Gur, a CRV venture capitalist. \u201cThen the buzz died down and we went back to our day jobs, which are super busy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Malaysian Art Scene, Under the Radar", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Mahathir Mohamad \u2014 who transformed this country of paddy fields and rubber plantations into a modern economy of factories, highways and skyscrapers \u2014 is known as much for his bold economic vision as for his intolerance of anybody who got in his way.While he was prime minister of Malaysia between 1981 and 2003, Mr. Mahathir detained opponents, fired top judges, controlled the media, clipped the power of Malay royalty, fired one deputy and pushed another to resign.Yet the visual arts mostly escaped his attention.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d a show of 48 works by 28 artists at Ilham Gallery here that is on view until Nov. 20, is evidence of that inattention. Despite their critical nature, many of the pieces in the show appeared in state-funded institutions such as the National Art Gallery; some won national awards.Art was seen as a concern of the urban elite, with no influence on the masses. \u201cIt was not really on his radar,\u201d said Valentine Willie, the curator of \u201cEra Mahathir\u201d and the creative director of Ilham Gallery. \u201cIn a way, it was a saving grace for us. He didn\u2019t take us seriously.\u201dMr. Mahathir\u2019s policies created a growing wealthy class who were looking for ways to spend its money. \u201cIf you have a million-dollar apartment, what are you going to put on the wall? Not your grandmother\u2019s portrait,\u201d Mr. Willie said.Around Asia, artists who have criticized government through their works have struggled for funding and, in some cases, for their freedom. In the 1960s Indonesia, Hendra Gunawan, one of the archipelago\u2019s most celebrated artists, was imprisoned for years under Presidents Sukarno and Suharto for his alleged association with communists. More recently, the Chinese government detained the artist Ai Weiwei and prevented him from traveling abroad. In Malaysia this year, the artist Fahmi Reza was charged \u2014 twice \u2014 under cybercrime laws for posting a caricature of Prime Minister Najib Razak with a clown face on Instagram and Facebook.But in Mahathir\u2019s Malaysia in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, even as art took a decidedly sociopolitical turn, galleries flourished, as did theater.The show, which features works on loan from the national art gallery, private collections and the artists, opens with a panel by Mohd Nor Khalid, better known as Lat, whose cartoons ran in the pro-government New Straits Times.In the panel, the late Singapore prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, is drawn clutching a newspaper and asking Mr. Mahathir why he allows cartoonists to get away with such unflattering depictions of him. \u201cLook what they do to your nose!\u201d Mr. Lee says. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Mahathir (with a giant nose) agrees, \u201ctoo much freedom.\u201d It\u2019s funny, and makes a point: even among autocrats, there are degrees of autocracy.\u201cEra Mahathir\u201d also includes a politically charged work by Ahmad Fuad Osman. In 1998, the artist joined thousands in the streets protesting Mr. Mahathir\u2019s firing of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was later charged with corruption and sodomy \u2014 a crime in this country. Then he went home and picked up his brush.Until then, Mr. Ahmad Fuad had been known for his studied, symbolic pieces. He ended up producing four vigorous self-portraits, in oil, each over two meters high. Three were based on the old proverb \u201csee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,\u201d to which he added a fourth portrait, of him holding his nose.\u201cThere are times we have to scream,\u201d Mr. Ahmad Fuad said in a phone interview from his current base in Bali. \u201cWe can\u2019t whisper anymore. We have to let our voices out.\u201dMr. Ahmad Fuad\u2019s self-portraits were shown at Galeri Petronas, owned by the national oil company. It is one of these four pieces \u2014 titled \u201cShhh!\u201d and showing the artist with finger to lips \u2014 that is included in \u201cEra Mahathir.\u201dAnother work, \u201cNEP\u201d by Roslisham Ismail, is a wall-sized collage forming the acronym for the New Economic Policy, an affirmative-action plan for the country\u2019s majority Malays that Mr. Mahathir wielded to a greater degree than any leader before him. Look closer and the three giant letters are made up of posters and calling cards for loan sharks, a comment on the abuses of the policy and the growing chasm between rich and poor Malays.Liew Kung Yu\u2019s \u201cProposals for my country\u201d features a photo montage of the Greek and Roman columns that mushroomed during the building boom, adorning everything from mansions to office buildings to wooden stilt houses \u2013- a sign of new money gone mad.Mr. Liew, in an interview, decried Mr. Mahathir\u2019s obsession with showy construction; the Petronas Twin Towers, briefly the world\u2019s tallest buildings, were erected during his time.Kathy Rowland, a Malaysian arts researcher who wrote an essay for the show\u2019s catalog, noted that it was during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s time that the state built a national theater, a national art gallery \u2014 both planned under earlier administrations \u2014 and a home for the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra at the base of the Petronas Twin Towers. \u201cI suppose a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d she said.The show comes at a time when Mr. Mahathir, 91, is starting a new political party and forging a once-unthinkable alliance with the opposition to try to oust the current prime minister, Najib Razak, who is implicated in a billion-dollar scandal involving a state fund named 1MDB. That the gallery, as well as the skyscraper it\u2019s located in, is owned by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and one of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s closest allies, only adds to the intrigue.Mr. Willie, the curator, said that he had the idea for the show for a while and that the timing with current events is coincidental. Mr. Daim, a longtime art collector, provides the space for Ilham \u2014 12,000 square feet over two floors, in a building designed by Foster + Partners on the edge of the central business district. He pays Mr. Willie, who used to own five galleries across Southeast Asia, a fee to run it, but does not interfere in curatorial decisions, Mr. Willie said. Entry is free and none of the works are for sale.Ilham\u2019s ownership has perturbed some in the arts community, who fear that artists are being co-opted in some larger political tussle. Ray Langenbach, an American who worked in Malaysia for years and is now a theater professor at the University of the Arts Helsinki, said he rejected a request from the gallery to include his 1994 video documenting a performance piece by another artist.The piece was based on one of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s most severe crackdowns, 1987\u2019s Operation Lalang \u2014 \u201clalang\u201d is a hardy local weed \u2014 when 106 activists, politicians, intellectuals, students and others were detained for allegedly stoking racial tension. \u201cAllowing criticism of his past acts makes Mahathir stronger now,\u201d Mr. Langenbach said in an email. (The gallery used news clippings about the performance piece instead.)Still, the gallery has attracted the participation of many independent voices.\u201cIt\u2019s a relevant art show, and you see a lot of anger from the time he was in power,\u201d said Jahabar Sadiq, a Malaysian journalist who also wrote an essay on Mr. Mahathir\u2019s legacy for the show\u2019s catalog. In it, he described the former leader\u2019s biggest fault as bringing an over-concentration of power to the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cOf course there\u2019s an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sadiq said. \u201cThe agenda is I want you to talk about it! This is therapy for the country. The country needs this therapy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scrutiny of Commercial Real Estate Loans Chills Small Lenders", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byFinancing commercial property has been local banks\u2019 bread-and-butter business for years, but a postcrisis push for loan growth prompted regulatory warnings about lax lending standards, and small banks are now shying away from the market.A shakeout in commercial real estate is under way as some banks unwind or sell off the loans that are under regulators\u2019 microscopes, and bankers say they are wary of making new loans.Brokers say they are finding fewer lenders for some commercial property deals. Aaron Appel at Jones Lang LaSalle in New York said there was less competition for $5 million to $10 million commercial property deals, particularly loans that involve construction or redevelopment projects, which are considered riskier because they are not properties that are generating income.Commercial property brokers have been working more with institutional investors like private equity and pension funds partly as a result of some banks taking a step back, Mr. Appel and others said. And foreign banks have stepped in on some of the deals.As a result, bankers say they are sticking to business closer to home and finding growth by acquiring other small banks.Joseph J. Lebel III, chief lending officer of OceanFirst Bank in Toms River, N.J., has reviewed some of the commercial loans that other banks have put up for sale recently but decided not to buy any because they have weak loan terms and other features that point to aggressive underwriting.OceanFirst, with $4.2 billion in assets, is being more selective about its lending and focusing on smaller deals, Mr. Lebel said. The bank has the capacity to make $10 million to $20 million commercial loans, but it does not want to aggressively compete for those loans, he said. Instead, the bank recently acquired another Jersey Shore bank, Ocean City Home Bank, for about $146 million.\u201cMy market is a market that I can drive to my customer and my customer can drive to me,\u201d Mr. Lebel said. \u201cIt\u2019s relationship-based lending where they know us, we know them, we\u2019ve been in their offices, they\u2019ve been in our branches and you build a little bit more than a transactional-based relationship.\u201dThis year, Frank Sorrentino III, a builder and developer turned banker, was hearing from former peers that his bank\u2019s rates were too high. They said his company, ConnectOne Bancorp, a $4 billion bank in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., was out of step in the competition for deals to finance apartment complexes and other commercial buildings in northern New Jersey. Mr. Sorrentino, who helped found ConnectOne a decade ago, said regulatory scrutiny on lending had led to fewer banks making commercial real estate loans on the New Jersey side of the New York metropolitan area.Mr. Sorrentino estimated that about two-thirds of ConnectOne\u2019s remaining competitors \u2014 the banks that are not under a regulatory agreement or have not yet sold themselves \u2014 have been \u201chobbled.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re being more cautious,\u201d he said.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have warned banks away from using more than 300 percent of a minimum capital standard for commercial real estate loans. For regional and local banks, that can be a low limit, because commercial property loans are among the largest loans they make, explained Dennis S. Hudson III, chief executive of Seacoast Bank, a lender in Stuart, Fla., with $4.4 billion in assets.Seacoast has been focusing on deals under $8 million. \u201cHere in Florida, we\u2019ve been through downturns in the past, and we know that if you have too much exposure in commercial real estate, you can have higher risk, so we\u2019ve intentionally stayed away from it,\u201d said Mr. Hudson, the third member of his family to run Seacoast.Bigger American banks have also been drawing back from taking on large commercial property loans because they can no longer count on being able to sell some of the credit to investors through syndication. In the past, bigger banks might make a $500 million loan and sell $25 million chunks of it to smaller banks; but now, those smaller lenders are bumping up against regulators\u2019 limits for commercial real estate loans.\u201cThat market has kind of filled up on the domestic front, so they\u2019re going internationally to find those lenders,\u201d said Michael Gigliotti, senior managing director and a broker at the real estate financing firm HFF in New York. Federal Reserve data shows that the American offices of foreign banks have increased their commercial mortgage holdings 56 percent in the last year to $51.8 billion. The Shops at Hudson Yards project in New York, Mr. Gigliotti noted, was financed entirely by foreign banks, among them Deutsche Bank, Bank of China, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Commercial Bank of China and Bank of Nova Scotia.For local banks, regulators\u2019 pushback over commercial property loans means another squeeze on growth and profitability that is likely to lead to further thinning of bank numbers, said Collyn Gilbert, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. \u201cCommercial real estate has been such the lifeline for community banks for decades upon decades,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said. \u201cIf we are seeing a shift in that, then where are these banks going to go for growth?\u201dThere were 6,122 banks in the United States in the second quarter, and at the current pace of consolidation, it should dip below 6,000 this quarter, as banks like New Jersey\u2019s OceanFirst try to expand their business without increasing their risk.Its purchase of the 11-branch Ocean City Home Bank adds another conservative lender and a longtime local fixture. Analysts said it was hard for smaller banks like Ocean City Home Bank to resist selling out in this environment. \u201cI think the smarter bankers know that the outlook is only going to get tougher and tougher,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said.Ocean City Home Bank, like others, had tried to expand to spread out its increasing compliance costs.\u201cThere were really no other banks in our area that we could acquire,\u201d said Steven E. Brady, the bank\u2019s chief executive, adding that compliance expenses at Ocean City Home Bank have gone up 50 percent because of the Dodd-Frank Act. When two other banks approached Ocean City Home Bank, Mr. Brady saw an opportunity. \u201cWe had the same rules and regulations as Chase, but we didn\u2019t have the scale to do it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Streamlined Test to Determine Insider Trading", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewCongress has never passed a law defining the crime of insider trading. This legislative vacuum has left the courts to make up the rules as they see fit.Last week, the Supreme Court heard argument in United States v. Salman, the most important insider trading case to reach the court in decades. The justices\u2019 frustration was evident as they struggled to develop a definition of the crime that would outlaw obvious cheating, while at the same time protect the legitimate exchange of corporate information that enhances the efficiency of the securities markets.By all means, Congress should pass an insider trading statute. But as long as our elected representatives shirk their responsibility in this area, the Supreme Court should adopt a common-sense approach that market participants can understand and juries can apply. A sensible rule would be to distinguish tips to close friends and family \u2014 which are almost always made for personal reasons and with no plausible business purpose \u2014 from disclosures to work colleagues, social acquaintances and others. Outside the circle of close friends and family, motives are more ambiguous, and the government should be held to a higher standard to establish a crime.The courts have long said that trading on inside information is a crime only when an insider exploits confidential company information for personal gain. If an insider discloses information by mistake \u2014 say, by speaking loudly on a mobile phone in public \u2014 trading on the information is permitted. Nor is it illegal to trade on information that an insider furnishes out of a desire to benefit the company, for example, an executive\u2019s effort to promote favorable analyst coverage by giving out confidential details of upcoming financial results. Although that kind of selective disclosure may result in civil liability under the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Regulation FD, it is not a crime. A criminal prosecution is permitted only when the insider personally benefits from the disclosure and is deemed to have defrauded the insider\u2019s employer by using for personal advantage information that was intended only to serve corporate purposes.There is little dispute among courts and scholars that an insider benefits personally when giving a tip in exchange for money or other tangible value. A personal benefit can also be intangible. Few would disagree that an insider who tips in exchange for an appointment to an important charitable board receives a personal benefit in the form of enhanced reputation or the gratification of accomplishing a deeply desired personal goal.The harder question is whether an insider who gives valuable information for free benefits personally from the mere act of giving. The Supreme Court touched on this issue more than 30 years ago when it mentioned tips to a \u201ctrading relative or friend\u201d among a handful of illustrations of illegal insider trading.The ensuing years have brought little clarity to the issue, however, as was apparent at last week\u2019s argument in the Salman case. In that case, an investment banker gave inside information to his brother. On appeal, the defendant argued that because the banker had received nothing tangible in exchange, it was legal to trade. The Supreme Court was understandably skeptical of that argument \u2013 making a gift to your brother is like helping yourself, observed Justice Stephen G. Breyer. But the justices were equally unsatisfied with the government\u2019s view that an insider always benefited when passing inside information knowing that the recipient will trade on it.The way forward is to carve out a subset of relationships \u2014 close friends and family \u2014 for which a benefit to the tipper is presumed, but to require more exacting proof when the disclosure is to others. It is fair to presume that someone who gives valuable inside information to a relative or close friend intends the disclosure as a personal gesture that gratifies both giver and recipient alike. Prosecutors should not have to identify and prove the precise personal advantage that a corporate executive receives by tipping a brother, a lover or a best friend. The benefit to the giver is inherent in the closeness of the relationship and does not need to be independently established. And, because many insider trading cases involve tips to close friends and family, this streamlined approach would apply to a large number of the most egregious cases.On the other hand, disclosures made to more limited relations \u2014 professional contacts, social acquaintances or even strangers \u2014 may have a host of different motivations, some personal and some not. When a finance executive tells an analyst that the coming quarter will be disappointing, the tip may be given with the expectation of some personal favor (illegal to trade) or because the executive thinks the company will be better off if the bad news leaks and there is no big surprise on earnings day (legal to trade).Given the ambiguities, the prosecution should have to prove a quid pro quo involving something consequential and objectively valuable. This is not to say that the personal benefit requires money to change hands. Intangibles count, but the prosecution should have to identify and prove the personal benefit in each case when the recipient is not a close friend or relative. Put another way, the mere act of giving a gift should not be considered a benefit to the giver outside the context of close personal relationships.A successful definition of insider trading should set down a line bright enough that juries will be able to apply it consistently and market participants will know when they are crossing it. Knowing who is a relative is straightforward enough. But what does it mean to be a \u201cclose\u201d friend?Definitional questions like these can prove thorny in practice. In the Salman case, the justices were unconvinced that juries could distinguish between disclosures for \u201cpersonal\u201d as opposed to \u201ccorporate\u201d purposes, especially because many tips involve multiple, overlapping purposes. One advantage of the \u201crelative\u201d or \u201cclose friend\u201d test, though, is that these are common-sense concepts with which most people are quite familiar. Haven\u2019t we all been asked at some point if someone was a close friend? And weren\u2019t we able to answer the question without resorting to legal treatises?Court decisions are an unsatisfactory way to define insider trading. But if the courts must decide, then the goal should be a clear rule that prohibits personal enrichment, while avoiding restrictions that will chill the free flow of information. Tips to close friends and relatives are invariably personal in nature and should be presumed to benefit the giver. When disclosures go beyond that group, the government should bear the burden of proving an objective and consequential quid pro quo to ensure that legitimate communications are protected.Stephen Fishbein is a lawyer in New York who specializes in insider trading matters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Portland\u2019s Small-House Movement Is Catching On", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byA simple 800-square-foot cottage in Portland, Ore., has helped focus attention on the need for affordable housing that can be wedged into existing urban spaces.The cottage, which won a top design award last year from the American Institute of Architects, is technically called an \u201caccessory dwelling unit,\u201d or A.D.U. Portland has been ahead of the curve in allowing these smaller housing units, which are illegal in many cities and towns under current zoning rules.They certainly are not seen as design statements; when such units are built in garages or basements, they tend to be dismissed as \u201cgranny flats.\u201dThe success of the cottage, designed for Ann Wilson, 68, an interior designer, left its architect, Ben Waechter, amazed. \u201cIt was dramatic to get an honor award for such a small project,\u201d he said. \u201cPortland has always encouraged a limited growth boundary, so this will encourage density in the center.\u201dThe cottage, known as Garden House, is hidden behind Ms. Wilson\u2019s 1924 gabled bungalow, which she now rents to the older of her two sons. The cottage\u2019s silhouette looks crisply modern: an upward-pointing arrow in a garden setting. The arrow shaft has open-plan living spaces; horizontal windows are the only breaks on its south side; and wide floor-to-ceiling doors and windows open to outdoor living space on the east and west sides.Upstairs, the arrowhead contains the bedroom, whose floor cantilevers outward to form deep overhangs above the outdoor space below.In 2010, during the economic slump, when many building plans were being shelved, Portland presciently began to allow homeowners the right to develop accessory dwelling units on standard 5,000-square-foot residential lots for the first time. The city also eliminated development charges of up to $15,000 for new accessory dwelling units to spur homeowners to build.More incentives followed: Homeowners could build and even rent out a unit that did not have off-street parking; any design not visible from the street could be built without input from neighbors; and new height limits \u2014 raised to 20 feet from 18 feet \u2014 encouraged two-story units, like Ms. Wilson\u2019s.\u201cAll that helped,\u201d said Shawn Wood, a construction waste specialist at the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and an expert on accessory dwelling units. \u201cWe went from about 35 A.D.U. permits in 2010 to 250 in 2015.\u201d\u201cThe benefits of cities growing inward are many,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cPeople can take advantage of existing infrastructure and maintain old neighborhoods.\u201d And residents can downsize and age in place.The Garden House has been influential, especially on the West Coast.Not surprisingly, the concentration of accessory dwelling units has been in central, higher-income areas close to amenities like transit and shops. \u201cPart of this could be due to the fact that people with large amounts of equity can more easily secure financing,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cThe City of Portland and Portland State University will be working on a project to encourage and facilitate A.D.U. development in more diverse neighborhoods.\u201dIf a condominium, like a single-family home, could have an accessory unit, he said, a 10-unit condominium building could have 20 dwellings. And while multi-unit buildings are allowed in commercial zones, Mr. Potestio said that similar rules for residential lots would help the environment. \u201cWhen A.D.U.s are incorporated with duplexes that share common walls, less open permeable space is lost,\u201d he said.Accessory dwelling units are changing lives in other unexpected ways.Bryan Scott, 40, a software designer and technology consultant in Portland, and his wife, Jen Wantland, 42, an apparel industry planner, quit their jobs in 2012 to travel in Mexico but returned earlier than planned, and found that the renters in their home could not shorten their stay. Lacking affordable alternatives, Mr. Scott and Ms. Wantland decided in late 2013 to convert their 480-square-foot garage into a pied-\u00e0-terre. \u201cUntil then, we had never heard of A.D.U.s,\u201d Mr. Scott said, speaking recently from his 1967 Volkswagen van while traveling in British Columbia.Ms. Daringa and Mr. Corotis live with their 3-year-old daughter, Alexa, in the older of the buildings, a 100-year-old, 1,200-square-foot house that faces the street. Mr. Corotis\u2019s sister, Lindsay Cortis, 39, who is a building contractor, lives in the 900-square-foot 1950s cottage in back. They share tandem parking spaces and the central courtyard.\u201cWe wanted to extend our living space to the outside,\u201d Ms. Daringa said. So, in lieu of a mudroom, they built a breakfast room with doors to the garden that let light into the refurbished kitchen, too.\u201cIt was a lot of work. We were only 28 when we started, and na\u00efve about how much work it would be,\u201d Ms. Daringa said. But sweat equity kept costs under $215,000.In some ways, Ms. Daringa said, the result reminded her of her grandmother\u2019s place in Romania, where she grew up.\u201cWe have created a small family compound,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated Daniel Garber\u2019s former occupation.

{"Headline": "How U.S. Torture Left a Legacy of Damaged Minds", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Beatings, sleep deprivation, menacing and other brutal tactics have led to persistent mental health problems among detainees held in secret C.I.A. prisons and at Guant\u00e1namo.Supported byBefore the United States permitted a terrifying way of interrogating prisoners, government lawyers and intelligence officials assured themselves of one crucial outcome. They knew that the methods inflicted on terrorism suspects would be painful, shocking and far beyond what the country had ever accepted. But none of it, they concluded, would cause long lasting psychological harm.Fifteen years later, it is clear they were wrong.Today in Slovakia, Hussein al-Marfadi describes permanent headaches and disturbed sleep, plagued by memories of dogs inside a blackened jail. In Kazakhstan, Lutfi bin Ali is haunted by nightmares of suffocating at the bottom of a well. In Libya, the radio from a passing car spurs rage in Majid Mokhtar Sasy al-Maghrebi, reminding him of the C.I.A. prison where earsplitting music was just one assault to his senses.And then there is the despair of men who say they are no longer themselves. \u201cI am living this kind of depression,\u201d said Younous Chekkouri, a Moroccan, who fears going outside because he sees faces in crowds as Guant\u00e1namo Bay guards. \u201cI\u2019m not normal anymore.\u201dAfter enduring agonizing treatment in secret C.I.A. prisons around the world or coercive practices at the military detention camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, dozens of detainees developed persistent mental health problems, according to previously undisclosed medical records, government documents and interviews with former prisoners and military and civilian doctors. Some emerged with the same symptoms as American prisoners of war who were brutalized decades earlier by some of the world\u2019s cruelest regimes.Those subjected to the tactics included victims of mistaken identity or flimsy evidence that the United States later disavowed. Others were foot soldiers for the Taliban or Al Qaeda who were later deemed to pose little threat. Some were hardened terrorists, including those accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks or the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole. In several cases, their mental status has complicated the nation\u2019s long effort to bring them to justice.Americans have long debated the legacy of post-Sept. 11 interrogation methods, asking whether they amounted to torture or succeeded in extracting intelligence. But even as President Obama continues transferring people from Guant\u00e1namo and Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, promises to bring back techniques, now banned, such as waterboarding, the human toll has gone largely uncalculated.At least half of the 39 people who went through the C.I.A.\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d program, which included depriving them of sleep, dousing them with ice water, slamming them into walls and locking them in coffin-like boxes, have since shown psychiatric problems, The New York Times found. Some have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, paranoia, depression or psychosis.Hundreds more detainees moved through C.I.A. \u201cblack sites\u201d or Guant\u00e1namo, where the military inflicted sensory deprivation, isolation, menacing with dogs and other tactics on men who now show serious damage. Nearly all have been released.\u201cThere is no question that these tactics were entirely inconsistent with our values as Americans, and their consequences present lasting challenges for us as a country and for the individuals involved,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.The United States government has never studied the long-term psychological effects of the extraordinary interrogation practices it embraced. A Defense Department spokeswoman, asked about long-term mental harm, responded that prisoners were treated humanely and had access to excellent care. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment.This article is based on a broad sampling of cases and an examination of hundreds of documents, including court records, military commission transcripts and medical assessments. The Times interviewed more than 100 people, including former detainees in a dozen countries. A full accounting is all but impossible because many former prisoners never had access to outside doctors or lawyers, and any records about their interrogation treatment and health status remain classified.Researchers caution that it can be difficult to determine cause and effect with mental illness. Some prisoners of the C.I.A. and the military had underlying psychological problems that may have made them more susceptible to long-term difficulties; others appeared to have been remarkably resilient. Incarceration, particularly the indefinite detention without charges that the United States devised, is inherently stressful. Still, outside medical consultants and former government officials said they saw a pattern connecting the harsh practices to psychiatric issues.Those treating prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo for mental health issues typically did not ask their patients what had happened during their questioning. Some physicians, though, saw evidence of mental harm almost immediately.\u201cMy staff was dealing with the consequences of the interrogations without knowing what was going on,\u201d said Albert J. Shimkus, a retired Navy captain who served as the commanding officer of the Guant\u00e1namo hospital in the prison\u2019s early years. Back then, still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks, the government was desperate to stave off more.But Captain Shimkus now regrets not making more inquiries. \u201cThere was a conflict,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween our medical duty to our patients and our duty to the mission, as soldiers.\u201dAfter prisoners were released from American custody, some found neither help nor relief. Mohammed Abdullah Saleh al-Asad, a businessman in Tanzania, and others were snatched, interrogated and imprisoned, then sent home without explanation. They returned to their families deeply scarred from interrogations, isolation and the shame of sexual taunts, forced nudity, aggressive body cavity searches and being kept in diapers.Mr. Asad, who died in May, was held for more than a year in several secret C.I.A. prisons. \u201cSometimes, between husband and wife, he would admit to how awful he felt,\u201d his widow, Zahra Mohamed, wrote in a statement prepared for the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. \u201cHe was humiliated, and that feeling never went away.\u201dIn a cold room once used for interrogations at Guant\u00e1namo, Stephen N. Xenakis, a former military psychiatrist, faced a onetime Qaeda child soldier, Omar Khadr. It was December 2008, and this evaluation had been two years in the making.The doctor, a retired brigadier general who had overseen several military hospitals, had not sought the assignment. The son of an Air Force combat veteran, he debated even accepting it. \u201cI\u2019m still a soldier,\u201d General Xenakis recalls thinking. Was this good for the country? When he finally agreed, he told Mr. Khadr\u2019s lawyers that they were paying for an independent medical opinion, not a hired gun.Mr. Khadr, a Canadian citizen, had been wounded and captured in a firefight at age 15 at a suspected terrorist compound in Afghanistan, where he said he had been sent to translate for foreign fighters by his father, a Qaeda member. Years later, he would plead guilty to war crimes, including throwing a grenade that killed an Army medic. At the time, though, he was the youngest prisoner at Guant\u00e1namo.He told his lawyers that the American soldiers had kept him from sleeping, spit in his face and threatened him with rape. In one meeting with the psychiatrist, Mr. Khadr, then 22, began to sweat and fan himself, despite the air-conditioned chill. He tugged his shirt off, and General Xenakis realized that he was witnessing an anxiety attack.When it happened again, Mr. Khadr explained that he had once urinated during an interrogation and soldiers had dragged him through the mess. \u201cThis is the room where they used me as a human mop,\u201d he said.General Xenakis had seen such anxiety before, decades earlier, as a young psychiatrist at Letterman Army Medical Center in California. It was often the first stop for American prisoners of war after they left Vietnam. The doctor recalled the men, who had endured horrific abuses, suffering panic attacks, headaches and psychotic episodes.That session with Mr. Khadr was the beginning of General Xenakis\u2019s immersion into the treatment of detainees. He has reviewed medical and interrogation records of about 50 current and former prisoners and examined about 15 of the detainees, more than any other outside psychiatrist, colleagues say.General Xenakis found that Mr. Khadr had post-traumatic stress disorder, a conclusion the military contested. Many of General Xenakis\u2019s diagnoses in other cases remain classified or sealed by court order, but he said he consistently found links between harsh American interrogation methods and psychiatric disorders.Back home in Virginia, General Xenakis delved into research on the effects of abusive practices. He found decades of papers on the issue \u2014 science that had not been considered when the government began crafting new interrogation policies after Sept. 11.At the end of the Vietnam War, military doctors noticed that former prisoners of war developed psychiatric disorders far more often than other soldiers, an observation also made of former P.O.W.s from World War II and the Korean War. The data could not be explained by imprisonment alone, researchers found. Former soldiers who suffered torture or mistreatment were more likely than others to develop long-term problems.By the mid-1980s, the Veterans Administration had linked such treatment to memory loss, an exaggerated startle reflex, horrific nightmares, headaches and an inability to concentrate. Studies noted similar symptoms among torture survivors in South Africa, Turkey and Chile. Such research helped lay the groundwork for how American doctors now treat combat veterans.\u201cIn hindsight, that should have come to the fore\u201d in the post-Sept. 11 interrogation debate, said John Rizzo, the C.I.A.\u2019s top lawyer at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t think the long-term effects were ever explored in any real depth.\u201dWith fear of another terrorist attack, there was little incentive or time to find contrary evidence, Mr. Rizzo said. \u201cThe government wanted a solution,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt wanted a path to get these guys to talk.\u201dThe question of what ultimately happened to Dr. Seligman\u2019s dogs never arose in the legal debate. They were strays, and once the studies were over, they were euthanized.Mohamed Ben Soud cannot say for certain when the Americans began using ice water to torment him. The C.I.A. prison in Afghanistan, known as the Salt Pit, was perpetually dark, so the days passed imperceptibly.The United States called the treatment \u201cwater dousing,\u201d but the term belies the grisly details. Mr. Ben Soud, in court documents and interviews, described being forced onto a plastic tarp while naked, his hands shackled above his head. Sometimes he was hooded. One C.I.A. official poured buckets of ice water on him as others lifted the tarp\u2019s corners, sending water splashing over him and causing a choking or drowning sensation. He said he endured the treatment multiple times.Mr. Ben Soud was among the early captives in the C.I.A.\u2019s network of prisons in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Romania and Lithuania. Again and again, he said, he told the American interrogators that he was not their enemy. A Libyan, he said he had fled to Pakistan in 1991 and joined an armed Islamist movement aimed at toppling Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi\u2019s dictatorship. Pakistani and United States officials stormed his home and arrested him in 2003. Under interrogation, he said, he denied knowing or fighting with Osama bin Laden or two senior Qaeda operatives.In 2004, the C.I.A. turned Mr. Ben Soud over to Libya, which imprisoned him until the United States helped topple the Qaddafi government seven years later. In interviews, he and other Libyans said they were treated better by Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s jailers than by the C.I.A.Today, Mr. Ben Soud, 47, is a free man, but said he is in constant fear of tomorrow. He is racked with self-doubt and struggles to make simple decisions. His moods swing dramatically.\u201c\u2018Dad, why did you suddenly get angry?\u2019 \u2018Why did you suddenly snap?\u2019\u201d Mr. Ben Soud said his children ask. \u201c\u2018Did we do anything that made you angry?\u2019\u201dExplaining would mean saying that the Americans kept him shackled in painful contortions, or that they locked him in boxes \u2014 one the size of a coffin, the other even smaller, he said in a phone interview from his home in Misurata, Libya. They slammed him against the wall and chained him from the ceiling as the prison echoed with the sounds of rock music.\u201cHow can you explain such things to children?\u201d he asked.Mr. Ben Soud was one of the men identified in a 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report as having been subjected to the C.I.A.\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d Condemning the methods as brutal and ineffective in extracting intelligence, the report noted that interrogators also used unapproved tactics such as mock executions, threats to harm prisoners\u2019 children or rape their family members, and \u201crectal feeding,\u201d which involved inserting liquid food supplements or pur\u00e9es into the rectum.Senate investigators did not set out to study the psychological consequences of the harsh treatment, but their unclassified summary revealed several cases of men suffering hallucinations, depression, paranoia and other symptoms. The full 6,000-page classified report offers many more examples, said Daniel Jones, a former F.B.I. analyst who led the Senate investigation.\u201cThe records we reviewed clearly indicate a connection between their treatment in C.I.A. custody and their mental state,\u201d Mr. Jones said in an interview.At least 119 men moved through the C.I.A. jails, where the interrogations were designed to disrupt the senses and increase helplessness \u2014 factors that researchers decades earlier had said could make people more susceptible to psychological harm. Forced nudity, sensory deprivation and endless light or dark were considered routine.Many of those men were later released without charges, unsure of why they were held. About one in four prisoners should never have been captured, or turned out to have been misidentified by the C.I.A., Senate investigators concluded. Khaled el-Masri, a German citizen, is the best known case.Macedonian authorities arrested him while he was on vacation in December 2003 and turned him over to the C.I.A. Mr. Masri said officials beat him, stripped him, forced a suppository into him and flew him to a black site in Afghanistan. He was held for months, he said, in a concrete cell with no bed, and endured more beatings and interrogations.Years later, Mr. Masri\u2019s nightmares are accompanied by a paralyzing tightness in his chest, he said. \u201cI have been suffering from absent-mindedness, amnesia, inability to memorize, depression, helplessness, apathy, loss of interest in the future, slow thinking, and anxiety,\u201d Mr. Masri wrote in an email.Ms. Mohamed, the widow of Mr. Asad, the Tanzanian businessman, said he returned home paranoid and anxious.\u201cHe used to forget things that he never would have forgotten before,\u201d she wrote recently. \u201cFor example, he would talk with someone on the phone and later forget to whom he had been talking.\u201d\u201cMohammed\u2019s personality changed after his detention,\u201d his wife wrote. \u201cSomething tiny would happen and he would blow up \u2014 he would be so angry \u2014 I had never ever seen him like this before. At these times, he would come close to crying, and he would withdraw to be alone.\u201dToday at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the Caribbean landscape is reclaiming the relics of the American detention system. Weeds overtake fences in abandoned areas of the prison complex. Guard towers sit empty. It is eerily quiet.Asked about their psychological well-being, Rear Adm. Peter J. Clarke, the commander at Guant\u00e1namo, said in an interview: \u201cWhat I observe are detainees who are well adjusted, and I see no indications of ill effects of anything that may have happened in the past.\u201dCapt. Richard Quattrone of the Navy, who left his post as the prison\u2019s chief medical officer in September, said his staff mostly dealt with detainees\u2019 anxiety over whether they would be released. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to some of my predecessors,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cand from what they say, it\u2019s vastly different today.\u201dAbout 20 detainees are cleared for release. Another 10 are being prosecuted or have already been convicted in military commissions. The fate of the remaining men, including some of the high-value prisoners, is unclear. For now they are considered too dangerous to release, but have not been charged.For some men who have been released, Guant\u00e1namo is not easily left behind. Mr. Chekkouri, a Moroccan living in Afghanistan in 2001, was held for years as a suspected member of a group linked to Al Qaeda. He said he was beaten repeatedly at a United States military jail in Kandahar and forced to watch soldiers do the same to his younger brother.Mr. Chekkouri is a Sufi, a member of a mystical Islamic sect that has been oppressed by Al Qaeda and others. At Guant\u00e1namo, he was kept in isolation.When he asserted his innocence, he said, interrogators threatened to turn him over to the Moroccan authorities, who have a history of torture. The Americans warned that his family in Morocco could be jailed and abused, he said, and showed him execution photos. Interrogators repeatedly made him believe his transfer was imminent, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to say goodbye,\u201d interrogation files cited in court documents say. \u201cMorocco wants you back.\u201dNow, he is under a psychiatrist\u2019s care and takes antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs. He complains of flashbacks, persistent nightmares and panic attacks. He also suffers an embarrassing inability to urinate until it becomes painful. It started, he said, when he was left chained for hours during interrogations and soiled himself. His doctors say there is nothing they can treat.\u201cThey tell me everything is normal,\u201d he said. \u201cYour brain is playing games. It is something mental. You\u2019re still living in Gitmo. It\u2019s fear.\u201dMr. Chekkouri saw psychiatrists at Guant\u00e1namo, but he said he did not trust them. He and others believed the doctors shared information about medical problems with interrogators. In one case, a psychiatrist prescribed the antipsychotic medication olanzapine to a prisoner. He then suggested that interrogators exploit a side effect, food cravings, according to another military doctor who later reviewed the records.Normally, such information would be confidential, but Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s dual missions of caring for prisoners and extracting information created conflicts. Over time, the military created two mental health teams. One, led by psychiatrists, was there to heal. The other, called the Behavioral Science Consultation Team, was led by psychologists with a very different mission.On Sept. 3, 2003, after a teenager named Mohammed Jawad was seen talking to a poster on the wall, an interrogator called for a consultation with a BSCT (pronounced \u201cBiscuit\u201d) psychologist. Mohammed\u2019s age at the time is in dispute. The military says it captured him at 17; his lawyer says he was more likely 14 or younger. However old, he was pleading for his mother.When the psychologist arrived, the goal was not to ease the young man\u2019s distress, but to exploit it.\u201cThe detainee comes across as a very immature, dependent individual, claiming to miss his mother and his young siblings, but his demeanor looks like it is a resistance technique,\u201d the psychologist wrote, according to notes seen by The Times. \u201cHe tries to look as if he is so sad that he is depressed. During today\u2019s interrogation, he appeared to be rather frightened, and it looks as if he could easily break.\u201dThe psychologist, who was not identified in the notes, recommended that Mr. Jawad be kept away from anyone who spoke his language. \u201cMake him as uncomfortable as possible,\u201d the psychologist advised. \u201cWork him as hard as possible.\u201dThe guards placed him in isolation for 30 days. They then subjected him to the \u201cfrequent flier program,\u201d a method of sleep deprivation. Guards yanked Mr. Jawad from cell to cell 112 times, waking him an average of every three hours, day and night, for two weeks straight, according to court records.After being held for years, Mr. Jawad was charged in 2007 with throwing a grenade that wounded American soldiers. But the evidence collapsed. The military prosecutor, Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld, withdrew from the case and declared that there was no evidence to justify charges. \u201cThere is, however, reliable evidence that he was badly mistreated by U.S. authorities, both in Afghanistan and at Guant\u00e1namo, and he has suffered, and continues to suffer, great psychological harm,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the court.Katherine Porterfield, a New York University psychologist, found Mr. Jawad to have PTSD after examining him in 2009. Seven years after his capture, she said, he suffered from flashbacks and anxiety attacks. A panel of military doctors disagreed. Medical records from Guant\u00e1namo include repeated notes such as \u201cno psych issues at this time,\u201d or the prisoner \u201cdenied any psych problem.\u201dThe military dropped all charges against Mr. Jawad, who is now living in Pakistan. He declined to discuss his mental health. But in a series of text messages, he wrote: \u201cThey tortured us in jails, gave us severe physical and mental pain, bombarded our villages, cities, mosques, schools.\u201d He added, \u201cOf course we have\u201d flashbacks, panic attacks and nightmares.It has been difficult to determine the scale of mental health problems at Guant\u00e1namo, much less how many cases are linked to the treatment the prisoners endured. Most medical records remain classified. Anecdotal accounts, though, have emerged over the years.Andy Davidson, a retired Navy captain who served as the chief psychologist treating prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo from July to October 2003, said most appeared to be in good health, but he still saw \u201can awful lot\u201d of mental health issues there.\u201cThere were definitely guys who had PTSD symptoms,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere were definitely guys who had poor sleeping, nightmares. There were guys who were definitely shell shocked with a thousand-mile stare. There were guys who were depressed, avoidant.\u201dThe two based their study on the medical records and interrogation files of the prisoners, all of whom had arrived at Guant\u00e1namo in its first year, had never been in C.I.A. custody, and were never charged with any crimes. In none of those cases, the study said, did Guant\u00e1namo doctors document any inquiries into whether the symptoms were tied to interrogation tactics.Today in Tangier, Morocco, Ahmed Errachidi runs two restaurants, has a wife and five children and has been free for nearly a decade. The United States military once asserted that he trained at a Qaeda camp in early 2001, but the human rights group Reprieve later produced pay stubs showing that he had been working at the time as a cook in London.Mr. Errachidi had a history of bipolar disorder before arriving at Guant\u00e1namo, and after being held in isolation there, he said, he suffered a psychotic breakdown. He told interrogators that he had been Bin Laden\u2019s superior officer and warned that a giant snowball would overtake the world.Guant\u00e1namo still lurks around corners. Recently, at a market in Tangier, the clink of a chain caused a paralyzing flashback to the prison, where Mr. Errachidi was forced into painful stress positions, deprived of sleep and isolated. On chilly nights, when the blanket slips off, he is once again lying naked in a frigid cell, waiting for his next interrogation.\u201cAll I can think of is when are they going to take me back,\u201d Mr. Errachidi said in an interview. He compared his treatment by the Americans to being mugged by a trusted friend. \u201cIt is very, very scary when you are tortured by someone who doesn\u2019t believe in torture,\u201d he said. \u201cYou lose faith in everything.\u201dGuant\u00e1namo, particularly during its early years, operated on a system of rewards and punishments to exploit prisoners\u2019 vulnerabilities. That manipulation, taken to extremes, could have dangerous effects, as in the peculiar case of Tarek El Sawah.An Egyptian who said he was a Taliban soldier, Mr. Sawah was captured while fleeing bombing in Afghanistan in 2001 and turned over to the United States. He arrived at Guant\u00e1namo in May 2002. Though his brother, Jamal, said he had no history of mental problems, Mr. Sawah began shrieking at night, terrified by hallucinations.When he began defecating and urinating on himself, soldiers would hose him down in front of other detainees, a nearby prisoner stated in court documents. Mr. Sawah said he was given antipsychotic drugs, sometimes forcibly.After his breakdown, interrogators found Mr. Sawah eager to talk. \u201c\u2018Bring me good things to eat,\u2019\u201d he told them. They delivered McDonald\u2019s hamburgers or Subway sandwiches, multiple servings at a time.Mr. Sawah became a prized informant, though the value of what he offered is disputed, and he says he fabricated stories, including that he was a Qaeda member. He ballooned from about 215 pounds to well over 400 pounds, records show. When the interrogations ended and he was placed in a special hut for cooperators, the food kept coming. His jailers had to install a double-wide door for him.Mr. Sawah called it a competition between the interrogators, who used food as an incentive, and the doctors, who told him to lose weight. He developed coronary artery disease, diabetes, breathing disorders and other health problems, court records show.In 2013, General Xenakis examined him and, in a plea for better medical treatment, told a judge that \u201cMr. El Sawah\u2019s mental state has worsened and he appears apathetic with diminished will to live.\u201d The military responded that he was offered excellent medical care but refused it.Today in Bosnia, Mr. Sawah, 58, complains of frequent headaches and begs a doctor for antidepressants. His mood fluctuates wildly. Though he has lost weight, his eating remains compulsive. Over dinner with a reporter after a daily Ramadan fast, he ate a steak, French fries, a plate of dates and figs, a bowl of chicken soup, spinach pie, slices of bread, the uneaten portion of another steak, another bowl of soup, two lemonades, a Coke and nearly an entire cheese plate, six or seven slices at a time.\u201cHe\u2019s unbalanced,\u201d said his brother, who lives in New York. \u201cHe needs care. Mental care. Physical care.\u201dMr. Sawah does not blame American soldiers for his treatment. \u201cThey were afraid of me, afraid for their life,\u201d he said. \u201cGuant\u00e1namo on both sides was just very scared people who want to live.\u201dDuring a courtroom break, one of the men, Ammar al-Baluchi, asked to speak with a doctor. Xavier Amador, a New York psychologist who was consulting for another defendant, met with him. As they talked, Mr. Baluchi\u2019s eyes darted around the room, according to a summary of Dr. Amador\u2019s notes obtained by The Times. Mr. Baluchi said he struggled to focus, described \u201cterrifying anxiety\u201d and reported difficulty sleeping.Dr. Amador noted that Mr. Baluchi seemed to meet the criteria for PTSD, anxiety disorder and major depression. \u201cNo one can live like this,\u201d Mr. Baluchi told him.Mr. Baluchi, 39, was captured by Pakistani officers in April 2003. Though he was described as willing to talk, the C.I.A. moved him to a secret prison and immediately applied interrogation methods reserved for recalcitrant prisoners. In court documents and Mr. Baluchi\u2019s handwritten letters, he described being naked and dehydrated, chained to the ceiling so only his toes touched the floor. He endured ice-water dousing and said he was beaten until he saw flashes of light and lost consciousness. He recalls punches from his guards whenever he drifted asleep.Today, his lawyer said, Mr. Baluchi associates sleep with imminent pain. \u201cNot only did they not let me sleep,\u201d Mr. Baluchi wrote in a letter provided by the lawyer, \u201cthey trained me to keep myself awake.\u201dGuant\u00e1namo physicians have prescribed Mr. Baluchi antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills, according to his lawyer, James G. Connell III, who sends him deodorants and colognes to keep flashbacks at bay. \u201cThe whole time he was in C.I.A. custody, you\u2019re sitting there, smelling your own stink,\u201d Mr. Connell said. \u201cNow, whenever he catches a whiff of his own body odor, it sets him off.\u201dGeneral Xenakis, who is consulting on the case, found that Mr. Baluchi had PTSD and that he showed possible signs of a brain injury that may be linked to his beatings. He said Mr. Baluchi needed a brain scan, which the military opposes. The test would likely prompt more hearings, which could further complicate a trial.\u201cHaving caused these problems in the first place, now the United States has to deal with them at the military commissions,\u201d Mr. Connell said. \u201cAnd that takes time.\u201dThe compromised mental status of several other prisoners, like Mr. Baluchi, has affected the military proceedings against them.Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who admits helping plan the Sept. 11 attacks, has said he believes the military is tormenting him with vibrations, smells and sounds at Guant\u00e1namo. Military doctors there have found him to be delusional, and records indicate that his symptoms began in C.I.A. custody, after brutal tactics and years of solitary confinement.But Mr. bin al-Shibh refused to meet with doctors to assess his competency and insists he is sane, so the case continues.Lawyers have similarly raised questions about Abd al-Nashiri\u2019s psychological state. Accused in the U.S.S. Cole bombing, he was subjected to waterboarding, mock execution, rectal feeding and other techniques \u2014 some approved, some not \u2014 at C.I.A. sites. Even after internal warnings that Mr. Nashiri was about to go \u201cover the edge psychologically,\u201d the C.I.A. pressed forward.Over the years, government doctors have diagnosed Mr. Nashiri with anxiety, major depression and PTSD. His lawyers do not dispute his competency to stand trial, though no such trial is imminent. His torture and mental decline, though, could make it harder for prosecutors to win a death sentence.When the Walter Reed doctors evaluated Mr. Nashiri, \u201cthey concluded that he suffers from chronic, complex, untreated PTSD,\u201d his lawyer told a military judge in 2014. \u201cAnd they attributed it to his time in C.I.A. custody.\u201dIn Libya today, a former C.I.A. prisoner named Salih Hadeeyah al-Daeiki struggles to focus, and his memory fails him. He finds himself confusing the names of his children. Sometimes, he withdraws from his family to be alone.A survivor of the C.I.A. interrogation in the Salt Pit, Mr. Daeiki says he was kept naked, humiliated and chained to the wall as loud music blared. Sleep is difficult now, but when it comes, his interrogators haunt him there.\u201cSomething is strangling me or I\u2019m falling from high,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cOr sometimes I see ghosts following me, chasing me.\u201dLast year, a video surfaced showing Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s son, Saadi, being blindfolded and forced to listen to what sounded like the screams of other prisoners inside Al Hadba, a prison holding members of the former regime \u2014 Libya\u2019s own high-value detainees. Someone beat the soles of his feet with a stick.As the scene unfolded, Mr. Daeiki appeared on the screen.The beating was a mistake, he later acknowledged, but he did nothing to stop it. The goal was to collect intelligence to prevent bloodshed, he said.He was an interrogator now.Reporting was contributed by Jawad Sukhanyar from Kabul, Afghanistan; Rami Nazzal from Jerusalem; Nour Youssef from Cairo; Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Lebanon; Maher Samaan from Paris; Suliman Ali Zway from Berlin; and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Bad Promise on Debt", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton has made the American public a promise she shouldn\u2019t keep.She repeated it to a much wider audience a few weeks later. \u201cI have said repeatedly throughout this campaign, I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI also will not add a penny to the debt.\u201d She repeated the new vow two more times during the evening.But it is economically foolish to swear off all deficit spending. Mrs. Clinton is going further than simply promising to cover a new idea with increased tax revenue. She\u2019s promising that she won\u2019t put forward plans that add to the national debt.Politicians, of course, break promises made in the heat of campaigns. Think of no new taxes under President George H. W. Bush, or keeping the health insurance plan you like under President Obama. But by and large, research has found that presidents do at least try to stick to their word.This particular pledge, though, would significantly hem in Mrs. Clinton if she wins, particularly by blocking her from doing the very thing the economy desperately needs.A better promise than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s no-debt vow would be something like this: \u201cI will not significantly run up the national debt to pay for projects that won\u2019t make the economy grow.\u201d That\u2019s more honest and more sound, and it would leave her free to make necessary policy decisions in the White House. But it\u2019s not as neat a slogan, and that makes it a much harder sell.Bryce Covert is the economic policy editor at ThinkProgress and a contributor to The Nation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Constellation of Influencers: Behind the Curtain at Teneo", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byWhether participating in glittery dinners with heads of state, or t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates in the Oval Office, Andrew Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, has regularly visited the White House.He served as co-chairman of President Obama\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Partnership. He stood beside the president onstage at events.Many of these Washington appearances by Mr. Liveris \u2014 which have totaled more than two dozen since 2009 \u2014 were arranged with the help of Teneo, an advisory firm with close ties to the Democratic establishment. Dow is Teneo\u2019s biggest and most lucrative account, paying millions of dollars a year in fees, according to a 2014 lawsuit filed against Dow and interviews with two Teneo employees.Teneo bills itself as the chief executive\u2019s best friend. Its pitch is that, with Teneo\u2019s help, C.E.O.s can become not just business leaders but \u201cthought leaders and global ambassadors,\u201d according to its website.To achieve that, Teneo hires influential political and corporate figures to advise clients. Last month it added its latest superstar, William J. Bratton, the former top police official in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, who will head a new security unit.Other prominent employees have included former President Bill Clinton and Huma Abedin, who, starting in 2012, briefly worked at Teneo while employed at the State Department under Secretary Hillary Clinton. At the same time, Ms. Abedin held a paid position at the Clinton Foundation, the family-founded charitable organization. Last year, Teneo declined to answer questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Ms. Abedin\u2019s employment.Mrs. Clinton is now, of course, the Democratic candidate for president. And in an election year defined by voters\u2019 anti-insider sentiment, Teneo \u2014 a firm whose business plan is premised on putting its clients, not the firm itself, in the limelight \u2014 has found itself in the public eye for its relationship with the Clintons.Interviews with more than a dozen current and former Teneo employees \u2014 most of whom asked not to be identified because of confidentiality agreements or concerns about endangering their relationships with Teneo \u2014 shed light on the inner workings of power and politics in the nation\u2019s capital and beyond.One of Teneo\u2019s three founders, Declan Kelly, was a fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton and also served as an envoy to Northern Ireland during her tenure as secretary of state. A second founder, Douglas J. Band, was a close adviser to Mr. Clinton during and after his presidency.More recently, in mid-October, emails released by WikiLeaks involving Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, included several written in late 2011 by Chelsea Clinton to Mr. Podesta, in which she accuses Teneo employees of \u201chustling\u201d for business at the annual Clinton Global Initiative, the annual symposium that brings together politicians, business chiefs and heads of nonprofit organizations to discuss and debate global issues. Chelsea Clinton also accused Teneo employees of using her father\u2019s name to set up meetings with London lawmakers for Teneo clients.At that time, Chelsea Clinton and Mr. Podesta were involved in an effort to formalize the relationships between Mr. Clinton\u2019s personal office, the Clinton Foundation and other initiatives to, among other things, avoid any perceptions of conflict of interest.In the email chain, Mr. Band responds to Mr. Podesta denying any connection between Teneo and the Clintons. In one note, he writes that Chelsea Clinton is \u201cacting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues.\u201dTeneo, through a spokesman, called Chelsea Clinton\u2019s accusations in the emails \u201ccompletely false.\u201d A spokeswoman for Chelsea Clinton did not respond to an email seeking comment. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, which Mr. Podesta is running, said it would not authenticate any of the hacked Podesta emails.Hacked emails reflect only one challenge facing the fast-growing firm. Within Teneo, some have expressed concern that if Mrs. Clinton is elected in November, the firm may find it harder to arrange White House meetings for its clients, perhaps because of sensitivities about perceived conflicts of interest.In an effort to become more of a one-stop shop well beyond Washington power circles, Teneo has been rapidly expanding to include investment banking services, executive recruiting and now risk assessment and response (tapping Mr. Bratton\u2019s expertise). \u201cI\u2019m part of that growth plan,\u201d Mr. Bratton said in an interview.In fact, the growth has been so fast that last year employees made a tongue-in-cheek video in which they tried, and sometimes failed, to name all 12 of Teneo\u2019s divisions.\u201cWe and the company are under no pressure to do anything with regard to the company\u2019s future, and any suggestion to the contrary is completely false and baseless,\u201d BC Partners, the private equity owners, said in a statement.In an emailed response to questions, Teneo said it did not sell access to its corporate clients and that \u201cany suggestion otherwise is false and misleading.\u201d The statement said, \u201cThe firm is fortunate to represent many of the largest and best known companies in the world,\u201d and emphasized that \u201cTeneo operates at all times to the highest ethical and professional standards.\u201dRebecca Bentley, a spokeswoman for Teneo\u2019s major client, Dow, said that the firm\u2019s fees had never totaled more than $1 million a month and that Teneo provided a range of advisory services around the world, including investor relations and digital and crisis communications. As for Mr. Liveris\u2019s visits to the White House, she said that not all of them had been arranged by Teneo.A White House official said in a statement \u201cthe Office of Public Engagement routinely meets with hundreds of private sector stakeholders\u201d on a monthly basis.But former employees said what made Teneo special was that it offered a constellation of influencers, such as Mr. Bratton and others, to counsel its clients, make connections with their contact lists or simply help amplify a C.E.O.\u2019s stature by attending a dinner or event.Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican strategist who ran Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 re-election campaign and who was a consultant with Teneo until this year, said, \u201cThe ability to bring business and political leaders together to meet the C.E.O.s was all part of the selling point.\u201dThe office of Mr. Band, a Teneo co-founder and longtime aide to Mr. Clinton, offers a reminder of the firm\u2019s roots. One photograph pictures Mr. Band, Mr. Clinton and President Obama playing golf. Another shows Mr. Band and Mr. Clinton in 2009 after they negotiated the release of journalists from North Korea.Teneo was formed in June 2011, when Mr. Kelly, the former fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton, joined with Mr. Band and Paul Keary, who worked with Mr. Kelly at another communications firm. Mr. Keary and Mr. Kelly are members of a rock band at Teneo, Insane Asylum, which performs Rolling Stones covers, former employees say.Early on, Mr. Clinton was named to Teneo\u2019s advisory board. A search of LinkedIn profiles shows that a number of former aides to the Clintons or employees of the Clinton Foundation have worked there or acted as consultants, including Justin Cooper, an assistant to President Clinton who helped set up the family\u2019s private email server.One employee who has faced particular scrutiny is Ms. Abedin, who worked as a consultant at Teneo in late 2012 while simultaneously working as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aide in the State Department. Late last year, a letter sent to Teneo by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked for details of Ms. Abedin\u2019s agreement and whether the arrangement had resulted in undue influence on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s diplomatic work.Teneo declined to provide the information and said it had provided the necessary details, including Ms. Abedin\u2019s contract, to the State Department Office of the Inspector General, which was conducting its own inquiry into Ms. Abedin\u2019s work status. \u201cOut of respect for the independence and integrity of that review, I respectfully refer your office to them for any other questions you might have,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote last October.The State Department Office of the Inspector General declined to comment on the inquiry.About the same time, Teneo changed its retention policy. In a June 2015 email to staff members that was reviewed by The New York Times, Teneo said that nearly all emails older than one year would be \u201cautomatically removed\u201d from its system. The firm cited cybersecurity concerns.When asked about the new email retention policy, Teneo said in a statement that it was \u201cwell aware of its obligations under the law in terms of retention and preservation of electronic communications and any insinuation that it has not met these obligations is totally false.\u201dWhile several former employees said Teneo\u2019s connections to the Clinton family had given the firm its jump start, others noted that there were prominent employees who had nothing to do with the Clintons. Besides Mr. Rollins, Teneo also has within its ranks a former Democratic senator from Maine, George J. Mitchell, and Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission appointed by President George W. Bush.Mr. Mitchell, a partner at the law firm DLA Piper, spoke about his work in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a major part of my time,\u201d he said, adding that he had spoken at Teneo\u2019s annual event and at functions in London and Toronto. He said he had also reviewed the practices of two multinational corporations, advising their chief executives and boards on how \u201cto improve their risk assessment procedures and legal compliance.\u201dBeyond the ties to the Clintons, longstanding relationships with crucial clients \u2014 Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola (a vintage Coke machine stands in Teneo\u2019s lobby) \u2014 also provided a big push. Teneo\u2019s growth over the last five years has been remarkable, and it now has 550 employees in 14 offices around the world.Teneo has acted as counsel to many of the world\u2019s superstar chief executives, including Virginia M. Rometty of IBM, Ursula Burns of Xerox, Sergio Ermotti and Robert McCann of UBS, and Klaus Kleinfeld of Alcoa.Teneo also helped shape McDonald\u2019s campaign against raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and it assisted Boston in the city\u2019s unsuccessful bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.Teneo frames its offerings to C.E.O.s like this, according to several former employees: You can\u2019t trust your board of directors, who could fire you. You can\u2019t trust your lieutenants, who want your job. Which is why you need Teneo.Some pitches also included what three former Teneo employees called the fear factor approach. A team of Teneo internal data analysts would provide a prospective client with a list of companies at risk of attack from activist investors, highlighting the risks to that person\u2019s company.Once an executive is signed as a client \u2014 and depending on his or her needs \u2014 Teneo will occasionally organize what it describes as a salon event for the client\u2019s benefit. Typically casual get-togethers, these dinners have been held in a private room at the \u201c21\u201d Club or the restaurant Marea in New York, or at private residences.For instance, Heather Bresch, the chief executive of the pharmaceutical company Mylan, was given two salons by Teneo in 2011 \u2014 one in a New York City apartment and a second at a private home in Washington that attracted a mix of media, finance and political elite. Then, in 2012, a Teneo employee and Ms. Bresch met with President Obama\u2019s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett at the White House, according to White House records.This year Ms. Bresch was thrust into the spotlight after Mylan increased the price of its EpiPen, a lifesaving allergy treatment, sixfold. A Mylan spokeswoman, Nina Devlin, confirmed that the company had been a client of Teneo, saying the relationship ended in 2012. She declined to address specific questions about the dinners.In Washington, Teneo salons \u2014 often home-cooked dinners that occasionally include homemade ice cream \u2014 are sometimes held in the home of Margaret Carlson, a columnist for Bloomberg View. Guests have included United States Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, according to several former Teneo employees.Social interactions have long been a lubricant of both politics and business. However, some former Teneo employees said they felt it was not made clear to participants that the salons were being held on behalf of Teneo or its corporate clients.\u201cI don\u2019t think they made it to be a sponsorship of Teneo,\u201d said Mr. Rollins, the former Teneo senior adviser. \u201cMargaret would do the invite.\u201dIn a statement, Teneo said Mr. Rollins had been terminated for \u201cegregiously breaching\u201d his employment contract, adding that his comments on salon dinners or anything else relating to Teneo were \u201ccategorically false, uninformed and made with malicious personal intent.\u201dMr. Rollins denied that he had been fired. He said Mr. Kelly was upset when he learned that Mr. Rollins had taken a job at a different communications firm this year. (Mr. Rollins is also the chairman of a super PAC for the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump.)\u201cHe came in, got furious,\u201d Mr. Rollins said. \u201cFrom his perspective, I was his token Republican. He saw it as a defection,\u201d Mr. Rollins said, adding, \u201cIt was not a comfortable place to be for a Republican.\u201dStill, spokesmen for Senator Gillibrand and Senator Manchin said the lawmakers had been unaware that any dinners they attended at the home of Ms. Carlson were connected to Teneo. Jonathan Kott, the spokesman for Mr. Manchin, said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what Teneo is.\u201dIn a statement, Teneo said the salon dinners were an \u201cextremely small part\u201d of its operations and that they were \u201cinformation thought leadership events\u201d that were typically attended by heads of leading think tanks and nonprofit organizations, public officials and members of the media, including journalists from The New York Times. An individual inside the firm also said that all appropriate disclosures to participants were made.Strict laws govern the activities of registered lobbyists in the American political system. Teneo has no registered lobbyists in its ranks and, in its statement, denied that any lobbying occurred at the salons.Ms. Carlson declined to comment for this article or to respond to questions about whether she was paid by Teneo or reimbursed for the costs associated with the salons. Teneo declined to comment on whether there was payment or remuneration for the parties.Still, individuals inside Teneo said the salons were valuable to the participants. Often they involve eight to 12 people, said Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, who became a senior adviser to Teneo in December after retiring as the Army\u2019s chief of staff last year. \u201cThey\u2019re always very casual, close, interesting conversations that you\u2019re able to have,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Bridgeport, Property Values Plummet, but Taxes Soar for Some", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byThe Botelers are among many homeowners here who felt blindsided by one of the highest one-year property tax rate increases any community in the nation has imposed in recent years \u2014 29 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d said Ms. Boteler, a 59-year-old writer, who has not put her home on the market but has shown it informally. \u201cPeople have come and fallen in love with the house. But then they look at the tax bill and can\u2019t do it.\u201dThe enormous tax rate increase is symptomatic of Bridgeport\u2019s unenviable status as a poor city in a rich state. It also reflects a broader and sobering national picture: The economic revival across much of the country has bypassed many communities, including once-thriving industrial hubs like this one that are grappling with dwindling resources.In a citywide reassessment last year, the value of Bridgeport\u2019s taxable property fell by a staggering $1 billion, to $6 billion.\u201cThe story of Bridgeport, unfortunately, as with so many old towns, is that they lose their tax base,\u201d said Richard D. Pomp, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law and an expert on state and local taxation.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the poorest cities in the country,\u201d he added. \u201cYou are now taking the same amount of spending and spreading it out over a smaller base and your tax rate has to increase.\u201dThe jump in the tax rate, and a frustration with Bridgeport\u2019s chronically chaotic governing, prompted Peter Spain to apply for a Guinness World Record: \u201chighest one-year increase in property tax rate in the world.\u201d\u201cThe Guinness World Book is a zany thing that you scare your babysitter with, by flipping to the page with the longest mustache,\u201d said Mr. Spain, 46, who owns a graphic design firm with his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s kooky and outrageous, and I feel like that sums up the situation here.\u201dA fitting description, perhaps, for a city where P. T. Barnum once lived and was mayor, and where he brought his circus to rest during the winter.The re-election of Bridgeport\u2019s mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, reflects some of that chaos. The city\u2019s voters catapulted him back into office in 2015, 12 years after he was convicted of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks and bribes from people who wanted to do business with the city. Between his last term and his current one, Mr. Ganim served nearly seven years in federal prison.Mr. Ganim\u2019s triumph last year was quickly tempered by the city\u2019s financial reality. Within weeks of taking office, he learned that the previous administration had left the city with a $20 million budget deficit.And just as things started settling down after Mr. Ganim returned to City Hall, news emerged that the city\u2019s property values had plummeted. State law requires municipalities to reassess the value of taxable property every five years. Bridgeport had managed to avoid a reassessment, staving off a post-recession reckoning after the financial crisis of 2008, which depressed property values across much of the region.\u201cThe longer you delay a reassessment, the worse the sticker shock,\u201d said Joan Youngman, a senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a research center in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cIt\u2019s politically and economically hard for everybody.\u201dMr. Ganim had been re-elected largely on campaign promises to hold the line on taxes. Faced with a big budget hole, the city raised the effective tax rate on properties by nearly 29 percent.\u201cWe had a double whammy \u2014 a $20 million deficit, plus the revaluation,\u201d said Av Harris, who is a policy adviser and spokesman for the mayor. \u201cThis was not an easy decision. It was not an easy budget to figure out. But we have to make the best decisions we can.\u201dStill, the lower property values have actually been good for many taxpayers \u2014 their tax bills decreased because the assessed value of many properties had dropped so precipitously. Indeed, more than half of the city\u2019s homeowners paid less in property taxes this year than last year, said Ken Flatto, who is Bridgeport\u2019s finance director.Mr. Ganim did not own a home in Bridgeport when he was re-elected; he rented a condominium on Cartright Street. After the reassessment was announced last winter, Mr. Ganim bought two condos, according to city records. Condo values took a particularly hard hit in the revaluation, and Mr. Ganim was able to buy both properties at prices well below what the sellers had paid when they bought the homes. The taxes due on one of the mayor\u2019s condos is 40 percent less than last year\u2019s tax bill.But others saw big tax increases, especially residents in Black Rock, an affluent neighborhood. The appraised value on Ms. Boteler\u2019s 1948 brick Georgian Colonial climbed to $690,000 from $650,000, an increase she successfully challenged last spring. The value is now $645,000, but her taxes still went up.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Ms. Boteler said. \u201cI\u2019d love to live here until I die, but that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m getting my home ready to sell,\u201d Ms. Calandrelli-Longo said, noting that her taxes had gone up 400 percent since she bought the house 20 years ago. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here. This last increase did it.\u201dBut, she added, \u201cWho\u2019s going to buy it once they see the taxes?\u201dThe Spains knew they would pay higher taxes in Bridgeport than in Fairfield, which is a well-off town with fewer residents and a bigger tax base. Its tax base is $10.8 billion for the current budget of $294 million; Bridgeport\u2019s is $6 billion for its budget of $552 million. But the Spains also knew the city\u2019s lower real estate prices meant they could afford a house that would have been out of reach in Fairfield, Mr. Spain said.The couple has lived in a half-dozen American cities, Mr. Spain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never lived in a place where you wake up and go, \u2018Oh my God, what the hell are they doing?\u2019 Even the street sweeper does circles around the neighborhood for two days in a row,\u201d he said.Mr. Walker has experience in government, having served as the comptroller general of the United States until 2008. He now divides his time between Northern Virginia and Bridgeport. His tax bill rose 22.5 percent this year, while the value of his house fell. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to grow the tax base faster than the budget,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cThis city is doing exactly the opposite.\u201dExasperated by what he had heard from neighbors, and wanting to do something that would garner attention, Mr. Spain landed upon an idea to officially declare Bridgeport guilty of municipal lunacy. He registered with the Guinness website, paid the $5 fee and applied on behalf of the taxpayers of Bridgeport for the world record.Guinness receives nearly 1,000 new applications every week, a spokeswoman said. It typically takes about three months to review requests before rendering a decision.Mr. Spain\u2019s application was denied. Guinness said it could not fairly compare local tax rates, given the variations in jurisdictions and tax formulas around the world.Mr. Spain said he was not too disappointed by the ruling. His Guinness bid was designed to bring attention to the city\u2019s plight.\u201cIt reminded me of the underlying criticism of Bridgeport,\u201d Mr. Spain said. \u201cIt\u2019s the phantom circus element that never really left town.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Oceanwide Dips Into American Insurance, Buying Genworth", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A Chinese conglomerate has agreed to buy the insurer Genworth Financial of Virginia for $2.7 billion, in the latest example of Asian firms buying American insurance companies.The conglomerate, China Oceanwide, which has interests in real estate and finance, said on Sunday that it had struck a deal to buy Genworth for $5.43 per share, offering a 4 percent premium to shareholders compared with Friday\u2019s closing. It also said that it would contribute an additional $1.1 billion to cover maturing debt and to invest in Genworth\u2019s life insurance business.Genworth, which provides mortgage and long-term-care insurance, would become a stand-alone subsidiary of Oceanwide.Genworth also announced on Sunday that it would have an after-tax charge of $260 million to $300 million in the third quarter after reviewing how much it would have to keep in reserve for long-term-care claims.Oceanwide has also invested in other sectors such as financial services and energy, with a controlling stake in Asia-Pacific Property & Casualty Insurance.If the Oceanwide-Genworth deal is approved by shareholders and regulators, the companies expect it to close by the middle of 2017.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Investor\u2019s Plan to Transplant Private Health Care in Africa", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 The eyes of the private equity investor lit up as he strode across the empty floor of a recently built hospital here. There was not much to see: a stretch of unfinished concrete, and steel bars pushed into a corner.Room for more patients \u2014 and a nice return on his investment.\u201cYou could squeeze another 50 beds in here, easy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will really improve profits.\u201dAbraaj is trying to do something that hasn\u2019t been tried before: build a global network of hospitals across cultures and in some of the poorest parts of the world \u2014 including India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and here in Kenya. Mr. Mann\u2019s new fund has just bought a fast-growing hospital in India and is now trying to export its business model to Africa.Even in rich countries with sophisticated medical markets, it can be tricky, given vastly different regulatory regimes and national quirks, for a hospital to go global. Few have done it. Abraaj, however, is betting that Indians, Nigerians and Pakistanis, who in many cases have annual incomes of no more than $1,000, will dip into their savings to pay for an angioplasty or some other necessary, but not necessarily cheap, procedure.The process is further complicated by cultural differences. The Abraaj-owned hospital chain in Hyderabad, India, for instance, is run by a doctor so revered locally that he approaches \u201cguru\u201d status. Some patients refer to him as a god.As a business model, that might not scale.Still, India, Kenya and other less-developed economies share crucial similarities. Government-run hospitals offer cheap or even free care, but they can be extremely overcrowded and grim. With personal incomes rising, Abraaj thinks an emerging middle class of teachers, small-business owners, call-center workers and others will be eager to pay private doctors for better care.But in a country where the main afflictions are malaria, meningitis and road accidents, the 150-bed hospital has become a destination for people willing to pay for decent medical attention. And then there is the rapid rise of unfamiliar ailments in poorer countries \u2014 diabetes, heart disease and obesity. They, too, are a byproduct of booming economies and rising wages, which enable unhealthier diets.\u201cNairobi is a sweet spot for us,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cThere is a big population that is growing. You have emerging middle incomes. And there is a massive need for health care.\u201dHe was in town to \u2014 he hopes \u2014 clinch a deal to buy Metropolitan for the $1 billion health care fund that Abraaj started this year. Mr. Mann is not the only one with this idea: Eight other private equity investors have visited recently, according to Metropolitan\u2019s chief executive.Abraaj\u2019s fund includes money from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the medical parts companies Philips Healthcare and Medtronic, as well as other big institutional investors. \u201cThere will be some heavy lifting ahead \u2014 $1 billion is a lot of money to deploy in these types of markets,\u201d said Maria Kozloski, who oversees private equity investments at the International Finance Corporation, the finance arm of the World Bank, which has also invested in the fund. \u201cThe opportunity is compelling, but it\u2019s going to take some time.\u201dThe fund\u2019s size also reflects investors\u2019 appetite for new ways to invest in emerging markets \u2014 an asset class that represents one-half of the global economy \u2014 after four years of so-so returns in publicly traded markets.Abraaj is not well known in the usual private equity circles of New York and London. But with $10 billion under management, among the most any private equity firm has invested in these markets, its name is well traveled in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. For years now, its founder, Arif Naqvi, has been pushing the notion that the best way for long-term investors to benefit from core emerging market themes \u2014 growing urbanization and consumption \u2014 is through long-term private equity investments that target specific business sectors, as opposed to volatile stock and bond market bets.The health care fund, which Mr. Naqvi conceived, is a prime example.Most emerging market investors tend to get their exposure via public stock and bond markets, for instance, by buying shares in Brazilian oil companies or Russian government bonds. But these investments tend to be extremely volatile, shooting up and down in tune with ever shifting risk perceptions in a given country.Abraaj, by contrast, tries to spot investment ideas less likely to be whipsawed by the headlines. In an interview, Mr. Naqvi cited a recent investment in a Turkish dairy company \u2014 made at a time when Turks were protesting against their president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\u201cTurks will drink milk irrespective of who governs them,\u201d Mr. Naqvi said.Selling beer to thirsty Ethiopians or dairy products to Turks is a fairly simple proposition. And it gets at the core thesis of investing in these markets, which is to take advantage of young and growing populations in rapidly developing economies.The trick, of course, is to pick the right companies \u2014 because there is no quick and easy way to dump a stake in a private company, as you can with a stock on a public exchange.It is this fundamental challenge \u2014 finding the right company, with the right management team \u2014 that has kept emerging-market private equity funds from growing like their larger peers in more developed markets. After all, it can be hard to get a true reading of your business partner in Jakarta, Indonesia, if you are sitting in New York, London or Hong Kong, as is the case with most private equity shops.Abraaj tries to solve that by being based in Dubai and maintaining 20 regional offices, in places like Cairo and Karachi, Pakistan. Its principals also hail from these markets. In addition to Mr. Naqvi, who is from Pakistan, the firm\u2019s senior partners are citizens of Egypt, Ghana, India, Mexico and Turkey.The 48-year-old Mr. Mann is typical in this respect. Born in the dicier precincts of Birmingham, England, to parents who had recently immigrated from Pakistan, Mr. Mann went to Cambridge, won a scholarship to the Wharton School and dropped his plan to become a doctor, switching to law and finance.Today he lives in Dubai and spends at least three weeks a month searching for hospitals and health clinics to buy in places like Ethiopia, Nigeria and Pakistan. He wears the tightfitting suits of a money-center banker, carries a fancy handbag and converses fluently in Urdu and Hindi.With his slick suit and practiced smile, Dr. Thenya seems more a deal maker than a doctor. Both he and Mr. Mann caused a bit of a stir, rushing up and down the hospital\u2019s spartan hallways and bursting into crowded patient rooms.Mr. Mann brimmed with questions about how to get doctors to see more patients and provide them with more profitable services. In a laboratory where blood samples from patients are analyzed, Mr. Mann asked how long each test took.Between 15 to 30 minutes, he is told.\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou want to get the tests back as quickly as possible.\u201dThen Mr. Mann poked his head into the room housing the hospital\u2019s single CT scan machine. The room was empty but for a bored-looking attendant hunched over a computer. These machines are a rarity in Kenya, and for hospitals looking to maximize profits, they are crucial pieces of equipment.Mr. Mann asked the doctor how many scans he performed in a day.About seven, came the reply.He shook his head. \u201cYou could be making a lot more money out of that machine,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cYou could be doing as many as 15 to 20 patients a day. A machine like this can really drive profitability.\u201dMr. Naqvi, in marketing Abraaj\u2019s health fund, has insisted that its emphasis will be to have a positive social impact first and make money second. He refers to this mix of capitalism and social good \u2014 a bit majestically \u2014 as \u201cpartnership capital.\u201d Nevertheless, both he and Mr. Mann know that any vision of a benevolent health conglomerate will not materialize unless they can find hospitals that are financially sound.Perhaps the greatest tension for Abraaj to resolve is pricing. Few patients in India or Africa have health insurance. In Kenya, 67 percent of health expenditures are paid out of pocket. And in India \u2014 the fund\u2019s central focus \u2014 that number is 60 percent.This makes for extremely price-sensitive patients.For example, the Hyderabad hospital chain that Abraaj recently bought, Care, has a business model that relies on patients paying $3,000 for a heart bypass operation, even though average income per capita in India is half that amount. (In the United States, similar treatment might cost $40,000, although insurance would help.)\u201cLook, this is not Mother Teresa stuff \u2014 we have a responsibility to our investors,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cBut in this case, I really think that you can do good and make money.\u201dWhen Mr. Naqvi hired Mr. Mann to head the new fund in 2014, their first challenge was to find a country, and a hospital, that would serve as the driving force for the project. Because of India\u2019s 200-million-person middle class and its wealth of doctors and surgeons trained to world standards, it was a logical place to start.Mr. Mann had long been aware of the niche that Care had carved out for itself, with its 16 hospitals serving a wide area in and around Hyderabad and other parts of central India. Mr. Mann knew, too, that to make the dream work across countries and continents, it would not be enough to swoop into Nigeria, buy the best hospital he could find and hope for the best.Training Nigerians and Kenyans how to use a CT scan or conduct a routine heart operation would be critical. If he could tap into the programs for professional advancement that Care had already built, he theorized, perhaps he could train his new doctors at a fraction of the cost it would take to send them to Europe or the United States.These doctors would then return to their home countries grasping not only the latest medical techniques but how to get people to pay for them \u2014 a sensitive dynamic that has been at the root of Care\u2019s success.Leading Care, spiritually as well as medically, is its popular chairman, Dr. B. Soma Raju, a 69-year-old cardiologist. He made his name developing an affordable coronary stent many years back when they cost too much to import to India.A quiet, stooped man, Dr. Soma Raju mumbles, making it hard for his fellow doctors and patients to hear him. But they hang on his every word, and he has been known to treat as many as 100 patients in a day.For a number of years now, the vast majority of those who come to see him have illnesses related to diabetes. Close to 70 million people in India \u2014 second only to China \u2014 have been found to have the disease as a growing number of Indians lead more sedentary lives and eat more processed foods.The result has been a sharp increase in what medical experts call truncal obesity, where fat is stored mainly around the waist. That can lead directly to heart problems, kidney disease and loss of sleep.One day this month, Dr. Soma Raju saw a patient who fit the pattern perfectly. The owner of a village rice mill, the 61-year-old man had traveled far to be seen by the doctor.Days without sleep had inflamed his eyes. In a ragged voice, he described what ailed him. And then there was his weight: 262 pounds, far too heavy for a man standing 5 feet 5 inches tall, the nation\u2019s average.\u201cHe has serious sleep apnea, blood sugar is increasing, and blood pressure is up,\u201d Dr. Soma Raju explained. He advised the patient to exercise more, but his condition was so grave that the doctor also felt that weight-reduction surgery was needed.In the large waiting room outside his examination chamber, every chair was filled. And as was the case with the owner of the rice mill, many patients had traveled more than 400 miles to see the doctor \u2014 not only from tiny rural villages but also metropolises like Mumbai.India is a country where a doctor\u2019s counsel is often viewed as sacred. One patient, a 77-year-old retired farmer who also had diabetes, said that he \u201cbelieved in Dr. Soma Raju like a god.\u201d Upon leaving the office, he bowed deeply before him.All of which is good for business at Care. The hospital\u2019s dialysis wards are filled to capacity, and many of the doctor\u2019s patients \u2014 like the rice mill owner, for example \u2014 are paying full price for the services they receive, reflecting the growing wealth of India\u2019s middle classes and the dearth of government spending on health care.Dr. Soma Raju is as fluent in the language of finance as that of medicine. And such jargon as Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \u2014 or, more simply, cash), profit margins and six sigma (a management style popularized by the former General Electric chief executive Jack Welch) rolls easily off his and his fellow doctors\u2019 tongues.When making his rounds in Hyderabad, Mr. Mann often asks that Care doctors take him to surrounding villages, where the hospital is opening small outposts. While Care is based largely in cities, about 70 percent of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people live in rural areas.Recently he traveled to Kandlakoya, a hamlet of about 2,000 people an hour\u2019s drive from the city, where cows jostle with cars for right of passage. The bare-bones doctor\u2019s office, a single room, was stuffed with a desk, a patient\u2019s chair and a hospital bed, and a crowd of elderly men patiently waited their turns.Presiding was a garrulous, 73-year-old doctor, who briefed Mr. Mann on the day\u2019s afflictions: water contamination, anemia and most of all, complications from diabetes.Are they paying for their visits, Mr. Mann asked?\u201cOh, yes, sir,\u201d replied the doctor, G. S. N. Raju, pointing to his scribbled notations in a battered ledger. \u201cThey come to me and tell me their problems.\u201dThen, to Mr. Mann\u2019s surprise, the doctor grabbed him in a tight embrace. A more buttoned-up deal maker might have stiffened, but Mr. Mann pulled the small man close.\u201cProfitable, impactful and outreaching,\u201d he proclaimed, a smile breaking out on his face. \u201cThis is the essence of partnership capital.\u201dIt was good P.R., too \u2014 an Abraaj public relations executive was quick to capture the moment on his camera. He also suggested that the ebullient doctor be flown to Dubai for the firm\u2019s next investor conference.While the Abraaj model seems to be working in India, it is not clear yet whether the strategy will immediately transfer to poorer countries in Africa where people may have more trouble paying for their visits.One way to start to understand why Care has so many willing customers is to visit the alternative \u2014 an Indian government-run hospital. This can require a steely stomach, particularly in urban areas, where the population is outracing already overburdened facilities.At one children\u2019s hospital in Hyderabad, large crowds of parents, having made the trek from distant villages, squatted recently in a concrete lot in the rain. This was essentially the waiting room. As families endured sometimes dayslong waits for their turns with a doctor, their children relieved themselves in the street.These types of conditions replicate themselves at government hospitals across India. Treatment is more or less free, but the facilities are Dickensian in comparison with the Care hospital \u2014 teeming emergency rooms, with hundreds of parents and children pushing for a single doctor\u2019s attention.The Indian government spends only about 1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, and it shows. All of this helps explain why people who can afford to do so pay for hospitals like Care.Similar scenes play out in Kenyan public hospitals. After his meetings at the private health facilities in Nairobi wrapped up, Mr. Mann dropped in at the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital.Named after a former first lady of Kenya and built with help from the Chinese government, it is in a rundown eastern suburb of Nairobi. The emergency ward of its pediatric wing was a swarm of crying infants and sickly children, packed closely together, noses dribbling and wounds open, with few doctors in sight. \u201cDid you see all those with contagious diseases squeezed into that room?\u201d Mr. Mann muttered.He said he tried to stop in at state-run facilities in the countries he visited to get a better sense of how public health care was administered \u2014 to size up the competition.Like all ambitious private equity figures, Mr. Mann finds the glory of a billion-dollar deal \u2014 and the potential for a financial reward at the end \u2014 an obvious motivation. But a large part of his job, he says, lies in making the moral case for providing high-quality health care to lower- and middle-income patients in these countries. \u201cHow often do you get an opportunity to do something like this \u2014 I mean, to really make a difference?\u201d he said.He is also feeling the pressure to make this grand project work. Bill Gates is watching, and so are the World Bank (via its financing arm) and, not least, Mr. Naqvi, the fund\u2019s philosophical father, to whom Mr. Mann writes detailed mission notes describing each step taken.\u201cOf course I am nervous,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cI think about this 24/7.\u201dTo some observers, the two ideas he most frequently deploys in explaining the goals of the Abraaj fund \u2014 cash flow and care \u2014 are more contradictory than symbiotic. Among those people was Karivki Ngure, a medical student doing his rotation at Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital.\u201cAll these things are good on paper,\u201d he said, after running into Mr. Mann and hearing what Abraaj was doing in Kenya. \u201cBut if you come to this facility here, you will realize that there is a real need at this level,\u201d he said, referring to the impoverished patients. \u201cSo what do you do about them?\u201dIt was a fair point, and Mr. Mann knew it. He knew, too, that in terms of what Abraaj was hoping to do, without the cash flow there would be no care to give.\u201cWe can\u2019t go to that part of the population because the business is just not sustainable,\u201d he responded.The delegation from Abraaj finished the day at the office of the hospital\u2019s head, Musa Mohammed, a child of refugees from the war-torn South Sudan. Mr. Mohammed asked Mr. Mann pointed questions about the prices his privately run Kenyan hospitals were charging patients.Mr. Mohammed, who was raised in the Nairobi neighborhood of Kibera, considered Africa\u2019s largest slum, argued forcefully that the government needed to step in more aggressively to cap health care prices. \u201cI know the private sector has to make a profit,\u201d he said, choosing his words carefully. \u201cBut how much profit? But I guess this is why it is called a free-market economy.\u201dMr. Mann did not agree that private hospitals in Kenya, not least the ones he was going to buy, were gouging their customers. But he held his tongue: Mr. Mohammed\u2019s moral authority was daunting. Mr. Mann would try to win him over instead. So he asked the hospital chief if he could come by for a visit the next time he was in Nairobi.An article last Sunday about efforts by the Abraaj Group to develop private health care systems in Africa rendered incorrectly the name of a medical device company that has invested in the group\u2019s $1 billion health care fund. It is Medtronic, not Medtronics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Law Tax Penalty? I\u2019ll Take It, Millions Say", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The architects of the Affordable Care Act thought they had a blunt instrument to force people \u2014 even young and healthy ones \u2014 to buy insurance through the law\u2019s online marketplaces: a tax penalty for those who remain uninsured.The full weight of the penalty will not be felt until April, when those who have avoided buying insurance will face penalties of around $700 a person or more. But even then that might not be enough: For the young and healthy who are badly needed to make the exchanges work, it is sometimes cheaper to pay the Internal Revenue Service than an insurance company charging large premiums, with huge deductibles.\u201cIn my experience, the penalty has not been large enough to motivate people to sign up for insurance,\u201d said Christine Speidel, a tax lawyer at Vermont Legal Aid.Some people do sign up, especially those with low incomes who receive the most generous subsidies, Ms. Speidel said. But others, she said, find that they cannot afford insurance, even with subsidies, so \u201cthey grudgingly take the penalty.\u201dThe I.R.S. says that 8.1 million returns included penalty payments for people who went without insurance in 2014, the first year in which most people were required to have coverage. A preliminary report on the latest tax-filing season, tabulating data through April, said that 5.6 million returns included penalties averaging $442 a return for people uninsured in 2015.With the health law\u2019s fourth open-enrollment season beginning Tuesday, consumers are anxiously weighing their options.William H. Weber, 51, a business consultant in Atlanta, said he paid $1,400 a month this year for a Humana health plan that covered him and his wife and two children. Premiums will increase 60 percent next year, Mr. Weber said, and he does not see alternative policies that would be less expensive. So he said he was seriously considering dropping insurance and paying the penalty.\u201cWe may roll the dice next year, go without insurance and hope we have no major medical emergencies,\u201d Mr. Weber said. \u201cThe penalty would be less than two months of premiums.\u201d (He said that he did not qualify for a subsidy because his income was too high, but that his son, a 20-year-old barista in New York City, had a great plan with a subsidy.)Iris I. Burnell, the manager of a Jackson Hewitt Tax Service office on Capitol Hill, said she met this week with a client in his late 50s who has several part-time jobs and wants to buy insurance on the exchanges. But, she said, \u201che\u2019s finding that the costs are prohibitive on a monthly basis, so he has resigned himself to the fact that he will have to suffer the penalty.\u201dWhen Congress was writing the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, lawmakers tried to balance carrots and sticks: subsidies to induce people to buy insurance and tax penalties \u201cto ensure compliance,\u201d in the words of the Senate Finance Committee.But the requirement for people to carry insurance is one of the most unpopular provisions of the health law, and the Obama administration has been cautious in enforcing it. The I.R.S. portrays the decision to go without insurance as a permissible option, not as a violation of federal law.Some consumers who buy insurance on the exchanges still feel vulnerable. Deductibles are so high, they say, that the insurance seems useless. So some think that whether they send hundreds of dollars to the I.R.S. or thousands to an insurance company, they are essentially paying something for nothing.Obama administration officials say that perception is wrong. Even people with high deductibles have protection against catastrophic costs, they say, and many insurance plans cover common health care services before consumers meet their deductibles. In addition, even when consumers pay most or all of a hospital bill, they often get the benefit of discounts negotiated by their insurers.The health law authorized certain exemptions from the coverage requirement, and the Obama administration has expanded that list through rules and policy directives. More than 12 million taxpayers claimed one or more coverage exemptions last year because, for instance, they were homeless, had received a shut-off notice from a utility company or were experiencing other hardships.\u201cThe penalty for violating the individual mandate has not been very effective,\u201d said Joseph J. Thorndike, the director of the tax history project at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher of tax information. \u201cIf it were effective, we would have higher enrollment, and the population buying policies in the insurance exchange would be healthier and younger.\u201dAmericans have decades of experience with tax deductions and other tax breaks aimed at encouraging various types of behavior, as well as \u201csin taxes\u201d intended to discourage other kinds of behavior, Mr. Thorndike said. But, he said: \u201cIt is highly unusual for the federal government to use tax penalties to encourage affirmative behavior. That\u2019s a hard sell.\u201dThe maximum penalty has been increasing gradually since 2014. Federal officials and insurance counselors who advise consumers have been speaking more explicitly about the penalties, so they could still prove effective.Many health policy experts say the penalties would be more effective if they were tougher. That argument alarms consumer advocates.\u201cIf you make the penalties tougher, you need to make financial assistance broader and deeper,\u201d said Michael Miller, the policy director of Community Catalyst, a consumer group seeking health care for all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Three Strong-Performing Funds Pick Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMany stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares.\u201cOur typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a \u201cresearch gap\u201d that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps.The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Ore. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland.As stock pickers, they\u2019re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers.\u201cFor a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,\u201d as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming.In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers.

Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers.

{"Headline": "SoFi, an Online Lender, Is Looking for a Relationship", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Alyson Casey recently received an invitation to a singles event in Manhattan from a start-up. But it didn\u2019t come from a dating service. It came from the company that had recently refinanced her student loan: SoFi.The idea of a financial firm playing matchmaker initially struck Ms. Casey, a 35-year-old software saleswoman, as rather unorthodox. But the invitation promised an even split of men and women, and free drinks at the rooftop bar of the James hotel.After a few glasses of wine \u2014 and a few phone numbers collected \u2014 the idea of a student lender helping her find a mate made a lot of sense to her.\u201cThese are people with a similar mind-set,\u201d said Ms. Casey, who used SoFi to refinance the student loan that paid for her M.B.A. at New York University. \u201cPeople who aren\u2019t risk-averse. People who understand a good investment.\u201dThis approach is helping elevate SoFi with potential customers and investors in a business \u2014 online lending \u2014 that has had no shortage of trouble over the past year.The investors who had been buying loans originated by Lending Club and rivals like Prosper, OnDeck and Funding Circle fled from nearly everyone in the market, including SoFi, forcing the lenders to curtail their business significantly at a time when they needed to grow to fulfill the expectations of venture capitalists.But as the turmoil has calmed down, SoFi is emerging as the new leader. In May a SoFi bond backed by the company\u2019s loans was awarded an Aaa rating by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, a first for SoFi. The company is now originating more student, personal and home loans than it was before the Lending Club crisis, unlike its competitors.So far this year, SoFi has lent out $5.5 billion, up from the $5.2 billion it originated all of last year, and the $1.3 billion it did in 2014. The company has now issued loans to 175,000 customers.\u201cThey are the No. 1 player in the space now,\u201d said Matt Burton, the co-founder of Orchard Platform, which provides a marketplace for online lenders.In a recent interview at SoFi\u2019s offices in San Francisco, the chief executive, Mike Cagney, said the company was preparing to expand to Europe and Asia, and to introduce products like life insurance in the coming months.Mr. Cagney has recently been traveling through Asia and Europe, raising around $500 million in new funding for SoFi. The new investors will increase SoFi\u2019s valuation from its last fund-raising round, when it was worth $4 billion, Mr. Cagney said, though he declined to say what valuation it was targeting.The previous rounds involved Daniel S. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund Third Point; Peter Thiel; and the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.Mr. Cagney declined to answer questions about any plans for an initial public offering \u2014 SoFi had been working toward one, but put it off when it raised money in 2015.The new money will help support Mr. Cagney\u2019s ambitions to expand SoFi from a specialized student loan provider to one offering wealth management, deposit accounts and other products.Matt Harris, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said that among the most intractable hurdles facing online lenders were the high cost of acquiring customers and the difficulty of building a relationship that outlasts the first loan.He said that SoFi had found a neat solution to these problems by providing additional services, like the singles events and career counseling.\u201cIt is a very different strategy than the more transactional lenders,\u201d said Mr. Harris, who is not an investor in SoFi, referring to competitors like Lending Club. \u201cIf you are playing a lifetime value game \u2014 a relationship game \u2014 you have a lot more leeway to subsidize more products and you are less subject to commodification and the vagaries of competition.\u201dFor example, Mr. Cagney said that half of the people who had taken out mortgages with SoFi began as student loan customers. He started the company with three co-founders in 2011 by refinancing the student loans of fellow Stanford business school graduates.Within 18 months, he expects that mortgages, which were introduced just this year, will be the company\u2019s biggest product line. They currently represent about 15 percent of SoFi\u2019s business, while student loan refinancing is still roughly 50 percent.Mr. Cagney, however, is likely to confront plenty of hurdles.Because SoFi and the other online lenders are not banks, they do not have a steady base of consumer deposits to fund their loans. As a result they must rely on big investors, who are often alarmed when there is any sign of trouble \u2014 as happened earlier this year.Since the spring, Mr. Cagney has frequently been on the road, getting bigger credit lines from banks and searching for a broader array of investors to buy the company\u2019s loans. He said SoFi now had a credit line of $4 billion from banks that it could use to originate loans even without investors, in contrast to the $1 billion it had when the first signs of trouble struck the online lending industry last winter.Mr. Cagney has also been spending time in Utah, weighing whether to seek a bank charter from the state, which would allow SoFi to begin collecting deposits. SoFi is opening a service center in Utah, and Mr. Cagney said he was looking into what becoming a bank would mean. He is still wary, because regulations may limit SoFi\u2019s ability to do things like hold singles and networking events.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \u201cis very particular about what banks can and cannot do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of things we do that don\u2019t fit into a bank holding company, that are critical to our brand and our mission. If we can\u2019t do those things, we lose a lot of what makes SoFi different.\u201dOn the regulatory front, some industry experts have said that SoFi could face problems because of its elitist approach, serving only customers with the most pristine credit. In the most recent pool of SoFi personal loans, the average annual income of the borrowers was $144,000 a year, and the average credit score was 733, according to the rating agency Kroll.Banking regulations bar lenders from any practices that have a discriminatory impact on minorities, even if the impact is a result of algorithms rather than human decision making. While not a bank at the moment, SoFi is audited by the F.D.I.C. and regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The pursuit of elite customers also leaves some investors concerned that SoFi will not have a base of potential consumers large enough to sustain a big business. These customers often pay off their loans quickly and are, by their very nature, relatively few in number.That is why Mr. Cagney is looking to Europe and Asia, and is building out more products to offer his customers.At the singles event in New York, the clientele appeared to appreciate SoFi\u2019s strategy.Ms. Casey, the software saleswoman, said that after refinancing her student loan she had refinanced her credit card debt with SoFi when the company began offering that service last year.A few tables over, Lisa Akey said she learned about SoFi from a classmate at school who loved it, and had since talked up the company to her friends.\u201cImmediately I felt it was a company I could trust,\u201d said Ms. Akey, 32, a brand manager at Unilever. \u201cI feel like banks are just banks. SoFi feels like it\u2019s more built around people.\u201dKim Hutchison, a 34-year-old lawyer, said she had refinanced her law school debt a month earlier and had been preapproved for a mortgage with SoFi just hours before the event.\u201cThey are making their customers into better risks and more committed customers,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of their business model. I wish I had thought of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank Singled Out in I.M.F. Stability Warning", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The International Monetary Fund did not bring up Deutsche Bank\u2019s name when it warned in its financial stability report that cash-poor banks in Europe with outdated business models posed a threat to the financial system.But at a news conference on Wednesday to discuss the study\u2019s findings, fund officials charged with gauging financial stability risks worldwide showed no such reluctance.\u201cThe focus of investors has shifted from the level of capital to the business model, and that is why banks are under pressure,\u201d said Peter Dattels, deputy director in the I.M.F.\u2019s capital markets division.In their report, the fund\u2019s economists argued that the problems with European banks were deeply structural: a toxic brew of low levels of capital, troubled loans and business models that no longer delivered profits in an era of low growth and negative interest rates.In particular, Mr. Dattels said, \u201cbanks are transitioning from outdated business models that rely on large scale balance sheets,\u201d saying that Deutsche Bank fell into this bucket.This year, the I.M.F. said in a report on the German financial sector that Deutsche Bank appeared to be the riskiest bank in terms of threats posed to global financial system \u2014 an insight that prompted a sharp fall in the bank\u2019s stock.On Wednesday, fund officials did not backtrack from this view.\u201cThat report highlighted that Deutsche Bank is of systemic importance,\u201d Mr. Dattels said. \u201cWe are confident that authorities are monitoring this.\u201dMr. Dattels emphasized that the fund\u2019s models showed that an economic recovery would not ease these problems \u2014 drastic overhauls of these banks were also needed.The tough message contrasts starkly with what Deutsche Bank officials have been telling investors and regulators in recent weeks.What drove the share price down had less to do with Deutsche\u2019s business model and everything to do with concerns about a huge fine that would stem from the bank\u2019s role in the sale of risky mortgages before the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank officials have said. The United States Justice Department has proposed that the bank pay $14 billion to settle the case.Such an argument is not falling upon sympathetic ears \u2014 in Washington or Berlin.On Tuesday, Sigmar Gabriel, the powerful German politician who leads the minority party in Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government, put into words what many critics of the bank have been wondering for some time now.\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to laugh or be angry that the bank that declared speculation to be its business model now declares itself a victim of speculators,\u201d Mr. Gabriel said to reporters.Catering to hedge funds is a major business for Deutsche Bank, and bank officials have blamed hedge funds that are betting against the stock for its plummeting share price.Responding to a question about the size of the proposed penalty, Matthew Jones, a member of the I.M.F.\u2019s financial stability team, said it was not the fine that was the problem but the question of underlying profitability, compensation and capital levels at institutions like Deutsche Bank.The goal of all regulators now is to \u201ccreate a culture of responsible finance,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethics Panel Investigating de Blasio\u2019s Nonprofit Is Said to Issue Broad Subpoena", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byA state ethics panel investigating Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s political nonprofit organization has served a sweeping subpoena on City Hall seeking communications among the mayor, his aides, the nonprofit, its donors and consulting firms that worked for it, people with knowledge of the matter said.The scope of the subpoena suggests a widening of the investigation by the State Joint Commission on Public Ethics, which enforces state lobbying laws and has been focused on whether the group, the Campaign for One New York, illegally lobbied the city in 2015.At the same time, several lawyers representing donors to the group who have been contacted by the panel said the inquiry also appeared to be focused on whether some donations from lobbyists or their clients who have business before the city actually constituted undisclosed gifts to the mayor. Any such undisclosed gifts would violate state lobbying laws.The subpoena was served on Sept. 14, just four days after a State Supreme Court judge in Albany rejected the group\u2019s effort to quash two earlier subpoenas from the panel. The judge ordered the nonprofit and several consulting companies that had done work for it and for Mr. de Blasio\u2019s mayoral campaign to provide almost all of the documents sought by the panel, also known as Jcope.In doing so, the judge rejected arguments from the group and the mayor that the panel\u2019s inquiry was politically motivated. The ruling limited the group\u2019s efforts to stop disclosure of communications with the consulting companies and their employees. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, had contended that such communications were privileged and should be kept confidential.It also seeks emails from the mayor and his staff to donors, lobbyists, consultants and reporters, as well as any telephone logs, calendars or schedules relating to the mayor and the nonprofit, the people said.A mayoral spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday that when the nonprofit was formed, in late 2013, the administration sought guidance from the city\u2019s Conflict of Interest Board on the \u201cappropriate management and solicitation of funds, consistent with applicable conflicts of interest laws,\u201d and that the mayor\u2019s office \u201cconsistently followed that guidance throughout\u201d the group\u2019s existence.Laurence D. Laufer, a lawyer for the Campaign for One New York, said in a statement, \u201cWe are sad, but not surprised, that Jcope\u2019s year-and-a-half-long political fishing expedition is continuing, nor are we shocked that they have invented yet another frivolous legal theory to justify its existence.\u201dWalter McClure, a spokesman for the commission, said that under law, he could not comment on anything that might relate to an investigative matter.The inquiry by the ethics panel, which has the authority to bring administrative actions and seek fines, is separate from more than a half-dozen federal and state criminal investigations that in recent months have examined various aspects of the mayor\u2019s political fund-raising. One of those, being conducted by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has also focused in some measure on the Campaign for One New York, according to people briefed on the matter.Critics have raised questions about the relationship between the nonprofit and Mr. de Blasio, who had an active role in fund-raising for the group.The questions include whether the group was simply working as an arm of his campaign and whether giving money to it may have been a way for those with business before the city \u2014 or those seeking such business \u2014 to curry favor with him without being subject to campaign-finance limits.The nature of that relationship seemed even murkier after the Albany judge\u2019s ruling, when Mr. de Blasio\u2019s response seemed to tacitly acknowledge that there was little separation between the nonprofit and him and his administration. When asked why the nonprofit had refused to comply with the subpoena, Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cWe disagree with judge\u2019s final judgment, and so we\u2019re exploring appellate options at this point.\u201dThe Campaign for One New York is what the Internal Revenue Service characterizes as a social welfare nonprofit, which means that it was supposed to work primarily to promote the common good and welfare of an entire community. Such nonprofits, which include groups like the Sierra Club and the National Right to Life Committee, are allowed to participate in politics \u2014 as long as politics does not become their primary focus.In its incorporation papers and documents filed with the I.R.S., the group said that its purpose was to \u201cadvocate for One New York and New York City by informing the public and policy makers about legislative and public policy options.\u201dAfter the United States Supreme Court loosened campaign-finance rules in its 2010 Citizens United ruling, many political consultants and politicians started using social welfare groups, which do not have to disclose donors, to hide the source of federal campaign donations.Having a nonprofit act as an arm of the mayor raises questions about transparency and about whether it is just intended to help him win re-election and be a place where people with business before the city can donate to gain favor.The idea of having a politician so closely tied to a social welfare nonprofit has prompted controversy in recent years. Allies of Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, formed such nonprofits to advance each administration\u2019s goals. Both were shut down after criticism from lawmakers and campaign finance watchdogs.An article on Wednesday about the investigation of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s political nonprofit, the Campaign for One New York, misstated the organization\u2019s history of disclosing its donors. The group said shortly after its formation in late 2013 that it would release the names of its donors and it began doing so about six months later; it did not release the names of donors in response to criticism.Kim Barker and J. David Goodman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Through the discovery process, the plaintiffs have been trying to learn why the Obama administration abruptly changed the terms of the companies\u2019 rescue four years ago.Lawyers for the government have responded to the suit with demands for unusual secrecy. The government has withheld 12,000 documents, including emails, memorandums and reports, asserting that they were protected by privilege of three types: privilege of the deliberative process, of bank examination and of presidential communications. Asserting presidential privilege in such a suit is highly unusual.Fairholme has contended that the government\u2019s assertions of privilege were excessive. Earlier this year, its lawyers asked Judge Sweeney to review some of the documents privately to determine whether the government\u2019s assertions were proper.In her 80-page ruling on Monday, she concluded that the government had not justified its use of the deliberative process or bank examination privileges on 52 of the 56 documents in the group and ordered their release.The other four documents were subject to the presidential communications privilege, the government maintained; this \u201caffords the president of the United States considerable autonomy and confidentiality,\u201d the court said.But Judge Sweeney granted the plaintiffs access to these materials as well, concluding that Fairholme had an \u201coverwhelming\u201d need for the documents and that no other source of evidence available \u201cwould similarly inform their understanding\u201d of the events surrounding the profit sweep.Bruce R. Berkowitz, managing member at Fairholme Funds, praised the judge\u2019s ruling in a statement.\u201cFinding no clear reason in favor of extraordinary secrecy,\u201d he said, \u201cJudge Sweeney astutely recognized that the government\u2019s attempt to hide thousands of documents is unjustifiable, for the work of our government must withstand public scrutiny.\u201dNicole A. Navas, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the ruling or say whether the government would appeal it. In the past, the government has maintained that releasing the documents would roil the markets.Last year, The New York Times intervened in the case, filing a brief arguing that the court should release certain documents. \u201cAccess to the evidence will enable the public to understand more fully the decisions the government has made in the public\u2019s name and to assess the wisdom and effect of those decisions,\u201d The Times argued. The court later unsealed excerpts from those documents.Many of the materials withheld by the government contain financial projections that reflect the government\u2019s view of Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s prospects before it decided to seize their profits.One document dated Jan. 10, 2012, contains \u201cestimates for the president\u2019s budget,\u201d the court said, and \u201creflects draft analyses and projections regarding estimates of future draws and dividend payments to be made\u201d by Fannie and Freddie.A document withheld by the government under the presidential communications privilege appears to be a memo prepared for President Obama less than two months before the companies\u2019 profits were diverted.Mr. Sperling now heads Sperling Economic Strategies, a consulting firm, and is a high-ranking economic adviser to Hillary Clinton. He declined to comment, referring the request to the Justice Department.In addition to ordering the release of all these documents, Judge Sweeney also gave the Justice Department\u2019s lawyers until Oct. 14 to explain why the government should not pay Fairholme\u2019s expenses, including lawyers\u2019 fees, related to its request that the judge review the materials.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Jewish Exodus to a New Nation", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byIF such events can be said to have an upside, the Inquisition had one for Spanish and Portuguese Jews: It propelled them to the Americas, where they largely found the tolerance and opportunities denied them in Europe.In the United States, they, like their fellow Americans, were tossed about in history\u2019s currents, finding themselves on both sides during the American Revolution, the movement to abolish slavery and the Civil War. And their welcome was sometimes short-lived or illusory.The exhibition\u2019s most arresting artifact is a threadbare 4-inch-by-3-inch, 180-page memoir and prayer book handwritten by Luis de Carvajal the Younger in colonial Mexico in 1595, where the Inquisition had extended its sinister reach of torture and execution.De Carvajal was a converso, forced to adopt Catholicism but suspected of clandestinely practicing Jewish rituals. At trial, he was pressured to denounce 120 Jews who secretly followed their faith, including his relatives. Then he was burned at the stake.\u201cThey broke him down,\u201d said Debra Schmidt Bach, a curator of the show.The de Carvajal book mysteriously disappeared from Mexico\u2019s national archives in the 1930s. Not long ago, however, Leonard L. Milberg, an American businessman with a major Judaica collection, learned that the document was for sale at Swann Auction Galleries in Manhattan, and he arranged to have it returned to Mexico. It is on loan for the show.The exhibition features documents chronicling the vagaries of early Jewish settlements: an edict expelling Jews from France\u2019s American colonies; a rabbinical paper certifying as kosher food shipped to Barbados; an 18th-century service for the biblically mandated circumcision of slaves and a list of circumcisers in Cura\u00e7ao and Suriname; and a Christian missionary\u2019s treatise speculating that Native Americans were the Lost Tribes of Israel. There are two nostalgic paintings of Caribbean scenes by Camille Pissarro, the French Impressionist who was born on St. Thomas to a Jewish mother. Seventy-two of the 170 items in the show are from Mr. Milberg\u2019s collection.Though the Dutch colony in New Amsterdam, now New York, became a significant haven, its embrace of Jews was stinting. The outpost\u2019s flinty governor, Peter Stuyvesant, recoiled when 23 refugees from Portuguese-ruled Brazil arrived in 1654. But the Dutch West Indies Company told Stuyvesant that business was business and Jews should remain as long as they could contribute to the outpost\u2019s commercial well-being.Those Jews established the first North American congregation, Shearith Israel \u2014 Remnant of Israel \u2014 and built a synagogue in 1730 on what is now South William Street in Lower Manhattan. The congregation endures on Central Park West, where it moved in 1897.Abigaill Levy Franks, a prominent woman of old New York, is saluted with a portrait. Her letters, the exhibition text informs visitors, confided her upset at her daughter\u2019s marriage to a Christian, Oliver Delancey. Interestingly, he was a scion of the family for whom Delancey Street was named; the street later became the spine of the Lower East Side\u2019s Jewish quarter.Like other colonists, Jews were conflicted about ending British rule. Haym Salomon, a Polish immigrant, helped finance the Revolution. But Abraham Gomez and 15 other Jews were among 932 signers of allegiance to King George III.Other documents chronicle the tug of war over slavery. Account books record the purchase of five slaves by Matthias Lopez in 1787, while Jacob Levy Jr. is mentioned in an abolitionist society\u2019s papers as having freed four slaves in 1817.Alexander Hamilton, the lionized founding father of today\u2019s Broadway, makes an appearance too. The show tells us that his mother had been married to a Jew and that he was fluent in Hebrew and maintained close professional ties with Jews.Several documents establish that it was at Congregation Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim in Charleston where the American version of Reform Judaism took root in 1824 through young mavericks who \u201cwanted to modernize Judaism so it wouldn\u2019t die,\u201d said Dale Rosengarten, director of the Center for Southern Jewish Culture at the College of Charleston. Ms. Rosengarten was a curator of a similar exhibition at Princeton.\u201cIt didn\u2019t spring out of whole cloth but sprang out of our native soil,\u201d she said.Jews made important contributions to 19th-century science and culture, along with other fields, but as the exhibition says, \u201cdespite the nation\u2019s ostensible commitment to religious tolerance, stereotypes of Jews persisted on the American stage.\u201d One gallery has a portrait and the sword and scabbard of Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy, a naval hero of the War of 1812, and paintings by Solomon Nunes Carvalho, who accompanied John C. Fr\u00e9mont, the explorer, on a cross-country expedition.Inevitably, said Louise Mirrer, the New-York Historical Society\u2019s president, the story of the New World\u2019s Jews has resonance for immigrants, refugees and religious minorities today. \u201cSeeds had been planted early on for a place where you could practice your religion,\u201d Ms. Mirrer said, because the New World had drawn Europeans like the Puritans seeking religious freedom.But at times, she added, there were anomalies: \u201cIn the exhibit, we see the kind of religious fervor that promotes a kind of violence against certain groups.\u201d\u201cThe First Jewish Americans\u201d runs through Feb. 26 at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street; 212-873-3400, nyhistory.org.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Leftist Era Fading in Latin America? Ask Colombia and Brazil", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 It was not a banner day for Latin America\u2019s leftists.\u201cPut simply, conservatives are on the rise in Latin America,\u201d said Mat\u00edas Spektor, a professor of international relations at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas, a university in Brazil.Many factors are feeding the trend. The sharp drop in commodities prices has eroded economic growth around Latin America and the support leftist governments once drew from it. The clout of evangelical Christian megachurches is expanding, and they are confronting socially liberal policies and channeling widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo.Still, political analysts caution that the trend does not necessarily involve a wholesale rejection of the policies that won admiration and votes for leftist governments in previous years. For instance, Michel Temer and Mauricio Macri, the leaders of Brazil and Argentina, have expressed support for maintaining popular antipoverty programs.Peru\u2019s new president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, relied on an alliance with the left to defeat his rival, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, the imprisoned former president.Likewise, Colombia\u2019s vote on the peace deal offered an example of how unpredictable politics is getting in some parts of Latin America. Leaders around the region \u2014 from an array of ideological backgrounds \u2014 had supported the agreement, which was forged between President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC.Colombians rebuffed the deal largely because they thought it was too lenient on the FARC, enabling most fighters to walk away scot-free. But the result also showed how ready voters were to reject what the political establishment was offering.\u201cVoters defying the status quo is hardly peculiar to Colombia,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. \u201cIt fits a pattern that can be discerned in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and other countries.\u201dIn Brazil, a country of 206 million, half of South America\u2019s population, the shift to the right has unfolded against a backdrop of rising political divisiveness.Supporters of the impeached president, Dilma Rousseff, argue that her ouster was the equivalent of a coup, a view that has weighed on the legitimacy of Mr. Temer, her former vice president who rebelled against her. Candidates from his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party were also roundly defeated in Sunday\u2019s mayoral elections in Brazil\u2019s largest cities.But the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which had its origins in the opposition to the country\u2019s military dictatorship before evolving into a more conservative grouping that now anchors Mr. Temer\u2019s coalition, scored big gains. One of the party\u2019s members, Jo\u00e3o Doria, a former host of a reality television show that involved firing participants on the air, glided to victory in the mayoral race in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest city.Some in the region see parallels with the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote in which Britain elected to leave the European Union, or the chance that Donald J. Trump, who also starred in a reality game show in which he fired contestants, will win the presidential election in the United States.Colombia, for its part, has long defied easy explanations of its politics. A top ally of Washington in Latin America, the country has traditionally been more politically conservative than some of its neighbors, even as nominally leftist guerrillas persisted for decades in its jungles.The rightward shift has stalled in some parts of the region. While the opposition won control of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly earlier this year, the country\u2019s leftist president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has managed to delay a referendum to remove him from office despite the collapsing economy.\u201cWe are facing a historical turning point in the region; some are talking about a throwback,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Linera said, comparing the current situation to previous periods of conservative resurgence in Latin America. \u201cWe must relearn what we learned in the \u201980s and \u201990s, when everything was against us.\u201dAs leaders on the left pick up the pieces in parts of Latin America, their dilemma now resembles that of the conservative politicians they long struggled to dislodge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Sea Fields Flag, Denting Prospects for Scottish Independence", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported bySpecial SectionsThe Transocean Winner, a rig filled with more than 300 tons of diesel and weighing 18,740 tons, broke away in an August storm to drift onto the rocks on the Isle of Lewis, in far western Scotland.The huge semisubmersible oil rig detached in rough seas from a tug trying to bring it to Malta, and amid worries about pollution, it looked massive and forlorn as salvage crews tried to free it, and refloat it.But the Transocean Winner, both in its plight and in its journey away from the North Sea, is a symbol of Scotland\u2019s growing problem. At the same time as North Sea production slips and oil and gas become harder and more expensive to extract, the price of energy has fallen sharply.Cheap oil prices are making it uneconomical to produce oil and gas from the North Sea, so investment is postponed or canceled and rigs are shutting down or being transported elsewhere. And the drop in production from the mature field has meant a steep drop in tax revenues for Scotland, which in turn has put a big question mark over the prospects of Scottish independence from the United Kingdom.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of Scotland, the leader of the ruling Scottish National Party, is committed to independence, and after Britain voted in June to leave the European Union, while Scotland voted heavily to remain, she said a second independence referendum was \u201chighly likely.\u201dBut in fact it seems far away. Ms. Sturgeon cannot afford to lose a second referendum, and although Scots feel adrift from a Conservative-ruled Britain, the economic situation has deteriorated badly. And that is largely because of the collapse in the price of oil, which has not only reduced revenues, but made new exploration simply too costly.The September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence was a raucous and emotional affair, but one of the central questions was whether an independent Scotland would thrive economically or become poorer than now. And the key element to that debate was competing analyses of the future of North Sea oil \u2014 how much revenue it would yield and how far into the future, given that the North Sea is a mature field and production was slowing.Scots voted against independence by 55 percent to 45 percent, driven largely by doubts on the country\u2019s economic future, not just on oil revenues, but on what kind of currency Scotland would have and whether it could join the European Union smoothly or from a standing start.The turnout was 84.6 percent, the highest ever for an election or referendum in the United Kingdom, underlining how important the vote felt to Scots. The turnout for last June\u2019s British referendum on membership in the European Union, by contrast, was 72 percent.In fact, production from North Sea oil and gas peaked in 1999 at 4.55 million barrels of oil equivalent a day; today, that number is 1.64 million, said Alexander Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen. And revenue has gone down sharply every year since 2011.The trade group Oil & Gas UK figures that the industry will lose 120,000 jobs by the end of this year. Passenger numbers at Aberdeen airport, a base for the North Sea oil industry, have dropped 20 percent over the last 18 months, and helicopter traffic from the airport to rigs has dropped a quarter in the last year. Aberdeen, once considered Britain\u2019s Klondike, is suffering.Analysts at S&P Global Platts said that investor anxiety would add to the \u201cexisting gloomy prognosis\u201d for the North Sea. \u201cUncertainty alone could lead to years of delay for new development projects and put more weight behind any planned closures.\u201dWith little new investment, they warned, \u201cfields may close down sooner, and the cost of running and maintaining pipelines and other infrastructure is spread over fewer remaining barrels.\u201dIn other words, extracting oil from the turbulent North Sea is becoming less and less cost-effective \u2014 fine when oil was at $100 a barrel, difficult at $60, disastrous at $44.Budgets for decommissioning oil rigs are estimated to triple over the next two years, because some 30 percent of North Sea rigs now operating are doing so at a loss, and wells are being capped on the seafloor.The 2014 independence referendum put a number of freighted questions to Scots: What kind of country would an independent Scotland be, with what relationship to Britain and to the European Union, and with what resources to finance a country that sees itself as a Nordic-style social democracy and spends far more than it takes in?Figures from the same official agency, issued in August, were far worse. For fiscal 2015-16, Scotland\u2019s public spending deficit was \u00a314.8 billion amid plummeting oil prices. That deficit, 9.5 percent of gross domestic product, was more than double the percentage debt of Britain as a whole and more than three times the level the European Union requires of new member states.Revised figures for the fiscal year 2014-15 showed Scotland\u2019s deficit at \u00a314.3 billion, or , 9.1 percent of G.D.P.The latest government report also estimated that Scotland\u2019s share of North Sea revenues fell about 97 percent in 2015-16 year to just \u00a360 million from \u00a31.8 billion in 2014-15.\u201cThat\u2019s a tiny figure,\u201d said Professor Kemp. With the drop in the price of oil, lower British taxes, accumulated tax credits from major investments since 2009 and now tax credits from decommissioning, he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have a very low tax take for several years at least, even if the oil price comes back.\u201dScotland\u2019s onshore revenues grew by \u00a31.9 billion, but overall, Scotland\u2019s revenue was estimated at \u00a310,000 a person, about \u00a3400 a person lower than for Britain as a whole. And its government expenditure, at \u00a312,800 a person, was \u00a31,200 greater than the British average.In response, Ms. Sturgeon recognized the challenge. \u201cThe lower oil price has, of course, reduced offshore revenues, with a corresponding impact on our fiscal position,\u201d she said. \u201cThis underlines the fact that Scotland\u2019s challenge is to continue to grow our onshore economy.\u201dShe insisted that the \u201cfoundations of the Scottish economy remain strong\u201d and tried to swing attention to the damage a British exit from the European Union and its single market would do to Scotland. \u201cScotland\u2019s long-term economic success is now being directly threatened by the likely impact of Brexit,\u201d she said.She is not wrong that Brexit, presuming that it actually happens in a couple of years, would do economic damage to Scotland if it remained a part of Britain.But whether Scots would vote for a poorer independence, with a hard border between itself and the rest of Britain, is far less clear. Scotland\u2019s economic ties \u2014 and dependency \u2014 on Britain were emphasized after the so-called Brexit vote by former prime minister Gordon Brown, a Scot who does not favor independence and did not favor Brexit.The British government\u2019s secretary for Scotland, David Mundell, said recent figures demonstrated \u201chow being part of the U.K. protects living standards in Scotland.\u201d Scotland has \u201cweathered a dramatic slump in oil prices last year because we are part of a United Kingdom that has at its heart a system for pooling and sharing resources.\u201dThe North Sea oil industry \u201cis in long-term decline,\u201d Professor Kemp said. While some oil will continue to be produced until at least 2050, \u201cit\u2019s a question of how gently or brutally this decline takes place. Reserves are still substantial \u2014 it\u2019s whether they can be produced economically.\u201dOil prices ebb and flow, of course, and Scotland is trying to invest in alternative sources like wind and tidal power. But the amazing windfall that the North Sea provided for the last 50 years is coming to an end. And investment forgone in an aging field is unlikely to be replaced.A recent study of the North Sea industry by PwC, the audit and consulting firm, concluded that the North Sea had a future, if carefully managed over the next two years, but that there was risk of \u201ca rapid and premature decline\u201d if government and industry did not \u201ccreate one last cycle of success that will retain and generate jobs, stimulate growth and ensure security of energy supply.\u201dScottish independence may depend on it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Newly Released Hillary Clinton Emails Offer Glimpse at Husband\u2019s Advice", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department on Friday began releasing thousands of emails the F.B.I. collected as part of its investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of state, but many were duplicates or near duplicates of messages already made public.The emails released on Friday suggested that materials from the investigation might not add significant new information to an issue that has dogged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign for a year and a half. They nonetheless revealed still more details about her tenure as secretary and the advice she received from those closest to her, including her husband, former President Bill Clinton.One email offered a rare glimpse into the strategizing between the two Clintons on matters of foreign policy. In a message dictated to an aide, Mr. Clinton offers his recommendations for negotiating with China, India and other poor countries in the days leading to the Copenhagen conference on climate change in December 2009.\u201cI recommend that you begin by saying that this challenge is an opportunity if we approach it the right and way,\u201d the note read, including an unnecessary word, \u201cand provide the right financing options so that the old energy economy no longer has an advantage over new ways of providing and consuming energy.\u201dThe State Department released only 75 new emails on Friday, including some that were merely brief replies to emails that had been previously turned over by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyers and made public under the Freedom of Information Act.Under a new court order, the department is scheduled to continue releasing batches of emails before the election on Nov. 8. That has raised hopes among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s critics that new disclosures could still damage her prospects. At a minimum, the staggered releases will keep a focus on her use of the server, which she has repeatedly acknowledged was a mistake.Mr. Comey has since faced intense criticism from Republicans over his handling of the investigation, including decisions to give immunity to some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides in exchange for testimony.\u201cFolks, this is a very sad time, I\u2019m telling you, for justice in this country,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, said at a recent rally, where he ridiculed the investigation.In reaction to the criticism, the F.B.I. took the unusual step of turning over to the State Department and Congress reams of materials related to its investigation, including 14,900 emails. More than 9,000 of those were deemed personal, however, and will not be made public. That leaves roughly 5,600 more, many of which will not become public until well after Election Day.It appeared that many of the emails the F.B.I. uncovered came from other accounts at the State Department or from fragments of the computer servers and phones Mrs. Clinton used.Five of the emails released on Friday included replies or forwards to emails that contained information later upgraded to classified. One included a note from Mrs. Clinton to her aide Huma Abedin in response to a long discussion on Honduras in 2009. \u201cAll of this did not print last night,\u201d she wrote. The original message, from Jake Sullivan, a senior policy adviser both then and now, was previously released by the State Department with sections blocked on the grounds they were classified confidential.Mrs. Clinton was usually the recipient of the emails, not the sender. But in one email she expressed to a confidante what she said was her deep personal pain over the death and destruction caused by a 2010 earthquake in Haiti.\u201cWe have much to do, my friend, and I\u2019m sending strength and blessings to you and the Haitian people,\u201d she wrote to Dr. Paul Farmer, co-founder of a group called Partners in Health, as he was preparing to go to Haiti to help with the relief effort, in which the Clinton Foundation played an important role.\u201cIf we\u2019re falling short in our efforts, pls yell. Love, Hillary,\u201d she wrote.In a separate email released last year by the State Department, Chelsea Clinton warned her parents that the relief efforts were indeed falling short.The message with advice from Mr. Clinton, who has said he rarely used email, was sent through intermediaries. \u201cI\u2019ve had a busy day and too little time to study all the articles enough to give much good advice,\u201d stated his note, dictated to an aide, Jason Cooper. \u201cCall me anytime to talk,\u201d he said, and forwarded two articles he wrote on climate change. It was signed simply \u201cBill.\u201dAnother email came from Mark J. Penn, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former pollster, analyzing President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in 2010 (\u201cpretty good speech \u2014 but he seemed angry\u201d) while praising one of hers by contrast.He offered a predication that proved false: \u201cOnly way for him to win second term is to ask you to be VP,\u201d Mr. Penn wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City Sells Landlords\u2019 Debts, but Buildings Fall Into Limbo, Critics Say", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byThe apartment building on St. Johns Place in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn is a mess. Repeated flooding has curdled the paint and caused mold to bloom on the walls. The temperature inside is freezing in the winter and sweltering in the summer. New York City\u2019s housing agency has sued the owner of the eight-unit apartment building nine times to try to force repairs. And the landlord owes $20,000 in fines and more than $235,000 in unpaid interest and water, sewer and other bills.In 1998, the city began selling off its overdue bills as part of a program started 20 years ago that allows the city to recoup at least some of what it is owed. The program works through a trust financed by the sale of bonds to private investors. The trust collects payments on the bills and can seize the property if the owners do not pay.But some properties like the one in Brooklyn that have gone through these sales have often fallen into a kind of limbo, where nobody is taking care of them or the tenants inside, according to a report expected to be released Friday by the city\u2019s public advocate, Letitia James.A growing number of housing advocates and city officials, including Ms. James and Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, are urging the city to rethink the practice. Each year, the city sells off debts on thousands of properties. From 2010 to 2015, more than 15,000 properties with roughly 43,600 residential units were affected by the sales. But critics of the program argue that the city is squandering a valuable chance to improve shabby housing and hold onto affordable units. Mr. Stringer wants the city to foreclose on the properties and use the land for affordable housing. And Ms. James has proposed that the city sell the debt through a preservation trust to nonprofits, which would use their leverage with building owners to get them to fix their properties.The stakes are higher than ever. More than half of city renters are considered rent-burdened, spending more than a third of their income on rent, according to the United States Census Bureau. As part of a broader push to address growing inequality, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, has made affordable housing a centerpiece of his administration, unveiling plans in 2014 to preserve 120,000 units over 10 years.\u201cWe have found that the lien sale program is an effective tool to collect delinquent municipal charges,\u201d Freddi Goldstein, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said, adding that the city will \u201ccontinue to look at how all available tools can be used to create affordable housing.\u201dTenant advocates say the sell-off of the unpaid bills sometimes does more harm than good. When the bills are sold off, the debt often grows, inflated by interest that is tacked on. For already struggling owners, the ballooning debt can be crushing, leading them to scrimp on crucial services like heat, hot water and repairs.In its report, the public advocate\u2019s office discovered dangerous conditions at 22 buildings that had cycled through the tax sales program many times. All the buildings had rent-stabilized apartments, one of the main ways for low-income New Yorkers to remain in the city.In total, the number of code violations at the buildings grew by 528 percent over the past six years.One building on Grand Concourse in the Bronx, for example, had racked up 265 violations from the Department of Buildings and the Housing Preservation and Development agency, the two city agencies responsible for protecting tenant and building safety.For tenants, those violations are more than just a number. A tenant in a building on Kingston Avenue in Brooklyn, for example, said her apartment had sewage backups, leaks that led her walls and ceiling to crumble, broken floors, mold, rats and roaches. Recently, she told investigators, she learned her son had lead poisoning.At a building less than a mile away, tenants complained of deep puddles of sewage on the floors and mosquito larvae in the ceiling.For Carmen Vega-Rivera, who is disabled, the worst days at her apartment on Grand Concourse Avenue are when the elevator gets stuck (like it did for an hour last week) or does not work at all (like last month). \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d she said of her building, which has 238 violations for housing conditions.\u201cWithout a doubt, the city is missing an opportunity to preserve affordable housing and protect tenants,\u201d Ms. James said in an interview on Wednesday. She said one building, churned through the tax sales, particularly rankled her because, as a city councilwoman, she had fielded complaints from tenants about conditions. Now, she said, the building is vacant.It is not the only one. Other buildings, still saddled with debt, are vacant because the city has said they are too unsafe for tenants, the report found.The report also found that the sales may create incentives for some building owners to push out low-income tenants in rent-regulated apartments to make way for higher-paying residents. Once tenants leave, an apartment can be renovated and rented out for much more money.At a building on Clifton Place in Brooklyn, the owner dragged almost every tenant to housing court in 2014 and accused each of being a squatter. The tenants sued the building owner for harassment in Kings County Supreme Court, records show. One tenant said the landlord kicked in her door. Another recalled that the landlord told her the \u201cparty was over\u201d and that she would have to move out.Ultimately, the building owner, after trying unsuccessfully to quash the lawsuit, offered the tenants money to leave.

Trump and cause mayhem among the Republican\u2019s nominee team, his security staff and supporters.Creating an explosive reaction, said the operative, Scott Foval, was \u201cthe whole point of it.\u201dStill, the videos were an embarrassment for Mrs. Clinton at a moment when she is trying to frame Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of a rigged election as nothing more than the fevered dreams of a conspiracy theorist. During Wednesday\u2019s debate Mr. Trump referred to the videos, which together have been viewed more than eight million times on YouTube, as proof of unfair play.And just months after the Democratic chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, was forced out of her post after hacked emails revealed party officials discussing how to damage Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential bid, the Clinton campaign was again forced on the defensive because of the actions of the party.Campaign finance records show that the Democratic committee made two payments, one in July and another in August, totaling about $64,000 to Mobilize Inc., a Chicago-based firm connected to Mr. Creamer, for \u201ccommunications consulting.\u201dThe committee said that Mr. Creamer was brought on for something relatively tame: \u201cbracketing,\u201d the industry term for when one party holds a dueling event, like a news conference, to draw attention from an opposition event.But in the Project Veritas videos, the tactics described went far beyond mere distraction.Mr. Creamer is not seen on the Project Veritas videos approving or endorsing plans to instigate fights at Trump rallies, but his underling, Mr. Foval, is shown boasting about using unseemly methods, like planting people at the gatherings to agitate the crowd.\u201cSometimes the crazies bite,\u201d Mr. Foval said. \u201cSometimes the crazies don\u2019t bite.\u201dBoth men and others in the videos are seen discussing \u2014 or at least nodding along when their undercover interviewers broach the idea \u2014 how people could illegally vote. Among the practices described are moving voters across state lines by using cars with the destination state\u2019s plates, and using pay stubs to make illegal immigrants appear to be citizens for voter registration purposes.While the 2016 race has been remarkable for its ugly tone, there is a rich political history of campaigns pushing ethical and legal boundaries to undermine the opposition. In 1972, supporters of Richard M. Nixon, who was even better positioned to win than Mrs. Clinton, unleashed an organized campaign of sabotage: forging letters, disrupting rallies and even flying an airplane over the Democratic National Convention that year with a banner that read \u201cPeace Pot Promiscuity \u2014 Vote McGovern.\u201dBut it was unclear from the Project Veritas videos whether any of the elaborate plans had been carried out.\u201cWe do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred,\u201d said Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic chairwoman. The Clinton campaign similarly denounced the tactics, while chiding Project Veritas, saying it has \u201cbeen known to offering misleading video out of context.\u201dMr. Creamer said in a statement on Wednesday that the \u201cunprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations\u201d caught on hidden camera were regrettable, and he denied that any of the \u201cschemes described\u201d had ever taken place.Mr. Foval did not respond to a message seeking comment on Thursday.Mr. Creamer is a longtime Democratic strategist from Chicago, and was a consultant during President Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. According to White House guest logs, he has been a frequent visitor, usually as part of groups of Democratic activists or while accompanying his wife, Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic congresswoman from Illinois, to social events.The hacked emails of the party committee and of John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, have shown an occasional lack of coordination between the party and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. They also give a glimpse of Mr. Creamer\u2019s role in party strategy.In the late spring of this year, Mr. Creamer was included and referred to on a series of internal Democratic committee emails also published by WikiLeaks. In one email, the party officials discussed having a presence with signs outside the Republican National Committee when Mr. Trump met there with Speaker Paul D. Ryan in May.\u201cDiscussed with Creamer, et. al today,\u201d wrote Eric Walker, a communications staff member.But in a phone interview Thursday, the woman, Shirley Teter, said she had attended the rally, which was near her home, on her own accord and had not received any protest training.\u201cThe last thing in the world I want to see is Trump getting elected to be our president,\u201d Ms. Teter said. \u201cIt is the first time in years that my heart actually ached, and I felt I had to do it.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Victims Seek Mercy for a Wall St. Scion Who Defrauded Them", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byIn letters to the judge, Mr. Caspersen\u2019s mother, friends and former colleagues on Wall Street paint a picture of a modest man who had a \u201cfirm grasp of the \u2018right\u2019 thing to do.\u201d Even his wedding photographer and the doorman in the Upper East Side apartment building where Mr. Caspersen lives wrote in support.Their depictions are at odds with the government\u2019s, which has detailed how Mr. Caspersen ran a Ponzi-like scheme to steal nearly $40 million, only to lose it all in high-stakes bets on the stock market. He pleaded guilty to one charge of security fraud and one charge of wire fraud in July.The most important letter of all, however, may be one from Dr. Marc N. Potenza, a professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine, who called Mr. Caspersen\u2019s \u201csevere gambling\u201d a mental illness.The lawyer for Mr. Caspersen contends that it was an extreme compulsion to trade stock options that drove his client with an Ivy League pedigree to lie and steal from his friends, family and a hedge fund foundation.In an unusual departure from the typical white-collar sentencing, Judge Jed S. Rakoff has agreed to hear testimony from Dr. Potenza on what constitutes a gambling addiction before imposing a sentence on the 40-year-old Mr. Caspersen. Judge Rakoff is set to sentence Mr. Caspersen at the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday.It is not known whether federal prosecutors in Manhattan will call any witnesses of their own or simply look to cross-examine Dr. Potenza.The testimony could be critical to Mr. Caspersen\u2019s attempt to persuade Judge Rakoff to impose a more lenient sentence than the more than 15 years in prison that federal prosecutors have said is appropriate.Mr. Caspersen was arrested in March at La Guardia Airport in New York as he was returning from a family vacation to Florida. He pleaded guilty in July, telling Judge Rakoff he was \u201cashamed for my crimes\u201d and for causing harm to people close to him.Shortly before the arrest, Mr. Caspersen drafted a suicide note to his wife and a \u201cletter to his \u2018creditors,\u2019\u201d in which he said he was \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d and said he had \u201cengaged in an \u2018outright fraud,\u2019\u201d his lawyer said in a court filing.Andrew Caspersen\u2019s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, has likened his client\u2019s urges to trade tens of millions of dollars worth of stock options as an addiction no less gripping than one to alcohol or drugs. Although such addictive behavior does not excuse Mr. Caspersen\u2019s conduct, he said, it is a mitigating circumstance that Judge Rakoff should take into consideration.\u201cHe never intended for them to lose, yet he could not stop,\u201d Mr. Shechtman said in a filing accompanying the letters from Dr. Potenza and other associates of Mr. Caspersen.Mr. Shechtman has said that his client has undergone treatment since his arrest.The lawyer\u2019s call for leniency has not moved prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan. They are asking Judge Rakoff to impose a stiff sentence that is within the range established by federal sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors, in their own court filing, are taking a tougher position than the probation department for the federal courts, which has recommended a sentence of seven years.Some federal judges have expressed frustration with the guidelines because they potentially hamstring jurists and do not take into account mitigating circumstances.One such critic has been Judge Rakoff, who called the guidelines \u201cirrational\u201d in July, when Mr. Caspersen pleaded guilty.But not all of Mr. Caspersen\u2019s more than a dozen victims have submitted letters of support.Notably, Mr. Shechtman\u2019s filing did not include a letter from Louis Bacon, the billionaire hedge fund manager, whose foundation had given nearly $25 million to Mr. Caspersen.Mr. Caspersen\u2019s tale has confounded Wall Street, where he was known and liked, blending in with many of his associates who came from well-heeled backgrounds. In many ways, his privileged background (he attended Groton and Princeton before Harvard) helped him to keep up a scheme for years before anyone noticed.The stock trading addiction began at Princeton, Mr. Shechtman said, but was amplified by a $2.7 million distribution that Mr. Caspersen received from a family trust in 1999, when he was at Harvard.Over the following years Mr. Caspersen received another distribution, which he lost as well. Soon, he turned to friends and family for investments, getting a million dollars here, several million dollars there. Money came easily from his network, and for years, he papered over the losses by bringing in new money.As recently as February, Mr. Caspersen \u2014 who was at that point a successful executive working at the Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners \u2014 made so much money trading stock options that he could have paid back everyone and still had as much as $60 million left for himself. Instead, he continued to trade, losing it all.Mr. Caspersen kept his compulsive stock trading from friends and families. He even persuaded his wife that they should file separate tax returns, largely to keep his frequent trading a secret, according to court filings.But Mr. Caspersen\u2019s facade began to unravel this year. A former Wall Street options trader who reviewed Mr. Caspersen\u2019s trading records at Mr. Shechtman\u2019s request said the option trading \u201clacked rationality.\u201d\u201cIf the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results,\u201d said Bruce Rosen, a former managing director at Tiger Ventures Capital, \u201cthen Mr. Caspersen\u2019s options trading was not that of a sane person.\u201dStill, Mr. Caspersen has his defenders.\u201cAndrew has always treated me with respect,\u201d wrote John Colby, a doorman at the Manhattan apartment building where Mr. Caspersen lives with his wife and their two children. Mr. Colby described how during a shift on Thanksgiving several years ago, Mr. Caspersen and his wife brought Mr. Colby Thanksgiving dinner \u201con a real plate, with a real glass and napkin and silverware,\u201d adding that the gesture was \u201cvery touching to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jorge Batlle, Political Scion Who Led Uruguay, Dies at 88", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byJorge Batlle, the brash scion of a political dynasty who had been groomed to be president of Uruguay since he was a teenager, got elected to the post on his fifth try and then audaciously presided over a pro-American administration that survived a brush with bankruptcy, died on Monday in Montevideo. He was 88.His death, less than two weeks after he suffered brain injuries in a fall and the day before his 89th birthday, was announced by the Uruguayan government.Mr. Batlle (pronounced BAH-zhay), a generally revered soul of Uruguayan politics for five decades, first sought the presidency in 1966 and then was barred from electoral politics by the ruling military dictatorship. After three more tries he won a five-year term in 1999. (The country\u2019s Constitution does not allow consecutive terms.)When he took office, in 2000, he was the country\u2019s first civilian president since the military relinquished power in 1985 to seek the remains of dissidents who vanished in the 1970s and \u201980s during an urban guerrilla war. The military yielded after general strikes led to a restoration of the Constitution and elections.Mr. Batlle was the first Latin American leader to propose the partial legalization of drugs as a way to reduce trafficking, money laundering and profiteering by cartels. Legalization would have the added benefit, he said, of reducing addiction and lowering drug prices, which were being set by the cartels.\u201cIf that little powder was worth only 10 cents,\u201d he said in 2002, \u201cthere would be no organizations dedicated to raising a billion dollars to finance armies in Colombia.\u201dCriticized for the proposal, he later said he had made it to provoke debate. In any case, it went nowhere.While neighboring countries were shifting to the left politically, Mr. Batlle established closer ties with Washington, led at the time by Republicans. That alliance was vindicated during a 2002 recession when unemployment in Uruguay hit 20 percent and a run on bank deposits led the country to declare a four-day bank holiday, prompting President George W. Bush to support a credit extension of $1.5 billion to Uruguay to stave off default.Mr. Batlle strained relations with neighboring Argentina at one point when, speaking unwittingly into an open microphone after a television interview, he proclaimed Argentines \u201ca bunch of thieves, from the first to the last.\u201dHours later, Mr. Batlle, as idiosyncratic as he was strident, flew to Buenos Aires to apologize to Argentina\u2019s president, personally and tearfully.Mr. Batlle also confronted Cuba on its human rights record, leading Fidel Castro to denounce him as a \u201clackey\u201d of the United States. Mr. Batlle severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2002, and they were not restored until three years later, when Mr. Batlle was succeeded by Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, a 65-year-old doctor.The election of Mr. V\u00e1zquez was a milestone in Uruguayan politics. He was the first leftist to take power, and Mr. Batlle was the last president from the Colorado Party, which had produced all but one of Uruguay\u2019s elected presidents during the 20th century.Jorge Luis Batlle Iba\u00f1\u00e9z was born in Montevideo, the country\u2019s capital, on Oct. 25, 1927, the son of Luis Batlle Berres, who was the president of Uruguay from 1947 to 1951, and Matilde Iba\u00f1\u00e9z Talice.Born into a family that had originally immigrated from the Catalan coast in Spain, he had a political pedigree rooted in the 19th century. He was descended from two other former Uruguayan presidents, Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez and Lorenzo Batlle.Mr. Batlle was being groomed to be president as early as the late 1940s, when his father dispatched him, as a teenager, to represent Uruguay at official functions.He was married to Mercedes Menafra. He is survived by two children, Beatriz and Raul Lorenzo, from his first marriage, to Noemi Lamuraglia; and four grandchildren.Mr. Batlle was elected a congressman in 1958, two years after graduating from the University of the Republic in Montevideo with a diploma in law and social sciences. He was banished from political activity and imprisoned briefly after a military coup in 1973 and again barred from political activity in 1976.He later presided over the Legislative General Assembly and, after his initial defeat in 1966, ran unsuccessfully for president in 1971, 1989 and 1994. In winning the presidency in 1999 he defeated a coalition of Socialists, Communists and former guerrillas by aligning himself with a center-right party.\u201cThe first thing we need is institutional stability, next economic stability and finally social stability,\u201d he declared.In his victory speech, Mr. Batlle vowed to lead \u201ca government with the active participation of all the people to promote the ideals of democracy, tolerance and liberty.\u201d He appointed a peace commission to locate about 160 \u201cdisappeared\u201d people, and later promised to pay their families damages. When a general suggested that the military might have to intervene in political affairs to combat leftist extremists, Mr. Batlle fired him.As a president in his 70s, he described himself as being in the Carnelli Station of life \u2014 that is, the penultimate stop on the railroad line to Montevideo \u2014 with nothing to lose by speaking his mind.\u201cI am the way I am,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am not about to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Family\u2019s Struggle With Microcephaly, the Birth Defect Now Linked to Zika", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosThe morning after Christine Grounds gave birth to her son Nicholas, she awoke to find a neurologist examining her baby.It was summer 2006, and Nicholas was her first child. There had been no indication that anything was wrong during her pregnancy, but it was soon clear that there was a problem.\u201cDid you know he has microcephaly?\u201d she remembered the doctor asking matter-of-factly.Confused, she replied, \u201cWhat is microcephaly?\u201dMs. Grounds, a 45-year-old psychotherapist, and her husband, Jon Mir, who live in Manhattan, had no idea what microcephaly would mean for them or for their child.\u201cWe had a diagnosis but no prognosis,\u201d recalled Mr. Mir, 44, who works in finance.The doctors could offer few answers.\u201cWe don\u2019t know if he will walk,\u201d the couple recalled being told. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he will talk. He might be in a vegetative state.\u201dBut the truth was, even the doctors did not know.Like other neurological disorders, microcephaly runs along a spectrum and its severity can vary widely. Zika-related microcephaly is believed to be somewhat different from microcephaly caused by genetics or other factors, but the result is largely the same: mental impairment that can run from mild to devastating. Detecting the condition before a child is born remains difficult and often impossible until very late in pregnancy \u2014 a fact that has renewed and fueled political debates about abortion and made an already difficult choice for prospective mothers even more agonizing.Watching the unfolding epidemic and concerned that many people did not grasp what it meant to raise a child with microcephaly, Ms. Grounds offered to share her family\u2019s experience.\u201cI was hysterically crying all the time,\u201d she recalled of her son\u2019s early days.By the time Nicholas was 2, his developmental problems started to become evident. He crawled awkwardly, did not start to walk on time and would not make eye contact with others.Fortunately, New York City has a robust early intervention program for toddlers with developmental problems, and Nicholas was able to get special instruction and care.Unfortunately, that care ends after three years.While the city\u2019s special education program in the public school system gets generally high marks for helping children with conditions like autism, it is exceedingly difficult to provide the kind of care needed by children like Nicholas.\u201cA child with microcephaly needs scaffolding around every aspect of his life,\u201d Mr. Mir said.The C.D.C. put the cost of care for each child at $10 million over a lifetime.When Nicholas, who shares his father\u2019s surname and is often called Nick, entered school, he was 5 and could barely communicate, mostly grunting and pointing.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even close his mouth,\u201d Kevin McManaway, a clinical coordinator at the school, said. A full day could be spent on reinforcement techniques to control his drool and keep his mouth closed.In year three at the school, when Nicholas was 8, he started to combine words. For instance, he could say, \u201cboy-eat.\u201d But he could not communicate his own desires.The breakthrough came in his fourth year. Just as he was getting started on a new communication device, \u201cit was like a switch went off,\u201d Mr. McManaway said.Nicholas would exclaim: \u201cLook the blue car. Throw ball. Jump. Get a haircut.\u201dMr. McManaway said, \u201cHe just had this burst of language.\u201dNow, sitting in an art class, Nicholas is quick to say hello to a visitor and attentive to his teacher. On the playground, he grabbed a basketball and shot hoops, sinking as many as he missed. He is quick to offer the ball to others and to join in games. He is nothing like the child he was six years ago, his instructors say.But all the progress came only after years of intensive and expensive intervention, and there is much work yet to be done to ensure that he has as full a life as possible.On a weekly basis, Nicholas sees roughly a dozen different specialists and teachers, all concentrating on different parts of his development.Every week at school, he has speech therapy four times, occupational therapy three times, physical therapy three times, individual counseling once, adaptive physical therapy twice, yoga once, and art class and music class twice each.At home he receives more speech therapy, as well as additional physical and occupational therapy. Recently, he has also been able to participate in a variety of recreational activities.Ms. Grounds said it was hard to imagine how parents could cope without the resources her family had.Whatever the cost of prevention, she said, it would not compare with the cost of care.Dr. Wendy K. Chung, the director of the clinical genetics program at Columbia University Medical School, has spent years working with children with neurological development issues. She said people with microcephaly needed care beyond childhood.\u201cThey need support their entire lives,\u201d she said.Dr. Chung met Nicholas when he was a baby and came in for testing.His parents, seeking to learn why he had been born with microcephaly, turned to Dr. Chung, hoping to find an answer in his genetic makeup.\u201cThe first tests we had were unsuccessful,\u201d Dr. Chung said. \u201cThe science was just not that well developed.\u201dMs. Grounds and her husband, thinking it was highly unlikely that lightning would strike twice, had a second son, this one born without complications.About three years ago, Dr. Chung was finally able to provide an answer to the question they had long asked: Why?Nicholas was \u201cautosomal recessive,\u201d meaning he had inherited two mutated genes \u2014 one from each parent \u2014 that caused microcephaly. It is exceedingly rare that both parents would carry the recessive genes for microcephaly.It meant the odds their second child could have been born with the condition was not like lightning striking again. They were one in four.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Magnate\u2019s Twin Goals: Fighting Climate Change and Electing Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byMONTAUK, N.Y. \u2014 On a sunny morning late this summer, Andrew E. Sabin was aboard his 60-foot yacht, \u201cAbove the Ground.\u201d He had begun the day in Amagansett, a well-heeled enclave near East Hampton where he maintains a lush seven-acre compound replete with a menagerie featuring peacocks and an enormous pig. Now, on the eastern tip of Long Island, Mr. Sabin pierced a clam with a hook and dropped his fishing line 120 feet to the ocean floor, hoping to land some cod.A wisecracking, boyish septuagenarian of seemingly unlimited energy, Mr. Sabin runs a privately held precious-metals recycling business that has made him enormously wealthy. The Sabin Metal Corporation processes about $1 billion worth of platinum, palladium and other metals each year. Annual revenue is less than that, but it clearly leaves plenty for a personal fortune.With that money, Mr. Sabin has emerged as a leading supporter of climate change initiatives. He has endowed the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, funds climate change prizes and professors at Yale and the University of California, Los Angeles and is a major donor to Global Wildlife Conservation. He founded a local natural history museum where he leads nature walks, and, thanks to his generous support of environmental causes, he has four species named after him \u2014 two frogs, a chameleon and a lemur.But Mr. Sabin also sharply diverges from the environmentalist stereotype: He is a strident Republican donating big sums of money in an effort to elect Donald J. Trump president.His twin passions are at odds. Many of the Republican Party\u2019s elected officials deny that humans are accelerating the warming of the planet, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence. Prominent environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, generally back Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. Yet Mr. Sabin has been a generous donor to the Republican Party for years, contributing more than $500,000 to Republican candidates, committees and other political groups this election cycle.Even within his party, Mr. Sabin is an outlier: Many other Republicans who believe in climate change have declined to support Mr. Trump. But after backing Jeb Bush early in the primaries, Mr. Sabin threw his wallet behind Mr. Trump and never looked back. He recently donated $100,000 to Trump Victory, the candidate\u2019s joint fund-raising venture with the Republican Party.To hear Mr. Sabin tell it, a Trump presidency would not be such a threat to environmental concerns. Yes, Mr. Trump has routinely suggested that global warming is not real, has vowed to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency if elected president and said he would walk away from the landmark Paris accord approved last year, in which nearly 200 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions.Mr. Sabin, however, brushes that off as election-season bluster. \u201cI don\u2019t think he believes half the things he says,\u201d he said. In meetings with Mr. Trump, he has come away convinced that the candidate is actually a reasonable, well-tempered man who is committed to clean air and clean water. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations about the E.P.A. and the Paris agreement, Mr. Sabin is dismissive, arguing that such actions wouldn\u2019t get through Congress. \u201cThere are good checks and balances,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to do whatever he wants.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.As much as he supports the Republican ticket, Mr. Sabin is equally motivated by his loathing for Mrs. Clinton, whom he derides as untrustworthy, unethical and unfit for office. In front of his mansion, in an organic garden that features kale, blueberries and Swiss chard, Mr. Sabin has erected several \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d yard signs. Last year, after the signs disappeared in the middle of the night, Mr. Sabin placed them on stilts and surrounded them with a 6,600-volt electrified fence.\u201cYou will have a fascinating journey down the rabbit hole in trying to understand the complexity of Andy Sabin,\u201d said Susan Rockefeller, a prominent conservationist who has worked with Mr. Sabin and affectionately calls him \u201cthe eco-saint of the Hamptons.\u201dThis summer, Mr. Sabin made several trips to Washington. His mission was to persuade Republican members of Congress to acknowledge climate change in the party platform that would shape the Republican National Convention in late July.In a flurry of meetings, Mr. Sabin, who wears a uniform of Hawaiian shirts, baggy khaki pants and sneakers, visited the offices of Republican representatives including Chris Gibson of New York, Joe Wilson of South Carolina and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, as well as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.Mr. Sabin has no doubt that greenhouse gases from human activity are warming the planet, leading to rising oceans and more severe weather. \u201cThe science is clear,\u201d he said, and inasmuch as he can, Mr. Sabin is working to minimize his own carbon dioxide emissions. At Sabin Metal Corporation\u2019s processing plants in upstate New York, North Dakota and Ontario, he says he has invested in expensive equipment to reduce emissions and minimize pollution. \u201cNot a drop of carbon comes out of my stacks,\u201d he said.Yet on Capitol Hill, he measured his words. Instead of trying to persuade Republican lawmakers that climate science is real, he talked to them about the need to minimize pollution as a way to keep people healthy. He makes the case that worse air quality leads to premature deaths, an increase in illnesses, more stillbirths and higher hospital spending. \u201cI don\u2019t discuss climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cI discuss health.\u201dMr. Sabin employs this rhetorical sleight of hand to reconcile what, to many, are inherently contradictory positions.\u201cI came to the conclusion that I needed to come up with a way to get Republicans on board about cutting carbon,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t going to convince Republicans that climate change is real, so I\u2019m trying to get them to the same place.\u201dHe has drafted a policy paper peppered with statistics from the RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University that encourages lawmakers to invest in clean energy jobs and to pressure businesses to pollute less, simply for the good of public health. If embraced in earnest, Mr. Sabin says, this approach will result in reductions in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 a goal of many Democrats.But he opposes many ideas from Democrats about how to reach that goal. He is vehemently opposed to new regulation and a carbon tax, and he says the E.P.A. is guilty of overreach. Instead, Mr. Sabin says that private investments in clean coal technology, new nuclear power and renewable energy will reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to check global warming. In the meantime, Mr. Sabin supports the use of cheap and abundant natural gas.It is a position that closely mirrors that of the broader Republican Party on energy production. And Mr. Sabin claims to have the Trump campaign\u2019s ear on the issue. He says he is in regular contact with the campaign and took credit for shaping the response to a question in the second presidential debate, when Mr. Trump talked up clean coal, wind power and solar energy. \u201cThat came from me,\u201d Mr. Sabin said.Many environmentalists, however, say the policies promoted by Mr. Sabin and Mr. Trump will not do nearly enough to curb emissions.\u201cTo put the fate of our climate on clean coal and so-called next-gen nuclear is about the riskiest proposition in the world,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. \u201cWe might as well bet on leprechauns and the Easter bunny.\u201dMr. Sabin\u2019s positions baffle even some professors he supports. Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said: \u201cAndy and I agree about some things and agree to disagree on other things. The party has gone off the rails on that side.\u201dMany Republicans in Congress reject the idea that human activity is contributing to climate change. \u201cI don\u2019t think what we do as a race is going to be the deciding factor in what happens with our environment,\u201d said Ms. Foxx, the North Carolina congresswoman. \u201cBecause I happen to believe that God is in charge.\u201dShortly after Mr. Sabin\u2019s visits to Washington, he had a private meeting with Mr. Trump at the Manhattan home of Steven Mnuchin, the candidate\u2019s national finance chairman. Mr. Trump wore his usual dark suit with a white shirt and a red tie. Mr. Sabin attended the meeting in a bright green Hawaiian shirt, wearing Buddhist prayer beads on his wrist.Mr. Sabin came away impressed. \u201cTrump knows in his heart that cutting carbon is the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cHe\u2019s very different in person. He listens.\u201dMr. Sabin, 70, grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn and still speaks with a thick New York accent reminiscent of Mr. Trump\u2019s. As a boy, he would wander over to undeveloped areas in nearby Bensonhurst and collect frogs and snakes with his bare hands. \u201cI started catching them and never grew up,\u201d he said.He joined the Army reserve in the late 1960s, he said, and then joined his father\u2019s business, which collected and sold scrap metal. In the early 1970s, Mr. Sabin started a trading house for metals and other commodities. As Wall Street went digital, Mr. Sabin left trading behind and built out his father\u2019s company into Sabin Metal Corporation.He attributes his passion for the environment to his boyhood enthusiasm. \u201cSince I started catching frogs, I\u2019ve always been interested in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the years went on I realized the importance of preserving what I was enjoying.\u201dHe has been a Republican for as long as he can remember, too, and has internalized the party\u2019s talking points about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI see corruption with the Clintons only rivaled by Nigeria, Malaysia or Indonesia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts right at the top, and it disgusts me.\u201dPerhaps one way to makes sense of Mr. Sabin is to recognize that he is much like Mr. Trump himself. Impassioned and at times charismatic, he is also quick to ignore facts, brimming with conspiracy theories, and prone to objectifying women. His girlfriend is several decades his junior. \u201cYou\u2019re only as young as the woman you\u2019re touching,\u201d he said. While watching Fox News, he complimented the appearance of the daytime host Jenna Lee. (\u201cI think she\u2019s so hot,\u201d he said.) Aboard his yacht, he openly viewed pornography on an iPad. Over the course of several months, he sent a reporter numerous emails containing X-rated images.On Thursday, Mr. Sabin said he was repulsed by Mr. Trump\u2019s recently unearthed comments about sexually assaulting women \u2014 though not enough to withdraw his support. And he is unashamed of his own libido. \u201cI\u2019m proud that at 70 years old I still have a healthy sex drive,\u201d he said.He also talks of radical transformation to the economy, while rejecting regulation as a tool to facilitate change. And on his Facebook page, Mr. Sabin traffics in the conspiracy theories of the so-called Alt Right. Stories such as \u201cMichelle Obama Vows to Confiscate All Firearms Before Leaving the White House\u201d and \u201cUnited Nations to Investigate Hillary Clinton for Election Fraud\u201d are posted alongside pictures of Mr. Sabin searching for salamanders.This complex personality is on constant display. Tooling around the Hamptons, he drives a Jeep Wrangler with his nickname, the Salamander Commander, emblazoned on the doors. On the back of the jeep are bumper stickers that say \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d and \u201cTrump 2016.\u201dAt a separate property that he owns in the Hamptons, away from his mansion, Tibetan prayer flags form a canopy over the driveway. In front of the house is a small sanctuary for injured turtles. Buddha statues are placed around the grounds and throughout the house. Inside, a piano once owned by the abstract expressionist painter Lee Krasner sits in the living room. And all around the property are National Rifle Association signs, warning trespassers that they will be shot.These days, Mr. Sabin acknowledges his candidate\u2019s shortcomings. And he said he disliked the hobbies of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s children. (\u201cI don\u2019t like hunting,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about Trump\u2019s kids: these pictures of them holding leopards and elephant tails.\u201d)And yet, Mr. Sabin is still supporting Mr. Trump for lack of what he sees as a better option. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep a Republican House, and Republican Senate and a conservative Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump comes with the package to do that.\u201dIt is a combustible, contradictory mix, reflecting the tensions roiling the Republican Party \u2014 and the nation \u2014 in this bizarre election season.In the run-up to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, the party\u2019s official platform was unveiled. \u201cClimate change is far from this nation\u2019s most pressing national security issue,\u201d it read. \u201cThis is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it.\u201dMr. Sabin was unruffled by the snub. \u201cIt was a disappointment,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t try it can\u2019t happen.\u201dMotoring back to the Long Island shore on his yacht, Mr. Sabin was satisfied with his haul. A dozen meaty fish were in the hold, including several cod and a handful of black sea bass. On the horizon, five towering wind turbines rose from the ocean. The first offshore wind farm in the United States, the turbines have stirred up predictable controversy in this area. But Mr. Sabin rejects the Nimbyism that has turned some wealthy locals against the project.\u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of wind energy,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people worry about the views, but it\u2019s better than more carbon.\u201dIn the cabin of the boat, Fox News played on a large flat-screen TV. It was midday, and Mr. Trump was holding forth at a news conference at his new Washington hotel, where he finally admitted that President Obama was born in the United States, after years promoting the birther conspiracy.\u201cTrump is doing really well,\u201d Mr. Sabin said enthusiastically. \u201cHillary\u2019s in trouble.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the wealthy businessman Andrew E. Sabin\u2019s contradictory stance of supporting both action to thwart climate change and the presidential aspirations of Donald J. Trump referred imprecisely to when Mr. Sabin joined the Army reserve. It was in the late 1960s, not \u201cin the years after World War II.\u201d The article also misidentified an environmental group that generally backs Democrats. It is the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, not the N.R.D.C. itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Economy Slows, a Look at What Could Happen", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s economy is slowing. How bad can it get?China reported on Wednesday that its economy grew 6.7 percent in the third quarter compared with a year ago. That matched economists\u2019 expectations exactly, and was identical to the pace China set in the first and second quarters of this year. In economics, stability like that is remarkable \u2014 and usually not to be believed.\u201cChina\u2019s growth has already slowed down dramatically from the heady rates before the financial crisis,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Enodo Economics. \u201cThe economy has reached the end of the road when it comes to its export- and investment-led growth model.\u201dThat is a major concern for central banks, economists, investors and corporate executives around the world, as China has been a major engine of growth for decades. Their main question: What happens next?Below are three situations that are often discussed as the most likely outcomes of China\u2019s predicament \u2014 and what each would mean for the rest of the world.China escaped the worst of the 2008 global financial crisis by starting a campaign of state-directed spending that created mountains of new debt. This helped cushion the blow of the fallout around the world. But critics argue that this only delayed China\u2019s own day of reckoning.China is still adding credit at a heady pace, and experts are starting to sound alarm bells. Under this situation, China risks its own version of the 2008 crisis that shook Wall Street and plunged the United States into recession and years of painfully slow growth. The rest of the world \u2014 which is still dealing with Europe\u2019s woes \u2014 could follow.The good news is that few people actually think such a crisis is the most likely outcome.\u201cThe risks of a financial crisis remain very low,\u201d said Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia, based in San Francisco.Mr. Rothman and others point to China\u2019s tight grip on its own financial system. It controls the country\u2019s big banks as well as the big companies that borrow the most. It also limits how much money can leave its borders and keeps a firm grip on the value of its currency.So why can\u2019t China just spend its way out of its slowdown?The problem is that China\u2019s debt burden is so much larger than ever before \u2014 both in absolute terms and compared with the economy.\u201cThe resurgence of state investment has helped sustain growth in the short run, as has the modest rebound in property investment this year,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on China\u2019s economy who is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.But he added, \u201cThe productivity of state investment is low, so it is a very inefficient way to sustain growth.\u201dWith China\u2019s high debt, inability to spend and a lack of political will to make tough choices to fix its economy, economists are increasingly comparing it to another Asian powerhouse: Japan.China is not Japan, of course, and its vast and upwardly mobile population stands in contrast to Japan\u2019s wealthier but aging society. Still, a growing number of economists see the possibility of something similar.\u201cJust having a lot of debt, and bad debt, does not cause you to have a crisis,\u201d said Arthur R. Kroeber, the managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, an economic research firm in Beijing.\u201cBut the price that you pay \u2014 if you don\u2019t do the financial restructuring and real economy restructuring that is necessary to restore things to health \u2014 is that you get a very long period of very low growth and anemic activity,\u201d he added.That could also sideline one of the world\u2019s most reliable engines of growth. It could also cause problems in China, where leaders have long pledged to provide jobs and opportunity to the millions who still leave their rural villages looking for a better life.Still, that could be better than the alternative.\u201cThis expansion of debt is way beyond anything we saw in Japan, both in terms of magnitude and time frame,\u201d said Charlene Chu, a partner at Autonomous Research and a former China banking analyst at Fitch Ratings.\u201cI think a Japan outcome in many ways would be a best-case scenario for China.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Upstate Congressional Race, a \u2018Classic Boxers\u2019 Match\u2019 That Is Virtually Tied", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byNEW PALTZ, N.Y. \u2014 The two candidates, current and former, stood with arms around each other, an American flag behind them, an adoring crowd before them.Most of the rally\u2019s attendees came for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination became a grass-roots phenomenon. But Mr. Sanders was there to support a Democrat with grass-roots credentials of her own: Zephyr Teachout, who is running for Congress.In some ways, the race in New York\u2019s 19th Congressional District, which reaches across 11 upstate counties, is the presidential race turned inside out.The Republican candidate, John J. Faso, is a career political insider who will not say if he will vote for his party\u2019s outsider nominee for president, Donald J. Trump. Ms. Teachout is a political insurgent more closely aligned with Mr. Sanders than her party\u2019s establishment candidate, Hillary Clinton.\u201cThis is the marquee race, and if the Democrats are to make real gains in the House nationally this is the kind of seat that they need to pick up,\u201d said Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic political consultant. \u201cYou have the classic boxers\u2019 match between the ring-wise boxing technician versus the young up and comer.\u201dThe district is one of just six of the state\u2019s 27 congressional districts where Mr. Sanders beat Mrs. Clinton in the presidential primary in April, and Mr. Sanders has enthusiastically supported Ms. Teachout, whose left-of-center views echo his own.At the rally on Sept. 16, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Teachout attracted more than 1,000 people to a grassy park in New Paltz, home to a campus of the State University of New York, where many students are avid Sanders supporters.\u201cThis race is one of the most important congressional races in America because the choices are so clear,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, contrasting the two candidates on issues like campaign finance and free trade.Yet the race may turn on other factors.Mr. Faso is well known in the district, which encompasses a large part of the Catskills, a section of the Hudson Valley and includes the Assembly district that he represented for 16 years. His two campaigns for statewide office raised his profile further.In contrast, Ms. Teachout is a newcomer to the district, where she moved last year from Brooklyn. She also is relatively new to politics: The 2014 primary race against Mr. Cuomo was her first.Mr. Faso has criticized his opponent as a carpetbagger and for being politically out of step with the district. \u201cShe\u2019s pie in the sky and I\u2019m practical,\u201d he said.Campaigning at an apple festival in Germantown on a recent Saturday, many of the people with whom Mr. Faso shook hands had known him, at least casually, for years.\u201cAll I know about Zephyr Teachout is she was in the governor\u2019s race at one point,\u201d said Frank Santacroce, 78, a volunteer at the festival who chatted briefly with Mr. Faso. \u201cIt makes it tough to decide.\u201dMr. Santacroce said he usually voted Republican, but was willing to cross party lines, although not in this case. \u201cI know John Faso,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to say he\u2019s a nice guy.\u201dA day earlier, at the Sanders rally for Ms. Teachout in New Paltz, Molly Franco, 21, a SUNY student, said that her sociology class, which usually met at that time, had insisted that their professor let them attend the rally. But Mr. Sanders was the draw. Without him, she said, \u201cprobably a couple people would come if they said it was extra credit.\u201dMs. Franco said that she had not yet taken a close look at the congressional candidates, but that Mr. Sanders\u2019s endorsement of Ms. Teachout could help persuade her.The district is almost equally divided along party lines, with 135,193 active voters registered as Republicans and 132,818 registered as Democrats, according to the State Board of Elections. There is also a large contingent of independent voters, with 114,577 active voters holding no party affiliation.Both parties have singled out the race as a priority, but the National Republican Congressional Committee and allied groups have committed far more money.The N.R.C.C. and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supports Republican House candidates, have spent more than $800,000 so far on television advertising, and the N.R.C.C. has reserved additional television time worth more than $1.4 million. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has spent just $80,000 and reserved about $100,000. The expenditures were provided by two people, one Democrat and one Republican, who had access to data that tracked political spending from both parties but were not authorized to disclose them.Both candidates said the race could come down to independent voters.\u201cIt is one of the swingiest districts you\u2019ll find in America,\u201d Ms. Teachout said in an interview after the rally, listing candidates who had won there in recent years, including President Obama, a Democrat, and Mr. Gibson. \u201cWhat you see there is people making an independent choice,\u201d she said.Ms. Teachout said her campaign had been financed, as was Mr. Sanders\u2019s, largely by small internet donations, with the average contribution being $19. In contrast, she said, Mr. Faso is supported by a super PAC that has taken contributions of $600,000 and $500,000 from two hedge fund managers who are major Republican donors.Ms. Teachout had raised $1.6 million through the end of June, according to the most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission, while Mr. Faso had raised $1.4 million. But Ms. Teachout still had $1.1 million left to spend while Mr. Faso had just $147,000.In her conversations with voters, Ms. Teachout said she heard the anti-establishment anger that led to the popularity of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump.\u201cThey are not looking for a career politician,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be beholden. I\u2019m bottom up.\u201dMs. Teachout stands to gain from Mr. Sanders\u2019s sway with the party\u2019s most liberal voters and could also get a boost if Mrs. Clinton has a strong showing against Mr. Trump.That is where Mr. Faso\u2019s road gets bumpier.\u201cI\u2019m going to support the Republican nominee,\u201d Mr. Faso said in an interview at a Germantown coffee shop. But he refused to say if he would vote for Mr. Trump.Pressed to give a yes or no answer, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll vote for him. I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t vote for him. I\u2019m saying I have some clear policy differences with him. I\u2019m not voting for Hillary Clinton.\u201dIn the April primary, Mr. Trump won 60 percent of the vote in the district, a strong showing but far from his best in the state, where he won every congressional district but one. Mr. Faso acknowledged that Mr. Trump could cost him some votes among independents.While Mr. Faso casts Ms. Teachout as an outsider to the district, she portrays him as an insider of the political establishment, emphasizing his work, since leaving government, as a lobbyist.Mr. Faso predicted that the race would come down to some basic choices between liberal and conservative, idealism and experience. \u201cIn some respects,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a barometer as to what approach the country wants to take.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated when Bernie Sanders appeared with Zephyr Teachout at a rally in New Paltz. It was an event last month \u2014 on Sept. 16 \u2014 not last week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Power Pastor: How A.R. Bernard Built a New York Megachurch", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "The reverend\u2019s intellectualism and distinctive brand of man-up Christianity draws a wide audience to his church, the largest in New York.Supported byCameras on telescoping booms were cantilevered over the stage, which is bland and massive, like the set of a daytime talk show. It was the final morning of a weeklong women\u2019s conference, and the female audience of more than 1,000 took out their own devices and cued up their Bible apps, poised to take notes.When the pastor speaks, everyone takes notes, not just the younger congregants.His church, the largest in New York City, has long been considered a required stop on the way to City Hall and beyond. Having served as an adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for all three terms, Mr. Bernard counts the billionaire among his many powerful friends. (In 2013, he flirted briefly with his own mayoral bid.) Mr. Bernard has met with the last two popes, and when Reuven Rivlin, the president of Israel, visited New York for the first time last year, he attended service at the church days before he addressed the United Nations. Mr. Bernard is a registered Republican, but he voted twice for Bill Clinton and twice for President Obama. The Clintons are old friends; they made sure to visit the church last spring in the days before the New York primary.Mr. Bernard may have a reputation as a kingmaker, or \u201cspiritual power broker,\u201d as Bill Cunningham, the political consultant and former communications director for Mr. Bloomberg, described him recently, following a storied tradition of influential black pastors in New York City. But his tweedy intellectualism and distinctive brand of muscular, man-up Christianity also draw stars of pop music, film and sports to East New York.\u201cHe\u2019s made me a better person through his teachings,\u201d Pauletta Washington said. \u201cMy husband as well.\u201dOnce a Nation of Islam follower and teenage civil rights activist who read Alan Watts and Krishnamurti before he read the Bible, Mr. Bernard presents more like a professor than a bible thumper. That he is a motorcycle-riding family man and father of seven sons as well as a martial arts devotee \u2014 inked into Mr. Bernard\u2019s forearm is a Chinese character that translates as \u201cthe unfettered mind\u201d \u2014 adds to his allure.On that Saturday morning in Brooklyn, Mr. Bernard was writing swiftly on his marker board while the women in the audience called out encouragements. \u201cYou have a responsibility to get smarter,\u201d he told them. \u201cIf you\u2019re the smartest one in your group, get a new group. Develop your strengths. Manage your weaknesses.\u201d As always, Mr. Bernard closed with this refrain: \u201cDid you get anything out of this today?\u201dThen Karen Bernard, his high school sweetheart and wife of 44 years, stepped onto the dais and swiftly upstaged him. Though she has multiple sclerosis, she waved away the stool a burly security guard had brought for her and stood next to her husband, a smartly dressed figure in black patent leather platform shoes with stiletto heels, a delicate diamond bracelet circling her ankle. As her husband described the pneumonia that hit him hard last month \u2014 unlike Hillary Clinton, he was benched for two solid weeks \u2014 and how his wife had cared for him, Ms. Bernard scanned the crowd, eyebrows eloquently aloft, and said with perfect comedic timing, \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you do with a baby?\u201dMr. Bernard winced as the crowd roared its approval.Ms. Bernard is the not-so-secret sauce in Mr. Bernard\u2019s global ministry. Their long marriage has been a touchstone in his preaching, and he has used their marital struggles as teaching aids. Mr. Bernard will tell you that his work has often been his mistress, and Ms. Bernard will just as quickly tell you how mad that has made her, and for how long (on this morning, she pinched his arm hard to make her point, which delighted her rapt audience).In the early 1980s, Ms. Bernard miscarried twins while Mr. Bernard was on the road, she said. She blamed him for being absent, and she stayed bitter, she said, for a solid decade. \u201cI thought about leaving him,\u201d she said, but with seven sons, \u201cI had nowhere to go. And my sons needed their father. And I loved him.\u201dIt was after the Saturday service, and the Bernards were in the large, formal dining room of Mr. Bernard\u2019s office suite at the church, an elegant, carpeted apartment with gleaming mahogany furniture that recalls the West Wing. There was a cadre of security guards brandishing walkie-talkies, along with a sizable crowd of family members, church employees and congregants, all milling about the many rooms, which are organized around a large, oval-shaped central hall.\u201cShe had cause to walk away,\u201d Mr. Bernard said, \u201cbut she stayed, and I really went to work on myself. I discovered a lot of things about myself I didn\u2019t like. I\u2019m a workaholic. I was all in. That\u2019s when I began to develop teachings about men and men\u2019s responsibilities. She hung in there and things began to change, and the church just began to explode.\u201dThe two met in high school in East New York, when he was 15 and she was 16. Mr. Bernard\u2019s mother, Adelina Bernard, had been a Panamanian sprinter who qualified for the 1952 Summer Olympics but wasn\u2019t able to compete because an affair with an older man left her pregnant, after which he rejected her and their son. She and Mr. Bernard moved to New York City when he was 4.He and Ms. Bernard began to host a Bible study in their Williamsburg kitchen, and it wasn\u2019t long before they figured out that Mr. Bernard was very good at preaching. A deft speaker who uses traditional pastoral tropes like call and response, Mr. Bernard crafts his 45-minute sermons like mash-ups of a university lecture and a Baptist revival, though Mr. Bernard\u2019s church is pointedly nondenominational.\u201cComing from a heavy black radical activism, to embrace Jesus was a major thing for me,\u201d he said. \u201cChristianity was the religion of the oppressor, so I had to work through what I knew historically.\u201d Investigating the religion and its central text as an academic would, he began to realize, Mr. Bernard said, \u201cthat I had an ability to articulate what I was reading and studying in a way that was not common within any denomination. I also realized that banking was not going to be my life\u2019s calling.\u201dBy the mid-1990s, his church was so popular that it had rapidly expanded from a congregation of 685 to more than 10,000. People came from all five boroughs, as they do today, some traveling hours to do so, and were folded into three Sunday services held in a former Key Food supermarket building in Brownsville, around which lines would start to form as early as 4 a.m. Nightclub goers on their way home grew curious about the crowds, which further swelled the church\u2019s ranks. You might run into Cheryl James and Sandra Denton, two of the members of Salt-N-Pepa, the hip-hop trio; Angela Bassett; or Kim Cattrall, who played the sultry publicist on \u201cSex and the City.\u201dIn the late 1990s, Disque Deane, the real estate investor and leader of the partnership behind Starrett City, the country\u2019s largest federally subsidized housing complex, approached Mr. Bernard with a proposal for a 15-acre parcel on the edge of his development. As the pastor recalled, \u201cHe said, \u2018I have a billion-dollar complex I need to preserve, and I\u2019ve been studying you and I want you to build a church.\u201d Mr. Deane did not finance the deal, Mr. Bernard added; the church raised the money and bought 11\u00bd acres. When the $12.6 million complex was nearly complete, Ms. Bernard looked around and told her husband, \u201cIt\u2019s not big enough.\u201d\u201cSo he crosses a lot of lines, a lot of boundaries,\u201d Mr. Cunningham added. \u201cIf you\u2019re a politician and you have a message about jobs or the economy or crime and you\u2019re addressing that megachurch, your message will ripple out to all these different communities.\u201dInitially, Mr. Bernard\u2019s sermons about male responsibility were attracting a lot of young men, which in turn, brought in more women. Church congregations typically skew more female than male, but at one point more than half of the Christian Cultural Center\u2019s membership was male. (Now the split is 60/40 female to male, like many college campuses.)Man up, men, Mr. Bernard exhorts, or you\u2019ll lose her. Echoing animal behaviorists, he suggests women offer positive reinforcement if their menfolk behave properly.Mr. Martin, the former football star, is one male congregant who has been avidly following Mr. Bernard\u2019s teachings; he said the pastor is both his friend and a father figure. \u201cHe is the single most influential male in my adult life,\u201d he said. Now 43, Mr. Martin began attending his church in the late 1990s, when he signed with the Jets. \u201cA friend of mine said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to hear this guy speak,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just kept going back. I\u2019m a very practical person, and I think he has a tremendous gift for making what is complicated extremely simple. He can talk about God in a way that makes you attracted to God so you don\u2019t get lost in all the rules and regulations.\u201dMr. Martin brought his friend Carra Wallace, now chief diversity officer in New York City\u2019s office of the comptroller. She was coming off a divorce \u2014 \u201cI like to say I married late and divorced early,\u201d she said \u2014 and was attracted to Mr. Bernard\u2019s teaching method: \u201cYou take notes, you\u2019re able to study and think about it.\u201d These days, Ms. Wallace attends the 8 a.m. service, an hour\u2019s train ride from her home in Battery Park City. \u201cYou get your message in, and then you have your day.\u201dMr. Bernard, who is the chief executive of his church, as well as its senior pastor (his six-figure salary is determined by a board), is at heart a practical evangelist. When it was reported in the run-up to the presidential election in 2012 that African-American ministers were encouraging their congregations not to vote because of President Obama\u2019s position on gay marriage, Mr. Bernard bristled at being lumped into that group.\u201cLet me give you three powerful reasons why I would never tell my congregation not to vote: Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney,\u201d he told a reporter on MSNBC, referring to the young civil rights workers who were murdered in Mississippi in 1964. \u201cDon\u2019t let same-sex marriage be the deciding factor.\u201d He went on to give a meticulous, and theologically agile, mini-lecture on the separation of church and state, on why same-sex marriage is a civil rights issue and how his own faith nonetheless requires that he obey its tenets.Last year, when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage, Mr. Bernard delivered a sermon about how societal norms and laws change over time. \u201cI used the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit as one example,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the law, but most people are doing 65, so that\u2019s the norm. If they hit 95, which is the extreme, the police will pull them over. Over time, cultural practices can move from extreme to norm to law.\u201dChange is a process, not an event, he likes to say.This election year has come with its own challenges. In June, when Donald J. Trump\u2019s team invited a group of evangelicals to advise the candidate, Mr. Bernard was among them. Mr. Bernard has since stepped away from that role, he said, because he felt more like \u201cwindow dressing,\u201d as he put it, than a genuine adviser. The two had met years ago, weirdly, at Maya Angelou\u2019s 80th birthday party, where Mr. Bernard was the keynote speaker; the setting was Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, which perhaps explains the unlikely pairing of that presidential hopeful with the poet and civil right activist.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to advise you,\u201d Mr. Bernard said, \u201cit\u2019s because I\u2019m going to really, genuinely advise you. O.K., politics is a weird game, I get it. But when I found out that no matter what we were saying, he continued the same path, I said: \u2018You know what? I need to step back and remain neutral.\u2019\u201dMs. Bernard, with typical candor, said, \u201cI never met Trump, but Trump just has issues, and it\u2019s obvious he has issues.\u201dTwo weeks ago, when Elena George, a celebrity makeup artist, was preparing Donna Brazile, the veteran political analyst now serving as interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, for her role on CNN\u2019s round table after the first presidential debate, they phoned Mr. Bernard to join them in a prayer. \u201cI told Donna, \u2018We need reinforcement,\u2019\u201d Ms. George recalled.\u201cHe quoted scripture,\u201d Ms. Brazile said. \u201cAnd it was helpful.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zenefits, a Rocket That Fell to Earth, Tries to Launch Again", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTrying to turn around a failing technology company is almost always a futile task \u2014 just ask Marissa Mayer at Yahoo or whoever it is who now runs BlackBerry.But the challenge becomes even more daunting if your company is afflicted by something deeper than a mere implosion of its business. If the company you\u2019re rebuilding has been racked by questions about its ethics and culture, and if on some fundamental level it became derelict in its integrity, well, good luck trying to get that turkey to fly.Mr. Sacks has since pushed a series of reforms that have essentially remade Zenefits. In the last few weeks, billboards across Silicon Valley have posed a cryptic question: \u201cWhat is Z2?\u201d The answer, as the San Francisco company will reveal at an event next week, is a redesign of Zenefits\u2019s software and the introduction of several new features that Mr. Sacks says will collectively signal a rebirth of its corporate image.\u201cThis will be the month where we close the chapter on all that stuff, we move past it and we launch the future of the company,\u201d Mr. Sacks said.Yet Mr. Sacks\u2019s efforts to resurrect Zenefits highlight the difficulty of conjuring up second chances in tech. By all accounts, the new chief executive has mounted an unconventionally aggressive plan to tackle Zenefits\u2019s challenges. But even doing everything right may not be enough.In the months that Zenefits has been rebuilding itself, a spate of competitors have set their sights on its business. One of them, a well-financed start-up called Gusto, has put ethics and culture at the core of its appeal, and it has been scooping up disaffected Zenefits customers.\u201cTo borrow a quote from a different context, \u2018When someone goes low, we go high,\u2019\u201d Joshua Reeves, one of Gusto\u2019s founders and its chief executive, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s about trust. And when you endanger that trust, it\u2019s hard to rebuild it.\u201dNow the two companies are racing to lead a multibillion market. In a recent interview that spanned several hours, Mr. Sacks explained in exacting detail everything he has done to fix Zenefits, and argued that the company still has the inside track on what could be the next great software bonanza. It sounded convincing \u2014 but many of his points are echoed by Mr. Reeves of Gusto.Gusto\u2019s and Zenefits\u2019s business may sound boring: Both are trying to become the primary human resources dashboard for small businesses, companies that hire a few to a couple of hundred workers. For years, small companies have been neglected by traditional software providers for a simple reason: They don\u2019t have a lot of money to spend on software.The internet has altered that calculus. Zenefits and Gusto, which charge subscriptions for some of their services, are relying on the vast scale and technical efficiencies enabled by the online cloud to make serving tiny companies feasible. Their success could alter the way millions of American businesses manage, pay and provide benefits to tens of millions of workers.Faced with investigations by regulators and outrage from investors and customers, another chief executive might have sought to minimize the fallout from Zenefits\u2019s problems. But Mr. Sacks pushed an unusual counterstrategy for rehabilitation, one he sums up with a simple mantra: \u201cAdmit, fix, settle and repeat.\u201dIt\u2019s tempting to dismiss Zenefits\u2019s new ethos as mere survival; everyone who gets caught suddenly finds religion, you might say. But Zenefits\u2019s most important constituency, its regulators, appear to believe in its sincerity.In April, Joshua Stein, the company\u2019s chief compliance officer, made an impassioned plea to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, arguing that Zenefits had seen the errors of its ways and deserved a second chance. Mr. Sacks called the speech a turning point for the firm. Eight states have settled with Zenefits so far, and more settlements are on the way.There is an irony to Zenefits\u2019s reformation: In altering the company\u2019s culture, Mr. Sacks has pushed Zenefits to become much more like its biggest rival. Compared to Zenefits\u2019s once-freewheeling, highflying sensibility, Gusto has always operated closer to earth. Where Zenefits pushed for nationwide expansion and invested millions of dollars in a sales staff to encourage rapid growth, Gusto sought to escape what Mr. Reeves calls the \u201cSilicon Valley hype cycle growth curve.\u201dHe favored a slower, more deliberate growth plan, encouraging a corporate culture that he said prized long-term sustainability. Though the two companies are just blocks apart from each other in San Francisco, in their early years each one felt like a universe apart.At Zenefits, the sensibility was one of a boiler room \u2014 packed to the gills, every employee on the phone, all of them cheering every sales goal. By contrast, Gusto\u2019s office has the air of a meditative retreat. There are plants, couches and people chatting in hushed tones. Shoes are not allowed in the office, to make it feel more like home than work.Mr. Reeves told me that Zenefits\u2019s \u201cimplosion\u201d had been a boon to Gusto. \u201cI used to have to spend a lot of time making sure that the team and our investors were not distracted by the attention they were getting,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when things came to light, it made it easier \u2014 because our internal conversations about their shortcuts were proved true.\u201dMr. Sacks dismissed the idea that Zenefits had imploded. Most customers have stuck with Zenefits despite its shortcomings, he said, and he predicted that the unveiling of the product next week would win back everyone else and then some. In other words, now that Zenefits\u2019s culture is cleaned up, the company is once again ready to take on the world.He made it sound easy. But turnarounds usually aren\u2019t.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "$1.6 Million Bill Tests Tiny Town and \u2018Bulletproof\u2019 Public Pensions", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byUntil the certified letters from Sacramento started coming last month, Loyalton, Calif., was just another hole in the wall \u2014 a fading town of just over 700 that had not made much news since the gold rush of 1849. Its lifeblood, a sawmill, closed in 2001, wiping out jobs, paychecks and just about any reason an outsider might have had for giving Loyalton a second glance.\u201cIt\u2019s a walking ghost town,\u201d said Don Russell, editor of the 163-year-old Mountain Messenger, a local newspaper that refuses, fittingly, to publish on the web.But then came those letters, thrusting Loyalton onto center stage of America\u2019s public pension drama. The California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or Calpers, said Loyalton had 30 days to hand over $1.6 million, more than its entire annual budget, to fund the pensions of its four retirees. Otherwise, Loyalton stood to become the first place in California \u2014 perhaps in the nation \u2014 where a powerful state retirement system cut retirees\u2019 pensions because their town was a deadbeat.\u201cI worked all those years, and they did this to me,\u201d said Patsy Jardin, 71, who kept the town\u2019s books for 29 years, then retired in 2004 on an annual pension of about $48,000. Now, because of Loyalton\u2019s troubles, Calpers could cut it to about $19,000.\u201cI couldn\u2019t live on it \u2014 no way,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t go back to work. I\u2019m 71 years old. Who\u2019s going to hire me?\u201dPublic pensions are supposed to be bulletproof, because cities \u2014 unlike companies \u2014 seldom go bankrupt, and states never do. Of all the states, experts say, California has the most protective pension laws and legal precedents. Once public workers join Calpers, state courts have ruled, their employers must fund their pensions for the rest of their careers, even if the cost was severely underestimated at the outset \u2014 something that has happened in California and elsewhere.Across the country, many benefits were granted at the height of the 1990s bull market on the faulty assumption that investments would keep climbing and cover most of the cost. And that flawed premise is now hitting home in places like Loyalton.There and elsewhere, local taxpayers are paying more and more, and some elected officials say they want to get off the escalator. But Calpers is strict, telling its 3,007 participating governments and agencies how much they must contribute each year and going after them if they fail to do so. Even municipal bankruptcy is not an excuse.The showdown in Loyalton is raising the possibility that California\u2019s pension promise is not absolute. There may be government backstops for bank failures, insurance collapses and pensions owed to workers by bankrupt airlines and steel mills \u2014 but not, apparently, for the retirees of a shrinking town.\u201cThe State of California is not responsible for a public agency\u2019s unfunded liabilities,\u201d said Wayne Davis, Calpers\u2019s chief of public affairs. Nor is Calpers willing to play Robin Hood, taking a little more from wealthy communities like Palo Alto or Malibu to help luckless Loyalton. And if it gave a break to one, other struggling communities would surely ask for the same thing, setting up a domino effect.Loyalton \u2014 which sits in a rural area of Northern California near the Nevada border, less than an hour\u2019s drive from Reno \u2014 severed ties with Calpers three years ago. It has no labor contracts to break. Though the town is not bankrupt, its finances are in disarray: It recovered more than $400,000 after a municipal employee caught embezzling was fired. But a recent audit found yet another shortfall of more than $80,000.\u201cIf a city doesn\u2019t have the funds to pay, it\u2019s just completely unclear how the legal plumbing would work,\u201d Mr. McGee said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would happen if the retirees sued.\u201dThe retirees say they are open to filing a suit but cannot afford to hire lawyers for a titanic legal clash with Calpers.\u201cNobody does squat for you with Calpers,\u201d said John Cussins, Loyalton\u2019s retired maintenance foreman, who now serves on the City Council. \u201cI contacted every agency possible. To me, it\u2019s just unbelievable that there isn\u2019t some kind of help out there with the legal side of things. It leaves us at the mercy of the city and Calpers.\u201dMr. Cussins said he had a severe stroke last year and was recently told he had Parkinson\u2019s disease. He needs continuing care and said he might not be able to afford his health insurance if his pension were cut. Every time the pension issue comes up at City Council meetings, he is told to leave because, as a retiree, he is deemed to have a conflict of interest.\u201cI\u2019d like to see somebody go to jail for this,\u201d he said.Calpers has total assets of $290 billion, so an unpaid bill of $1.6 million would hardly be a deathblow. But if Calpers gave one struggling city a free ride, others might try the same thing, causing political problems. Palo Alto may have lots of money, but its taxpayers still do not want to pay retirees who once plowed the snow or picked up the trash in far-off Loyalton.\u201cI think this is all about precedent setting,\u201d Mr. McGee said.In September, Calpers sent \u201cfinal demand\u201d letters to Loyalton and two other entities, the Niland Sanitary District and the California Fairs Financing Authority. The Niland Sanitary District has struggled with bill collections, and the fairs financing authority was disbanded several years ago when the state cut its funding. Both entities stopped sending their required contributions to Calpers in 2013 but have continued to allow Calpers to administer their pension plans.In Loyalton, the City Council voted in 2012 to drop out of Calpers, hoping to save the $30,000 a year or more that the town had previously sent in, said Pat Whitley, a former mayor and a City Council member. (She is not one of the four Loyalton retirees but earned a Calpers pension through previous work on the Sierra County Board of Supervisors.)\u201cAll our audits said that our benefits were going to break the city,\u201d Ms. Whitley said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why we decided to withdraw. We decided it would be a perfect time to get out, because everybody was retired.\u201dLoyalton did not plan to offer pensions to new workers, she said. And it had been paying its required yearly contributions to Calpers, so officials thought its pension plan must be close to fully funded.That is why Calpers sent Loyalton the bill for $1.6 million.\u201cI never dreamed it was going to be that, ever. Ever!\u201d Ms. Whitley said. \u201cIt defies logic, really.\u201dMs. Whitley said Calpers had snared Loyalton in a Catch-22. The agency would not tell the town the cost of terminating its contract until the contract was ended, she said. But once that was done, it was too late to go back.\u201cWe were very confused about why we owe $1.6 million, and why didn\u2019t they tell us that before we signed all the papers,\u201d she said.Mr. Davis, the Calpers spokesman, said that since 2011, Calpers had been giving its member municipalities a \u201chypothetical termination liability\u201d in their annual actuarial reports, so there was little excuse for not knowing.Ms. Whitley disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s just too confusing,\u201d she said. \u201cI looked at what\u2019s been happening with all the other entities, and I saw that eventually it\u2019s got to collapse. It\u2019s almost like a Ponzi scheme.\u201dThe bill was due immediately, but Loyalton did not pay it. It has been accruing 7.5 percent annual interest ever since.Meanwhile, Calpers has continued to pay Loyalton\u2019s four retirees their pensions. But at a Calpers board meeting in September, some trustees said it was time to find Loyalton in default and cut the pensions. The board is expected to make a final decision at its next meeting, in November.In Loyalton, Mr. Cussins, the retiree and City Council member, said he was so frustrated about being barred from the council\u2019s pension discussions that he and another former town worker drove to Sacramento to attend Calpers\u2019s last board meeting.The trustees were cordial, he said, but they held out little hope.\u201cWe had a bunch of them come and shake our hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018We need some guidance.\u2019 They told us the city could apply to get back into Calpers next spring. But they made it very clear that they will not allow the city to get back into Calpers until that $1.6 million is paid.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Donald Trump\u2019s Big Tax Break Might Buy", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhat would, say, a half-billion dollars do for the well-being of the American people?Such a huge loss would be worth a lot of money to a top 1 percenter like Mr. Trump. Assuming he used it to the fullest \u2014 as he has boasted he has \u2014 avoiding taxes on $50 million of income a year over 18 years, he would have saved almost $400 million in federal taxes in today\u2019s money. Deploying the deduction against New York\u2019s state and local income taxes would have produced savings of another $150 million.Mr. Trump and his surrogates on the campaign trail have portrayed such maneuvering as a sign of accounting genius, a crucial skill for a future president to have. Yet perhaps the most relevant question, considering Mr. Trump\u2019s ambition to the highest office in the land, is what did his fellow Americans lose in exchange for his gain?Half a billion dollars over 18 years would not be enough to plug the budget deficit or rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. But it is definitely real money.Consider Mr. Trump\u2019s tax savings. Half a billion dollars would finance housing vouchers for more than 40,000 families with children, at just under $10,000 a family. It would fund more than 50,000 slots for the Head Start program, which costs about $8,700 a child.It would pay the unemployment insurance benefits of more than 60,000 Americans getting the average weekly check of $300 for six months. Or it would cover the average food stamp benefit of $126 a month for more than 300,000 people for an entire year.The federal and state governments spent $11.3 billion in child care subsidies in 2014, a 12-year low, according to the Center for Law and Social Policy. Another $500 million would provide support for an additional 75,000 children, freeing thousands of low-income parents to go to school or enter the labor force.And yet Mr. Trump\u2019s proud dodge should draw attention to one of America\u2019s most damaging weaknesses: The nation does not manage to provide its people with a minimum standard of well-being, something commonplace across the rest of the industrial world.The United States scores depressingly low compared with other advanced countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A baby girl born in the United States today is expected to live four fewer years than one born in Italy or South Korea. One in five American children lives in a poor home. In Norway, fewer than one in 20 do. For every 100,000 American children, 33 die before they turn 20. That\u2019s 12 more than in Britain. And American teenagers have babies at four times the rate of teenagers in Spain.What\u2019s going on? On average, Americans are among the richest people in the world. The problem is that too many of them have been left out of that prosperity. And the American government has simply not had the wherewithal to lend a hand.A preschool student at the North Idaho College Head Start school Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. Mr. Trump\u2019s tax savings could have funded more than 50,000 slots for the Head Start program, at about $8,700 a child.Contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that the United States is one of the most heavily taxed nations, only South Korea, Chile and Mexico, among O.E.C.D. countries, collect less in tax revenue as a share of the economy. That means the American budget for things like prenatal care, low-income housing and worker training is simply not up to the task.President Obama has tried hard to draw more resources for the federal government by raising the top rate of taxes paid by rich people like Mr. Trump. He forced Congress to increase the top income tax rate for high-income Americans from 35 percent back to 39.6 percent, where it was under President Bill Clinton. He imposed a small tax on the wealthy to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured.Still, total federal tax revenue in 2015 amounted to only 18.3 percent of the nation\u2019s G.D.P. That is less than Washington collected in the 1950s. Federal taxes on individuals generated just 8.7 percent of gross domestic product, well below the peak of 9.9 percent 15 years earlier.In this context, Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting \u201cgenius\u201d adds up, for the nation, to an existential threat.The large and growing share of income flowing to the very wealthiest Americans \u2014 those who routinely deploy high-price professionals and sophisticated financial engineering to keep the taxman at bay \u2014 poses a simple question:Are those who have benefited the most from the economy\u2019s bounty prepared to do anything more to improve the nation\u2019s meager social standing and allow their fellow citizens to share in America\u2019s riches?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lewd Donald Trump Tape Is a Breaking Point for Many in the G.O.P.", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byThe list of party figures publicly rejecting Mr. Trump included a host of prominent elected officials, perhaps most notably Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 nominee.\u201cI thought it important I respect the fact that Donald Trump won a majority of the delegates by the rules our party set,\u201d Mr. McCain said in a statement. \u201cBut Donald Trump\u2019s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.\u201dAnd in an unheard-of rebuke by a running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, declined to appear on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf at a party gathering in Wisconsin and offered him something of an ultimatum on Saturday afternoon.\u201cI do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,\u201d Mr. Pence said, adding, \u201cWe pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night.\u201dBy Saturday evening, no fewer than 36 Republican members of Congress and governors who had not previously ruled out supporting Mr. Trump disavowed his candidacy, an unprecedented desertion by the institutional Republican Party of its own standard-bearer just a month before Election Day.The growing wall of opposition recalled the determination of the party establishment this year to deny Mr. Trump the nomination in the first place. He easily swatted away that effort, but Mr. Trump now finds himself in a far more precarious state. Facing a more vast and diverse electorate, his lightly organized campaign was already listing before the videotape was released.In a brief telephone interview on Saturday, he shrugged off the calls to leave, saying he would \u201cnever drop out of this race in a million years.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from anyone saying I should drop out, and that would never happen, never happen,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of person I am. I am in this until the end.\u201dFar from sounding rattled, Mr. Trump insisted that he could still prevail in November.\u201cOh, yeah, we can win \u2014 we will win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tremendous support. I think a lot of people underestimate how loyal my supporters are.\u201dWhich statements caused Republicans to bail on Donald Trump.A couple of hours later, the campaign released a statement from his wife, Melania. \u201cThe words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis does not represent the man that I know.\u201d\u201cI hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world,\u201d she said.But the situation had grown so dire that many in the party were all but pleading with him to withdraw and let Mr. Pence serve as the presidential nominee. On Saturday afternoon, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Republican Conference, became the most senior Republican to call on Mr. Trump to make way for Mr. Pence.The exodus began late Friday night when a handful of Utah Republicans who said they would support Mr. Trump indicated that they could no longer tolerate their nominee.But it was not until a pair of conservative women, Representatives Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Martha Roby of Alabama, implored Mr. Trump to withdraw that previously hesitant Republicans stepped forward to reject Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire was the first Republican senator facing a competitive re-election to say she would no longer back Mr. Trump, announcing in a statement that she would write in Mr. Pence for president instead.How the two top Republicans in Congress have responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.Ms. Ayotte was joined just hours later by Mr. McCain, who is also running for re-election, and Representative Joe Heck of Nevada, who is locked in a close race for the Senate seat now held by Harry Reid, the Democratic minority leader, who is retiring.It was an admission that Mr. Trump now posed an immediate threat to their own candidacies and that, to have any chance to survive, they had to risk angering his ardent supporters. At a party gathering on Saturday in Wisconsin, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had disinvited Mr. Trump and said he was \u201csickened\u201d by the video, was greeted with a few boos, and Mr. Heck was both jeered and applauded when he announced to a crowd in Nevada that he was not backing the presidential nominee.Mr. Ryan told his crowd he would not be discussing \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d the 2005 video showing a bus that had Mr. Trump aboard, and included an audio recording of him privately bantering with other men.Mr. Trump, then newly married to Ms. Trump, crassly boasted about groping women\u2019s genitals, vulgarly commented on their bodies and generally described women as sex objects who could not resist his advances.In his video statement released early Saturday, Mr. Trump said: \u201cAnyone who knows me knows these words don\u2019t reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.\u201d\u201cI pledge to be a better man tomorrow and will never, ever let you down,\u201d he added, before ending the message with a promise to bring up the sex scandals of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency and Hillary Clinton\u2019s response to them.Inside Trump Tower, though, Mr. Trump\u2019s defiant public responses belied the reality of a 24-hour period in which he was alternately angry and distressed, according to two people with direct knowledge of his behavior who were granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, initially expressed skepticism upon hearing that such a recording existed, saying those comments did not sound like him. When Mr. Trump heard the tape played, he acknowledged it was him, but he believed the fallout would not be dramatic.Mr. Pence, however, was dismayed, and called into Trump headquarters on Friday night to urge Mr. Trump to apologize.On Saturday morning, Mr. Pence called Mr. Trump and told him he had to handle the next 48 hours alone because he did not think he would be an effective surrogate.Mr. Trump, after monitoring television coverage, realized he was becoming isolated by his party.\u201cAmerica is finally fed up and disgusted with its political elite,\u201d they said. \u201cTrump is channeling this disgust, and those among the political elite who quake before the boombox of media blather do not appreciate the apocalyptic choice that America faces on Nov. 8.\u201dTwo of Mr. Trump\u2019s most prominent supporters \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York \u2014 went to Trump Tower around noon to huddle with Mr. Trump and try to get in some debate preparation.18 PhotosJust before 5 p.m., Mr. Trump emerged for about five minutes, briskly striding through his gilded lobby to a waiting crowd of supporters on the sidewalk. He pumped his right fist in the air as fans surrounded him.\u201cHundred percent,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters who yelled questions about whether he would stay in the race.Mr. Pence flew from Indianapolis to a fund-raising event in Rhode Island, where he told supporters that the election was about more than \u201cone man,\u201d said Joseph A. Trillo, the chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in the state. Over hors d\u2019oeuvres in a Newport mansion, Mr. Pence offered a pep talk without making direct mention of the day\u2019s dire events.\u201cHe used the terminology that it\u2019s a movement and it\u2019s bigger than Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Trillo said.At the same time, leading Republicans were demanding that the Republican National Committee, which has been helping the Trump campaign financially and organizationally, abandon Mr. Trump and turn its attention to salvaging other candidates down the ballot.Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, said the committee should no longer \u201cdefend the indefensible.\u201dHe called on Reince Priebus, the party chairman, to force Mr. Trump off the ticket \u2014 or face the consequences.\u201cThe chairman of the R.N.C. must look out for the good of the party as a whole, so he should be working to get him to step down,\u201d Mr. Dent said. \u201cIf he can\u2019t, then he should step down.\u201dThe committee remained silent on Saturday as members of Congress began fleeing from Mr. Trump, not responding to news media inquiries and, senior Republican officials said, not coordinating with other campaign organizations. However, one senior Republican official said Mr. Priebus was deeply distressed. He went to Trump Tower in the afternoon to talk to Mr. Trump.Powerful donors and business interests signaled that they would redirect their attention to down-ballot candidates. Republican power brokers had hoped until recently that Mr. Trump might make a credible showing in the presidential election, aiding the party in its other crucial races.But Republicans now say that their worst fears have come to pass, as Mr. Trump has unraveled in a series of missteps after his first debate with Mrs. Clinton.Even before Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 comments came to light, internal Republican polling showed him losing ground among three groups that had long been wary of his candidacy: independents, women, and voters with college degrees.That slide is likely to accelerate now, Republicans said, potentially sending voters fleeing toward Democrats or convincing them that they should stay home on Nov. 8. Either outcome would be ruinous for Republican candidates beyond the presidential race.\u201cIt will be difficult in the extreme for him to recover from this, but the biggest impact is likely to be its effect on all the down-ballot races,\u201d said Fred Malek, the finance chairman of the Republican Governors Association, who called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cbeyond disgusting.\u201d\u201cIf they pull the plug on support for Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cthe vast majority of voters will certainly understand that and most will respect it.\u201dJonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman from New York.

{"Headline": "Con Ed Says Plan to Install Rooftop Solar Panels Will Aid Poor New Yorkers", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byMore than 10,000 New York City residents are using solar power to reduce their electric bills. But hardly any of those people converting the sun\u2019s rays into savings are poor.The reason so few New Yorkers with low incomes are tapping into the power of the sun is not a lack of interest, but rather a lack of access, community activists say. Simply put, most poor New Yorkers \u2014 like many other city residents \u2014 do not have a roof of their own on which they could install solar panels, even if they could afford to do so.\u201cWe want to do our part to make sure that all of our customers have access to renewable energy, regardless of their income level,\u201d Matthew Ketschke, Con Edison\u2019s vice president for distributed resource integration, said. Mr. Ketschke added that he believed the proposal fit with the regulators\u2019 demand that utilities increase their use of renewable energy.Buffeted by gusting winds as he stood atop a warehouse in Astoria, Queens, Mr. Ketschke listed the obstacles blocking the poor from using solar power: They tend to live in apartments and to share an electric meter with other tenants. And those who live in houses or have access to a rooftop where solar panels could be installed often do not have the thousands of dollars it would cost for the installation or enough credit to finance it.Con Edison\u2019s idea could circumvent all of those hurdles, Mr. Ketschke said. The company has buildings all around the city and in some of its northern suburbs, enough roof space to hold solar panels that could produce as much as 11 megawatts of electricity, he said. That could result in savings of $5 a month for as many as 6,000 customers who qualify for financial help from the company, Mr. Ketschke said.That is a tiny fraction of Con Edison\u2019s three million electricity customers in the city and Westchester County, but it could have a larger symbolic value. The company wants to show that it is heeding an order issued last year by the state\u2019s Public Service Commission to allow communities to share sources of renewable energy.\u201cNew York City is burdened with some of the highest electricity rates in the country,\u201d Jeremy Friedman, coordinator of the Central Brooklyn Community Solar Program, said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely important to be looking at ways to bring renewables to low-income people. That really hasn\u2019t happened in New York City until now.\u201dThe low, flat top of Con Edison\u2019s expansive warehouse in the northwest corner of Queens would be ideal. The roof could hold several thousand panels, each of which measures about 3 feet by 6 feet and produces up to 250 watts of power.The power generated on the roof would be measured as it is fed into the local grid. Con Ed would determine its value, after accounting for the costs of the installation, and share it with customers who sign up for the pilot program.Mr. Ketschke said the company was prepared to put solar panels on top of other buildings, including offices, substations and garages. The first installations could be in use by the end of next year, he said. Con Edison has installed panels on a roof of its headquarters near Union Square in Manhattan, but it uses the power generated there to provide electricity to the building.Only about 200 of the more than 10,000 Con Edison customers who generate their own solar power qualify as low-income, said Christopher Raup, director of Con Edison\u2019s Utility of the Future group. Low-income customers receive a discount of $9.50 on their monthly electric bills, he said.Con Edison\u2019s proposal requires approval from the state commission in part because the company would own the solar panels. Generally, utilities that distribute electricity in New York are prohibited from owning sources of power generation.Mr. Friedman, whose program has been helping older homeowners in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, band together for bulk discounts on solar panels, said he approved of the proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to really level the playing field by opening up these really great sunny roofs.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cit\u2019s not just an altruistic idea.\u201dHe said Con Edison was grappling with surging demand for power in booming parts of the city and would benefit from having more sources to draw from in times of peak demand. \u201cThey have a statutory need to figure out how to manage demand differently,\u201d Mr. Friedman said, \u201cespecially across large swaths of Brooklyn and Queens.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "N.J. Transit Getting Scrutiny and Pledges of Aid for Its Problems", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byState lawmakers in New Jersey moved on Friday to hold hearings focused on investigating the problems plaguing New Jersey Transit, and a top federal official announced that a key project meant to improve the railroad\u2019s service was moving forward.The official, Anthony Foxx, the federal transportation secretary, said that the process of lining up grants and loans to pay for the project, a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, had started.\u201cTo use a football analogy, we\u2019ve carried the ball to the 50-yard line,\u201d Mr. Foxx said, urging local leaders to take the next steps toward starting construction.After state lawmakers criticized the state-run agency at a news conference in Trenton on Friday, Gov. Chris Christie announced that he had signed legislation raising New Jersey\u2019s gasoline tax by 23 cents a gallon to pay for transportation projects, including those involving New Jersey Transit. He also ended a statewide shutdown of most transportation work he ordered over the summer.The gas tax increase, part of a deal reached by Mr. Christie, a Republican, and Democratic leaders last month, takes effect on Nov. 1.Stephen M. Sweeney, the State Senate president, said lawmakers would hold a hearing next week to investigate New Jersey Transit\u2019s many problems, including its failure to install technology that can stop a speeding train automatically. The agency\u2019s new executive director, Steven Santoro, would be invited to testify.\u201cAn agency that was a national model with a bright future seven years ago is now suffering from years of neglect, chronic underfunding, questionable decision-making, including poor preparations for Hurricane Sandy,\u201d he said. Nearly one-fourth of the railroad\u2019s fleet was damaged during the 2012 storm.Also on Friday, several members of Congress sent a letter to Mr. Foxx in which they raised concerns about The Times\u2019s findings and asked for details about safety violations uncovered by a recent Federal Railroad Administration audit of New Jersey Transit.Leaders of the State Assembly are considering the use of subpoenas to require officials to testify and to collect documents.\u201cThe public and the state\u2019s economic vitality depend on N.J. Transit to fulfill its mission, but the public has lost confidence in the agency\u2019s ability to operate safely and efficiently,\u201d said the Assembly speaker, Vincent Prieto, a Democrat.Asked on Friday about New Jersey Transit\u2019s ability to lead the environmental review for the proposed Hudson tunnel, Mr. Foxx said the agency had been a \u201cgood partner\u201d on the project so far. He was joined by officials from Amtrak and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who are working together on plans for the tunnel and other infrastructure improvements as part of a larger project known as the Gateway program that could cost more than $20 billion.Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and a key supporter of the Gateway project, said construction on a new tunnel could begin in 2019 and could take four to five years to complete. Mr. Schumer pledged to do everything he could to secure federal financing for the project and suggested that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, would support the tunnel if she was elected.The project, which is likely to be paid for with a combination of federal grants and loans, was accepted this summer into a pipeline for federal grants known as New Starts funding, Mr. Foxx said. The environmental study is also being expedited, he added.Patrick J. Foye, the Port Authority\u2019s executive director, said the tunnel project had the support of the agency, as well as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, and Mr. Christie. The agency\u2019s board plans to discuss the Gateway project at a meeting next week, he said.The Port Authority board is expected to consider approving $300 million for the Portal Bridge project, according to an official who was familiar with the plans but was not authorized to discuss them publicly.About six years ago, Mr. Christie canceled an earlier plan to build a tunnel under the Hudson.Asked whether the current proposal might be similarly thwarted, Mr. Schumer said that he had faith in Mr. Christie and Mr. Cuomo and that anyone who stood in the way would face \u201cdramatic consequences.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re making sure,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is no one who can kill it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scotland Embraces Gay Politicians in a Profound Cultural Shift", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byIn the span of a generation, Scotland has shed much of its traditional social conservatism and enthusiastically embraced diversity in sexuality, a process led and reinforced by a remarkable transformation in its political culture.Homosexuality was illegal in Scotland until 1980 \u2014 in England it was decriminalized in 1967 \u2014 and as recently as 2000, billboards financed by a Christian millionaire campaigning to uphold a ban on schools\u2019 talking about homosexuality urged Scots to \u201cProtect Our Children.\u201dToday, in addition to the leaders of three of the five major political parties in Scotland, four ministers in the Scottish government are openly gay, as is the secretary of state for Scotland in Britain\u2019s Conservative government. The one elected representative of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party in Scotland is gay, too.Of the 129 members of the Scottish Parliament, a legislative assembly with far-reaching autonomy from London, 10, or nearly 8 percent, identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, by one tally the highest known proportion for a national legislature anywhere.But the shift in Scotland has also reflected trends closer to home. Scotland\u2019s Parliament is young. Established in 1999 as part of a deal to devolve more power from London, it has given a platform to a new generation that grew up with greater tolerance about sexuality; has made politicians, because they are in Edinburgh, more accessible to interest groups like L.G.B.T. advocates; and has injected new energy and pride into Scottish politics. In turn, the openly gay politicians who have emerged since then have helped champion L.G.B.T. rights.\u201cIt\u2019s a big cultural shift,\u201d said Ms. Dugdale, who became engaged to her girlfriend this summer. \u201cWhen you say you\u2019re gay, people just shrug their shoulders. There is almost a feeling of \u2018so what?\u2019\u201dScotland has long voted to the ideological left of England. It was a stronghold of the Labour Party before Scottish voters switched to the even more left-wing Scottish National Party, now the dominant political force. But a mix of Calvinism and Catholicism meant that on issues like abortion, divorce and homosexuality, Scotland remained more conservative than England for decades. The Scottish nationalists were once known as the \u201cTartan Tories.\u201dNow they are the third-largest party in the British Parliament in London, and eight of their 56 members of Parliament are openly gay, bisexual or lesbian, a higher proportion than in the other main parties.\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be the leader of the gayest parliamentary group in the world,\u201d Angus Robertson, the (straight) deputy leader of the Scottish National Party, declared this month. His campaign manager, Nathan Sparling, regularly performs in drag at G-A-Y, one of London\u2019s best-known gay clubs. At the party\u2019s annual conference in Glasgow this month, Mr. Sparling hosted a karaoke night dressed up as his alter ego, Nancy Clench.Ms. Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives, a churchgoing Presbyterian who trained for Britain\u2019s Army Reserve and once cheerfully described herself as a \u201cflat-shoed, shovel-faced lesbian,\u201d cut her hair shorter than it had ever been when she first ran for office. \u201cI wanted to make sure people knew what they were getting,\u201d she said.Since then, five other Scottish Conservative Party politicians have come out, her partner has appeared with her in campaign broadcasts, and her party overtook the Labour Party as the main opposition party in Scotland for the first time. The church she attends flies a rainbow flag on its communion table.\u201cWe\u2019ve come a very, very long way in a really short time,\u201d she said.There is still more to do, Ms. Davidson and others said. Bullying in schools remains a problem, particularly for transgender teenagers. Hate crimes against L.G.B.T. people are up by 20 percent over the past year, according to Stonewall Scotland, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group, although that also reflects the fact that reporting rates have increased.But the changes in politics, policy and culture have been striking.One of the first things lawmakers did after the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 was to repeal legislation barring schools from \u201cpromoting homosexuality,\u201d a law that had effectively muffled any discussion of L.G.B.T. issues in schools. It was an ugly fight, with homophobic slogans splashed across front pages and billboards as parts of the national press teamed up with the Roman Catholic church and Brian Souter, a wealthy Scottish businessman, to fight the repeal. But in the end, they lost.\u201cIt was the last gasp of conservative Scotland,\u201d said David Torrance, an author and journalist, who is a respected political commentator and also gay.Since then, Scotland has legalized civil partnerships, gay adoption and, in 2014, same-sex marriage (known in Scotland as \u201cequal marriage\u201d because it allows for entirely gender-neutral ceremonies). Scottish hate-crime law, which explicitly includes prejudice against transgender and intersex people, is considered one of the most robust in the world. And now the government is considering changing its gender recognition law to accommodate those with a \u201cnonbinary\u201d identity, which is neither female nor male.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary: We have started a conversation about a genderless society,\u201d said Bob Orr, 66, who in 1982 co-opened Edinburgh\u2019s first lesbian and gay bookshop, Lavender Menace.That bookshop closed years ago, as have several gay bars. Gay people increasingly go to mainstream places, Mr. Orr said, and several singers in his \u201cL.G.B.T. choir\u201d are straight.\u201cThe boundaries are going,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was always the point \u2014 that sexuality ceases to matter.\u201dIndeed, one of Scotland\u2019s most prominent gay rights campaigners is straight: Liam Stevenson, a 38-year-old truck driver with a shaved head and soccer tattoo, led this year\u2019s Pride Parade in Glasgow for Time for Inclusive Education, a campaign for L.G.B.T.-inclusive education that he founded with a gay student.When their Parliament was created, 48 percent of Scots thought same-sex relationships were always or mostly wrong, according to the government\u2019s social attitudes survey. That share dropped to 18 percent in the most recent survey, published this month.And the world is beginning to take note. Andrew Brown, a gay wedding planner in Glasgow, said more gay couples from abroad were coming to Scotland to get married.It helps that the paperwork is so simple: \u201cScotland is a bit like Vegas,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who has recently organized weddings for Chinese, Italian and Canadian couples. A few years ago, he and his husband, Scott, were considering moving to Sydney, Australia. But they have decided to stay.Val McDermid, a Scottish crime writer, moved to England in 1979, when, she said, in Scotland \u201cjust meeting other lesbians took more planning and luck than climbing Ben Nevis,\u201d Scotland\u2019s highest mountain. She returned two years ago.A picture caption on Oct. 23 with an article about Scotland\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of diversity in sexuality in the space of a generation erroneously attributed a distinction to Susan and Gerrie Douglas-Scott. They were among the first gay Scots to marry under Scottish law, but not necessarily the first; several couples have claims to that distinction.Follow Katrin Bennhold on Twitter @kbennholdAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ammon Bundy Case as Inkblot Test: What Will Jurors See in His Words?", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byBut he is still talking. And talking.\u201cI still believe very strongly that what we did was the right thing, and that it was legal,\u201d he told the court.A kind of inkblot study of Mr. Bundy in psychological profile has become a central thread of the criminal case against him, his brother Ryan and five of their followers on felony conspiracy charges in connection with the armed takeover of the refuge. For the 12-member jury, that river of words \u2014 in the testimony and in the videos and news interviews during and before the occupation \u2014 is the means through which it is coming to know him.What the jurors make of him \u2014 and whether his steadfast beliefs come across as arrogance or sincerity \u2014 could decide his fate when they start deliberating this month.At one point during his testimony, Mr. Bundy compared himself to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who also had to take a \u201chard stand,\u201d Mr. Bundy said, for what he believed.And he said his Mormon faith had informed and fueled his determination to defend \u201cthe people\u201d against incursion and overreach by the federal government in Western land policies.He dismissed the idea \u2014 central to the main criminal charges against him \u2014 that the takeover had kept federal workers from doing their jobs. Being armed throughout the occupation of the refuge, he added, was a tool to get people\u2019s attention and was never meant to harm anyone.\u201cThis has nothing to do with refuge employees or their duties,\u201d he said under questioning by his lawyer, Marcus R. Mumford. The Constitution, Mr. Bundy said, at one point grabbing the copy that jutted prominently from his front shirt pocket, is the sole reason he acted.\u201cThis was bigger than any of us,\u201d he said.In his brief cross-examination, Ethan D. Knight, an assistant United States attorney, suggested that Mr. Bundy had benefited from a federal program and might not be the philosophical purist of strictly limited government that he seemed. Was it not true, Mr. Knight asked, that Mr. Bundy\u2019s business had been financed by a $530,000 loan from the Small Business Administration? Mr. Bundy said that he had sought no such loan and that the small bank he had gone to had arranged it.Was it not true, Mr. Knight said, that having people armed during the refuge takeover was all about keeping the government from trying to take it back?No, Mr. Bundy said, the armed people \u201cprotected us from being attacked,\u201d though he conceded that without the weaponry, the occupation would have quickly ended.In the current case, which began here in September, Judge Anna J. Brown, in her rulings and instructions to the jury, has further sharpened the trial\u2019s focus on the interior lives of the defendants \u2014 their state of mind, as she has put it. The most serious count in the indictment \u2014 a conspiracy to impede federal employers from completing their duties, punishable by up to six years in prison \u2014 also centers on questions of planning and intent in the decisions to take over the refuge and then hold it.But the judge has also strictly told the defendants and their lawyers that they cannot assert those beliefs to the jurors as truth about federal government land policies, the Constitution or anything else. Out of the jury\u2019s presence, she has flatly said that some of those beliefs are wrong \u2014 notably that two members of a ranching family who live near the refuge were charged as \u201cterrorists\u201d by the government in an arson case.The two ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond \u2014 a father and son \u2014 were convicted of arson and sentenced, Judge Brown said, under a statute that included an antiterrorism provision but was not aimed purely at prosecuting terrorists; she read a legal instruction to the jurors reflecting that distinction as the Hammond case came up in witness testimony.The terrorism claim about the Hammonds was a major rallying cry of the protesters at the Malheur refuge, underscoring, as many of them said at the time, the idea that federal authority was clamping down on dissent and that ranchers in particular were being targeted.In a comment in open court but out of the jury\u2019s presence, Ryan Bundy, who is representing himself in the case, said he thought Judge Brown\u2019s instruction on the terrorism language was \u201cintended to make us look stupid.\u201d\u201cThe truth will come out,\u201d he added.Ammon Bundy, in his testimony, repeatedly talked about prayer and about how God had led him to take action in defense of liberty.\u201cI asked the Lord if he would clear my mind,\u201d he said at one point, describing a long night of study and contemplation before resolving to go to Oregon. And then it was all clear, he said. \u201cI did exactly what the Lord asked me to do,\u201d he said.Followers then had to ask themselves a related question, he said, not unlike the one faced by the jury. Everyone who heard a call to come to Oregon, he said, had to \u201cmake a decision right now whether this is a righteous cause or not, whether I am a crazy person.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Hamilton\u2019 and Heartache: Living the Unimaginable", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, helped create \u201cHamilton.\u201d But alongside that triumph came personal tragedy.Supported byOskar Eustis bounded into the middle of the square yellow carpet at the center of the small theater, ready to deliver his welcoming remarks, and stood in the only place he could: next to a coffin.Mr. Eustis, the exuberant 58-year-old artistic director of the Public Theater and arguably the most admired theater executive in the country, was in his element: It was late September, opening night of a production of \u201cHamlet\u201d from the branch of the Public that takes dramas to prisons and homeless shelters.The play began. Mr. Eustis\u2019s eyes welled up. There were tears when the ghost of the dead king cries out to his son, Hamlet; tears when Hamlet laments that he has \u201clost all my mirth\u201d; tears through \u201cTo be or not to be,\u201d the speech in which Hamlet considers ending his life.\u201cWatch \u2018Hamlet\u2019 tonight with this in mind,\u201d Mr. Eustis had urged over dinner just before the show, seated at his regular table at the Public\u2019s restaurant, photos of his family arrayed on the shelves overhead. \u201cThree years before he wrote \u2018Hamlet,\u2019 Shakespeare\u2019s only son died.\u201dMr. Eustis, whose theater oversees Shakespeare in the Park, had long known about the possible connection between the playwright\u2019s grief and his play, but it had new and unwanted resonance.His 16-year-old son, Jack, took his own life nearly two years ago. Now, Mr. Eustis, with his family, faces the kind of soul-searching for which there can be no preparation. How to hold on and move forward at the same time. What it means to be a public figure with a private grief. How he thinks about the work he does and the shows he sees.The tragedy coincided with a time of extraordinary success in Mr. Eustis\u2019s professional life: The Public was the Off Broadway birthplace of two groundbreaking new musicals, \u201cFun Home\u201d and the once-in-a-generation hit \u201cHamilton.\u201d Those very shows are propelled by tragic losses. But his is a life of theater, and immersing himself in theatermaking is the only path he knows to take.\u201cIt is the way I move in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like the place for me to work it out.\u201d\u201cYou guys all know what happened, and what I\u2019m going to do now is tell you my story,\u201d he recalled saying. \u201cAnd for 45 minutes, I told them the story. I said: \u2018Now this means that you know what I think. It\u2019s not a taboo subject \u2014 we can talk about it when we need to \u2014 but you never have to talk about it, because now we have.\u2019\u201dMr. Eustis is burly and bearded, with a generous hug and an easy cry. Cheerleader and counselor, impresario and guru \u2014 he will push and prod in a rehearsal room for greater clarity, deeper character, more truth. And then, come opening night, he will climb atop a bar or a table and dole out praise in poetically turned phrases that are somehow both sincere and superlative.\u201cHe cares about theater as deeply as anyone I\u2019ve ever met \u2014 this idea that you sit in the dark with a group of strangers and something galvanizing happens,\u201d said Thomas Kail, the director of \u201cHamilton,\u201d who this season will direct his third show at the Public. \u201cThat ritual of going to the theater is just part of his ethos and his soul, and you feel like you are a part of that when you sit in the theater with him.\u201dAs deft with Shakespeare as it is with contemporary drama, the nonprofit Public is a magnet for star performers (Anne Hathaway and Daniel Radcliffe, to name two) and laureled writers (coming soon: Stephen Sondheim). Its Astor Place headquarters, renovated under Mr. Eustis\u2019s watch, is alive and aglitter, night after night.Richard Nelson, whom Mr. Eustis has encouraged to pursue a stunningly intimate series of plays chronicling dinner table conversations at two family homes, describes Mr. Eustis as \u201ca life force\u201d and credits him with \u201can extraordinary sense of trust and collaboration with a playwright, unheard-of in my experience.\u201dSuzan-Lori Parks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \u201cTopdog/Underdog,\u201d lauds Mr. Eustis for \u201ca kind of generosity that is otherworldly, that is enormous, that is spiritual.\u201dThe theater world is an emotional community; pain is expressed and discussed and honored. But still, figuring out how to talk about his loss has been difficult for Mr. Eustis, who ultimately agreed to answer questions about his experience, and how it affects his thinking about theater and the challenges facing the Public, in a series of interviews over the last six months.An early test came at Jack\u2019s school, Saint Ann\u2019s in Brooklyn Heights, where Mr. Eustis had been teaching a class about the Public Theater itself. Two weeks after Jack died, he decided to return to the classroom.\u201cI knew it was going to be one thing or the other \u2014 it was either within five minutes I was going to have to get out of there, or I would find out what I did find out, which is that I loved being there, and I still feel that way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids \u2014 you could feel they wanted to be there for me, which was so moving.\u201dHe has leaned heavily for support on his wife, Laurie, and daughter, Kyle. As he has turned to the theater, Laurie has taken up writing poetry, and Kyle, 25, has begun directing. \u201cLaurie and Kyle and I are struggling with this together, and the main thing we have is our support for each other,\u201d he said. The family is often at the theater together; all three of them attended that \u201cHamlet\u201d opening.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how they navigated their way,\u201d said Jeanine Tesori, the \u201cFun Home\u201d composer. \u201cThey really are there to bear witness at openings and closings, often with very painful material to sit through, and yet, here they are, part of the circle.\u201dIt was a demo recording of \u201cIt\u2019s Quiet Uptown,\u201d the song from \u201cHamilton\u201d describing Alexander Hamilton, and his wife, Eliza, as they grieve the death of their 19-year-old son, Philip:\u201cThere is nothing you can say,\u201d Mr. Miranda recalled thinking. \u201cAnd yet, I had a song about this. So I wrote to him saying, \u2018If this is useful, then lean on it, and, if not, delete this email.\u2019\u201dMr. Eustis and his wife found it useful. \u201cEvery line of \u2018Quiet Uptown\u2019 feels like it\u2019s exactly correct to my experience,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cIt was the only music we listened to for a long time, and we listened to it every day, and it became a key thing for the two of us.\u201dThere is a part of \u201cHamilton\u201d that Mr. Eustis still finds unbearable, in the opening number, when a rapid description of Alexander Hamilton\u2019s childhood includes the lyric \u201cMoved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide,\u201d which is choreographed with a brief pantomime of the death.\u201cFrom the moment it happened in rehearsal, I\u2019ve turned away,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked at it.\u201dBut Mr. Eustis and Mr. Miranda both recall something else, too: The grieving father\u2019s reaction to a line of comic relief that, in the show\u2019s libretto, is uttered by Thomas Jefferson immediately after \u201cIt\u2019s Quiet Uptown\u201d: \u201cCan we get back to politics?\u201d\u201cFor me, the beautiful thing about \u2018Quiet Uptown\u2019 is, it serves a ritualistic function \u2014 it takes us into the grief, and then it takes us out of it,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s no other ritual that I know of, that can do that for me.\u201dMr. Miranda still remembers hearing Mr. Eustis\u2019s instinctive response. \u201cI\u2019ll treasure that laugh forever,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a big belly laugh of getting to stop crying.\u201dHe is midway through a contract with the Public that expires in 2018, so he must decide in the not-too-distant future whether to ask the board to extend his tenure, or to do something else (he especially loves teaching, which he does regularly at the Bread Loaf School of English in Vermont and at New York University).He has enormous support. \u201cI hope he sticks around forever,\u201d said Arielle Tepper Madover, the chairwoman of the Public\u2019s board.He also has ever more ambitious dreams and is excited about seeing them through. Presenting consistently excellent work and cultivating new voices, yes, but also expanding the Public\u2019s audience.His biggest, craziest idea \u2014 more a longstanding hope than a plan \u2014 is to make much of the theater\u2019s programming free, knowing that free shows attract audiences younger and more diverse than those that charge for tickets.\u201cPeople who tell you that there\u2019s not economic barriers to people participating in the theater are just not telling you the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are huge economic barriers.\u201dThe notion of free tickets is not as wild as it sounds; the Public, of course, already makes most tickets to its summertime Shakespeare in the Park series available free. And the Public is largely financed by philanthropy, not ticket sales.The Public has begun offering free tickets to the first preview of all of its shows, and it now has plans to expand the experimentation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take another big step next season,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, if we start being able to give away our tickets for free in an indoor space, and balance our budgets, and run financially successful seasons, it will be a big earthquake in American theater.\u201dHe is also pushing to extend the reach of the Public\u2019s programming, and its ethos, beyond Astor Place.He has become an evangelist for Public Works, the Labor Day weekend musicalizations of classic plays that combine a handful of professional actors with hundreds of amateur performers from across the five boroughs.Theaters in Dallas, Detroit and Seattle are adopting the program, often using productions created by the Public, but with their own casts, and Mr. Eustis, enamored of the democratic ideals implicit in the casting, and the diversity of the audiences that result, is eager to see it spread further.Joe\u2019s Pub, the Public\u2019s cabaret-style nightspot, has begun producing a performance series in Houston and is about to do the same in Seattle. The Public has announced a partnership with the Donmar Warehouse, a highly regarded nonprofit in London, and is talking about what Mr. Eustis calls a possible \u201cmultilevel collaboration\u201d with the National Theater in London, which is a pioneer in presenting stage productions on cinema screens.And the Public is taking to festivals in Hong Kong and Australia Mr. Nelson\u2019s latest plays, about an upstate New York family called the Gabriels, dramatic works that Mr. Eustis believes can give global audiences insight into contemporary American life.Next: The theater, which has had considerable financial ups and downs over the years, must decide whether to initiate a major fund drive for new rehearsal facilities and more.\u201cWhat I want to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis make sure that this theater is set up so that not just its existence, but its mission, is permanent.\u201dIt\u2019s not just in \u201cHamilton,\u201d but also in \u201cFun Home,\u201d which closes with the suicide of Alison Bechdel\u2019s father, and Mr. Nelson\u2019s play this fall, \u201cWhat Did You Expect,\u201d which opens with a story about men debating whether to tell a family that its little girl has drowned.Mr. Eustis is not without a sense of humor about his theatrical appetites. Earlier this year \u2014 arriving at the opening-night party for \u201cHead of Passes,\u201d a play that ends with a scorching cri de coeur from a mother railing against God after the tragic death of her children \u2014 Mr. Eustis blurted out, \u201cGet used to seeing plays like this.\u201dHe finds himself marveling at the frequency of heartbreaking loss in the plays he has chosen to present. \u201cIs it just suddenly I\u2019m noticing that all of these plays that I\u2019m trying to do have this quality,\u201d he said, \u201cor have they been there and I\u2019ve just not seen it?\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Eustis, who attends theater five or six nights a week, finds himself newly angered by shows that he believes present an overly rosy picture of life \u2014 particularly on Broadway, where the triumph over tragedy is a staple. He is infuriated, he says, by \u201cnarratives that imply that children are always reunited with their parents, that dead people aren\u2019t really dead.\u201d\u201cWhat I see over and over is narratives that are absolutely lying to the audience about how life works out, and they are lying to the audience for the sole purpose of making the audience feel good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what art is for.\u201d\u201cThe mission that I feel like I have is to figure out how you can tell the truth about how tragic and unfair life actually is without destroying hope,\u201d he added.As the two-year anniversary of his son\u2019s death approaches, and a new season at the Public gets underway, Mr. Eustis is seeking hope himself. He is thrilled with the success of \u201cTwelfth Night,\u201d this year\u2019s Public Works endeavor; pleased with the audience appetite for Mr. Nelson\u2019s Gabriels plays; and looking forward to a revival of \u201cPlenty,\u201d which opens Oct. 20.One sign of change: This past spring, when \u201cDear Evan Hansen,\u201d a heart-wrenching musical imagining the aftermath of a high school student\u2019s suicide, was playing Off Broadway at Second Stage, the show\u2019s director, Michael Greif, persuaded the Eustises not to come, thinking elements of the show would just be too painful.Now the show is heading to Broadway, and, at the moment, the Eustises are planning to be there opening night.Mr. Eustis said that he has also recently noticed a change in his own behavior: He has found himself straightening up and organizing his office and home.\u201cIt feels like the start of a new phase, where we\u2019re actually thinking about the future,\u201d he said. \u201cNot happy. But a step. Almost two years in.\u201dAnd then, trying to sum up how he is doing, he turned, as he always does, to theater for words. He quoted \u201cAngels in America,\u201d the Pulitzer Prize-winning epic by one of his closest friends, Tony Kushner, in which Prior Walter, a character with AIDS, converses with an angel, declaring, toward the play\u2019s end, \u201cI want more life.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be quite so grandiose, but that\u2019s actually kind of what it\u2019s feeling like,\u201d Mr. Eustis said. \u201cIt\u2019s feeling like I want to be alive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementOctober 21, 2016Mara RevkinJacob OlidortThe beginning of the Mosul Offensive earlier this week poses yet another test for the adaptability of the Islamic State, or ISIS, which has downplayed or ignored a string of territorial setbacks it has suffered in Iraq and Syria over the last year. While Mosul will be the most strategically and symbolically significant of these tests \u2014 being the site where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi pronounced himself caliph, and one of the cities in which ISIS was able to realize its caliphate-state and its most significant presence in Iraq \u2014 the liberation of the city, as well as eventually of Raqqa (ISIS\u2019s capital in Syria), will not signal a final defeat for the group. Where territorial governance was indispensable in building the group\u2019s brand over the last two years, today it is dispensable precisely because it will always be a part of the group\u2019s history and narrative.The single area in which the group has proved to be exceptional is not territorial but rhetorical. In the case of the other jihadist Syrian groups, this is not for want of trying; rather it is because of their fundamentally different aim \u2014 namely of being recognized as the only solution to the Syrian conflict. By contrast, ISIS\u2019s brand of harsh punishment, mass extortion and terrorizing of society are unsustainable as long-term governance strategies \u2014 something for which we could expect ISIS leadership to have planned.To be sure, ISIS\u2019s fight for Mosul will be long and bloody. It is perhaps the most important territorial site for its brand. However, as evinced by its simultaneous propaganda activities, we should be careful not to forget that the group pioneered social media and communications space in a way that no other jihadist group did. The Islamic State, as its name suggests, has been working toward the goal of territorial sovereignty since its predecessor, Al Qaeda in Iraq (A.Q.I.), emerged in the early 2000s.  As ISIS clings to Mosul \u2014 its last urban stronghold in Iraq \u2014 and continues to lose ground in Syria and Libya, the question motivating this debate has never been more salient.  Whether or not ISIS needs territory to survive depends on our definition of \u201csurvival.\u201d  Will it survive as an organization with a command structure, or only as an ideology?  I argue that the latter scenario is more likely.Where I disagree with Jacob is on ISIS\u2019s ability to persist as an organization in the absence of the \u201cstate\u201d on which it has so explicitly staked its claim to legitimacy.  The control and governance of territory is so integral to ISIS\u2019s brand that its loss will trigger a credibility crisis from which the group may never fully recover.  To understand why statehood is so essential to ISIS\u2019s organizational identity, we must revisit its past.  Although the internet ensures that all ideas are immortal, without the territorial caliphate on which its ideology is based, ISIS will find it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain supporters.  I do not dispute Mara\u2019s presentation of the ISIS evolution from A.Q.I., as well as her basic argument of how central the Islamic State\u2019s governance of territory \u2014 its state \u2014 has been for both boosting its support and distinguishing itself from rival jihadists. Where we differ is in how central its governance is for its brand, and how capable ISIS leadership is in reshuffling its other priorities so that it remains credible as a cause and sustainable as an organization. And yet, there may well be cadres of ISIS supporters who are drawn to the group on purely ideological grounds, believing ISIS's claim to be committed to this kind of harsh and \"pure\" brand of religion and rule. Here we would do well to avoid overstating the uniformity of those who are willing to fight on behalf of ISIS or, for that matter, shape its ideology.Seen from this perspective, my variation on Mara\u2019s assessment is that many ISIS rank-and-file will indeed desert and cut deals in the face of territorial loss. But those most likely to do so will probably be motivated more by personal well-being rather than ideological disillusionment and that it was personal reasons that likely brought them to ISIS in the first place. These, however, are arguably of little concern to the Islamic State. Rather the committed believers and the fighters \u2014 those who will persist until the bitter end, and are the most effective advocates and functionaries of the Islamic State \u2014 will stick around to help the group map and execute its survival strategy.Based on its performance so far, it is possible that ISIS's core leadership \u2014 ideologues and bureaucrats \u2014 will reconstitute in some form with their most dedicated cadres, and that they will find a way for the Islamic State to survive as an organization. The questions of who will fill the ranks of this new Islamic State organization, what messaging themes they will amplify and which they will mute, and whether they will continue seeing value in its \u201cpure Islam\u201d brand will all depend on what their leadership sees as the most effective way to gain popular support within the new local conditions once Mosul and Raqqa are liberated.\nHowever, I do want to challenge the dichotomy that Jacob sets up between true believers, who wholeheartedly subscribe to ISIS\u2019s ideology and will defend it until the bitter end, and opportunists who join only for instrumental and self-serving reasons.  During this discussion, I texted a J.F.S. fighter in Aleppo province to solicit his views on our debate.  Speaking over Whatsapp, he estimated that in recent months, hundreds of ISIS fighters \u2014 Syrians as well as foreigners \u2014 have defected and joined J.F.S. in his area of Aleppo alone.  Although J.F.S. and ISIS are enemies, J.F.S. will accept ISIS deserters who agree to undergo multiweek \u201cshariah courses,\u201d where they learn the basics of J.F.S.\u2019s ideology and the \u201cemirate\u201d that it plans to establish in Syria.  When I asked why so many ISIS fighters are switching sides to J.F.S., he answered: \u201cBecause [ISIS] are deviants and [extremists], and there is a faction among them that is prone to excessive radicalism.\u201d  As a social scientist, I know that one person's story is never dispositive, but I have heard similar reports from other sources suggesting that many of the ISIS fighters now defecting to J.F.S. once considered themselves to be \u201ctrue believers\u201d in the caliphate.  As ISIS loses ground, they see J.F.S.\u2019s \u201cemirate\u201d as the next iteration of jihadist governance in Syria. As for ISIS, I agree with Jacob that its online propaganda apparatus will outlive the inevitable collapse of its physical institutions in Iraq and Syria.  The future ISIS may look more like a crowd-sourced jihadist media platform and less like an organization with a top-down command structure. We can expect ISIS to continue and even escalate its calls for homegrown terror attacks against its Western and regional allies as it tries to distract attention from territorial and military losses on its own turf.  These attacks are often perpetrated by \u201clone wolves\u201d acting without the knowledge or support of ISIS leadership, which can then retroactively ratify attacks carried out in its name. But without territory, ISIS faces two major challenges.  But will losing Mosul hurt ISIS? "}
{"Headline": "More Wretched News for Newspapers as Advertising Woes Drive Anxiety", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byThe gloom began earlier this month, when Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, sent a memo to employees that said, in part, \u201cevery story should be as short as it needs to be.\u201d The next week, William Lewis, the chief executive of Dow Jones, which owns The Journal, announced a newsroom review that he said would be \u201cunderpinned by a series of cost-management initiatives.\u201dTwo days later, on Oct. 21, the anvil fell: Mr. Baker informed employees in another memo that The Journal was looking for a \u201csubstantial\u201d number of them to take buyouts, and that layoffs were in the offing.Numerous Journal employees, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared endangering their jobs, said in interviews and conversations that they have received few specifics from management about the size and scope of the coming cuts. Mr. Baker said in one of his memos last week that changes to the print newspaper would \u201cinvolve some consolidation of sections of the paper and the teams that produce it.\u201d The employees said that the staff is now openly speculating about the potential for once-prized sections, including Greater New York and Personal Journal, to be folded or significantly reduced. Separately, employees have been working without a union contract since Oct. 1, and negotiations with the company are ongoing.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern, a lot of worry,\u201d said Timothy Martell, the executive director of the Independent Association of Publishers\u2019 Employees, the union that represents about 1,300 workers at Dow Jones. \u201cPeople are anxious, and they want to know how these changes will affect them and their families.\u201dA spokeswoman for Dow Jones declined to comment for this article.Across the country, those working in the newspaper industry are fretting as the end of the year approaches. Driving much of the anxiety is a steep drop in print ad revenue, once the lifeblood for newspapers. Spending on newspaper advertising in the United States is projected to fall 11 percent this year, to about $12.5 billion, according to the Interpublic Group\u2019s Magna.At the same time, digital advertising and other forms of revenue have been slow to pick up the slack, leading news companies, including The New York Times, The Guardian and Gannett, the owner of USA Today, to cut costs by downsizing.With quarterly earnings looming, newspaper companies are facing something of a reckoning.On Thursday, Gannett, which announced this week that it was laying off 2 percent of its work force, said print advertising revenue in its publishing segment fell 15 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, driven in part by a 35 percent decline in national print advertising. Digital ad revenue rose 6 percent, but the increase was largely because of recent acquisitions. Gannett is among the biggest publishers in the country, with more than 100 newspapers.On Thursday evening, however, three people briefed on the negotiations said the deal discussions were not on the verge of breaking down. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were ongoing. Representatives from both Tronc and Gannett declined to comment.Across the industry, similar declines in print advertising coupled with the shift to digital and, increasingly, mobile, are driving newspaper companies to reconfigure their newsrooms. Earlier this year, The New York Times introduced a newsroomwide strategy review, with the goal of providing something of a guide for how the newsroom should be reshaped for the digital age. Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, is expected to release the resulting report in some form in the coming weeks, and layoffs are expected early next year. About 70 Times employees took buyouts this year, and the company is considering other areas of cost-cutting. The contract for its union employees expired in March, and negotiations are moving slowly. The Times has also announced its intent to make subscriptions the driving source of its revenue, an acknowledgment that newspaper advertising, both print and digital, can no longer be counted on to finance the company\u2019s journalism on its own.The New York Times Company, which will report its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, said in August that its print ad revenue had fallen 14 percent in the second quarter. Digital advertising revenue dropped 7 percent.Last week, The Journal, which has a print circulation of about 1.4 million and about 1 million digital-only subscribers, announced its own newsroom review, called WSJ2020.\u201cThese are days of accelerating change in the newspaper business,\u201d Mr. Baker, The Journal\u2019s editor in chief, said in his memo about the review. \u201cNone of our competitors is immune from the challenges.\u201dNews Corp., the parent company of Dow Jones, is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 7. In August, Bedi Ajay Singh, the chief financial officer of News Corp., said on an earnings call that domestic advertising at The Journal had dropped about 12 percent compared with the same period a year earlier.Buyout requests are due Oct. 31, and Mr. Martell of the union and several other Journal employees said they expected the company to announce the layoffs by the middle of November.Anxiety within Dow Jones is even being stoked by emails sent by mistake. Last week, Ed Finn, the editor and president of Barron\u2019s, unwittingly announced layoffs at the business publication when he sent an email meant for people in management and human resources to the entire Journal newsroom.Leslie Picker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The network, which reported on the decision, called it a British-government-sanctioned attempt to interfere with freedom of speech.NatWest\u2019s corporate parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, said in a statement on Monday that \u201cthese decisions are not taken lightly.\u201d \u201cWe are reviewing the situation and are contacting the customer to discuss this further,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe bank accounts remain open and are still operative.\u201dBritain\u2019s Treasury said the government was not involved in the bank\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is a matter for NatWest, not for the government,\u201d a spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol. \u201cWe as the U.K. government haven\u2019t changed the sanctions and obligations related to Russia since February 2015. For that reason, this is a decision that only NatWest has made, possibly based on their own risk appetite.\u201dRT\u2019s defense has been that its viewers expect alternative viewpoints.In Moscow, the management of RT said on Monday that its lawyers were dealing with the banking situation and that the network would remain in operation.Jonathan Eyal, assistant director of Russian and European security studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said that the bank\u2019s action might have reflected concerns over RT\u2019s links to the Kremlin. \u201cCertain questions are being raised over the corporation and its sources of funding,\u201d he said, \u201cand the bank must have been aware that this is not a happy commercial transaction.\u201dMr. Eyal noted that some financial institutions had recently faced large fines for handling questionable accounts, and he speculated that NatWest may \u201cprefer the controversy of closing the bank account over dealing with a business that may have tainted money.\u201dBeyond that, he said, the bank may be following a lead, either directly or indirectly, from the United States, which has been weighing its response to Russian hacking of American computers and servers. The bank\u2019s action could be a kind of \u201cveiled sanction,\u201d he said, aimed at \u201ctrying to convey to the propaganda sources that they are increasingly finding their life difficult in the West.\u201dRT started in 2005 as Russia Today, a television network meant to sell Russia abroad through soft features. Very few watched. In 2009, it switched tracks, becoming a snarky anti-West outlet. It changed its name to RT and erased any obvious Russian link.RT portrays itself as an independent alternative voice. It trumpets the slogan \u201cQuestion More,\u201d yet generally sticks to the same major news that CNN or the BBC is covering.The difference is less in subject matter than in tenor: On RT, the West is portrayed as grim, divided, brutal, decadent, overrun with violent immigrants and unstable. The network tends to make favorable remarks about Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president; the former CNN host Larry King, who now appears on RT, scored a rare direct interview with Mr. Trump in September.In RT\u2019s coverage, Russia seems to brim with multicultural tolerance; President Vladimir V. Putin is depicted as a modernizing leader protecting Russia\u2019s sovereignty with no dreams of empire; and the enormous civilian toll in Syria represents the unfortunate many who are caught in the crossfire as the Syrian government battles terrorists.Most analysts interviewed by RT toe the line, and any who do not are rebuked. When one analyst recently said on the air that the Kremlin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea remained an issue, the questioner quickly cut her off. \u201cCrimea is off the table,\u201d he exclaimed, echoing a Putin statement.Public accusations about a general Russian bias toward what is known as Brexit grew so loud that the Russian Embassy in London issued a statement saying that Moscow had no position on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union.Neil MacFarquhar reported from Moscow, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from London.

{"Headline": "In a Queens Food Court, No More Dumplings, No More Ramen", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byWorks In ProgressIn our epicurean culture, the lowest species on the culinary food chain is the generic food court, and it has been marked for extinction. For many, the scariest-looking food truck is more desirable these days than a franchise outlet like Cinnabon or Taco Bell.Even the term \u201cfood court\u201d is pass\u00e9, replaced by the trendier \u201cfood hall.\u201d Leading the way are City Kitchen in Times Square and the Pennsy, near Penn StationNow joining the dining evolution are the Shops at Queens Crossing in Flushing. Back in April, Helen Lee began redeveloping the second floor of the mall that her family\u2019s company owns, a popular spot in the lively racket of the Chinatown neighborhood.Ms. Lee, 37, is executive vice president at F&T Group, a Flushing-based international developer that has for three decades been a driving force behind the neighborhood\u2019s building boom, nudging its transformation from one of European to Asian immigrants. Born in Taiwan, Ms. Lee studied finance at N.Y.U., went on to Harvard and has worked in the family business for the past two and a half years. The dining area, however, is a different breed of challenge.Aside from curating the restaurants, Ms. Lee has other worries: how to get the plates in and out of the newly expanded dishwashing room, how to refrigerate the 19-spice, two-week-marinade mix for the Japanese curry restaurant, and whether to build a giant nest of wood or simply hang big birch logs for decoration. \u201cI\u2019m totally winging it,\u201d she said, laughing.When Ms. Lee took over, the second floor was a confusing mix of restaurants and retailers selling low-end merchandise. \u201cLike jeans nobody wanted,\u201d she said. The food court was small and industrial.Ms. Lee has more than doubled the food-court space, to nearly 10,000 square feet, making it appear more upscale and youthful for the quickly gentrifying Chinese community. She has carefully selected the restaurants, creating a potential destination for local bankers, doctors and business and condominium owners in the area. The compass guiding her search is food that she herself would like to eat.One ramen chain will remain, and so will a Shanghai street-food spot that offers the obligatory dumplings and noodles.But by November, there will be a Korean tofu spot called Wonjo SoonToFu, a Happy Lemon bubble tea juice bar and a Korean fried-chicken chain called Tori. Natalie Graham, owner of SakaMai on the Lower East Side, will operate a Japanese restaurant, Curry Bo, as well as a Hawaiian poke spot.\u201cIf you don\u2019t think carefully about what people want, you\u2019ll do something that\u2019s been done before or go too far out of the box and you\u2019ll fail quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are picky. Philly cheesesteak is not going to work here.\u201dMs. Lee seems to have her finger on the pulse of the community, having recently opened Leaf, a popular craft cocktail lounge on the roof of another of her family\u2019s developments, the Hyatt Place Hotel at nearby One Fulton Square. Dozens of vendors have approached her over the past few months, she said, about space in the new food court. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying no to a lot of people,\u201d she said. Most of them were offering noodles and dumplings. \u201cYou\u2019re really tempted to say yes, since these people are more than willing to pay the rent. But we have to think in the long term.\u201dTo match the upscale new vendors, Ms. Lee had to reimagine the nondescript space.

{"Headline": "In \u2018Gaining Currency,\u2019 a Look at China\u2019s Global Ambitions for Its Money", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported bySinosphereWhy is China reconsidering the role of its currency?China is increasing its dominance in the world economy. But there was a sense that China wasn\u2019t getting the respect that it felt it deserved. One of the manifestations of that was that its currency was not quite seen as an elite currency.Chinese policy makers, especially the more reformist-minded officials, recognized that China needs to do a lot of work to get its financial markets ready before the renminbi could become a prominent international currency. Of course, there is a lot of opposition to such reforms because the system worked well for a lot of politically and economically powerful people.About three or four years ago, these reformist-minded officials had a very important insight: If they could get the Chinese people and leadership to sign on to making the renminbi a great global currency, that could provide a very useful mechanism for getting around the opposition and putting in place a lot of reforms. Ultimately it would be good for China, no matter what happened to the currency.I view this as a sort of Trojan horse strategy.These serve a very positive role, but they must come from the right sources in the right fashion. When the U.S. Treasury or the I.M.F. tells China to allow its currency to appreciate, that is seen as something that is not necessarily in China\u2019s best interest.When it comes to matters where the West has some sort of prize to offer, that changes the dynamic. We\u2019ve seen some examples of that over the last year and a half. When China decided it wanted to get the renminbi into the I.M.F.\u2019s elite basket of currencies, it felt that this would be a great way of getting more prestige for its currency in one fell swoop. The I.M.F. and China came together and decided on a checklist of things that China needed to accomplish over the next year. That checklist turned out to be very useful particularly for the People\u2019s Bank of China [China\u2019s central bank] in pushing out its reforms.After the 2008 financial crisis, the United States pumped money into its financial system, which in effect lowered the value of China\u2019s vast holdings of American debt. How has that affected China\u2019s ambitions for its currency?Chinese are net creditors to the rest of the world. That is, the world owes China a lot more than China owes to the world. But the net income that China\u2019s earning \u2014 the amount paid by foreign investors minus the amount it pays out to foreign investors \u2014 is in fact negative. Foreign investors get pretty good returns in China. But China, because most of its foreign assets are in the form of U.S. Treasuries and the government securities of other advanced economies, is earning piddling rates of return.The fact that the U.S. dollar is so dominant in global finance, and also that the architecture of global finance is controlled by the U.S. and the Western economies, frustrates the Chinese. I think the Chinese feel that the system is stacked against them.It is surprisingly prevalent even among Chinese economists who are pro-reform. There is a good reason for that: If one takes economic theory and the practical experience of emerging market countries into consideration, China is doing it exactly the wrong way.The right way to do it is to make domestic financial markets more sound, improve regulatory frameworks and make the exchange rate more flexible so that it can act as a shock absorber. Then you can open up the capital account.But I think there\u2019s a logic to China\u2019s strategy. Opening up the capital account isn\u2019t just about money, because China doesn\u2019t need money from abroad. But what comes with the money is very important.One example is where the Chinese government brought in foreign strategic investors into its banks. In 2007, in particular, there was concern that there was no improvement being undertaken in the corporate and financial structure of the big state-owned banks. The idea was that those foreign investors in the banks will have an incentive to bring with them better corporate governance practices and better risk-management practices. So all these sort of collateral benefits that come with the capital are what China wants.The Chinese government prizes stability. Will it give up control?China represents a grand and fascinating experiment in managing these two fundamentally contradictory impulses: trying to let the markets work freely versus trying to maintain stability and control in the market. We see that in a variety of contexts, and the currency is no exception. The Chinese government would like the currency\u2019s value to be more market-determined because they see that as important in terms of increasing the renminbi\u2019s prominence.They view the stability of the currency as an important marker of their ability to manage the economy well. This is going to create a number of stumbles and missteps in the future, and indeed it already has.Should the world be concerned about China\u2019s growing financial ambitions?There is a positive view about this \u2014 that having China become more engaged with the international community is a good thing. Rather than saying that it is a developing country and should be handled by different standards, China might recognize that ultimately having good rules governing international trade and finance would be to its own benefit.But I think there was also a fear that China could end up parlaying its economic heft into a more strategic influence that then feeds into its somewhat expansionist tendencies. In the past, and in fact until fairly recently, China took a fairly brute-force approach, using its economic clout to gain economic and political influence.China is very effectively gaining what I like to think of as a multilateral sheen for its effort to build closer economic relationships with other countries.At a time when the political rhetoric in the U.S. is about disengaging and questioning traditional lines both economic and political, I think China stands ready to fill in the void. That is not intrinsically a bad thing. But we have to remember many of the values the U.S. in particular has fought for, or tried to expand, like supporting democratic forms of government, by-and-large free markets, freedom of expression and so on. All those are anathema to China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Woman Puts Her Horse Before Her Marriage", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.A piece of scientific research turned viral internet folklore says you\u2019re likely to fall in love with someone if you ask him 36 quick questions and then stare into his eyes for four whole minutes. You know what they say about eyes and windows and souls. Even among already married couples, the exercise is supposed to bring about a new level of intimacy. But whether a fast track to eternal happiness or an awkward gimmick, this activity serves as a reminder that the people with whom we think we\u2019re the most intimate can still feel like strangers. You might see him, but do you really see him?Margot Livesey\u2019s new novel, \u201cMercury,\u201d features a married couple who have drifted into this proximate but distant state of coexistence. As Donald, the husband, puts it, they operate like planets orbiting the same sun, propelled by their own gravitational forces, moving harmoniously but also independently. They talk over each other more often than to each other. They have a parrot named Nabokov, and his Dada non sequiturs \u2014 \u201cThe train for Inverness will depart at 11:06 precisely\u201d \u2014 seem less like interruptions than a series of notes in the low-key disharmony of their lives.Donald, a Scottish surgeon turned ophthalmologist turned optometrist, is mostly concerned with a mundane rundown of the everyday: his patients, his children, his tennis and what the family will have for dinner. (Lamb curry, enchiladas \u2014 this kind of domestic detail gives the book a warm, humble texture.) \u201cI enjoyed my work, enjoyed my egalitarian marriage. I learned to speed around the huge American supermarket,\u201d he says. \u201cMy life, despite frequent emergencies, fit me like a well-made suit.\u201d It\u2019s indicative of his staid manner that \u201cfrequent emergencies\u201d are parenthetical interjections rather than major events. He\u2019s a man who stoically accepts the disappointments and downshifts of life. \u201cI am pleased by an average day,\u201d he observes, \u201cand I know I am neither great nor awesome.\u201dHis American wife, Viv, on the other hand, has loftier, if ill-defined, aspirations, and her failure to realize them is an irritant that prevents her from settling into the same routine that brings Donald comfort. As a girl, she excelled at riding; after attending Yale, she was recruited to work in finance. Now, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t consider a business career her calling, she\u2019s annoyed by her sluggish rise. When Claudia, her oldest friend, tries to assuage her fears, Viv dismisses her limited purview, noting that \u201cshe didn\u2019t believe she was destined for greatness; she didn\u2019t have the hunger, the ambition.\u201d Nice lady.Viv isn\u2019t exactly nice, but she\u2019s a familiar type: a woman whose place has been defined more by circumstance and familial sacrifice than by her own plan for herself. Although she was profoundly uncertain about having children (\u201cDid I want to be colonized by a small, helpless being?\u201d), she loves her kids once they\u2019ve arrived. She didn\u2019t want to be a wife \u2014 \u201cBeing a mother was already overwhelming\u201d \u2014 and yet when she became pregnant for the second time, marriage seemed right. Although she loathes suburban life, she recognizes that living near Donald\u2019s ailing father is best for everyone. She is a relatable type, one of the millions of women contemplating her life\u2019s thousand small concessions as her hands prune up in the dishwater.Viv\u2019s sense of her true self \u2014 her \u00addestined-for-greatness self \u2014 only returns when she\u2019s around her first love, horses. At first she rides on the weekends but eventually she quits her corporate job, takes over a stable with Claudia and begins to care for and ride a glorious thoroughbred named Mercury. This new passion is celebrated (by Viv) and blamed (by Donald) as the bolt from the blue that disrupts the comfortable complacency of their lives. The novel makes this difference in opinion explicit in its narration: It\u2019s told first by Donald, then by Viv and then by Donald again. They describe the same events, but from different perspectives.Decades ago, Evan S. Connell\u2019s paired novels about Mr. and Mrs. Bridge established a brilliant precedent for alternating narration of this type. More recently, the technique has been deployed as a means not just to highlight marital miscommunication but to propel a sensational plot. In both Gillian Flynn\u2019s \u201cGone Girl\u201d and \u00adLauren Groff\u2019s \u201cFates and Furies,\u201d the secrets women hide from their partners become dramatic pivots.But while \u201cGone Girl\u201d and \u201cFates and Furies\u201d used the technique for sensational ends, Livesey\u2019s novel, despite its occasionally portentous tone (what hath Mercury wrought!), is more in the Bridge school, delving into the subtler miscommunications of even the most intertwined lives. Both halves of the marriage feel somewhat underappreciated and underloved. When their sex life wanes, each partner blames the other for a lack of interest. Donald thinks that Viv\u2019s desire to send their son to private school comes out of nowhere; Viv believes she\u2019s been voicing concerns about their son regularly. The novel also underlines the small efforts people make to carve out autonomy within a marriage: Viv refers to \u201cmy credit card bill,\u201d whereas Donald thinks of her expenditures in terms of the family budget. Even within the close and contained realm that is the home, there are many different realities.At best, this mechanism offers a subtle commentary on the way Viv and Donald process their shared life. But \u201cMercury\u201d suffers from a self-consciousness that undermines whatever elegant observation this mechanism allows. Both Don and Viv indicate that they\u2019re writing down their own version of events. \u201cPainfully, on page after page, I record my myopia,\u201d Donald states. \u201cI have only one chance to plead my case, and only one person to plead it to,\u201d Viv writes. But why are they doing this? To exchange their true confessions like pen pals sending missives from the living room to the kitchen?In a 2012 interview, Livesey spoke of the need to take care of the reader \u2014 to opt for clarity and coherence over a forced sense of mystery or stylishness \u2014 and one feels that imperative here in the novel\u2019s \u00adfriendly, open language and the alternating narration. Hearing the way the characters justify their poor decisions to themselves makes them make a kind of sense. Ultimately, though, this feels more like a convenient tactic to fill in the gaps rather than a path to these characters\u2019 souls. And for me, it still didn\u2019t render the central tension realistic. So Viv really liked a horse. So what?And despite the consideration with which Livesey treats her readers, \u00ad\u201cMercury\u201d is also shaggy and unrealistic. Donald has a sister who is regularly mentioned but \u00adnever really incorporated into the plot. There is, however, a gun, much mentioned and eventually used; here, at least, Livesey follows Chekhov. She includes a hint of an extramarital love interest, but the thread is never developed. A long-lost friend is hunted down at a crucial moment in order to offer Donald some sage advice. How many of us, when faced with complex adult difficulties, have turned to childhood friends to whom we haven\u2019t spoken for decades?This is, in the end, less a book about mercurial change than mundane mismatch. There are the incongruities between the husband\u2019s and the wife\u2019s understanding of their marriage. There\u2019s the difference between Viv\u2019s aspirations and what the quotidian constraints of her life allow. And you could say that the novel suffers from a similiar flaw. It\u2019s a book that doesn\u2019t quite measure up to its ambitions.Chloe Schama is the executive editor of Elle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Hopefuls in New York Races Walk Tightrope on Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byIn a normal year, down-ballot candidates in the home state of their party\u2019s presidential nominee count on Election Day to provide a big boost from voters energized to send their candidate to the White House.But nothing this year is normal.Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney, a conservative Republican running for Congress in upstate New York, has consistently said she will vote for her party\u2019s presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, who has polled strongly against Hillary Clinton among voters in her district.In some areas where Mr. Trump remains popular, Republican hopefuls must walk a tightrope between expressing support for him and distancing themselves from a candidate who may become toxic to the moderates and independents they need to win.Analysts said the so-called Trump effect could play out in different ways in different parts of the state. Where Mr. Trump remains popular, voters could reward candidates who remain loyal to him. But elsewhere, his low standing with moderates, women and college-educated voters could tip close races to Democrats, and make otherwise safe Republican seats competitive.\u201cIt\u2019s not that Hillary will sway them; it\u2019s that Trump will scare them,\u201d Susan Del Percio, a Republican strategist, said. Perhaps the greatest fear for Republicans is that Mr. Trump could have a negative effect on turnout.\u201cIf Republican women are so turned off by Trump that they can\u2019t come out and vote for him and they can\u2019t vote for her,\u201d she said, \u201care they going to say these other candidates represent change, or are they going to say just forget the whole lot?\u201d\u201cVoters are not only angry and frustrated, but are asking questions about how did we find ourselves in this situation,\u201d Mr. Babinec said, adding that the \u201celection drama at the top of the ticket raised interest and appetite for the value of an independent candidate.\u201dMs. Tenney did not respond to requests for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Hannah Andrews, said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about groping women had not changed her position. \u201cShe says she will vote for him and supports him,\u201d Ms. Andrews said.But an ad running on Ms. Tenney\u2019s behalf, paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, sounds a very different note. It makes no mention of Mr. Trump, warns ominously about the Islamic State and job losses, and says Ms. Myers would be a rubber stamp for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 implying that she will be the next president.The 22nd District is one of many across the country seen as crucial to both parties\u2019 congressional hopes. It is currently represented by a Republican, Representative Richard L. Hanna, who is retiring. Mr. Hanna, perhaps freed by not having to run for re-election, has denounced Mr. Trump and said he plans to vote for Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Faso has sent mixed messages about his party\u2019s nominee. He has simultaneously voiced disagreement with Mr. Trump, said he supports the Republican ticket, and refused to say whether he will vote for him. \u201cI\u2019m not voting for Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said in a recent telephone interview when asked if he would vote for Mr. Trump.\u201cAs a husband and father I was simply outraged and appalled,\u201d Mr. Faso said about Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts of grabbing women\u2019s genitals; he called the remarks \u201cwholly inappropriate for someone running for public office.\u201dYet, while he acknowledged that Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy put him and other Republicans in a bind, Mr. Faso said he did not think it would determine the outcome of his race for Congress.\u201cThe vast majority of voters understand there are different candidates running for different offices, and there probably will be a lot of ticket splitting this year,\u201d he said, referring to those who vote for a presidential candidate from one party and down-ballot candidates from another.Steven Greenberg, a pollster with the Siena College Research Institute, said many independent voters in New York lean Republican.\u201cIf those voters stay home, that could have a major impact on a congressional race,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything can tip the balance.\u201dIn both races, although the incumbents are seen to be in relatively good shape, a so-called super PAC that backs Republicans, the Congressional Leadership Fund, in recent days has spent heavily on television advertising on their behalf \u2014 a strong indication of how Mr. Trump\u2019s disastrous October has forced his party to act defensively.Mr. Trump\u2019s impact is also being watched on races for the New York State Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Republicans. There are about 10 Senate races across the state that observers believe could tilt either way.\u201cWe have some tremendous tailwinds bolstering our cause, due to the national dynamic,\u201d said State Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who leads political operations for Democrats seeking to claim a Senate majority.In particular, Democrats sense an opening in the race for the Nassau County seat being vacated by Mr. Martins, as well as other seats on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley, where there are plenty of the moderate suburban voters most likely to be turned off by Mr. Trump.Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said State Senator John J. Flanagan, the current majority leader, \u201chas made clear that Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments are offensive and intolerable, and do not represent his values or those of the men and women of the Senate Republican Conference.\u201dJesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Donald Trump Hacked the Politics of Foreign Policy", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byThe InterpreterYet for all the boos they elicit from experts, they draw frequent cheers at his rallies.Scholars of American politics say this is because Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is using international issues as a medium to connect with voters\u2019 gut-level fears and desires, an approach that works precisely because his foreign agenda falls far outside the mainstream.Studies show that most voters rank foreign issues low on their list of concerns, but they do listen and use those issues as a window through which they judge candidates\u2019 values and ideology.Mr. Trump has exploited this dynamic, offering ideas that experts consider unworkable, but that tap into some voters\u2019 desire for a strong-handed leader. Foreign policy, some research suggests, provided an ideal medium for this message.Typically, candidates cannot reach the national stage without first proving their fitness to certain institutions that care deeply about foreign policy: the news media that vets them, the parties that provide them with crucial support, the policy makers they will need once in office.Because foreign policy is so complex and most voters do not follow its particulars as closely as they do domestic issues, those institutions play an outsize role in shaping the bounds of acceptable debate.But Mr. Trump, a celebrity who largely self-financed his primary campaign, was able to bypass this process, hacking the politics of foreign policy to his considerable advantage \u2014 and in ways that could outlast his candidacy.In a perfect world, each voter would dedicate months of study to the complexities of major global conflicts, evaluate the available options, then determine which candidate\u2019s plan best balances risks and rewards.In the world we live in, voters choose whom to believe based on whose message feels truest.\u201cWe have overwhelming evidence that voters don\u2019t know that much about the details of foreign policy,\u201d explained Elizabeth N. Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist.\u201cPeople tend to choose the candidate they like first,\u201d and then take on that candidate\u2019s views as their own, she added. \u201cThis is the way people make sense of a complicated world.\u201dAll candidates wrap their policy agendas in simpler values, such as strength or inclusiveness, or stories of heroes and villains, Professor Saunders said, \u201cas a way of crafting a narrative that voters who don\u2019t follow the details can grab on to.\u201dThat is especially true for foreign policy, she said, because it is so complex.Mr. Trump seems to have reversed this process, beginning with the narrative and values he wishes to convey, then designing policies to maximize his message\u2019s effect.Because foreign policy requires difficult trade-offs, conventional candidates are limited in how emotionally appealing they can make their plans while keeping them workable. They also need to appease the hard-nosed policy experts or party officials those candidates rely on to get elected \u2014 and, eventually, to govern. But Mr. Trump was under no such constraints.The result: Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy is not a foreign policy at all, but rather a vessel for reaching voters on a purely ideological level.This explains how Mr. Trump has won support with, for example, threats to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, though voters have expressed little interest in renegotiating the alliance and foreign policy professionals have warned it would risk disaster.Paul Musgrave, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, summed up Mr. Trump\u2019s message: \u201cNATO requires cooperation. Cooperation is something you do if you\u2019re weak. If you\u2019re strong, people go along with you.\u201dAs policy, that is dubious. But it is a powerful way for Mr. Trump to present himself as someone who will treat outsiders with suspicion and ruthlessly pursue economic gains. It is a message wrapped in foreign policy but meant to tap into more domestic concerns.To voters \u201cfeeling displaced by long-term trends toward cultural and economic globalization,\u201d Professor Dueck wrote, Mr. Trump\u2019s policies promise \u201csecurity, separation, and reassertion of control.\u201dBut for supporters, these and other statements suggested Mr. Trump could be trusted to impose order on the chaos they see in a rapidly changing world.Because American voters have long approached international issues as a way to judge presidential candidates\u2019 values, they are willing to overlook the particulars; foreign policy became a powerful medium for Mr. Trump and his supporters to connect.When Mr. Trump warns that the United States is getting swindled by the Iran nuclear deal or the North American Free Trade Agreement, he is speaking directly to a feeling among many Americans that they have been sold out by untrustworthy elites, that the game is rigged against them.This message turned out to resonate with a surprisingly large audience \u2014 but where did this seemingly new constituency come from?People who hold those values prioritize security, conformity and tradition. They also tend to fear physical threats and people they see as outsiders, whether that means foreigners or those of different races or religions. And they often express those values as a particular set of \u201chawkish\u201d foreign policy views.That hawkishness is very different from that of neoconservatives like President George W. Bush or interventionist Democrats like Mrs. Clinton. It is characterized by a desire to shut out the world, ruthlessly promote American interests, reject cooperation and meet threats with overwhelming force.The paper, though written before Mr. Trump\u2019s rise, details the worldview he would come to champion in surprising detail.The distrust of cooperation shows up in Mr. Trump\u2019s call to stymie alliances from Europe to Asia. The instinct to impose order by force appears in his proposals for unchecked violence against the Islamic State. And the \u201cAmerica first\u201d nationalism can be seen in his demand that the United States seize Iraq\u2019s oil.Voters who hold conservation values are drawn to such policies not out of a sudden interest in global affairs, but as a way to express their fear of change and desire for order at home, the researchers found. They desire a strong leader who will protect \u201cus\u201d against an ever-more-menacing \u201cthem.\u201dMr. Trump, by redirecting voters\u2019 anxiety about demographic, cultural and economic changes toward foreign policy, gives his supporters a clearer set of villains \u2014 and a promise to do whatever it will take to defeat them.Supporters do not primarily hear a policy agenda, but a promise: that Mr. Trump understands their fears and will protect them.Mr. Trump may never have a chance to test the experts\u2019 contention that his foreign policy proposals are unworkable. But the constituency he has surfaced and focused those policies on could demand them from future candidates, risking a repeat of this year\u2019s campaign dynamic pitting the party establishment against its base.Professor Saunders of George Washington pointed out that Republican leaders and Republican voters have diverged on foreign policy since Mr. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq.Mr. Trump\u2019s legacy, she said, may be to widen those gaps.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nations, Fighting Powerful Refrigerant That Warms Planet, Reach Landmark Deal", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 Negotiators from more than 170 countries on Saturday reached a legally binding accord to counter climate change by cutting the worldwide use of a powerful planet-warming chemical used in air-conditioners and refrigerators.The talks in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, did not draw the same spotlight as the climate change accord forged in Paris last year. But the outcome could have an equal or even greater impact on efforts to slow the heating of the planet.President Obama called the deal \u201can ambitious and far-reaching solution to this looming crisis.\u201dSecretary of State John Kerry, speaking to fellow negotiators in Kigali, said, \u201cIt is likely the single most important step we could take at this moment to limit the warming of our planet and limit the warming for generations to come.\u201d\u201cIt is,\u201d Mr. Kerry added, \u201cthe biggest thing we can do in one giant swoop.\u201dWhile the Paris agreement included pledges by nearly every country to cut emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the fossil fuels that power vehicles, electric plants and factories, the new Kigali deal has a single target: chemical coolants called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, used in air-conditioners and refrigerators.HFCs are just a small percentage of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but they function as a sort of supercharged greenhouse gas, with 1,000 times the heat-trapping potency of carbon dioxide.The Kigali deal was seven years in the making, and is a compromise between rich nations and poorer, hotter ones, including some where rising incomes are just starting to bring air-conditioners within reach. Wealthier nations will freeze production of HFCs more quickly than poorer countries, though some nations, including those in Africa, elected to phase the chemicals out more rapidly than required, citing the grave threats they face from climate change.While the Paris pledges are broad, they are also voluntary, often vague and dependent on the political will of future world leaders. In contrast, the Kigali deal includes specific targets and timetables to replace HFCs with more planet-friendly alternatives, trade sanctions to punish scofflaws, and an agreement by rich countries to help finance the transition of poor countries to the costlier replacement products.So, narrow as it is, the new accord may be more likely to yield climate-shielding actions by industry and governments, negotiators say. And given the heat-trapping power of HFCs, scientists say the Kigali accord will stave off an increase of atmospheric temperatures of nearly one degree Fahrenheit.That would be a major step toward averting an atmospheric temperature increase of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which many experts think the world will be locked into a future of rising sea levels, severe droughts and flooding, widespread food and water shortages, and more powerful hurricanes.Over all, the deal is expected to lead to the reduction of the equivalent of 70 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere \u2014 about two times the carbon pollution produced annually by the entire world.The Kigali accord is \u201cmuch, much, much stronger than Paris,\u201d said Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a research organization. \u201cThis is a mandatory treaty. Governments are obligated to comply.\u201dThe deal is an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the landmark 1987 pact designed to close the hole in the ozone layer by banning ozone-depleting coolants called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. That means the Kigali amendment maintains the legal force of a treaty, even if that treaty was ratified by the Senate during the Reagan administration.Chemical companies responded to the 1987 agreement by developing HFCs, which do not harm the ozone layer but do trap heat in the atmosphere.The Kigali deal came about in part because Mr. Obama, as he sought to build a legacy of tackling climate change, elevated the obscure effort to amend the Montreal Protocol to a top White House priority. The final agreement is also consistent with the president\u2019s efforts to push his climate change agenda while using creative ways to bypass a hostile Congress.Mr. Obama began paving the way to the HFC deal at a 2013 get-acquainted meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the Sunnylands golf estate in California. The two leaders agreed to make a deal to reduce the use of HFCs a priority, a major concession from China, the world\u2019s largest HFC producer.Since then, American and Chinese companies have increased production of HFC replacement chemicals, and major chemical makers in both countries stand to emerge as winners in the deal.Top officials from the chemical industry were in Kigali to push for the deal. \u201cOur industry is hard at work doing the research on the HFC alternatives,\u201d said Stephen Yurek, the chief executive of the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, an advocacy group. \u201cGetting that right is certainly as important as reaching agreement.\u201dThe Kigali amendment adds momentum to a series of new global climate change agreements. The Paris agreement entered into legal force this month, and governments from 190 countries adopted a deal to curb planet-warming emissions from the aviation industry.\u201cThis will be the trifecta of international climate agreements,\u201d said Andrew Light, a former State Department climate change negotiator. \u201cIt\u2019s just extraordinary.\u201dIn each case, the new climate deals have been criticized by scientists for being too weak, and together they do not add up to the solution to global warming. But each accord will make significant inroads on different parts of the problem.Negotiators in Kigali conceded that the final deal was much less stringent than some had originally hoped. The United States and other rich countries had pushed a plan that would freeze the use of the heat-trapping chemicals by 2021, reducing them to about 15 percent of 2012 HFC levels by 2046. That plan would have eliminated the equivalent of about 90 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution from the atmosphere by 2050.The final deal will divide the world economy into three tracks. The richest countries, including the United States and those in the European Union, will freeze the production and consumption of HFCs by 2018, reducing them to about 15 percent of 2012 levels by 2036.Much of the rest of the world, including China, Brazil and all of Africa, will freeze HFC use by 2024, reducing it to 20 percent of 2021 levels by 2045.A small group of the world\u2019s hottest countries \u2014 India, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait \u2014 will have the most lenient schedule, freezing HFC use by 2028 and reducing it to about 15 percent of 2025 levels by 2047.After arriving in Kigali on Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Gina McCarthy, and her counterparts spent hours locked in meetings, working on Excel spreadsheets to try to find a compromise. But no one could agree on the numbers. In contrast to many other environmental negotiations, it was possible for negotiators to calculate the exact effects of their proposals in real time, down to numbers of tons of planet-warming pollution avoided.\u201cIt became clear that to get everybody to the same place was not possible,\u201d Ms. McCarthy said. \u201cIt was not going to be a one size fits all.\u201dMr. Kerry arrived on Thursday, and his talks with officials from India, Pakistan and China went late and grew contentious.\u201cWe wanted a deal,\u201d said Shri Manoj Kumar Singh, an Indian negotiator. \u201cIndia is a hot country, a poor country, and we needed a deal that would work for us.\u201dAfter details were hashed out Friday night, the deal was gaveled in at 7 a.m., and the exhausted but exultant negotiators gathered for an impromptu Champagne breakfast.Environmental advocates and countries that had pushed for a more stringent deal still called the Kigali amendment a significant step forward.\u201cIt\u2019s a step toward ensuring the survival of our island,\u201d said Mattlan Zackhras, the climate change minister of the Marshall Islands, a low-lying Pacific nation threatened by rising seas. \u201cBut we need to take further steps.\u201dNegotiators noted that many of the hottest, poorest countries, including the entire African bloc, had decided not to join India on the least ambitious timetable, but rather signed on to the midlevel one. While most Africans lack air-conditioning, African negotiators said rapidly battling climate change was a higher priority.\u201cAfrica is a continent that is deeply vulnerable to climate change,\u201d said Vincent Biruta, Rwanda\u2019s minister of natural resources. \u201cWe are witnessing disastrous droughts \u2014 our people are losing lives. We need to address climate change if we are to address poverty.\u201dRwanda, which has worked to emerge from the shadows of its 1994 genocide, hopes to become known as well for the forging of a major climate deal. Negotiators met in the sparkling new Kigali Convention Center, and the night the deal was completed, it was illuminated in green.Advertisement"}

Swaine.The proposal \u201cwent against the whole idea of the place, the idea of equal access,\u201d said Mr. Swaine, who denied the campaign\u2019s request. Subsequent threats and insults from Trump supporters, aimed at museum staff members, led to a flurry of new donations to the center.Civil rights museums have always tied history lessons to current events. But now there may be more interest than ever in what some refer to as civil rights tourism \u2014 as indicated by growing financial support and higher attendance at museums focused on the African-American experience.Helping drive the trend is the extent to which race and ethnicity have become prime topics in the presidential campaigns, as well as growing public consciousness around issues like voting rights, racial variances in prison sentencing and the Black Lives Matter movement.The museum, at the Lorraine Motel, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, is more than a piece of history.Visitors \u201csee the exhibits through the lens of 2016,\u201d said the museum\u2019s president, Terri Lee Freeman. Students in particular, she said, relate the historical photos in the museum to the present-day protests against perceived police bias, among other topics.\u201cAs we talk about the past,\u201d Ms. Freeman said, \u201cwe encourage the students to think about how they can make a difference today.\u201dThe Greensboro museum opened in 2010, using tax credits provided by the federal government to create public-private partnerships. It is ranked No. 1 on a list of 65 Greensboro attractions on the travel review site TripAdvisor.Mr. Swaine says the museum\u2019s popularity has had a broader economic impact on the city, as its visitors spend money at nearby restaurants, shops and hotels.And the recent episode with the Trump campaign, which was covered extensively by local and national news media, helped spur new contributions to the museum.The campaign had asked Mr. Swaine\u2019s staff to close the museum for five hours on Sept. 20, to film Mr. Trump touring the exhibits. The museum said it could arrange a private tour for the candidate but declined to close the center to the public.Afterward, Mr. Swaine said, the museum\u2019s staff became the targets of insulting and even threatening phone calls and social media posts. One visitor appeared at the museum with an open-carry gun \u2014 legal in North Carolina \u2014 prompting the museum to declare itself a gun-free zone.Media coverage of those developments spurred contributions from around the country, mostly in the range of $25 to $100, Mr. Swaine said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more than 100 new donors contribute to the museum in the last few weeks,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign team in North Carolina has declined to comment on the incident.Elsewhere, but also primarily in the South, a number of other new and planned museums offer opportunities to explore connections between civil rights history and contemporary concerns.The regional museums also expect the new Smithsonian museum to buoy attendance at their own institutions.The Birmingham institute, which has about 150,000 visitors a year and is undergoing a renovation to be completed next year, has among its exhibits the cell door behind which Dr. King wrote \u201cLetter From a Birmingham Jail.\u201d\u201cWe use history as a point of departure to examine current issues and draw relevant lessons,\u201d Ms. Taylor said.For the last 10 years the Birmingham institute has held an annual joint conference with the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u2014 which had a wary relationship with Dr. King in his day \u2014 on race, community and law enforcement. The number of attendees has been growing, and this year for the first time, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, came to speak.The various museums draw visitors of all generations.When Sarah Welch of Seattle visited the Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta, she was struck by the center\u2019s education initiatives, some of which are led by civil rights activists who protested in the 1960s. As a recent college graduate at that time, Ms. Welch worked on the West Coast for Cesar Chavez, the farm workers\u2019 organizer.\u201cThe museum rekindled ideas I had, to get involved again,\u201d said Ms. Welch, who added that she intended to find a way to participate in the Black Lives Matter movement.Mia King, a sophomore at Duke University in Durham, N.C., who is part of the university\u2019s Task Force on Bias and Hate Issues, has visited museums in five states focused on African-American culture and civil rights.The institutions, she said, \u201ccreate more informed citizens who can have the important conversations, stand up for everyone\u2019s rights, and vote.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snooping in the Bathroom to Assess Credit Risk in China", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byKUNSHAN, China \u2014 Banks and other lenders typically look at borrowers\u2019 credit histories, tax forms and other financial information to determine whether they will get paid back. In China, lenders also look at their bathrooms.Lenders have to be creative. As the economy slows, the government wants to nurture a credit culture to get Chinese families spending instead of saving.But judging creditworthiness is tricky in a country where cash reigns, fraud is rife and even the most basic details can be difficult to verify. Despite China\u2019s size and wealth, most people have never taken out a mortgage or used a credit card, so lenders often have little reliable information about potential borrowers.To fill the gaps, one upstart lender, China Rapid Finance, supplements data analysis with on-the-ground spade work. The company\u2019s investigators, in more than 90 cities, check for the number of toothbrushes or towels to determine how many people are living in a house. They look for dirty dishes in the kitchen. They take photos of a potential borrower at work to confirm employment status.\u201cThis is probably the largest untapped consumer finance market globally,\u201d said the founder and chief executive of China Rapid Finance, Zane Wang, who spent years as the head of analytics at the credit arm of Sears, the American retailer.Getting credit right is crucial to China\u2019s economic plans. The government is trying to bolster consumer spending to help offset the sharp decline in the smokestack industries that previously helped power the country\u2019s ascent. China will need to increase the use of credit to make it easier to spend, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls that come with too much debt.Shifting generational dynamics will play a big role, as China\u2019s millennials are much more likely to use credit than their scrimping and saving parents. But lenders will also need to put the right products in their hands.While the country\u2019s wealth has swelled, the financial system has not kept pace.China\u2019s banks have a modest consumer lending business. But they typically favor making loans to big state-owned companies.They are trying to attract the next generation of spenders like Mao Yiting, a researcher at the local antiquities bureau in the coastal city of Haining.Ms. Mao, 27, has never had a credit card or taken out a loan. But she regularly borrows small amounts of just over $90 from Huabei, a consumer lending business started by the Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. She uses the money to pay for online purchases like books, dog food, or ingredients for the dessert recipes she likes to cook.\u201cI always pay the debt on Huabei on time,\u201d said Ms. Mao, who repays the money in installments. \u201cIt\u2019s more convenient than the credit cards issued by banks.\u201dBut online lending in China still has a Wild West aspect \u2014 for both the lender and the borrower.After that, regulators have stepped up their oversight of online lenders, including setting caps on the amounts that can be borrowed. The regulators\u2019 tightening grip is \u201csomething like a shepherd gradually herding his sheep into an increasingly narrowing pen or chute,\u201d said Mark Natkin, the founder and managing director at Marbridge Consulting, based in Beijing.The lenders themselves are entering a financial black hole, with little to no credit history on potential borrowers.In the United States, the Big Three credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2014 compile borrowing and repayment records to create so-called FICO scores. Financial institutions rely heavily on those scores to make lending decisions.China lacks a direct equivalent. The central bank\u2019s main database includes personal credit history data on less than a third of the country\u2019s population.\u201cCompared with the broad consumer base, there is still lots of room to go,\u201d said Paul Wang, a co-founder and the chief executive of Happyfi.com, a Shanghai start-up that guides online lenders on risk management.Without a more complete depository of information, the industry is finding new ways to build those histories.WeLab, an online lender, uses data collected on mobile phones, with the permission of users, to automatically process hundreds of details about potential borrowers\u2019 habits, online and offline. When deciding whether to lend money, it becomes granular, like the time of a day a loan application is submitted. Those filed from 1 and 6 a.m. have a higher correlation with repayment default, according to Simon Loong, the founder and chief executive of WeLab.\u201cGetting efficient access to cheap lending is still a fundamental way of how people improve their quality of life,\u201d said Mr. Loong, a banking veteran whose start-up has backing from Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, and Sequoia, the Silicon Valley investor.China Rapid Finance draws on transaction data and other records from dozens of internet companies, including Baidu and Tencent. The company feeds this raw data into its own algorithms to identify potential customers.Based on that information, the company first gives out small, preapproved loans to build a credit history. China Rapid recently teamed up with Tencent\u2019s QQ messaging platform to offer loans of $75.After a borrower repays several loans, the company then hands out bigger amounts. At that point, the company\u2019s investigators step into the mix to vet borrowers further.One applicant, the company said, wanted to borrow 100,000 renminbi for 18 months at an annual interest rate of 2.89 percent. The applicant, a 28-year-old single man from Changchun, wanted the money to renovate his home.It did not pass muster. On inspection, the company found that the applicant had stayed at what he claimed was his residence for only three days. His stated employer had no record of him.\u201dWe need to have a mechanism to check and verify,\u201d said Mr. Wang of China Rapid Finance. \u201cWe have to start somewhere.\u201dKaroline Kan contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cut Ties to Donald Trump, Big Donors Urge R.N.C.", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byTo an elite group of Republican contributors who have donated millions of dollars to the party\u2019s candidates and committees in recent years, the cascade of revelations related to Mr. Trump\u2019s sexual conduct is grounds for the committee to cut ties with the party\u2019s beleaguered standard-bearer, finally and fully.\u201cAt some point, you have to look in the mirror and recognize that you cannot possibly justify support for Trump to your children \u2014 especially your daughters,\u201d said David Humphreys, a Missouri business executive who contributed more than $2.5 million to Republicans from the 2012 campaign cycle through this spring and opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s bid from the outset.Bruce Kovner, a New York investor and philanthropist who with his wife has given $2.7 million to Republicans over the same period, was just as blunt. \u201cHe is a dangerous demagogue completely unsuited to the responsibilities of a United States president,\u201d Mr. Kovner wrote in an email, referring to Mr. Trump.\u201cEven for loyalists, there is a line beyond which the obvious moral failings of a candidate are impossible to disregard,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat line has been clearly breached.\u201dMr. Kovner argued that the Republican National Committee should shift its attention to candidates who reflected its core values, like free markets and limited government. \u201cI hope the R.N.C. sticks to candidates who articulate these principles!\u201d he said.\u201cThe R.N.C. long ago should have cut ties with Donald Trump,\u201d said William E. Oberndorf, a California investor who has given more than $3 million to Republicans since 2012. \u201cReince should be fired and replaced with someone who has the competence and leadership skills to rebuild the R.N.C.\u201dEven some of Mr. Priebus\u2019s longtime associates in his native Wisconsin appear to have reached their breaking point.\u201cReince Priebus has to ask, how much of his soul does he want to sell for Donald Trump at this point?\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host in Milwaukee, calling on Mr. Priebus to \u201cman up.\u201dReferring to Mr. Priebus, Mr. Sykes asked, \u201cIs he going to allow Donald Trump to throw Paul Ryan under the bus?\u201dFor all Mr. Priebus\u2019s public expressions of loyalty, he has been deeply shaken by revelations about Mr. Trump and the rifts within the party, seeing years of Republican organizational work potentially being undone, according to multiple people who described private conversations with Mr. Priebus on the condition of anonymity. He has said he feels adrift, fearing that Mr. Trump is headed for disaster, and told one longtime associate that he was having sleepless nights. Mr. Priebus did not respond to requests for comment.The Republican financial apparatus under Mr. Priebus, sputtering since Mr. Trump claimed the presidential nomination, is wheezing painfully in the final weeks of the race. The committee\u2019s fund-raising officials now quietly acknowledge that Mr. Trump is a thoroughly compromised candidate, party donors said, but implore potential contributors to give anyway, stressing graver concerns like control of the Supreme Court.Many donors have stopped giving, though, and some have deserted the party, including two major donors who confirmed on Thursday that they were supporting Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor who is the Libertarian candidate for president.Julian H. Robertson Jr., a billionaire hedge fund investor who has directed more than $5 million to Republicans since the 2012 election, is now backing Mr. Johnson, said Fraser P. Seitel, a spokesman for Mr. Robertson. And Jeffrey Yass, a Pennsylvania investor who has given more than $3 million to conservative candidates and committees, said in an email that he was \u201crooting for Johnson.\u201dEven some of Mr. Priebus\u2019s allies believe that Mr. Trump is certain to be defeated and that it is time for the party to protect its image by disavowing him.\u201cWe\u2019re headed for destruction,\u201d said Al Hoffman, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman and a longtime Florida donor, who plans to host Senator John McCain of Arizona at his house for a fund-raiser this week. \u201cI just hope we can find a group of conservatives and moderates who are rational thinkers to re-establish the party.\u201dBut other leading Republicans believe the party has little choice but to prop up Mr. Trump, fearing that excommunicating him would be catastrophic for other Republican candidates and all but hand over control of Congress to Democrats. And in some parts of the country, Mr. Trump has been a boon to the party.\u201cHe will bring over a minimum of two state House guys and two state senators for us,\u201d said the Pennsylvania state Republican chairman, Rob Gleason, who predicted a record presidential turnout for his party west of the Susquehanna River.While some Republican donors and elected officials have had it with Mr. Trump, another constituency dear to Mr. Priebus remains committed to the nominee: the 168 members of the national committee. In a series of emails shared this week with The New York Times, some Republican state chairmen and chairwomen and national committee members affirmed their support for Mr. Trump and saluted Mr. Priebus for standing by him.\u201cHe is our candidate,\u201d Rosie Tripp, the Republican committeewoman from New Mexico, wrote to other members of the committee. \u201cI am dismayed by our own Republicans who are bailing like rats off a ship. He who is without sin can cast the first stone. I am sure they are not as pure as the driven snow, either.\u201dJuliana Bergeron, the Republican committeewoman from New Hampshire, agreed. \u201cThere are worse things in this world,\u201d Ms. Bergeron wrote, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct, \u201cand Hillary Clinton is near the top of that list.\u201dThe views of the committee members, most of whom are party activists, not political professionals, are important because Mr. Priebus is considering running in January for another term as chairman. And when the party does not control the White House, the chairman is selected by a vote of the members.Should he seek another term, Mr. Priebus is expected to face competition from Mr. Trump\u2019s critics as well as his loyalists. Matt Borges, the Ohio Republican Party chairman and an outspoken Trump detractor, is said to be considering the chairman\u2019s post, as are several state-level officials supportive of Mr. Trump.Asked about his interest in the job, Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, declined to rule out a run, saying only that he was happy in his current work as a CNN commentator.Jonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Showing How Art Critical of Malaysian Premier Thrived During His Rule", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Mahathir Mohamad, who transformed this country of paddy fields and rubber plantations into a modern economy of factories, highways and skyscrapers, is known as much for his bold economic vision as for his intolerance of anybody who got in his way.While he was prime minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 2003, Dr. Mahathir detained opponents, fired top judges, controlled the news media, clipped the power of Malay royalty, fired one deputy and pushed another to resign.Yet the visual arts mostly escaped his attention.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d a show of 48 works by 28 artists that is on view at Ilham Gallery here until Nov. 20, is evidence of that inattention. Despite their critical nature, many of the pieces in the show appeared in state-funded institutions like the National Art Gallery; some won national awards.Art was seen as a concern of the urban elite, with no influence on the masses. \u201cIt was not really on his radar,\u201d said Valentine Willie, the curator of \u201cEra Mahathir\u201d and the creative director of Ilham Gallery. \u201cIn a way, it was a saving grace for us. He didn\u2019t take us seriously.\u201dDr. Mahathir\u2019s policies created a growing wealthy class whose members were looking for ways to spend their money. \u201cIf you have a million-dollar apartment, what are you going to put on the wall? Not your grandmother\u2019s portrait,\u201d Mr. Willie said.In Malaysia this year, another artist, Fahmi Reza, was charged \u2014 twice \u2014 under cybercrime laws for posting a caricature of Prime Minister Najib Razak with a clown face on Instagram and Facebook.But in Dr. Mahathir\u2019s Malaysia in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, even as art took a decidedly sociopolitical turn, galleries flourished, as did theater.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d which features works on loan from the national art gallery, private collections and the artists, opens with a panel by Mohd Nor Khalid, better known as Lat, whose cartoons ran in the pro-government New Straits Times.In the panel, Lee Kuan Yew, a former Singapore prime minister who died last year, is drawn clutching a newspaper and asking Dr. Mahathir why he allows cartoonists to get away with such unflattering depictions of him. \u201cLook what they do to your nose!\u201d Mr. Lee says. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Dr. Mahathir, depicted with a giant nose, agrees, \u201ctoo much freedom.\u201d It\u2019s funny, and makes a point: Even among autocrats, there are degrees of autocracy.The show also includes a politically charged work by Ahmad Fuad Osman. In 1998, the artist joined thousands in the streets protesting Dr. Mahathir\u2019s firing of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was later charged with corruption and sodomy \u2014 a crime in this country. Then Mr. Ahmad Fuad went home and picked up his brush.Until then, he had been known for his studied, symbolic pieces. He ended up producing four vigorous self-portraits, in oil, each over six feet tall. Three were based on the old proverb \u201cSee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,\u201d to which he added a fourth portrait, of him holding his nose.\u201cThere are times we have to scream,\u201d Mr. Ahmad Fuad said in a phone interview from his current base in Bali. \u201cWe can\u2019t whisper anymore. We have to let our voices out.\u201dMr. Ahmad Fuad\u2019s self-portraits were shown at Galeri Petronas, owned by the national oil company. One of these four pieces \u2014 titled \u201cShhh!\u201d and showing the artist with finger to lips \u2014 is included in \u201cEra Mahathir.\u201dAnother work, \u201cNEP,\u201d by Roslisham Ismail, is a wall-size collage forming the acronym for the New Economic Policy, an affirmative-action plan for the country\u2019s majority Malays that Dr. Mahathir wielded to a greater degree than any leader before him. The three giant letters are made up of posters and calling cards for loan sharks, a comment on the abuses of the policy and the growing chasm between rich and poor Malays.Liew Kung Yu\u2019s \u201cProposals for My Country\u201d features a photo montage of the Greek and Roman columns that mushroomed during the building boom, adorning everything from mansions to office buildings to wooden stilt houses \u2014 a sign of new money gone mad.Mr. Liew, in an interview, denounced Dr. Mahathir\u2019s obsession with showy construction; the Petronas Twin Towers, briefly the world\u2019s tallest buildings, were erected during his time.Kathy Rowland, a Malaysian arts researcher who wrote an essay for the show\u2019s catalog, noted that during Dr. Mahathir\u2019s time the state built a national theater, a national art gallery \u2014 both planned under earlier administrations \u2014 and a home for the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra at the base of the Petronas Twin Towers.\u201cI suppose a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d she said.The show is running as Dr. Mahathir, 91, is starting a new political party and forging a once-unthinkable alliance with the opposition to try to oust Mr. Najib, the current prime minister, who is mired in a billion-dollar scandal involving a state fund named 1MDB. That the gallery is owned by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and one of Dr. Mahathir\u2019s closest allies, adds to the intrigue.Mr. Willie, the curator, said that he had had the idea for the show for a while and that the timing was coincidental. Mr. Daim, a longtime art collector, provides the space for Ilham \u2014 12,000 square feet over two floors in a skyscraper he owns on the edge of the central business district.He pays Mr. Willie, who used to own five galleries across Southeast Asia, a fee to run it, but does not interfere in curatorial decisions, Mr. Willie said. Entry is free, and none of the works are for sale.Ilham\u2019s ownership has perturbed some in the arts community, who fear that artists are being co-opted in some larger political tussle. Ray Langenbach, an American who worked in Malaysia for years and is now a theater professor at the University of the Arts Helsinki, said he had rejected a request from the gallery to include his 1994 video documenting a performance piece by another artist.The piece was based on one of Dr. Mahathir\u2019s most severe crackdowns, 1987\u2019s Operation Lalang \u2014 lalang is a hardy local weed \u2014 when 106 activists, politicians, intellectuals, students and others were detained without trial, accused of stoking racial tension. \u201cAllowing criticism of his past acts makes Mahathir stronger now,\u201d Mr. Langenbach said in an email. (The gallery used news clippings about the performance piece instead.)Still, the gallery has attracted the participation of many independent voices.\u201cIt\u2019s a relevant art show, and you see a lot of anger from the time he was in power,\u201d said Jahabar Sadiq, a Malaysian journalist who wrote an essay on Dr. Mahathir\u2019s legacy for the show\u2019s catalog. In it, he described the ex- leader\u2019s biggest fault as bringing an overconcentration of power to the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cOf course there\u2019s an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sadiq said. \u201cThe agenda is: I want you to talk about it! This is therapy for the country. The country needs this therapy.\u201dA picture caption on Oct. 9 with an article about \u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d an exhibition in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, featuring artwork that was popular during the tenure of a former Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, misstated, in some copies, the patronymic of the artist whose self-portrait \u201cShhh!\u201d is in the show.

{"Headline": "What You Should Know Before Going Solar", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "Supported by How do home solar systems work? Do I need a new roof?Most installers prefer a roof that has been fixed or replaced within the last five years. This is because the roof must be sturdy enough to support a mounting system and a rack. What happens when it snows?The snow typically melts right off the panels, especially if the panels are tilted. Who fixes a panel if it breaks?Most solar panels come with a 25-year manufacturer\u2019s warranty, and it takes only a few hours for a solar installer to make replacements. Usually the installer will have a monitoring system that continuously checks the working condition of its solar panels. What is net metering?When solar panels generate more power than a household uses, the excess kilowatts are pushed back onto the electric grid. Net metering is the billing system that credits a homeowner for the excess power on the home\u2019s future bills. This helps during the winter months, when solar systems generate less power since the sun\u2019s energy is weaker. Solar system owners still use the utility\u2019s grid, which is why you still need to pay a monthly connection charge. How can I pay for a solar system? Should I lease or buy? How can a renter tap into solar energy?It is tough to do now, but renters one day may be able to join a shared solar group. In theory, an owner of a large rooftop, say on a warehouse, could become a host and could enter into an agreement with an energy developer, a company that would finance, install, own and operate the solar system on the host\u2019s roof. Area residents could join this group and pay a subscription fee to the developer in exchange for credits on their electricity bills.The idea sounds simple, but there are many hurdles before these groups can be up and running. Issues include the difficulty of finding a large rooftop space; creating enough government incentives to entice building owners to give up their rooftops for 20 years or more; and calculating the optimal size for such a group.Advertisement"}

It still evokes the particular context when the phrase became popular in the 1960s and \u201970s.\u201cInner city,\u201d in short, is imprecise in describing today\u2019s urban reality. It captures neither the true geography of poverty or black America, nor the quality of life in many communities in central cities. But politically, its 1970s-era meaning lingers.\u201cThe point is, it doesn\u2019t have to be, because what it does is it conjures a narrative about what happened in America during and after the 1960s,\u201d Professor Connolly said. \u201cThe inner city is the place that burned when King was assassinated.

It was the place Ronald Reagan had to try to conduct the war on drugs.\u201dThe phrase can also imply, Professor Connolly argues, that the problems of \u201cinner cities\u201d are of their own making \u2014 and are not the result of decades of policies that withheld mortgages, abetted discrimination or undermined schools. It might be more accurate to call them \u201cdisinvested neighborhoods.\u201d That language acknowledges that society actively chose to withhold investment from these places (but that not all urban neighborhoods suffered that fate).

They interrogate powerful officials and frequently rebuke them for lacking zeal. Most of all, they demand unflinching loyalty to President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party.They are the inspectors from the party\u2019s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the humbling displays they have orchestrated recently in many of China\u2019s most influential government agencies and largest corporations are the most prominent sign of their expanding authority.Best known as the country\u2019s anticorruption agency, the commission has lately assumed a growing role as political inquisitor, investigating the loyalty and commitment of cadres to Mr. Xi and his agenda, while cementing the commission\u2019s role as his chief political enforcer.The move reflects Mr. Xi\u2019s ambitions and fears as he prepares for a second five-year term as national leader, and has confirmed the rise of the commission and its formidable secretary, Wang Qishan, a longtime ally of Mr. Xi now seen by many as the second-most powerful official in China.The commission\u2019s investigators have shown a taste for chastening displays of power in what has become a ritual of rebuke and repentance.At the Ministry of Public Security headquarters in Beijing this month, for instance, hundreds of officers were marched into a cavernous auditorium to listen to investigators excoriate senior ministry officials for lacking \u201cpolitical judgment\u201d and demand greater loyalty to Mr. Xi and the party.Another notable target was the Propaganda Department, which the commission censured in June, saying that it \u201clacked vigor\u201d and that \u201cthe political awareness of some leading officials has not been high.\u201dThe criticism of such a powerful arm of the party fueled speculation of a factional rift at the top of Mr. Xi\u2019s government. But dozens of other party and government agencies have faced similar reprimands.The discipline commission has even taken a role in enforcing Mr. Xi\u2019s economic policies, including efforts to cut back gluts of coal, steel and other industrial products.But the core of its work is about loyalty to the party and its top leadership, referred to as the party center.Underlying the push for stricter loyalty is fear, the leadership\u2019s nagging nightmare of the Communist Party\u2019s crumbling in a Soviet-style collapse.Some officials have been publicly swearing to uphold his \u201cabsolute authority.\u201dMr. Wang, with Mr. Xi\u2019s backing, has freed the commission of organizational shackles that once allowed local officials to stymie it, and he has taken to the task with enthusiasm.He told them that the pressure would not let up. \u201cI\u2019ve said there\u2019ll be no end to this, because if there\u2019s a backlash, there\u2019ll be big problems,\u201d he said.On a practical level, the anticorruption campaign has deprived thousands of local officials of illicit income, eliciting discontent that the loyalty campaign aims to eradicate.So far there have been no signs of public backlash to the campaign. But there are fears that it risks undermining Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to rejuvenate the economy.As the discipline commission has taken a role in enforcing economic policies, censuring state-controlled companies and banks, foreign investors have become worried about the effects on their Chinese business partners and clients.American businesses should not tolerate corruption, he said, but \u201cwe are very much concerned about the expanding scope and uncertain duration of C.C.D.I. investigations, which appears to have extended nationwide and to practically every sector of the economy.\u201dMore broadly, the centralization of power, incessant inspections and demands for conformity have sapped the morale of government officials, experts and investors said. China\u2019s past spurts of economic rejuvenation often came from letting officials take risks, but the relentless pressure for loyalty to the top has instilled caution.\u201cThere is widespread inaction from local elites and local governments,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody opposes, but nobody does anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stringer, the New York City comptroller, has not said whether he plans to run for mayor next year.And yet, Mr. Stringer has said plenty.There is a long and understandable history of mayors being at odds with their comptrollers, who serve as the city\u2019s official chief auditing officer and an unofficial thorn in the side of City Hall.Mr. Stringer, who has also served in the State Assembly and as Manhattan borough president, has thus far coyly sidestepped questions about whether he is considering running against Mr. de Blasio.Mr. Stringer spoke of his association with BerlinRosen in the past tense. \u201cWe haven\u2019t officially signed anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are talking to a group of consultants I will announce once we sign them.\u201dMr. Stringer is an able fund-raiser, with a campaign war chest of $1.4 million, according to the most recent filings, made in July with the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board. That is second only to Mr. de Blasio, who had $1.6 million.In his speech last week, Mr. Stringer offered what might have been a campaign blueprint, addressing issues of economic inequality and growth, education and housing \u2014 all themes that were central to Mr. de Blasio\u2019s run for office in 2013.Mr. Stringer criticized the administration for not being more aggressive in building affordable housing and for failing to work adequately with local communities in response to concerns about zoning changes and housing plans. He said a mayoral program aiming to provide all city students with classes in computer science by 2025 was being rolled out too slowly. And he said that what the city needed was \u201cengaged leadership,\u201d pointedly suggesting that such a quality was lacking at City Hall today.The mayor wasted no time in striking back.Just hours after Mr. Stringer\u2019s speech, Mr. de Blasio, speaking at a news conference showcasing the computer education program, lashed out at the comptroller\u2019s critique. \u201cI think people who don\u2019t run things often have a simplistic analysis of the reality,\u201d he said, adding that it would take until 2025 to put the program in every school because the system is so large.The next day, during his weekly appearance on WNYC radio, the mayor defended his affordable housing plan as the most ambitious ever undertaken by the city and accused Mr. Stringer of \u201cgrandstanding.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s breathtaking how little the comptroller understands about this issue,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.In an interview this week, Mr. Stringer, 56, rebuffed the mayor\u2019s digs regarding his management experience and knowledge of the housing crisis, saying that he was indeed a person who ran things \u2014 managing an office of 700 people \u2014 and taking responsibility for, among other things, a $160 billion pension fund. He said that as borough president he dealt extensively with real estate issues, and had once been for a time a Mitchell-Lama affordable-housing activist.\u201cI think people know of my experience and record, and I just think it was unnecessary to engage in a personal attack that\u2019s just not credible,\u201d he said.Asked if he would run for mayor, Mr. Stringer deflected the question. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of time to have a 2017 discussion,\u201d he said.Susan Del Percio, a Republican political consultant, said Mr. Stringer was \u201ctesting the waters to run for mayor, there\u2019s no question about it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not so much about what effect his punches have against de Blasio, but it\u2019s showing people he will take them,\u201d Ms. Del Percio continued. \u201cThis is about showing donors and other groups that he is serious about doing this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still early on,\u201d said Mike Nieves, a Democratic political consultant, who observed that the back and forth between Mr. Stringer and Mr. de Blasio felt like the early rounds of a campaign. \u201cYou still have the mayor in a very strong position.\u201dTwo of them, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, whose district includes parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., spoke on Wednesday at a charter school rally in Prospect Park promoted by one of the mayor\u2019s foremost detractors, Eva S. Moskowitz, the founder of the Success Academy charter school network. Both could potentially draw support away from the mayor within crucial constituencies: Hispanics for Mr. Diaz, who is of Puerto Rican descent, and African-Americans for Mr. Jeffries, who is black.In an interview before the rally on Wednesday, Mr. Jeffries said that until after the presidential election, it was too early to talk about the 2017 mayoral race.\u201cImmediately thereafter, it will be important for us to have a discussion about the direction of the city of New York and whether the incumbent mayor deserves a second term,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said.He said that he planned to continue serving in Congress and added, \u201cI am going to be actively engaged in the question as to who is best prepared to lead the city when the mayor\u2019s current term expires.\u201dHe praised both Mr. Stringer and Mr. Diaz, as \u201ctremendous competitors who would be worthy of my consideration and that of others who are perhaps interested in a change in direction.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cantor Gaming set higher betting limits for its large-scale bettors, whom it also gave preferred treatment. That included direct contact with the business\u2019s director of risk management, Michael Colbert, who set odds and lines for bets.Prosecutors accused Mr. Colbert and others of breaking federal and state laws, including by allowing bets made by proxy, a practice known as messenger betting that is illegal in Nevada. Cantor Gaming also allowed bettors to make wagers from out of state, aiding at least two customers in what the government said were money-laundering schemes.Mr. Colbert, whom prosecutors said was involved in the \u201cJersey Boys\u201d gambling ring based in New Jersey and Queens, pleaded guilty two years ago to conspiring to take part in illegal gambling. He faces up to five years in prison.

The total cost is expected to be around $2 billion, with private money filling in the gap.Davis, who briefed the owners of the other 31 N.F.L. teams on the possible move at a meeting here, has not said how he and his partners would pay for the relocation of the team or the privately financed part of the new stadium.Yet in obtaining a commitment for significant public financing \u2014 something that usually comes after the private funding for a stadium is assembled \u2014 Davis appears to be moving faster than had been expected just a few months ago toward developing a formal proposal to move the team.\u201cLas Vegas has already done what they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d Davis said at the end of the meeting Wednesday. \u201cWe just have to present it to the N.F.L. and get the approval to move to Las Vegas.\u201dFor years, Las Vegas was considered off-limits to N.F.L. teams because of its association with sports gambling and fears that the proximity would make game-fixing tempting. But in recent years, the owners have warmed to the idea of having a team there, as the rapidly growing city has become more of an entertainment and family destination.The N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell, said the owners could see a formal proposal from the Raiders as early as the next owners\u2019 meeting in December, but more likely in January. At the same time, the league and the team must also complete research to determine whether Las Vegas has a sufficient number of fans and the corporate support necessary to sustain a team.The league also wants to see what role, if any, the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson, who has pledged $600 million of his personal fortune to the project and has expressed interest in ownership rights, might have. Under league rules, owners of a team cannot have gambling ties. The owners would also have to determine a relocation fee that the Raiders would have to pay.Goodell and several owners said in Houston that all things being equal, they would prefer that teams remain in their current markets. But the lack of a proposal for a new stadium in Oakland, and the commitment from lawmakers in Nevada to help pay for a stadium, have made Las Vegas an attractive alternative.To keep all options open, the league continues to talk with the City of Oakland about how it might help the Raiders stay there.Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, has said that the city is willing to provide the property for a new stadium and infrastructure improvements but will not help pay for a new stadium, which could cost more than $1 billion.Davis said he was seeking to move to Las Vegas only because Oakland \u201ccame up with nothing, zero.\u201d He insisted that his efforts to move to Las Vegas were not a way to gain leverage in negotiations with Oakland.Regardless, Davis said the Raiders would remain in Oakland for at least two more years. The team, he said, has options to play in its current home, the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, in 2017 and 2018. He said getting a stadium built in Las Vegas in time for the 2019 season might be difficult.He did say, though, that the Raiders were likely to play a preseason game in Las Vegas next year.While the owners consider Las Vegas, they are also awaiting the results of a special ballot measure in San Diego in which residents will have a chance to approve tax increases to help pay for a stadium the Chargers want to build near downtown. Courts have yet to resolve whether the ballot measure can pass with a simple majority of votes, or if needs a two-third majority.As part of the decision this year to let the Rams move to Los Angeles, the Chargers have until early January to exercise an option that would let them to move into a new stadium that the Rams are building in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood. If the Chargers forgo that option, the Raiders would then have the chance to move in with the Rams.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Else Is on the Ballot? Minimum Wage, Death Penalty and Guns", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byWhen it comes to big choices facing voters on Election Day, it\u2019s not all about Hillary Clinton versus Donald J. Trump. Down the ballot are a variety of initiatives, from the raising of the minimum wage to the restriction of gun purchases to the reinstatement of the death penalty. Here\u2019s a look at some of the hot-button issues Americans will decide on Nov. 8.An increase in the minimum wage is on the ballot in four states, something more than a dozen other states have done since 2014. Voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington will decide whether to elevate their state\u2019s wage floors to amounts ranging from $12 to $13.50 an hour by 2020. A fifth state, South Dakota, will consider excluding teenagers from a recently passed increase.Supporters say higher minimum wages would put more money into consumers\u2019 pockets and help pull people off public assistance. Opponents say businesses that are already scraping by would be hit too hard, pointing to restaurants as particularly vulnerable.Some states are experiencing a crosscurrent, with employers saying the changes are going too far and too fast for them to keep up. In Colorado and Washington, opponents say that the proposed statewide shifts are feasible in cities with vibrant economies, like Denver and Seattle, but that rural areas would suffer. South Dakota\u2019s measure to decrease wages for teenage workers would pare down an across-the-board increase that passed in 2014.Oregon voters will consider a measure to raise corporate taxes as a way help the state generate more revenue.If Proposition 62 is passed, the strongest punishment available under California law would be life without the possibility of parole. Those on death row would see their sentences commuted to life without parole. Attempts to pass a similar measure in 2012 failed.Proposition 66 takes a different approach by trying to eliminate the obstacles to carrying out the death penalty and shorten the time between conviction and execution. The provisions of the initiative include a five-year limit on the appeals process.If both measures pass, the one receiving the most votes would prevail.Nebraska voters will decide whether to repeal a bill passed by the Legislature in 2015 that ended the death penalty by commuting death sentences to life in prison.Voters in California, which already has some of the country\u2019s toughest gun laws, will consider an initiative that would require people buying ammunition to pass a background check and to obtain authorization from the Department of Justice; ammunition would have to be bought from licensed dealers. The initiative would also ban large-capacity magazines for firearms, extending previously passed restrictions on their ownership.Maine and Nevada have proposals to more tightly regulate gun purchases. A measure in Maine would extend the requirement for background checks to include most private sales of guns.A similar proposal in Nevada would require most private buyers and sellers to conduct a background check through a licensed gun dealer.A proposal in Washington would allow courts to issue \u201cextreme risk protection orders\u201d to prevent people named in the orders from owning or getting firearms if there is a risk of harm to them or others.A measure under consideration in Washington would make it the first state to impose a tax on carbon emissions.Modeled after a similar initiative in British Columbia, just to the north, the measure would tax the sale or use of certain fossil fuels and electricity generated from fossil fuels. The revenue generated would be offset by a reduction in some other taxes.Supporters argue that residents have a moral responsibility to address climate change. Opponents say the measure would strain household budgets by increasing gasoline and electricity costs.An initiative in Maine is simple, but unusual: Should the state tax those earning more than $200,000 a year an additional 3 percent, and use the money for public education?The state estimates that it would provide $142 million in school funding, which supporters say is badly needed, while opponents argue that it would drive out businesses and high earners, imperiling the state\u2019s tepid economic growth.The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan though conservative-leaning group that researches tax policy, said the measure would give Maine the second-highest top individual tax rate in the country, after California.It has become a subject of fierce debate in one of the top states for public education: Should Massachusetts lift its cap on charter schools?The state has 78 charter schools, and counts more than 30,000 students on waiting lists, many of them in urban districts like Boston. A ballot proposal would allow 12 new charter schools to open each year.Polling suggests that public opinion might have turned against the move after a sustained opposition supported by teachers unions, the N.A.A.C.P. and public school committees. Opponents got a boost in September, when Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, said she would vote against the question.Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, supports the measure.A proposed amendment in Colorado would radically transform the state\u2019s health insurance system, creating a first-in-the-nation single-payer plan that would cover all residents.State insurance would replace private insurance, and consumers would no longer have premiums or deductibles, though they would make co-payments. The endeavor, ColoradoCare, would be paid for by a 10 percent payroll tax. Employers would contribute two-thirds, and individuals one-third. An elected 21-member board would control many aspects of the program.The amendment has divided traditional allies in the liberal community. Supporters say it would fix an expensive system still laden with coverage gaps, save $4.5 billion by reducing bureaucracy, and ease economic pain in mountain towns where people with few providers face jaw-dropping premiums.A Colorado measure would make it more difficult to put constitutional amendments on the state ballot. The measure could have major consequences for people and communities opposing fracking, many of whom see the ballot as the last avenue for reining in oil and gas companies.Opponent say the measure, Amendment 71, would benefit well-financed industries while pushing out the ideas of grass-roots activists on a wide range of issues, including oil and gas.Proposition 106 would make Colorado the sixth state to allow terminally ill people to take their own lives using medication prescribed by a doctor. The initiative would require two doctors to confirm a person is terminally ill and mentally capable. The patient must be at least 18 years old.The typically pro forma elections in which voters decide whether justices may keep their seats have taken on a particularly bitter and partisan tenor this year. This comes after years of court rulings that have rebuffed policies set by the conservative state Legislature, and as lawmakers have maneuvered to reshape the judiciary.The Kansas Supreme Court, comprising mostly justices appointed by Democratic and Republican governors who preceded the current Republican governor, Sam Brownback, has ruled that the Legislature has not adequately and equitably funded public schools. It has struck down abortion restrictions and overturned death penalty sentences.The state\u2019s conservative lawmakers, who dominate the Legislature, have accused the court of impeding on their territory. In response, they passed a bill taking away the power of the Supreme Court to appoint chief judges in the district courts, and threatened to strip the judiciary of all funding if it found that law unconstitutional. They have floated legislation to allow for the impeachment of justices and to give the governor more power in appointing them.Justices face retention votes every six years, and five of the seven on the Supreme Court are up this year. Only one of those up for retention was appointed by Mr. Brownback.The key forces against retention include the state\u2019s Republican Party and the House Republican caucus, which has sent out emails opposing retention of the four justices appointed by Mr. Brownback\u2019s predecessors. A coalition that includes four former governors \u2014 two Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 is lobbying in favor of retaining the justices, saying that the judiciary should not be subject to political winds.Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood, Caitlin Dickerson, John Eligon, John Schwartz and Julie Turkewitz.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other Campaign Madness: Mega-Donors", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byEditorialWhatever voters\u2019 disappointment with the fractious and bitter election campaign, the moneyed forces underpinning the candidates are quietly doing very well. It\u2019s estimated that the $6.3 billion record set for election spending by presidential and congressional candidates in 2012 will be surpassed by at least a billion dollars this year, driven by affluent mega-donors whose insider heft with politicians grows with each seven-figure check they write.Unfortunately, the public\u2019s concern has stirred virtually nothing in the way of a straight-talk debate between the two presidential candidates about how they would rein in the abuses of big money. This is a grave omission. The lure of outsized donations is corrupting the political process.Debate moderators have let the issue slip away. Hillary Clinton managed to broach the subject briefly in the debate last Sunday, promising to use her Supreme Court nominations to reverse the effects of the Citizens United ruling, which in 2010 ended restraints on campaign spending by corporations and unions. Donald Trump continues to insist that he relies on his personal wealth, not influence-craving donors, to finance his campaign. That may have been true in the primary elections, but Sheldon Adelson and other Republican oligarchs are heavily backing him in the homestretch drive.Mr. Trump speaks exuberantly of buying political influence as a businessman, and he promises to put his insider knowledge to work in overturning the \u201crigged\u201d system, yet he offers no plan to rein in fat-cat donors. Mrs. Clinton began her campaign with an array of serious proposals, from overturning Citizens United to overhauling the impotent Federal Election Commission.To help level the spending field, Mrs. Clinton proposes to update the public financing system for presidential, Senate and congressional campaigns along the lines of the New York City model, which supplies matching funds to qualified candidates. Another Clinton idea is to force disclosure of donors to the proliferating nonprofit groups that exploit an Internal Revenue Service loophole by claiming to be promoting \u201csocial welfare\u201d rather than political campaigns. Mrs. Clinton also proposes to eliminate the type of super PACs, with their unlimited contributions and spending, that pretend to be independent but are custom tailored for individual candidates. Her reforms already exist as proposals in Congress but need a decisive push toward enactment.These are noteworthy proposals that voters should embrace. But they demand dedicated follow-through from Mrs. Clinton, should she win the White House, particularly since her own campaign has been driven by large amounts of special-interest, Wall Street and super PAC financing. Her campaign insists its super PAC reliance is a temporary necessity to avoid being outspent by Republicans. But voters urging reform have reason for skepticism about whether they will get the reform they\u2019re hoping for. As a candidate, President Obama also vowed to fight for big-money political reform, but he did not deliver.Mrs. Clinton has promised to pursue her campaign finance agenda from her first weeks in office. She would do well to focus on building support for it now. Beyond her strong proposals, she should be working to elect the congressional candidates she needs to enact true reform, no easy task in a Congress deeply beholden to mega-donors.Advertisement"}

Gen. Gary J. Volesky, the commander of American ground forces in Iraq, has called Mosul the Islamic State\u2019s Iraqi \u201ccrown jewel.\u201d Noting that the militants had been entrenched there for more than two years, he added on Wednesday, \u201cClearly, there\u2019s going to be intelligence that will be able to be exploited.\u201dEuropean intelligence and counterterrorism officials said they were eagerly awaiting data gleaned from computer hard drives, cellphones, recruiting files and other sources after Iraqi forces advance into the city in coming weeks. These officials fear an influx of foreign fighters fleeing the campaigns against Mosul and Raqqa.It is unclear if Islamic State leaders in Mosul will try to destroy any of their electronic or paper records before Iraqi forces and their American advisers can seize them. The Islamic State maintains prodigious and meticulous records, and it is not known if the leaders would take such a drastic step.American officials acknowledge that they face a daunting task in gathering, analyzing and disseminating to Iraqi and Western intelligence services a collection of information from Mosul that is expected to dwarf the 20 terabytes of data retrieved so far in Manbij. One terabyte is equal to the contents of a million books.The American-led coalition must be able to offer intelligence support in the Mosul operation to more partner forces \u2014 including the Iraqi Army, counterterrorism service and police, as well as Kurdish pesh merga fighters \u2014 than in any previous operations to retake other cities.\u201cWhenever you liberate a city the size of Mosul, you can expect to get a tremendous amount of information,\u201d said Col. John L. Dorrian, the chief American military spokesman in Baghdad. \u201cCertainly, if we have a window of opportunity that presents itself rather quickly, we do have adequate forces in theater to go ahead and act upon that.\u201dThe intelligence surge would most likely \u201cgive us a lot of insight into Daesh networks not just in Iraq and Syria, but it also gives insight into how they export terror around the world, some of the people they work with, how they finance themselves,\u201d Colonel Dorrian said.That is important because even as the Islamic State loses its physical caliphate, or religious state, in Iraq and Syria, the group can still inflict deadly assaults, senior American counterterrorism officials say. \u201cIt\u2019s our judgment that ISIL\u2019s capacity and ability today to carry out attacks in Syria and Iraq and abroad has not thus far been significantly diminished,\u201d Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress last month. \u201cThe tempo of ISIL-linked terrorist attacks and terrorist activity in Europe and other places around the globe is a reminder of that global reach.\u201d\u201cThis external operations capability has been building and entrenching over the past two years,\u201d he warned, \u201cand we don\u2019t think that battlefield or territorial losses alone will be sufficient to completely degrade the group\u2019s terrorism capabilities.\u201dAlissa J.

He\u2019s existed for a long time.\u201dFor Quiteka Moten, 29, a graduate student at Tennessee State University, the 2016 campaign has conjured memories of Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008, when as an undergraduate at the University of Tennessee she saw people driving around with Confederate flags and someone spread cotton balls across the lawn of the school\u2019s black cultural center.When Jeff Jackson, a 43-year-old Atlanta resident who works in finance, relates to the presidential race, he reaches back further still, to the early 1990s, when he and friends took a trip in high school and were told by a gas station clerk, \u201cYour kind is not wanted.\u201dWhether stunned or simply deflated, black voters, not surprisingly, are keeping a great distance from Mr. Trump. His support among African-Americans is low even compared with other Republican presidential candidates of the recent past, which could damage his efforts to win swing states like North Carolina.Ben Carson, the onetime presidential candidate who is now one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most visible black supporters, said that people who view the Republican nominee in a racial context did not understand his message.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything about him that is racist,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cI realize that there is a long tradition of supporting the Democratic Party and thinking that the Republicans are racist. I understand that. I think if Donald Trump is elected, when people see the results of his policies, school choice and voucher programs and prison reform, welfare reform, and job creation, you\u2019re going to see a markedly different picture when it comes time to re-elect him.\u201dDerix Dugan, 33, of Baton Rouge, La., who works at a warehouse painting cylinders, said he was leaning toward voting for Mr. Trump because he thought he was a good businessman. \u201cI would definitely say he is a racist, but that wouldn\u2019t stop my vote because I don\u2019t see us black people going back to slavery or some ridiculousness,\u201d Mr. Dugan said.\u201cThere are young people who will tell you we know people like Donald Trump, we go to work with people like Donald Trump, we go to school with people like Donald Trump every day, so we are not scared of Donald Trump,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.Indeed, regardless of whom they are supporting, black voters said they saw Mr. Trump\u2019s comments as fitting on a spectrum with their own life experiences, and Mr. Trump as just one more unenlightened authority figure they might have to deal with.\u201cThere were things I let people say to me. They\u2019d say, \u2018Dominique, you\u2019re one of the good black folks.\u2019\u201d said Dominique Morgan, 34, of Omaha, who supports Mrs. Clinton and leads a gay rights group in Nebraska.He would stay quiet, he said, when former colleagues would tease him, for fear of losing his position. \u201cThey would set out watermelon and say, \u2018You know you want some of that watermelon,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cJust things that they would say that I would have to accept because I knew if I corrected them, pointed out the things that were said, I would be vilified.\u201d\u201cEverything was, \u2018You little black this, you little black that,\u2019\u201d Mr. Linen, 39, said. \u201cHe would grab me and pull me out by the arm really tight and just say the worst things he could say to me.\u201d\u201cHe reminds me so much of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Linen said.And he said he saw another parallel in the way his teacher and the candidate spoke. \u201cAs much as he\u2019s not worthy to be president,\u201d Mr. Linen said, \u201che is 100 percent honest, even to a fault.\u201dMs. Powell, who is studying urban schooling, also said Mr. Trump was not so jarring.\u201cThere is a part of America that is like this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might be scary to some liberal whites, it might be scary to some blacks who always feel like we knew it was happening but we didn\u2019t really want it.

{"Headline": "Small Factories Emerge as a Weapon in the Fight Against Poverty", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byBALTIMORE \u2014 James Branch\u2019s life seemed destined to follow a familiar arc in the streets that surround the Marlin Steel factory, where he bends metal from sunrise until near dark.He fathered a child while in high school, dropped out, then spent a dozen years selling drugs. He went to prison and, afterward, squatted in abandoned houses in West Baltimore. He worked the fryer at Popeyes and fought the temptation to go back to dealing on street corners that many Americans will know from the television series \u201cThe Wire.\u201dFortunately, things turned around for Mr. Branch.Now 40, he earns just over $20 an hour as a skilled machine operator at Marlin Steel, a small maker of specialized metal baskets used by much bigger manufacturers like Ford Motor, Boeing and Merck. He owns a car, rents a two-story townhouse with an airy backyard and recently watched the daughter he fathered at 16 as she graduated from college with a degree in psychology.What altered Mr. Branch\u2019s fate? There was his own discipline, of course, like completing a two-year course in metalwork between his shifts at Popeyes. Or getting up at 3:45 a.m. and taking three buses to avoid being late for his first factory job.But his success is also because of the unlikely survival of Marlin Steel, a rare breed: the urban industrial manufacturer.Marlin is a thriving factory in a place that, over the last half-century, factories have fled \u2014 first to the South, and later to Asia. That flight haunts the United States perhaps most in its urban areas \u2014 especially neighborhoods that once housed the nation\u2019s working class \u2014 and helps explain why many African-Americans in particular today live in poverty in metropolises like Baltimore, Detroit, Newark and St. Louis.Despite the candidates\u2019 election-year promises, factories will never employ the masses of Americans they once did. Automation and foreign competition will not abate no matter who occupies the Oval Office. Over the last 20 years, industrial employment has dropped by nearly one-third. Only 12.3 million Americans work in the sector today, millions fewer than in leisure and hospitality, for instance, the category that includes frying chicken at Popeyes.But small manufacturers like Marlin are vital if the United States is to narrow the nation\u2019s class divide and build a society that offers greater opportunities for everyone \u2014 rich and poor, black and white, high school graduates and Ph.D.s.\u201cThe closing of factories has taken the rungs out of the ladder for reaching the middle class in urban areas,\u201d said Robert A. Johnson, a former hedge fund investor who is now president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a liberal research group. Many service jobs do not pay as well, nor do they offer the same opportunities for advancement.And as the service sector has expanded in recent decades, less educated workers in big cities have largely been bypassed as demand has grown for well-compensated professionals in what Mr. Johnson calls F.T.E., or finance, technology and electronics.\u201cManufacturing jobs involve a skill base that you develop over time, and that fortifies your negotiating strength,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. But in lower-skilled jobs, the competition is with someone who will do the same work for less. \u201cThe marketplace doesn\u2019t give you any leverage,\u201d he said.Today, smaller plants are particularly important to job creation in factory work, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \u201cMegafactories are the exception today,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cSmall manufacturing is holding its own \u2014 and you are seeing some interesting developments in urban centers.\u201dWhile they may not rival the scale of 1950s assembly lines, these smaller craft-type producers hold out hope for cities, Mr. Paul said, particularly as some companies look to move jobs back from overseas to be closer to customers and more nimble to supply customized, small-batch orders.What is more, these jobs pay people more. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing workers typically earn just over $26 an hour. By contrast, medical orderlies and nurse\u2019s assistants (a growing field) earn half as much. And fast food, a mainstay for Americans with a high school diploma or less, has a median hourly wage of $9.11.For Mr. Branch, this is not abstract economics.\u201cThis changed my life,\u201d he said, standing next to one of the machines he operates, which can cost up to $300,000 each. \u201cI went from minimum wage at Popeyes to making almost 70K a year. They\u2019re proud of me in my old neighborhood. They say I made it out.\u201dWith the rise of Donald J. Trump, much of the economic debate during the presidential campaign has centered on the anger and economics of the white working class in the Rust Belt and elsewhere. That is partly because blue-collar whites were especially hard hit by factory closures in the last decade, largely as a result of competition from China and the savage recession eight years ago.But it was the black working class that was devastated first, by a decades-long decline of manufacturing employment.As the sociologist William Julius Wilson has written in his classic studies, \u201cThe Truly Disadvantaged\u201d and \u201cWhen Work Disappears,\u201d the exodus of factories from high-cost, union-dominated cities to cheaper, less union-friendly locales in the South and West in the 1960s and 1970s played a major role in the breakdown of urban cores.\u201cThe trends among non-college-educated, white Americans today look like a lot like the trends among black Americans in the 1970s that so worried policy makers and social scientists,\u201d said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who researches the connections among trade, labor and employment. \u201cYou see it in the falling labor force participation, the decline of traditional family structure, crime and poverty. It\u2019s all there.\u201dFor Marlin and its 24 employees, all of this hit close to home when riots swept the city in April 2015 after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black resident of West Baltimore, died in police custody. Stores were looted not far from the industrial park that\u2019s home to Marlin. The police enforced a nightly curfew.One Marlin employee, Joshua Wallace, an Iraq War veteran who serves in the National Guard, was called to duty and had to patrol the streets instead of manning the computerized cutting machine. The factory\u2019s night shift, which runs seven days a week, was shut down because Marlin\u2019s workers couldn\u2019t come or go after dark.\u201cI didn\u2019t want my guys to get shot,\u201d said Drew Greenblatt, Marlin\u2019s owner.At the same time, he does not possess squads of accountants and lawyers or foreign subsidiaries that can be used to lower Marlin\u2019s tax payments \u2014 strategies most Fortune 500 companies use to cut their taxes far below the official rate.Then there is the soaring cost of health insurance and other benefits, which Marlin provides, unlike many other low-wage service employers. Factory jobs tend to come with benefits \u2014 92 percent of manufacturing employees have access to employer-sponsored health care plans compared with 79 percent of workers over all.Health care coverage for Marlin\u2019s two dozen workers costs nearly $100,000 annually, up from about $45,000 five years ago, or about the cost of two additional employees. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much is out of my control,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling how many obstacles there are in our way. But these people are depending on me.\u201dMarlin Steel is nearly a half-century old, but today it bears little resemblance to what Mr. Greenblatt found when he bought the company in 1998. \u201cIt was right out of a Charles Dickens novel,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, describing Marlin\u2019s old factory, then in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. \u201cEverything was done by hand, but there were guys missing eyes and fingers. It was dangerous, and health care coverage meant going to the emergency room.\u201dFor the first three decades of Marlin\u2019s existence, the company almost exclusively made simple, sturdy, welded-wire bagel baskets. As the Jewish breakfast staple exploded in popularity outside the Northeast, Marlin prospered along with it.But by the early 2000s, the bagel craze was fading, and the popularity of the Atkins diet and carb-phobia started hurting bagel sales. China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 presented traditional manufacturers \u2014 and what is more old-school than bagel baskets? \u2014 with an existential threat.Chinese versions of Marlin\u2019s products were selling for $6 each, or less than what the steel alone cost in Marlin\u2019s baskets. The other $5 that Marlin charged, to cover salaries, taxes, equipment and a sliver of profit, was now just red ink.Mr. Greenblatt did what organisms threatened with extinction have always done to survive: He evolved.He moved the factory to Baltimore in 1999, with eight of his Brooklyn employees following him, including one who is still working on the floor. Then he began going after what economists call value-added goods, products that were more specialized and sophisticated what than the Chinese were making, and therefore able to command higher prices.But producing baskets with very specific requirements, or tolerances, as they are known, for automakers or aerospace giants could not be achieved by hand. \u201cIf a bagel falls out the bottom, that\u2019s 10 cents,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cA single airplane part can cost thousands of dollars, so there\u2019s no room for error.\u201dOver the course of a decade, he invested in robots that churned out baskets almost a hundred times as fast as human beings. He trained his workers to operate the robots, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each, and hired engineers to help design ever-more-sophisticated products to win customers and stay ahead of overseas rivals.\u201cIn Brooklyn, eight fellows could do 300 bends an hour,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt recalled. \u201cNow two guys running robots can do 25,000 bends per hour.\u201dToday, in fact, many of Marlin\u2019s robot-made baskets are designed specifically to be handled by other robots.Automation did not mean the elimination of jobs \u2014 in fact, it saved the company. But it does mean producing many more baskets with only a few more workers. So, while Marlin\u2019s revenue has grown to over $5 million today, from $800,000 when Mr. Greenblatt arrived, the company\u2019s work force has increased by just a third, to 24 people from 18 people.Marlin\u2019s comeback isn\u2019t exactly a secret. In 2012, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, visited the plant. Mr. Greenblatt is a well-known booster in industry circles.Less publicized is how the company\u2019s survival has transformed the lives of its workers, even as the Westport neighborhood around the factory, and other poor sections of Baltimore, remain deeply scarred. \u201cSome are dead, some are locked up,\u201d said Edward Derrill, 23, of the guys he grew up with in West Baltimore. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to end up like that.\u201dWith an associate\u2019s degree in computer science from Morgan State University, a historically black college in Baltimore, workers like Mr. Derrill can earn at least $50,000 a year. Besides health insurance, they also have access to a 401(k) plan and two weeks\u2019 paid vacation, a rarity at many local employers.\u201cYou can work your way up and get raises,\u201d he said. Mr. Derrill hopes to become a team leader soon, supervising other workers. Marlin also pays for its employees to go back to school and get degrees in related subjects like engineering, giving workers who never had a chance to attend college additional options.Nationwide and for men in particular, whether black or white, the erosion of manufacturing work has been especially devastating.In the 1950s, says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard, nearly one-third of the men who went to work after high school were employed in factories. Those jobs and that era are never coming back, Mr. Katz said, \u201cbut a job as a physical therapist or a home health aide doesn\u2019t fit the identity of someone who is a welder or a machinist.\u201dAnd while not all the workers at Marlin are men \u2014 the split is about 80-20 \u2014 for many blue-collar men there and elsewhere, the idea of working with one\u2019s hands and building things is closely connected to finding a purpose in life, and in the workplace. \u201cI call it an identity mismatch, and I think it\u2019s a huge issue for men,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cPure physical labor isn\u2019t much valued today, but we need to try and rebuild the service sector for men without college degrees.\u201dBrent Fox, 34, served with the Marine Corps in Iraq and is now the weekend shift supervisor at Marlin, a position that can pay well over $50,000 a year. While the money is a draw, Mr. Fox also said working in a service-type role doesn\u2019t appeal to him.\u201c\u2018You want fries with that?\u2019 No way,\u201d he said. \u201cI like being able to take raw material and make it into something. There\u2019s pride in making things \u2014 you don\u2019t get that in a lot of service jobs.\u201dNew employers have appeared in Baltimore, including an Amazon warehouse that employs more than 3,000. But with hourly wages of over $15 an hour, that is still less than what most Marlin workers earn.\u201cThis isn\u2019t theoretical,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, shouting over the din of metal pounding on metal. \u201cManufacturing bootstraps people out of poverty.\u201d\u201cTry to get a job,\u201d said John Brooks, who has lived in Westport for most of his 63 years. \u201cThey won\u2019t hire people from here.\u201dTicking off Baltimore employers of yesteryear \u2014 like Bethlehem Steel, and Carr Lowrey, a glassmaker that shut its doors in 2003 after 114 years down by the Patapsco River \u2014 Mr. Brooks shook his head.\u201cMcDonald\u2019s, you might not even get that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere used to be plenty of factories here. You didn\u2019t even need a high school diploma to work at Bethlehem Steel.\u201dOnce upon a time, Mr. Branch, the Marlin machine operator, also lacked a high school diploma. He earned one through an equivalency test, and later helped other prisoners earn their G.E.D.s during his time inside.After Popeyes and his course at the Magna Baltimore Technical Training Center, Mr. Branch landed a job at Crown Cork & Seal in a suburb of Baltimore. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone else would have taken a chance on me,\u201d he said.\u201cThe worst feeling in the world was watching my kids get up and leave after they visited me in prison,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI promised them I wouldn\u2019t put them through that again.\u201dMr. Greenblatt had worked with Magna, and when a headhunter steered Mr. Branch to Marlin Steel, it was a natural fit. \u201cI like being creative,\u201d Mr. Branch said, as he entered figures that would determine the diameter and angles of the parts that his machine produces.\u201cGod gave me a lot of blessings,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lived that life on the corner, you never knew which day would be your last. Now I can come home, sit on my couch, look at my big-screen TV and appreciate it because it came from honest, hard work. That\u2019s a great feeling, and nothing can take that away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Less than 24 hours after the Senate and House delivered a stinging rebuke to President Obama by overriding his veto of a bill that would let the Sept. 11 families sue Saudi Arabia, Republican leaders raised the possibility of a do-over.The new law would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role it had in the terrorist operation. It would do that by expanding an exception to sovereign immunity, the legal principle that protects foreign countries and their diplomats from lawsuits in the American legal system.The aim of the bill \u2014 to give the families their day in court \u2014 is compassionate, but it is already complicating the American relationship with Saudi Arabia, and it could expose the American government, citizens and corporations to lawsuits abroad. And while the families believe that Saudi Arabia played a role in the attacks because 15 of the 19 hijackers, who were members of Al Qaeda, were Saudis, an independent American commission that investigated the attacks found no evidence that the Saudi government or senior Saudi officials directed or financed the terrorists.Just what has caused Republican leaders to have second thoughts is unclear. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that there\u2019s a way we can fix [it] so that our service members do not have legal problems overseas while still protecting the rights of the 9/11 victims,\u201d Paul Ryan, the House speaker, told reporters on Thursday, acknowledging one of the dangers.It is even less clear what lawmakers could do to mitigate that or the other problems with this ill-conceived law. The Saudi government, in a statement, said it hoped Congress would \u201ccorrect this legislation\u201d in its lame duck session after the November election. Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has suggested that changes could include limiting suits to the Sept. 11 attacks or creating a separate legal tribunal.But foreign governments could still retaliate by taking similar steps, like carving out sovereign immunity exceptions for specific incidents of importance to them \u2014 perhaps America\u2019s mistaken bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan in 2015 that killed 42 people.

{"Headline": "Politicians Place a Bet on a Stadium, and Vegas Pays for It", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 The fight to get professional football to Nevada is actually a story of inside baseball.The Oakland Raiders want to move to Las Vegas, and the city\u2019s politicians, business leaders and legions of football fans are salivating. The catch, as usual, is the price tag. The Raiders want a new, 65,000-seat stadium as part of the deal, and they\u2019re asking for the state to pitch in to cover the nearly $2 billion cost using a tax on Vegas-area hotel rooms.The Raiders\u2019 owner, Mark Davis, has pledged $500 million, and the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has offered $650 million. But both offers are contingent on the Nevada government\u2019s ponying up the remaining $750 million. Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, has called a special session of the Legislature next week to decide.Backers are betting on the fact that Las Vegas is already mad for pro sports, despite the lack of pro teams. A Sunday afternoon in a packed casino sports book lounge, with local and visiting gamblers gathering in swarms to ponder point spreads, attests to the city\u2019s enthusiasm.Las Vegas\u2019s first professional sports team, a yet-to-be-named National Hockey League expansion outfit, will debut next year, and with more than 15,000 deposits already made on season tickets, it is clear the city is excited about the arrival of professional sports franchises.But there\u2019s a difference between the proposed Raiders stadium and the new, privately funded site where the N.H.L. team will play, T-Mobile Arena. Hockey teams play 41 regular-season games at home; N.F.L. teams play just eight. The Rebels of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, will use the Raiders stadium too, but altogether it will host only about 46 events a year.Economists overwhelmingly agree that stadiums are not good economic investments for cities, but supporters claim the stadium could produce up to $800 million in new economic activity each year. But it\u2019s unclear how that can happen, since so few events will produce little job growth, and investors have made it clear the public will not share in any stadium profits.Supporters respond that the public funds in Vegas will come from an increased tax on hotel rooms, which means, they say, that tourists will foot the bill.And because room tax revenue is largely dependent on a thriving tourism industry and strong economy, there is a huge risk that those taxes won\u2019t be enough if a recession hits.Three groups in Nevada have voiced their disapproval of the stadium financing in its current form: the Nevada Taxpayers Association, Nevadans for the Common Good (a nonpartisan group of religious and community leaders) and the state\u2019s largest union, Culinary Local 226.Despite the growing coalition of the opposition, it is an underdog versus Mr. Adelson, one of the most powerful people in the state. He has been adamant that the stadium is a \u201cmust do\u201d \u2014 so much so that after the board of his casino company, Las Vegas Sands, denied his request to invest in the stadium, he offered up financing from his own personal fortune, an estimated $28 billion.In a country where football is king, no one \u2014 particularly not local politicians \u2014 wants to be responsible for passing up an N.F.L. franchise.Since the introduction of the stadium proposal in the spring, legislators including the State Senate majority leader, Michael Roberson, a Republican, have made it clear that they would not approve previously recommended projects without also approving the stadium proposal (like many state politicians in both parties, Mr. Roberson has received political donations from the Las Vegas Sands).Next week, it\u2019s a good bet that the stadium will pass, simply because stadium politics \u2014 whether in Las Vegas or San Diego \u2014 bring out two of America\u2019s deepest manias: sports fanaticism, and the feeding frenzy set off whenever wealthy investors dangle money in front of politicians.Lost in both is any consideration of what the people actually want, let alone need.An Op-Ed article on Friday about Las Vegas misstated when a National Hockey League team will make its debut there. The team is scheduled to open its first season in 2017, not this year.Advertisement"}

Some rivers reached record heights, while on others, waters are expected to keep rising for days in some areas, as the floods move downstream.The Cape Fear River south of Fayetteville crested Monday at more than 26 feet above flood stage; farther downstream, near Chinquapin, the same river was forecast to rise into Wednesday.To the northeast, the Neuse River reached more than 8 feet above flood stage near Goldsboro on Monday, and was projected to rise another 2 feet, peaking on Tuesday near its record. Downstream, near Kinston, the Neuse rose more than 7 feet above flood stage, and was expected to climb 5 feet more, not cresting until Saturday.The Lumber River at Lumberton rose 4 feet higher than it had ever been measured before.

So when Hurricane Matthew raked the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, it carved away some beaches \u2014 though it left others relatively untouched.Brevard County, Fla., home to Cocoa Beach, the Kennedy Space Center and other famous tourist attractions, lost about one million cubic yards of sand from the county\u2019s 72 miles of beaches, said Virginia Barker, the county\u2019s natural resources management director.While the number is large, the damage was less than that caused by Hurricane Sandy, or the storms that passed through in 2004 and 2005. Matthew \u201cwas more of a glancing blow,\u201d she said. It helped that the storm hit at a very low spot in the tide cycle, she said, and that the storm moved quickly. Also, she said, it was especially fortunate that \u201cour beaches were in really good shape before the storm,\u201d with beach and dune replenishment programs in place since 2000. \u201cWe talk about them being \u2018sacrificial sands,\u2019\u201d she said, a kind of environmental crumple zone to blunt storm damage.Environmental officials in states farther north said their coastal evaluations were still underway. Mary-Kathryn Craft, a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, said that early reports indicated \u201cerosion is rather extensive throughout the coast,\u201d and that many state beaches \u201cwere already experiencing significant sand deficits and chronic erosion.\u201d\u2014 JOHN SCHWARTZ\u201cReturning residents are encouraged to exercise patience and expect lengthy travel times, blocked roadways and detours back to evacuated areas and are asked not to drive around barricades or use emergency lanes that are needed for first responders,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said in a statement.The authorities in South Carolina have attributed three deaths to the storm, including two in Florence County, northwest of Myrtle Beach.\u2014 JESS BIDGOOD, in Charleston10 PhotosOn Monday, Matthew broke up and headed northeast into the North Atlantic as a diffuse low-pressure system, passing the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.

The retrial followed the British Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in April to quash Evans\u2019s initial conviction and refer the case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.The retrial in Cardiff followed a well-financed campaign by Evans and his supporters, and it received a great deal of attention \u2014 specifically to the offer of a reward of 50,000 pounds (about $60,000) to anyone who could provide information helping to bring about an acquittal.The waitress was named a number of times on social media and was forced to relocate from her home in Rhyl, Wales, before the retrial.Friday brought new fury from some women after the court in the retrial \u2014 in a rare decision \u2014 allowed two of the waitress\u2019s former sexual partners to give explicit details about her sexual history in Evans\u2019s defense.\u201cThey know that if they come forward they are going to be trashed.\u201dThe jury deliberated for less than three hours before deciding unanimously to acquit Evans, who rushed to his fianc\u00e9e, Natasha Massey.A spokesman said that Evans, who is currently injured, intended to continue his career as a player.A striker who played 13 times for Wales, Evans had relatively unheralded stints at Manchester City, Norwich and Sheffield United before his conviction.One of the first teams to express an interest in signing him after his release from prison was his former employer, Sheffield United, which in November 2014 stated that it intended to allow Evans to return to training. The decision was met by a backlash from supporters and sponsors; 150,000 people signed a petition urging the club not to re-sign Evans, who at that point had become a household name, and the club eventually withdrew its offer.Over the ensuing months, Evans continued to be linked with teams in England and abroad, and drew similar reactions from each club\u2019s fans.Evans and his supporters blamed teams\u2019 unwillingness to sign him on \u201cmob rule.\u201dAfter failed attempts to secure deals at Hartlepool United, Oldham Athletic and Grimsby Town \u2014 all of which currently play in lower tiers than Evans\u2019s previous clubs \u2014 he signed a contract with Chesterfield in June.

{"Headline": "In Fight for Aleppo, Tangled Alliances in Syria Add to Chaos", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The Syrian civil war, and the intense new ground battle in the divided city of Aleppo, is often seen as a contest between a chaotic array of rebel groups and the Russian-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad. But the reality is that Mr. Assad\u2019s side is increasingly just as fragmented as its opponents, a panoply of forces aligned partly along sectarian lines but with often-competing approaches and interests.There are Iraqi Shiite militiamen cheering for clerics who liken the enemy to foes from seventh-century battles. There are Iranian Revolutionary Guards fighting on behalf of a Shiite theocracy. There are Afghan refugees hoping to gain citizenship in Iran, and Hezbollah militants whose leaders have long vowed to fight \u201cwherever needed.\u201dThe Syrians themselves are in a few elite units from an army steeped in a nominally socialist, Arab nationalist ideology, exhausted after five years of war, as well as pro-government militias that pay better salaries. And, yes, overhead there are the Russian pilots who have relentlessly bombed the rebel-held eastern side of Aleppo \u2014 trained to see the battle as supporting a secular government against Islamist extremist terrorists.While Washington and Moscow say preservation of Syrian state institutions is a priority, a look at the fight for Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, shows that those structures are already atrophying.At least one elite Syrian Army unit has been filmed seizing positions in Aleppo, but the bulk of the pro-government force is made up militiamen trained and financed by Iran, the Shiite theocracy that is the Syrian government\u2019s closest ally, according to experts, diplomats, regional officials and fighters battling for and against the government.The government\u2019s Aleppo offensive has moved aggressively in the past week, worsening an epic humanitarian crisis. Syrian or Russian airstrikes have hit seven hospitals and killed hundreds of civilians, in what Moscow and Damascus describe as preparation for a final battle for the city.The Syrian military has dropped leaflets urging rebels to surrender and civilians to leave, but the United Nations says that pro-government forces have not allowed access to the escape routes, and that residents are afraid of arrest if they head to the government side.Pro-government ground forces have taken bites out of rebel territory from several directions, but have faced tough resistance in street fighting from insurgents who in many cases are defending their own neighborhoods.To the north, the Quds Brigade, made up mostly of Palestinians living in Aleppo, seized the Handarat Palestinian refugee camp, lost it to rebels, and seized it again. To the south, Iraqi militias and other fighters have battled rebels for crucial territory close to a water pumping center. Syrian Army forces, meanwhile, seized a neighborhood in central Aleppo near the ancient citadel.As rebel groups called for a general mobilization, residents on their side have stockpiled equipment for digging wells, fuel for generators and seeds to grow food, in preparation for a lengthy siege.There is no precedent in the Syrian war for ground forces\u2019 quickly rolling into an area that rebels have held for years. The disjointed forces, many with no local connections, are not strong enough to take fortified urban rebel positions in a frontal assault.Rather, airstrikes, artillery and starvation sieges have typically been used to force rebels to surrender in exchange for safe passage \u2014 a process that has taken months or years in places far smaller and less strategically vital than Aleppo. But it could go quicker if pro-government forces managed to take control of the water distribution plant and shut off water to the rebel side, or if thousands of Russian soldiers and veterans now working for private security contractors joined the ground battle.The Russian opposition-leaning newspaper RBK, citing a security service source, said that private Russian military companies had 1,000 to 2,500 employees in Aleppo and in one other Syrian city, Latakia, under the de facto command of Russian military intelligence officers. Russian special forces are also on the ground in Syria.The messy mosaic of ground fighters on both sides has challenged Washington\u2019s tangled allegiances. The United States is effectively allied with Iraqi Shiite militias to thwart the Islamic State in Iraq, but in Syria, some of those same militias are fighting on the side of the Assad government, which the United States opposes, and against a mix of rebel groups, some of them backed by the Obama administration.The front lines around Aleppo, as seen on video and described by witnesses, in some ways resemble those around Tikrit and Falluja in Iraq: In both countries, Shiite militia flags fly alongside, or sometimes instead of, those of a shaky national army and government.In Iraq, militias have often acted as the tip of the spear, the first ground forces to enter after Iraqi government \u2014 and sometimes American \u2014 airstrikes. Similar scenes unfolded in northern Aleppo Province in February: After heavy Russian and Syrian airstrikes drove most people from villages, fighters from the Iraqi militia Harakat al-Nujabaa \u2014 the Noble Ones \u2014 Hezbollah and others fought rebel holdouts. Afterward, Syrian troops planted flags.The pro-government forces now mobilized around Aleppo include several thousand fighters from Iranian-backed Iraqi Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilization committees, which formed to fight the Islamic State in Iraq after it swept into large parts of that country in 2014.South of Aleppo, Iraqi clerics have given rousing speeches to militiamen in fatigues urging them to fight in the name of faith and Islamic law. The Nujabaa fighters and their supporters have circulated an Arabic hashtag on social media, #AleppoOurNextVictoryInSyria.Also fighting are Iranian troops and recruits from Iran\u2019s sizable Afghan refugee population. The Iranian government has been increasingly open about the fact that these are not only advisers, as they were long portrayed.At least 400 Iranians and Afghans from Iran have died \u201cdefending the shrines\u201d in Iraq and Syria, as the government describes it. In June, at least a dozen members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps \u2014 some of them high-ranking \u2014 died in battles near Aleppo, and around that time some regular Iranian Army troops headed for Syria.Around Aleppo, sectarian battle cries can be heard on both sides. Some Sunni insurgents use slurs against the Shiites who lead their archenemy \u2014 Iran \u2014 and against the Alawites, the sect Mr. Assad belongs to. And some foreign Shiite militiamen call their enemies by the names of foes from the seventh-century battle of Karbala that split Sunnis from Shiites.There is more cultural affinity between Russia and senior Syrian Army officers \u2014 steeped in secular Baathist ideology and often trained in the Soviet Union \u2014 than between Syria\u2019s formal military and Iran and Hezbollah. But militarily, they are all interdependent.Mr. Assad needs the ground forces provided by Iran and Hezbollah, which in turn need Russian air power. At the same time, Iranian and Hezbollah officials have said that their fighters provide intelligence from the ground for targeting airstrikes.Before the war began in 2011, Syria had one of the largest and most professional armies in the region. But it has been eroded by tens of thousands of casualties, by untold numbers of men fleeing the country to avoid conscription, and by the practice of keeping many soldiers from the nation\u2019s Sunni majority away from the front lines amid questions about loyalty.Some Syrian officers and government officials grumble about Iran and Hezbollah impinging on their sovereignty, complaining that their fighters earn more than the Syrians and blow past road checkpoints with the flash of a badge. Damascus residents complain about the foreign fighters with semiautomatic rifles making stands in neighborhoods once visited by tourists from all over the world, like the shrine of Sayeda Zeinab, and the Christian quarters of the Old City.In turn, both Russians and the foreign Shiite fighters have complained about a lack of discipline among Syrian conscripts. But while many Syrian soldiers are weary after years of war, the foreign militia ranks seem to have buoyant morale.The leader of the Iraqi Harakat al-Nujabaa, for example, can be seen in a video the group posted on Facebook telling his men to keep up the battle against extremists backed by the United States, the \u201cZionist entity\u201d and \u201carrogant, colonial forces,\u201d then offering \u201cthe secret of our victory.\u201d\u201cWe are with God,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won us the big victories.\u201dOn the video\u2019s soundtrack, a singer then declared that when they see the militia\u2019s fighters, \u201cThe people of Aleppo are happy.\u201dReporting was contributed by Maher Samaan from Paris; Hwaida Saad from Beirut; an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria; Falih Hassan and Omar Al-Jawoshy from Baghdad; Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran; and Andrew E.

{"Headline": "With Senate Control at Stake, Koch Groups Start Endorsing by Name", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The vast and cash-rich Koch political network is intensifying efforts behind preferred Republican candidates in the few crucial races that could decide Senate control.The push will be a major test of strength for the Koch network, an effort that has been building over the past decade, born of the brothers\u2019 disenchantment with the performance of the Republican Party. The groups have already spent tens of millions of dollars on Senate campaigns.\u201cWe as an organization are worried about losing those champions in the Senate,\u201d said Dan Caldwell, the vice president for policy at the veterans group, about why it is taking the \u201cextraordinary step\u201d of advocating expressly on behalf of Mr. Toomey and Mr. Rubio.The shift to grass-roots appeals by Koch-aligned organizations in hard-fought Senate races comes as the groups on Wednesday ended a monthslong, multistate television advertising campaign, which along with other initiatives cost an estimated $42 million.The new attempt to make direct personal appeals to voters is far less visible than the ads saturating the airwaves in battleground states but potentially more effective at this stage. Officials from the Koch groups see it as the best way to leverage the volunteer networks and advocacy infrastructure the organizations have been creating in three dozen states over the past decade.\u201cThis has been a long-term effort in building up this grass-roots force, and this is where we believe we can have the most impact,\u201d said Mr. Caldwell, who estimated that the new grass-roots program will cost in the \u201chigh six figures.\u201dThe switch in strategy also shows races are close enough that the officially nonpartisan organizations are willing to take heat and scrutiny for acting in a partisan manner if they can influence the outcome of the races.Such activity is legal for the nonprofit groups as long as they make sure it is not the majority of their spending, a fairly easy standard for such well-financed groups to meet. Spokespeople say the express advocacy campaigns constitute a small portion of their individual budgets.Still, campaign finance watchdogs say such activity distorts what tax laws intended those \u201csocial welfare\u201d groups to do, while allowing their backers to remain anonymous.\u201cThe idea that these are social welfare organizations is somewhat odd since they are really political organizations involved in politics,\u201d said Lawrence M. Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center.Leaders of the organizations say they have based their decisions on the merits and records of the candidates, not on their partisan affiliation. They say backing candidates who share their views is their objective, not keeping control of the Senate. They note that they are not working on behalf of another endangered Republican, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, because of some disagreements with her policy stances.In Pennsylvania and Florida, Concerned Veterans for America plans to distribute 150,000 doorknob hangers to the homes of voters shown through research to be susceptible to the appeal. The Pennsylvania literature calls Mr. Toomey \u201cthe clear choice for Pennsylvania\u2019s veterans\u201d and lists some of his legislative work on their behalf. The door knocking is to be followed up with phone calls, a direct mail campaign and digital advertising.Mr. Caldwell said the organization\u2019s personnel in Florida include 14 paid staff members and 400 active volunteers, while six staff members and more than 100 volunteers are working in Pennsylvania.Another Koch-allied group, Americans for Prosperity, has a significant presence in those states as well and has been engaged in direct advocacy since last year. Besides Florida and Pennsylvania, the group is now active in Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin.Americans for Prosperity recently sent voters in Indiana, Missouri and Pennsylvania hard-hitting pieces of mail urging them to reject Evan Bayh, Jason Kander and Katie McGinty, the Democratic Senate candidates in those states.\u201cWe have found that in instances where there is a real clear policy divide, we can drive a clearer message with our volunteers into the public with express advocacy,\u201d said Levi Russell, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity.The tactical shift by the Koch network, which has steered clear of the presidential race, came after a recognition by strategists that trying to persuade voters to split their tickets might not be worthwhile. Instead, the groups are now focused on five million voters they believe share the values of conservative Senate candidates but may not be enthusiastic about the presidential choices or the election over all.\u201cWe feel like that is where we can have an outsized impact,\u201d said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, which funds the Koch network.How pivotal Senate races turn out could reflect whether the groups made the right calculation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New Jersey Transit, a Cautionary Tale of Neglect", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "The swift decline of one of the nation\u2019s busiest commuter railroads is a story of failures and mismanagement, and ominous for mass transit systems across the country.Supported byIn the 1990s, New Jersey Transit was riding high.Its ridership was increasing, and its trains were new and running on time. It won a coveted award for outstanding public transportation three times. In the years ahead, faster routes to Manhattan and double-decker trains would put it at the forefront of the nation\u2019s commuter railroads. Even as recently as 2007, it won a leadership award from New York University.That all seems like a very long time ago.Today, New Jersey Transit is in crisis. Its aging tracks and trains need billions of dollars in improvements. Delays and fares are rising along with ridership, with passenger cars packed to the breaking point. The century-old tunnel that carries its trains to New York is crumbling. And the agency has gone nearly a year without a permanent leader.\u201cIt was an excellent railroad and running quite well until the last seven years, and it has been in constant decline,\u201d said Martin E. Robins, a former deputy executive director of the agency.Under the administration of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, the state subsidy for the agency has plunged by more than 90 percent. Gaping holes in the agency\u2019s past two budgets were filled by fare increases and service reductions or other cuts. Plans for a new tunnel under the Hudson River \u2014 one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in the country \u2014 were torpedoed by Mr. Christie, who pushed for some of the money to be diverted to road-building projects.The result can be felt by commuters daily. So far this year, the railroad has racked up at least 125 major train delays, about one every two days. Its record for punctuality is declining, and its trains are breaking down more often \u2014 evidence that maintenance is suffering.The agency\u2019s troubles are especially perilous because it serves the country\u2019s most crowded region, where hundreds of thousands of commuters depend on mass transit; the loss of productivity from the many wasted hours commuters endure on delayed trains is impossible to calculate.The sun rising over New York City and Kearny, N.J. The populous area New Jersey Transit serves makes it the country\u2019s third-busiest commuter railroad.A decade ago, New Jersey Transit was laying the groundwork for robust growth. While ridership has indeed boomed \u2014 nearly 20 percent more passengers have flooded the system in the past seven years \u2014 the railroad has failed to make the investments in infrastructure needed to meet the rising demand or to simply provide reliable service.Today, its trains break down about every 85,000 miles, a sharp decline from 120,000 miles between breakdowns four years ago. The region\u2019s two other large commuter rail systems, the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad, are twice as reliable: Their trains travel more than 200,000 miles between breakdowns. New Jersey Transit also reported more major mechanical failures: 213 in 2014, compared with 89 for the Long Island Rail Road and 169 for Metro-North.In its first meeting in months, the New Jersey Transit board on Thursday appointed an executive from within the agency, Steven Santoro, as its new executive director.The railroad\u2019s falling reputation, some fear, could push people out of the state and turn others off from living there.\u201cIf I had known how inconvenient New Jersey Transit was going to be, I never would have moved to where I did,\u201d said Melissa Walters, 31, a social worker who lives in Union County. After having a baby this month, she and her husband are moving to Westchester County in New York in favor of Metro-North.The proposal for a new Hudson River tunnel, known as Access to the Region\u2019s Core, was a crucial next step, creating the path for more trains to New York. The project had cleared the high hurdle of securing federal financing and could have opened in 2018. But nine months after Mr. Christie became governor in 2010, he abruptly canceled the plan. That year, fares grew by nearly 22 percent.Under the Christie administration, the agency\u2019s finances have been dealt a blow. The direct state subsidy to its operating budget plummeted to $33 million last year from $348 million in 2009, according to the agency\u2019s financial reports.That decline has been offset by temporary infusions from New Jersey\u2019s toll roads and utilities. But each year the railroad\u2019s executives are still left to figure out where they will get the money to keep the trains running. New Jersey Transit has also had to divert billions of dollars from its capital budget to pay for operating costs, siphoning money from future improvements.Mr. Christie has said he canceled the tunnel project over concerns that the state would be responsible for cost overruns. He also criticized the project\u2019s inclusion of an underground station near the Macy\u2019s store in Herald Square in Manhattan. The governor\u2019s office has also argued that the overall state financing for New Jersey Transit\u2019s operations has remained about the same, despite its shifting sources.Mr. Christie and Richard T. Hammer, the state\u2019s transportation commissioner, declined to discuss the challenges facing the railroad. Stephen Schapiro, a spokesman for the Transportation Department, responded to some questions submitted by email.A nearly $45 million budget shortfall this year, Mr. Schapiro said, was \u201cabsorbed through internal efficiencies and using cash reserves.\u201dOn the ground, belt-tightening means making do with less: Commuters complain about missing cars; some late-night trips have been canceled. The train that crashed in Hoboken was a car short, and a device required on board to record speed was not working.\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for extravagance, but you have to fund this in a safe manner,\u201d said Stephen Burkert, a rail union leader and longtime conductor who joined New Jersey Transit in 1989.Midway through Mr. Christie\u2019s first year as governor, New Jersey Transit was spending about $1.35 billion on projects to maintain and improve service. By the middle of last year, that figure had fallen to about $600 million. The average age of the agency\u2019s train fleet \u2014 nearly a quarter of which was flooded during Hurricane Sandy \u2014 is 16 years, compared with less than 13 years for the Long Island Rail Road.Transportation experts argue that New Jersey Transit needs dedicated sources of revenue similar to those that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York has, instead of relying on a tumultuous state budget process. New York collects a fee on taxi rides, a payroll tax and other taxes for the transit system.To close a $60 million budget gap last year, New Jersey Transit raised fares by about 9 percent, causing an uproar among commuters. Mr. Christie has hinted that fares could soon increase again.Mr. Robins, the former New Jersey Transit executive, agreed.\u201cThat is a cardinal sin in labor relations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates a very incendiary situation where people feel like they\u2019re being taken advantage of.\u201dMr. Burkert said Mr. Christie did not seem to understand New Jersey Transit\u2019s essential role in the state\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cHad he taken buses or trains he would have seen \u2014 no, it\u2019s not just people going to Wall Street,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the blue-collar worker holding two or three jobs who doesn\u2019t have money for a car, and they need that train.\u201dNew Jersey Transit has lacked steady leadership amid its mounting challenges. Veronique Hakim, a highly respected executive director, stepped down last year to join the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Several top New Jersey Transit officials \u2014 all with deep experience running a railroad \u2014 have left for high-level transportation jobs elsewhere.Last year, Michael Drewniak, an ally of Mr. Christie\u2019s, joined the agency. Mr. Drewniak, who was embroiled in the scandal over the closing of traffic lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 and is known for his combative tactics, now serves as New Jersey Transit\u2019s chief of staff despite having virtually no transportation experience. He was Mr. Christie\u2019s press secretary at the time of the lane closings and helped manage the administration\u2019s response. He declined to comment about his current role.On Thursday, during the meeting of the New Jersey Transit board, Mr. Hammer ordered Mr. Santoro to \u201ctake a renewed focus on safety\u201d and to press ahead with installing technology that can automatically stop speeding trains. Mr. Santoro, who has been overseeing capital projects, said the agency had \u201cchallenges that we need to face\u201d and \u201cissues about getting our focus back.\u201dTrevar Riley-Reid is fed up with her chronically unreliable commute from Union County in New Jersey. Ms. Riley-Reid, a librarian at the City College of New York in Harlem, said delays kept her away from her family, including a 10-year-old daughter on the autism spectrum.Eager to make it on time to a performance at her daughter\u2019s school one night, Ms. Riley-Reid got off a stalled train in Newark and took a taxi. She arrived 20 minutes late, just as her daughter mounted the stage.Despite having two master\u2019s degrees, Ms. Riley-Reid has considered taking an overnight job at Target to be closer to home. \u201cI love my job,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I love the students I work with. But I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this commute.\u201dWhen things go awry, and they often do \u2014 there were at least 15 major train delays in September \u2014 commuters suffer. They wait in the Meadowlands on stalled trains. They cram onto overstuffed buses, PATH trains and ferries.Just last week, a crowd of devoted Beyonc\u00e9 fans were stranded on a broken-down train on their way to the singer\u2019s concert at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford.New Jersey Transit says about 93.5 percent of its trains are on time \u2014 a 2 percent decline from recent years and a seemingly exemplary record that commuters have trouble accepting. The figure refers to the full schedule rather than just rush hour, when delays are more disruptive.Ridership has continued to grow. The railroad now carries about 165,000 people a day, up from about 138,000 in 2009. New Jersey Transit also has about 274,000 daily bus riders and 37,500 riders on light rail.A New Jersey Transit train crossing the Dock Bridge in Newark on the way to Manhattan. Aging infrastructure has contributed to frequent delays in the system.Now a plan for a new tunnel is finally progressing. But federal officials worry that Amtrak may have to close one or both of the existing tunnel\u2019s tubes for major repairs before a new one opens in a decade, a prospect that would be devastating to travel across the Northeast.Then there is the quagmire that is Pennsylvania Station. The dispiriting maze \u2014 North America\u2019s busiest train station, shared by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road \u2014 was never meant to handle a daily flow of 600,000 passengers and 1,300 trains.With only 21 tracks, keeping trains moving requires a complex dance \u2014 one that determines the fates of commuters scrambling to make it to work, and home, on time.On a recent morning inside Penn Station\u2019s cavernous control center in Manhattan, trains were moving smoothly until a train reported a mechanical problem. It was the kind of hiccup that can set off a cascade of delays across the vast rail network. A day earlier, a signal problem with a train near Secaucus had delayed 26 trains.\u201cWe have tracks, signal systems, catenary, power grids,\u201d said Dennis Hamby, who runs the control center for Amtrak. \u201cAll the stuff has to work perfect or else we have a problem.\u201dIn June, federal inspectors swarmed New Jersey Transit\u2019s rail operations, part of a \u201cdeep audit\u201d by the Federal Railroad Administration prompted by an increase in safety violations and a lack of leadership at the railroad. The federal agency fined the railroad for several violations and warned officials of the problems it had uncovered.The railroad administration, which has not made its audit public, examined New Jersey Transit\u2019s operations, including whether crews were following safety rules. The agency is weighing additional enforcement steps against the railroad.New Jersey Transit has cooperated with federal inspectors, and if they raise any issues, the agency will promptly address them, Mr. Schapiro, the Transportation Department spokesman, said.An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board will determine whether the crash in Hoboken was caused by a mechanical problem or by human error, as well as whether the railroad had a poor safety culture \u2014 the damning conclusion of a federal review of Metro-North after a fatal derailment in the Bronx in 2013.The accident in Hoboken was New Jersey Transit\u2019s first fatal crash involving a commuter in 20 years, an impressive feat for an agency that runs hundreds of trains across a huge system each day. Nonetheless, the railroad has been cited for a large number of safety violations in recent years.Since 2010, New Jersey Transit paid about $465,000 to settle 76 safety violations identified by the Federal Railroad Administration. During the same period, the Long Island Rail Road paid $77,000 to settle 18 safety violations, and the Metro-North Railroad paid about $346,000 to settle 71.Train accidents were twice as common for New Jersey Transit during those years as they were for the region\u2019s other commuter railroads. New Jersey Transit had 200 train accidents since 2010, though most were minor episodes. Metro-North had 100 accidents during the same period; the Long Island Rail Road had 58.Days after the Hoboken crash, State Assemblyman John F. McKeon called for the railroad\u2019s administration to release its findings and let commuters know whether the problems had been fixed.\u201cIf trains are going to be delayed now and then, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d Mr. McKeon, a Democrat who represents northern New Jersey, said in an interview. \u201cBut safety\u2019s nonnegotiable.\u201dThe crash also revived calls for the addition of technology that can automatically stop a train headed for trouble. American passenger railroads are required to install such technology, known as positive train control, by the end of 2018. But New Jersey Transit has made virtually no progress toward that goal.Karl Ward, who was seriously injured while riding in the lead car of the train that crashed in Hoboken, said he was angry that New Jersey Transit had not installed an automatic braking system. Mr. Ward, a site-reliability engineer recovering from surgery on a knee hurt in the crash, said the brakes and the broader reliability problems must be fixed.\u201cI want to know that there\u2019s a plan in place to solve the systemic problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe State of New Jersey has dragged its feet. It\u2019s very disheartening.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the title of John F. McKeon.

{"Headline": "Tyson Foods, a Meat Leader, Invests in Protein Alternatives", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byTyson Foods appears to be the first big meat company to invest in a business that, among other things, aims to reduce consumption of chicken, beef and pork by replacing it with plant proteins.Tyson, the country\u2019s largest meat processor, announced last week that it was investing an undisclosed amount for a 5 percent stake in Beyond Meat, a company based in El Segundo, Calif., that makes \u201cmeats\u201d from protein sources like soy and peas.Whole Foods Market apparently finds it close enough to the real thing that the supermarket chain has been selling Beyond Burger next to the meat case in its stores.\u201cThe quality of the Beyond Burger is amazing,\u201d said Monica McGurk, a former Coca-Cola executive who joined Tyson in spring as senior vice president in charge of strategy and new ventures. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a game-changing product that gives us exposure to this fast-growing part of the food business.\u201dTerms of the deal were not disclosed. The financing round includes other investors like the Humane Society of the United States, which also previously invested in Beyond Meat.The venture capital arm of General Mills, 301 Inc., also has invested in Beyond Meat, as well as in Kite Hill, which uses nuts and other plant proteins to replace dairy products in cheese and other dairy items.Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, said Tyson\u2019s investment was the first she knew of in which a big traditional meat producer took a stake in a plant-based company.In 2014, Pinnacle Foods, which owns the Armour canned meats brand, bought the maker of the Gardein line of plant-based meat substitutes. Armour, however, is a modest part of Pinnacle\u2019s business, which includes the Duncan Hines and Birds Eye brands.\u201cThe question in my mind with these acquisitions is always why they\u2019re being done,\u201d Ms. Simon said. \u201cThe most positive view is that this means the meat industry is shifting away from animal meat to plant-based meat, but I don\u2019t think we know that\u2019s the case yet \u2014 it could also be a way of distracting attention from their industrial meat business.\u201dEthan Brown, the founder and chief executive of Beyond Meat, said he knew the investment would raise eyebrows, particularly among the most ardent vegans and vegetarians.\u201cI\u2019m hoping, though, that they and others will see this as part of a deliberate course of action to get out of the penalty box that\u2019s the \u2018alternative\u2019 section in the supermarket and get into a mainstream discussion with the consumer,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Research conducted jointly last year by the NPD Group, Midan Marketing and Meatingplace, an industry publication, found that 70 percent of meat eaters said they used a meat substitute in place of meat protein at least once a week. And 22 percent said they were using such substitutes more frequently than a year earlier.Beyond Meat raised $17 million last year from investors. That was the third round of financing that CB Insights, a data collection and research firm, could pinpoint, and the only one for which a dollar amount was disclosed.The company\u2019s goal is to take its meat substitutes mainstream. It has added Don Thompson, the former chief executive of McDonald\u2019s, to its board and built relationships with entertainment and sports celebrities like Russell Simmons and Eric Bledsoe.\u201cI made a visit to their facility in Chicago, and the similarity between what we were doing and they were doing in making sausage was eye-opening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have easily been our fat and our protein moving through that system with little distinction that a consumer would see.\u201dMs. McGurk of Tyson, which is based in Springdale, Ark., said there were no current plans to use Tyson\u2019s extensive production facilities or distribution system to support Beyond Meat, though the relationship may develop over time.\u201cThe investment for us is not about an either-or choice, it\u2019s about the \u2018and,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just another form for consumers to enjoy protein as part of their daily diet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now, a large air rights project is underway to cover the trench with five buildings, bringing with them 2.2 million square feet of offices, apartments, public spaces, shops and restaurants.Covering three square blocks, it will bridge a divide in the city and restore Pierre L\u2019Enfant\u2019s original street plan for the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cThe city has just changed tremendously the last 16 years, and I feel we\u2019re becoming part of that change,\u201d said Stuart Zuckerman, a past president of the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington and a member of the building committee.The developer, Property Group Partners, is paying up to $500,000 for the synagogue moves and, according to Robert Braunohler, regional vice president for the developer, is also contributing $9 million toward the new museum, about a quarter of its estimated total cost. The museum is scheduled to open in 2022.Meanwhile, the huge platform is nearly complete, and the first office building, at 200 Massachusetts Avenue NW, on the east side, is rising quickly. Scheduled to open in 2018, it is more than halfway to its eventual 12 stories, with 430,000 square feet, including 25,000 for ground-floor retail.None of the space is leased, but Property Group Partners, known as P.G.P., has a letter of intent from one potential tenant and is negotiating with others, Mr. Braunohler said. Negotiations are also underway with a first-floor food service tenant, after Eataly, an Italian food market chain, decided not to locate there. (It left open the possibility of renting in a future Capitol Crossing building.)\u201cIn a project such as this, people don\u2019t believe it until they see it,\u201d Mr. Braunohler said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about it for so long. Now they can see it.\u201dBrian T. Kenner, the District of Columbia\u2019s deputy mayor for economic development, expects the project eventually to generate $40 million annually in property tax revenue, as well as benefit the community at large.\u201cCapitol Crossing is unique, refilling in a city grid that used to exist, also reknitting neighborhoods back together,\u201d Mr. Kenner said. He oversees four current or former city-owned properties with 325 acres that are being converted for private redevelopment.Capitol Crossing, one of them, is coming to fruition at a time of seemingly unbridled economic prosperity for the District, coupled with a net increase of 100,000 new residents since 2000. Emblematic of this growth are the ubiquitous cranes soaring over the city\u2019s legally set height limits.The $1.3 billion Capitol Crossing project has been years in the making. At various points, it has been stalled by shifting ownership and financing problems.The local developer T. Conrad Monts acquired the air rights in 1989 with the hope of luring federal agencies to the site, then called Capitol Square. But Mr. Monts and the city became mired in seemingly endless litigation, and Mr. Monts died in 2009.P.G.P., formerly known as the Louis Dreyfus Property Group and based in New York, picked up the option to buy the air rights in 2012. Founded in 1971, the company has projects in London, West Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan, where it built 860 Washington Street, adjoining the High Line in the meatpacking district. Its projects in Washington include the Four Seasons Hotel in Georgetown.Capitol Crossing will be the District\u2019s largest air rights project to date; a larger one planned for the railroad tracks abutting Union Station is years away. Mr. Braunohler compared his project in size to covering Hudson Yards in Manhattan, now under construction.The lack of air rights projects in general, he said, is tied to the fact that \u201cland values in most cities, aside from New York and D.C., don\u2019t justify the cost.\u201dA ceremonial groundbreaking for the project was held at the edge of the highway in May 2015, with the promise of 4,000 construction jobs and 8,000 permanent jobs. But before work could begin on the deck, major infrastructure problems had to be dealt with, including the location and relocation of electrical cables. Then came the columns, girders and beams to support the platform.Altogether, Mr. Braunohler said, infrastructure costs totaled $100 million and the decking some $200 million. To speed the process, P.G.P. sought to close a freeway entrance ramp but met overwhelming resistance. Instead, it closed one lane after evening rush hour.A similar scheduling problem arose over when to move the synagogue. Wolfe House and Building Movers, a Pennsylvania firm owned by Sabbath-observing churchgoers, did not want to move it on Sunday. Also for religious reasons, the Jewish society objected to a move on Saturday. The parties compromised on a day and time that would not conflict with either.Metro, the mass transit agency, planned to tear down the original building to use the site for its new headquarters, but Jewish leaders and donors had it moved in 1969 to its current location. \u201cWe like to move our historic synagogue once a century,\u201d joked Laura Apelbaum, who was the society\u2019s executive director for 22 years.The moving company is now bracing the old synagogue for next week\u2019s move, with steel girders underneath. Its final move is expected in about three years.P.G.P. is also assisting the 103-year-old Holy Rosary Catholic Church, on Third Street NW, adjoining the deck. The church, once the center of the city\u2019s Italian immigrant community, was to have been razed for the freeway decades ago, but Congress intervened to save it.P.G.P. plans to demolish the old rectory and to rebuild it and a new annex on the deck behind the existing church, at a cost of $10 million. P.G.P. has also pledged to expand Casa Italiana, a cultural center attached to the church.On the opposite, east side of the deck sits Georgetown\u2019s law school, which has worked closely with P.G.P. to minimize disruption from the construction. \u201cThe complexity of this is unlike any project I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d said Wallace Mlyniec, a law professor who has worked closely with the developer and monitored the project.Capitol Crossing\u2019s second office building is to include underground parking for 1,150 vehicles. By 2020 or 2021, there will also be a residential building, Mr. Braunohler said. It will have 150 units, including 50 deemed affordable, he said, adding that all will most likely be rentals.Further burnishing its location, Capitol Crossing will be just a few blocks from two Metro stops, Union Station to the east and Judiciary Square to the west, and its location has Mr. Braunohler bullish.\u201cD.C. is a great market and real estate investment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the wild swings other cities do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rural Bangladesh, Solar Power Dents Poverty", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byFixesKAKHIN BIMILE, Bangladesh \u2014 Kismat Ali is a 33-year-old mason living in Kakhin Bimile, a village a few hours drive from Dhaka, Bangladesh\u2019s crowded capital. He lives in a large brick home on a dirt road with his wife, son, parents and five brothers. This semirural area is off the main electrical grid, so residents rely on kerosene lamps and electricity from wires strung across the village to a noisy privately owned diesel generator. It runs about five hours each night.But Mr. Ali has a new source of electricity he can turn to: solar panels on his corrugated metal roof. In his home, he flicks a light switch and a bare bulb glows from the ceiling. Mr. Ali proudly switches on a fan that stirs the stultifying summer air. He says he wants to have a television one day, but is waiting for an LED TV that would consume less energy than models available now.Solar energy is reliable, clean and cheaper in the long run than kerosene and the village\u2019s generator. It costs about 3,000 taka ($38) a month for the diesel generator to light a three-room house. But for the solar equipment, Mr. Ali pays 1,355 taka ($17) in monthly installments after a down payment of 6,500 taka ($83) on a loan he expects to pay off within two years.In rural Bangladesh, especially the coastal southwest, it is common to see tiny solar panels embedded even in humble thatch-roofed huts. This is mostly the work of Infrastructure Development Company Limited (Idcol), a government-backed Bangladeshi energy and infrastructure group that claims more than 90 percent of the country\u2019s booming home solar market.Since 2003, Idcol has installed solar panels in 3.95 million off-grid homes, reaching 18 million people. In terms of individual units served (rather than total wattage), Bangladesh has become one of the world\u2019s largest markets for home solar systems.One factor in those comparisons is that solar energy has become a lifeline for low-income Bangladeshis, a great many of whom the grid does not reach. Although its big cities seem bright and bustling, just 25 percent of the population of 160 million have reliable electricity.Since electricity \u2014 even in small doses \u2014 powers lamps, cellphones, fans, water pumps, health clinics and equipment for businesses, it is critical in improving the lives of the poor.Mahmood Malik, chief executive of Idcol in Dhaka, calls its arrival for the rural poor \u201ca silent revolution you can\u2019t feel sitting in the city.\u201dSolar is also safer and cleaner than conventional fuel. Idcol estimates that each year its solar installations replace 242 tons of kerosene worth $300 million that the poor would otherwise spend on lighting.The keys to Idcol\u2019s expansion across Bangladesh are financing plans that cater to lower-income people, as well as partnerships with 56 grass-roots organizations like the microfinance institution Grameen. These well-established community partners, some of which have worked for decades in Bangladesh, \u201chave the trust and confidence of rural people,\u201d said Zubair K. M. Sadeque, senior energy specialist at the World Bank in Dhaka.They also \u201chave huge clientele so they already have outreach in rural areas to distribute this technology very quickly,\u201d explained Formanul Islam, Idcol\u2019s deputy chief executive until last year (he is now chief executive of the Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund).Indeed, Bangladesh is considered the birthplace of microfinance. The most densely populated country in the world, it is relatively small, making it easier and more efficient to reach people on the ground. About 88 percent of customers pay off their solar equipment on time.Idcol helps its partners train technicians, maintenance staff and consumers. It also handles financing from international development partners, payment plans and quality control on equipment. More than 150 Idcol staff members conduct random checks across the country to ensure that solar systems are properly installed. Partners, who make money from interest paid on loans for solar installations, are responsible for marketing, sales and collections.High-quality standards and rigorous inspection and monitoring processes are critical, said Mr. Sadeque of the World Bank, who praised Idcol\u2019s \u201cmarket-based and performance-linked incentives\u201d and professional staff.Idcol also offers products that low-income people want and can afford. Sixty percent of its solar customers buy the smallest panel, which generates 20 watts \u2014 enough to power two to three LED lights and a cellphone charger. Some customers with larger homes, like Mr. Ali, pay for more solar panels. After a $20 subsidy funded by Idcol\u2019s international development partners, customers pay installments of about $5 a month, including interest of 12 to 15 percent a year.Idcol is a profitable private company, but its renewable energy division has received support from the World Bank, Islamic Development Bank, Global Environmental Facility and the aid agencies of the United States, Germany, Britain and Japan, among others. Subsidies for solar have dropped over the years, from $90 for a solar system in 2003 to $20 now for small installations.Solar panels are warrantied for 20 years, and batteries for three to five years. Seventy-five percent of the panels are made in China with the rest by Bangladeshi suppliers; nearly all the batteries are locally made.By contrast, the home solar market in neighboring India has seen slower growth because of fragmented financing plans, uneven service after sales, and technical weaknesses in batteries and solar lamps. The Indian market also faces diverse and different conditions from state to state, ranging from language to geography.Mr. Ali\u2019s solar installation was facilitated by TMSS, a local nonprofit that does work with microcredit, health and small enterprise, such as agriculture and handicrafts.Abu Sayed, a TMSS manager, remembered that early on it was difficult to convince customers that the solar panels worked. But the nonprofit\u2019s history of working in the area, and Idcol\u2019s emphasis on quality and post-sale maintenance earned people\u2019s trust. TMSS has six loan officers who cover a six-kilometer radius by bicycle. The unit manager visits customers by motorbike.Close connection to customers and the ability to reach them have paid off. As of the summer of 2015, TMSS had installed more than 600 solar units in this village. Loan repayment rates in the area were 98 percent.However, Idcol has hit some bumps. Solar installations have dropped from 90,000 per month a few years ago to 55,000 per month last year, as counterfeit and lower-quality solar products entered the market. To protect its brand and solar\u2019s reputation, the company began ad campaigns warning customers about copycats and poor quality, Mr. Malik of Idcol said.Political upheaval in this turbulent country can also make it difficult to collect monthly installments. Another threat is natural disaster in cyclone-prone coastal Bangladesh. However, many of the small solar panels are detachable and can be put indoors during bad weather. Idcol also has a disaster management fund to help customers affected by cyclones.And with rapid growth has come a shortage of technical staff and high turnover at grass-roots partners, as technicians jump to other organizations with higher salaries.Still, those challenges aren\u2019t curbing the appetite for solar energy in Bangladesh. A stone\u2019s throw from Mr. Ali\u2019s solar-paneled house, Jahanhiger Alam Joy stands inside his tiny store made of wood and corrugated metal. In the intense summer heat, sweat streams down his face. Mr. Joy looks enviously at his neighbor\u2019s roof. He says he also wants a solar panel so he can run a fan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Home Designers Who Actually Move In", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byCANAAN, N.Y. \u2014 Tara Mangini brushed the sawdust off a picnic table, plunked down a package of Good & Plenty and started talking, very fast.As is their habit, they were building and deploying that stuff with carte blanche from the owners to outfit the place right down to its flea-market artwork and vintage hardcover books. Usually, they camp in the houses they renovate, moving from job to job. (Call them nomadic designers.) But this cabin was so small, they were sleeping in an Airbnb.It was early August, and within two weeks the cabin would be transformed. There would be Shaker-style kitchen cabinets made by Mr. Bright. There would be dressers and tables harvested from the Brimfield Antiques Flea Market in Hampden County, Mass., a source as essential to Mr. Bright and Ms. Mangini\u2019s work as Georges Bank is to the regional fishing industry. There would be mismatched antique silver-plate utensils in the kitchen drawers, and the beds would be dressed in neutral-color linens from West Elm and Pine Cone Hill.And there would be napkins and towels and dishes, along with a welcome note written in pencil on a Post-it: \u201cWe hope you love everything in this house as much as we do! Here\u2019s to years of memory making. Love, Jersey Ice Cream Co.\u201dAs Dr. Rachael Bedard, Client No. 3, said: \u201cI was following them on Remodelista and I couldn\u2019t figure out: Were these people famous and expensive and inaccessible or just weirdos from Philly? Were they humans or some kind of reality show?\u201dOutside of reality TV, their methods may be unique in the interior design profession. It\u2019s hard to imagine Mario Buatta or Nate Berkus spending three months sleeping on a mattress in a corner of a client\u2019s farmhouse in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley scraping up old linoleum with a putty knife, or cooking chili in a makeshift outdoor kitchen.In the last four years, Tara Mangini and Percy Bright have camped in (or near) eight houses, moving from job to job and renovating and outfitting each place right down to the dishware. It\u2019s an extreme design method that has earned them the unofficial title of the Homeless Home Designers. The actual name of their business is the Jersey Ice Cream Company, after a vintage embosser they found at the Brimfield Antiques Show on their second or third date.\u00a0Ms. Mangini, elfin and energetic, was once a nerdy teenager, she said, who was voted most likely to be president by her New Jersey high school classmates. She and Mr. Bright, a lanky classics major who burned out on a Ph.D. track and then discovered a talent for graphic design, met just after the recession, in Philadelphia, where he had grown up.Mr. Bright had been laid off from a job in advertising (and she had quit a job in advertising), and both were struggling, existentially. He was collecting unemployment and fixing up a rowhouse he had bought just before he was fired; Ms. Mangini was waiting tables.Two weeks after an epic (and out of character) first date, that lasted more than 12 hours and involved the World Cup and many whiskey shots, Ms. Mangini said, they decided to drive to Brimfield to shop for his house.\u201cAll our friends were like: \u2018No, not a road trip! It\u2019s going to be over!\u2019\u201d Ms. Mangini said. \u201cBut the whole week we were like: \u2018What if we had an Etsy shop? What if we had a store and did our own designs?\u2019 By the end of the trip we\u2019re like: \u2018We\u2019re doing it. And it\u2019s going to be called Jersey Ice Cream Company, because we found this seal.\u2019 We\u2019re reusing everything else. Why not reuse someone\u2019s name?\u201dIt was an accident that led to their first design-camping gig. While racing to move her parked car, Deborah Billinge, now 62, had fallen down the stairs of her Brooklyn apartment and broken her leg. She and her three teenage children had just moved, her husband was in Europe and Ms. Billinge was surrounded by unpacked boxes and hobbling on crutches.She saw Mr. Bright and Ms. Mangini\u2019s sublet makeover on Design Sponge and wrote them: \u201cMaybe you could help me?\u201d And after they did, winningly, she wondered, \u201cMaybe you could help me upstate?\u201d she said recently, recalling the episode. Ms. Billinge and her husband had bought a farmhouse in the Hudson Valley, closing on the place while she was still in the hospital. She had seen the house only twice.\u201cI sent them to pick up the keys, and they moved in,\u201d said Ms. Billinge, who is a landscape designer. \u201cBecause I do gardens, I understood that you can accomplish more when the owner isn\u2019t around. I gave them free rein. I had no choice, but I\u2019d also seen what they could do. They would leave little notes, \u2018We\u2019ve finished this with love.\u2019 It was all very, very emotional. And what a joy to not have to make those decisions, like, if you spend $30 more, you can get this faucet.\u201dWhen the house was finished, after five months of live-in work, it featured what would become Jersey Ice Cream Company signatures: smoky plaster walls, reclaimed wood furniture made by Mr. Bright, a farm-style kitchen with an apron sink, and curated objects and dishware.\u201cIt\u2019s a D.I.Y. ethos with impeccably modern taste,\u201d said Grace Bonney, the founder of Design Sponge.A word about money. Ms. Billinge had a budget of $45,000, out of which the couple paid themselves a scant few thousand dollars each, even though the job took the better part of five months. They have since learned to charge for their time and materials, as other designers do.In late 2013, Dr. Bedard, a geriatric and palliative-care doctor in Manhattan, and Gideon Friedman, 33, a real estate developer, bought a 220-year-old farmhouse in Earlton, N.Y. \u201cWe wanted to do something fantastic,\u201d said Dr. Bedard, 34.Since college, the couple had a fantasy about a communal living space for family and friends they called the Magic Egg. In Earlton, they had found their egg.\u201cTara and Percy came over for lunch,\u201d Dr. Bedard said. \u201cWe made macaroni and cheese, and we just really liked them. At that point, they were still basically homeless, and they moved in upstate and lived there on and off from January to June. It was totally nuts: They moved walls, knocked out closets, laid in floors, built beds.\u201dBetween jobs, the couple traveled: yoga training in Costa Rica, hiking in Argentina, a motorcycle tour of Vietnam. Early on, they had turned Mr. Bright\u2019s house into an Airbnb workhorse, but a few years ago, he sold the place.Is there a trick to getting Jersey Ice Cream Company to take you on as a client?They have to like the house, Ms. Mangini said, and they have to have the time, since the method is serial. A compelling narrative helps.Gary and Karen Schneider, owners of the Canaan, N.Y., cabin, said they emailed them \u201cour sob story.\u201d Mr. Schneider had been working in finance for seven years in Pittsfield, Mass., while his wife and their three daughters lived in Rochester, N.Y., and the cabin, though small, was going to bring the family together at last.The more personal an inquiry is, \u201cThe more of their story they\u2019re willing to expose, the greater the likelihood is that a job will work out,\u201d Ms. Mangini said.This year has been complicated and something of a watershed, as their practice has veered into more traditional design territory. Some new clients have asked for millwork plans, which meant hiring an assistant with computer skills.Finding a place to sleep between jobs has been stressful. For the last five years, Ms. Mangini and Mr. Bright have been living out of suitcases, juggling three storage spaces in two states, and shuffling clothes, antiques and objects.\u201cWe had a kind of breakdown,\u201d said Mr. Bright, and in June rented a one-bedroom apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. It\u2019s now filled with 20 chairs, more or less, a mattress and not much else. By late September, the two had spent less than two weeks there, and not at the same time.That same month, Devin Friedman, 44, the editorial director of GQ (and no relation to Gideon Friedman), and Danielle Pergament, 42, the executive editor of Allure magazine, booked Ms. Mangini and Mr. Bright to build a new kitchen for their late 18th-century farmhouse in the Berkshires. \u201cThey are so funny and so brash,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. \u201cAnd their aesthetic is so great: If you were cool, you would have this stuff in your house.\u201dBut just as they were about to start, Mr. Bright came down with a nasty respiratory infection.\u201cPercy can barely walk, he\u2019s laying on the table,\u201d Ms. Mangini recalled, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s cool. We got this.\u2019 Percy\u2019s like, \u2018I have to go to a hospital.\u2019 And, fun fact: I don\u2019t drive.\u201dMr. Bright recovered, the couple made a Brimfield run in July, and by early August they had finished Mr. Friedman and Ms. Pergament\u2019s kitchen (Mr. Friedman was particularly impressed with the accessories: succulents in weathered clay pots) and were knee-deep in the Canaan cabin.They had more help than usual: Amber Jane Eaton, 24, who had become a fan from following them on Instagram, drove from Crane, Tex., to work free.Ms. Mangini and Mr. Bright are pining a bit, they said, for their leaner days. In a few weeks, they will return to a complicated job in the Hamptons, after having spent late August and all of September working on a lovely shingled house in Rockport, Me.In Long Island, an architect is involved, along with a landscape architect, a lighting designer and the owners themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s made us appreciate how we normally work,\u201d Ms. Mangini said. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird having clients have the final say in everything.\u201dThe job has also made them realize, she said emphatically, that they do not want to become a traditional design practice or morph into a larger company.A few months ago, when they were in Philadelphia working on the new studio apartment Mr. Bright had bought to run as an Airbnb, they posted this rather mournful Instagram update: \u201cBack to basics today and it feels so good. Just two kids, some orbital sanders, dirty chambray shirts and TGIF pizza guiding the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His hair has silvered, and he walks with the hint of a stoop, but his grin and manner were impish. Had it really been necessary to miss a minute of his movie? Could I come to the next screening to see it in its entirety? \u201cI am very close to someone who has the same bathroom issues as you,\u201d he said in a stage whisper. It was a little strange, a little awkward and I felt a little charmed and also somewhat captive. At his peak, Mr. Beatty was the epitome of Hollywood new and old; a larger-than-life matinee idol, lover boy and filmmaker whose work kick-started cinema\u2019s new Golden Age in the 1970s, making him evermore a big deal. Now, six decades into his career, it was clear that Mr. Beatty still wanted to \u2014 and did \u2014 hold sway.\u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply\u201d is Mr. Beatty\u2019s first film in 15 years and the first one he has written, directed and starred in since \u201cBulworth\u201d (1998), a withering take on money in politics that feels more relevant than ever today. The new film has been kicking around Mr. Beatty\u2019s noggin for decades, and it is sort of about Howard Hughes, although Mr. Beatty, who plays Hughes, does not want it described that way.\u201cStop calling it a Howard Hughes movie!\u201d he commanded, a few weeks later, during our marathon interview at the sprawling house he shares with his wife, Annette Bening, and whichever of their four mostly grown children happen to be home.\u201cCall it a movie about Hollywood in 1958,\u201d he continued. \u201cOld Hollywood. Warren Beatty\u2019s Hollywood. Warren Beatty\u2019s old Hollywood. Or old Warren Beatty\u2019s Hollywood.\u201dThe movie is about an aspiring actress, Marla (Lily Collins), and an ambitious chauffeur, Frank (Alden Ehrenreich), who are employed by an increasingly delusional Hughes, and forbidden, by his decree, to act on their budding love. Hughes has long intrigued Mr. Beatty, who, like the reclusive millionaire, knows both the freedom afforded by piles of money and the access to power brokers that fame allows. And, like Marla and Frank, Mr. Beatty arrived in Hollywood in the late \u201950s from a small town, Protestant background.\u201cYou could say maybe I\u2019m more interested in myself than Howard Hughes,\u201d Mr. Beatty said.Part of what drove Mr. Beatty\u2019s interest in Howard Hughes was how the millionaire shrouded himself in mystery, which amused Mr. Beatty greatly. \u201cNobody was trying to get him, but he wanted them to try and get him,\u201d Mr. Beatty said. \u201cHe wanted them to be more curious.\u201dWe also spent two hours talking before he consented to being recorded. Inquisitive and engaging, Mr. Beatty said he wanted to get to know me. But when he finally did go on the record, the colorful tales vanished, the free-flowing chat dried up, and his speech became so tortuously stilted that I had to ask why he was suddenly talking like a robot. \u201cIf you think I am being careful, you are correct,\u201d he said in a slow drip.As it turned out, the length of the interview \u2014 unheard-of by today\u2019s standards \u2014 was no aberration. The man likes to take his time.Five years passed between the time Mr. Beatty met Mr. Ehrenreich and gave him the part in \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201d\u201cWe kept having extensive dinners and lunches, and he flew me to New York, and we once had dessert with Bill Clinton,\u201d Mr. Ehrenreich said. Whenever Ms. Collins met Mr. Beatty for lunch, she knew to clear her afternoon. \u201cI learned very quickly it\u2019s a lunch, but it\u2019s also a day,\u201d she said. He was painstaking in prop placement, and it was not unusual for discussions about a line of dialogue to last hours. \u201cHe also would direct in character,\u201d Mr. Ehrenreich said. \u201cHe would give you notes as Howard Hughes.\u201dAs he does with all of his movies \u2014 and his life \u2014 Mr. Beatty also remained in firm control of the project throughout. New Regency helped him put together the $26 million in financing and also secured distribution though Fox. Production wrapped in 2014, and though Mr. Beatty could have probably edited it forever, he knew to stop himself. \u201cA poem is never finished, it\u2019s only abandoned,\u201d he said, paraphrasing Paul Val\u00e9ry (he said the same in Vanity Fair). \u201cIt would be possible to go on forever with a poem, a movie or a song.\u201dEvery detail about Hughes in the film came from stories relayed to Mr. Beatty over the years, though the veracity of each is suspect. The film admits as much, starting with a title card that quotes Hughes: \u201cNever check an interesting fact.\u201d\u201cI think \u2018love\u2019 is the key word here,\u201d Mr. Beatty said of his womanizing days. \u201cMaking love is a good thing, not a bad thing. And I got lucky late. Not that I wasn\u2019t lucky earlier. When I say lucky, I\u2019m talking about my wife.\u201d\u201cI have compared this to, ugh, vomiting,\u201d Mr. Beatty said of moviemaking. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I like to vomit. I do not like to vomit, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I vomited.\u201d He continued, \u201cWith a certain idea, I get to the point where I say, \u2018Well, maybe I would feel a lot better if I just went ahead and threw up.\u2019 [Laughs]. And then I throw up.\u201dAnd does he feel better?\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve taken paydays,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the pictures that I have produced or have been in control of, yeah, I felt much better.\u201dEarly reactions to the new film have been glowing, he said, at least those made to Mr. Beatty\u2019s face, though he conceded that he can\u2019t tell if people were being polite and truthful. He certainly seems up for marketing the film and arrived in New York for yet another screening (which I successfully sat through all the way, parched).Afterward, he whisked me off for a light supper at the Carlyle. We settled into a banquette, I began recording, asked whether he paid attention to reviews and waited. He cleared his throat. Silverware scraped plates. A distant piano tinkled. \u201cYeah,\u201d he finally said. He muttered something about Rotten Tomatoes, asked me to stop recording and, after I did, he began talking again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Canada and E.U. Sign Trade Deal, Bucking Resistance to Globalization", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byCanada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had been forced to call off an earlier trip to sign the deal after Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, used its veto to withhold Belgium\u2019s approval of the deal. The pact required the support of all 28 European Union countries.Mr. Trudeau signed the pact on Sunday, joined by Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of the member states; Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, which holds the rotating presidency of the body that runs the bloc\u2019s ministerial meetings; and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm.The deal will help to demonstrate that \u201ctrade is good for the middle class and those working hard to join it,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Brussels. Mr. Trudeau said he wanted to \u201cmake sure that everyone gets that this is a good thing for our economies but it\u2019s also a good example to the world.\u201dBut the Walloon intransigence has underlined the extent to which trade has become politically radioactive as citizens increasingly blame globalization for growing disparities in wealth and living standards. Across Europe and the United States, opposition to trade has become a rallying point for populist movements on the left and the right, threatening to upend the established political order.A compromise among the regions of Belgium, which persuaded Wallonia to drop its veto, called for language to clarify the handling of trade complaints brought by Canadian or European companies.Belgium pledged to refer the arbitration system to the Court of Justice of the European Union, where judges can assess its legality.That much larger deal, known as T.T.I.P., has already stalled amid opposition from large numbers of Europeans, including many Germans and Austrians. The protesters see the Canadian deal as a warm-up for a much larger battle.The spectacle of tiny Wallonia, with just 3.6 million people, holding up a deal that affects more than 500 million Europeans and 35 million Canadians and prompting European Union leaders to delay a summit meeting has rattled Western leaders.\u201cNow that we see the Canadian deal has made it over the finish line, the Atlantic trade deal still has a fighting chance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be easy. T.T.I.P. could similarly threaten traditional farming interests and arouse knee-jerk European suspicions about common trans-Atlantic health and environmental standards.\u201dAs a legal matter, the member states\u2019 legislatures still need to ratify the Canadian agreement. That could mean more hiccups before it goes into effect.Mr. Tusk, of the European Council, said he was cautiously optimistic that the deal would survive the ratification process and could send a positive message about globalization.\u201cToday\u2019s decisions demonstrate that the disintegration of the Western community does not need to become a lasting trend,\u201d Mr. Tusk said. \u201cFree trade and globalization have protected hundreds of millions of people from poverty and hunger. The problem is that few people believe this.\u201dEurope, Mr. Lee-Makiyama said, is pivoting to a position as \u201cneither an ally of East nor West.\u201dOnce ratified, the Canadian deal would cut many tariffs on industrial goods and on farm and food items, according to the European Commission. The deal also would open up the services sector in areas like cargo shipping, maritime services and finance to European firms, the commission said.The Canadian deal is also regarded by trade advocates as a template for advanced, industrial economies by making it easier for their regulators to recognize one another\u2019s rules, and by updating the rules on how companies can make sure governments protect their investments.If the Obama administration has its way, the next major regional trade accord to make it over the finish line will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes the United States, Canada, Japan and Vietnam.The Pacific deal \u2014 largely because it involves a number of emerging economies \u2014 is a more traditional trade accord aimed mainly at cutting tariffs and knocking down impediments to trade.But like the Europeans, many Americans do not want to make concessions that would lower wages or threaten jobs at home. The Asia-Pacific deal has become a hot issue in the United States presidential election; both major-party nominees, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, oppose it.Mr. Funk Kirkegaard, the senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said he gave the Pacific deal about a 30 percent chance of being concluded while President Obama is still in office. \u201cBeyond January,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s all dependent on the results of the election and who\u2019s the next president.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is also the union of their data. And when they divorce, the data often gets spilled.Divorce lawyers and data analysts interviewed on Monday said less public versions of this story play out all the time.\u201cThe problem is, once they\u2019ve already engaged in bad behavior, it\u2019s out there,\u201d said John Slowiaczek, the president-elect of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. \u201cYou can\u2019t recapture it, you can\u2019t bury it.\u201dNo matter a person\u2019s level of technical skill, it can be difficult to hide digital behavior from a spouse, a spouse\u2019s lawyers or, in Mr. Weiner\u2019s case, federal investigators.Nancy Berg, the president of the International Academy of Family Lawyers and a partner at the law firm Berg, Debele, DeSmidt & Rabuse, said that it was not uncommon to see situations like that of Ms. Abedin\u2019s, where, she said, \u201cher husband\u2019s garbage is destroying her life.\u201dIn divorce proceedings, lawyers and investigators routinely mine public social media profiles for a glimpse into the activities of the client\u2019s spouse.But their investigations go far beyond that, as they sift through whatever data they can legally obtain for signs of hidden assets or to catch the spouse in a significant lie. Lawyers are likely more focused on questions of finance and child custody than lurid questions of adultery or betrayal.Even so, a computer \u201ctells you everything about a person\u2019s character,\u201d said Brook Schaub, a forensic analyst and licensed private investigator at the accounting firm Eide Bailly. It has \u201cbecome the file cabinet, the stationery, the social networking, the everything,\u201d he said.The data that can become publicly available depends largely on the individuals\u2019 penchant for privacy and how careful they have been. Even those who value privacy during the relationship are at risk of the former spouse finding sensitive data.The first steps taken after the divorce process begins can be critical.Christine Leatherberry, a family lawyer in Dallas, said she recommended that her divorce clients create a new email account, stop sharing calendars and turn off the ability for apps on their phones to track their locations.Someone committed to finding embarrassing or otherwise discrediting information about a spouse can most likely find a way, especially if he or she is willing to flout the law. Such revelations may not be admissible in court, but they could bring professional ramifications or personal embarrassment.Take, for instance, the security questions that most important digital accounts, including email and banking, use to recover passwords if forgotten. Identifying your mother\u2019s maiden name or the street you grew up on might foil distant identity thieves, but not a spouse.Annette Burns, a family lawyer in Phoenix, suggested concocting untruthful answers that you could remember but that no one else could guess.Frank Rudewicz, a principal at Marcum L.L.P. of Boston who focuses on forensic practice, said people had gone so far as to install malware on a spouse\u2019s computer that would log keystrokes.But there are also fully innocent and legal ways that a spouse can gain access to what was thought to be private data, especially among those lacking savvy with their technology.As an example, a text message could go simultaneously to a phone and an iPad that was left with children or a former spouse, something many people forget or don\u2019t know, especially if they didn\u2019t set the devices up themselves.\u201cIt\u2019s so convenient to have our texts pop up all over, and all of our computers synced,\u201d Ms. Burns said. \u201cBut if one of those computers is left at home, that means your separated spouse has access to everything.\u201dMr. Slowiaczek said that the trend of social media evidence in divorce cases had started between five and eight years ago and had picked up \u201cdramatically\u201d over the last three to five years.He said evidence from social media was a \u201cprimary source for virtually anyone who has any divorce practice whatsoever, for getting information not only to understand our own clients, but also to understand the dynamics of people on the other side of a case.\u201dMr. Schaub described a case he had handled in which a father who had been unemployed for several years had claimed that he had been acting as a \u201cMr. Mom.\u201d His computer use revealed a different story.\u201dHis activity during the day is not dedicated to doting on the kids, it\u2019s sitting at the computer, doing various things,\u201d Mr. Schaub said, whether that be viewing pornography or racking up debts on online poker sites.Ms. Leatherberry said she did not recommend people who have filed for divorce delete photos, texts or social media posts, because that could be considered destruction of evidence. But people should be aware that lawyers introduce text messages and social media posts into almost all of their hearings and trials, she said.\u201cAnything they put in a text or an email or in social media, assume it will be blown up onto a poster board in a courtroom one day,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ignoring the Debt Problem", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsTogether, the two of us have 179 years of life experience and 13 grandchildren. We have served presidents of both parties. We have seen more campaign seasons than we care to count \u2014 but none as strange as this one.Insults, invective and pandering have been poor substitutes for serious debate about the direction in which this country is going \u2014 or should be going. And a sound and sustainable fiscal structure is a key ingredient of any viable economic policy.Yes, this country can handle the nearly $600 billion federal deficit estimated for 2016. But the deficit has grown sharply this year, and will keep the national debt at about 75 percent of the gross domestic product, a ratio not seen since 1950, after the budget ballooned during World War II.Long-term, that continued growth, driven by our tax and spending policies, will create the most significant fiscal challenge facing our country. The widely respected Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by midcentury our debt will rise to 140 percent of G.D.P., far above that in any previous era, even in times of war.Unfortunately, despite a brief discussion during the final presidential debate, neither candidate has put forward a convincing plan to restrain the growth of the national debt in the decades to come.Throughout the campaign, Donald J. Trump has called for a combination of deep tax cuts that appear to far exceed proposed spending reductions, at the clear risk of substantially increasing the ratio of debt to G.D.P. Hillary Clinton has set out more balanced and detailed proposals, but they would still fail to stabilize and reduce our debt burden.Whoever wins, the new president will eventually face fiscal realities that force him or her to develop strategies for decreasing the national debt as a share of the economy over the long term.Our current debt may be manageable at a time of unprecedentedly low interest rates. But if we let our debt grow, and interest rates normalize, the interest burden alone would choke our budget and squeeze out other essential spending. There would be no room for the infrastructure programs and the defense rebuilding that today have wide support.It\u2019s not just federal spending that would be squeezed. The projected rise in federal deficits would compete for funds in our capital markets and far outrun the private sector\u2019s capacity to save, to finance industry and home purchases, and to invest abroad.Instead, we\u2019d be dependent on foreign investors\u2019 acquiring most of our debt \u2014 making the government dependent on the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d who may not be so kind as the I.O.U.s mount up.We can\u2019t let that happen \u2014 not if we want an America that is able to provide growth and stability at home while maintaining global leadership. We would risk returning with a vengeance to stagflation \u2014 the ugly combination of inflation and economic stagnation that we tasted in the 1970s.The solutions are clear enough. A realistic approach toward the major entitlement programs is required, given that they are projected to account for all of the growth of future noninterest spending.We should make gradual adjustments to the Social Security system that still maintain present benefit levels for those at or near retirement, with particular attention to those most in need. Our health care systems can be made more efficient, with better approaches toward cost control. Since health care represents 70 percent of the growth of our major entitlement programs over the next 30 years, bending the cost curve is essential to the long-term well-being of our economy.It\u2019s no secret that our federal tax system is broken \u2014 unfair, inefficient and prone to political manipulation. It\u2019s filled with exclusions, deductions, exemptions and preferential rates \u2014 so-called tax expenditures \u2014 that are ripe for reform. Those policies cost about $1.5 trillion each year and disproportionately benefit the well off. Tax reform could provide better incentives for economic growth, while raising more revenue, even as the code is simplified.But we face an immutable fact. Fair and responsible reforms will take years to implement. And businesses and individuals will need time to adjust.Delaying action now will make the needed changes only more painful and difficult later on, while also increasing the risk of financial crisis before the reforms are even made. That is why the real debate should begin immediately.Yet at the final presidential debate, both candidates missed the opportunity to clearly lay out their visions for a fiscally responsible, long-term future for our country. There\u2019s still time to solve this problem. But our next president needs to show leadership in the first months.At our age, neither of us will personally suffer from a failure to act. It is those with long lives ahead \u2014 grandchildren and great-grandchildren \u2014 who deserve the benefit of prospering in a nation with sound finances.Take some advice from two observers who have been around for a while: The long term gets here before you know it.Paul A. Volcker is chairman of the Volcker Alliance and a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Peter G. Peterson is founder and chairman of the Peter G.

The next year the 4,260-square-foot concrete-and-wood residence was a finalist in the Georgie Awards from the Canadian Home Builders\u2019 Association of British Columbia. It has geothermal heating, exposed fir beams, Gaulhofer sliding windows and Brazilian cherry wood floors.The open kitchen has Brazilian cherry wood cabinetry, stainless-steel appliances and a window backsplash. Blue eyes granite tops the counters and center island. A breakfast area shares a double-sided gas fireplace with the living room, which opens to a private courtyard. A black basalt stone fireplace punctuates a wall of windows in the formal dining room.A glass-walled walkway connects the entertaining spaces to the master suite, an office with an en-suite bath and fireplace, and a private glass-covered deck leading to a hot tub and garden. In the limestone-and-marble-lined master bath, a Mayan shellstone countertop has two vessel sinks. The steam shower has a bench; the tub is separate.Off the foyer, a powder room with tumbled marble floor tiles has a polished black fossil limestone countertop. Each of the two guest wing bedrooms has floor-to-ceiling windows and opens to the yard. En-suite baths have polished Mayan shellstone counters and showers with Mexican ceramic tiles.On the lower level is a media/game room with a wet bar, a bedroom and a hall bath with a tub/shower enclosure and a workshop. A temperature-controlled wine cellar has racks for 658 bottles.A two-car attached garage opens to a mudroom and laundry room.Used as a deck, a flat, green roof (with grass and vegetation) sits atop the garage. The guest wing is adjacent to the garage, through the laundry room and mudroom. The roof deck is accessible by stone steps from a ground-level sitting area. Roofs on the rest of the house are metal.This house, on a slightly more than half-acre lot, is in the mountainside Taluswood development with easy ski access to Whistler slopes. It is a five-minute drive to parking on the perimeter of the pedestrian-only village\u2019s boutiques, restaurants, spas and hotels, and equally close to Creekside village. The 75-mile drive north from Vancouver International Airport to Whistler takes about two and a half hours along the Sea to Sky Highway.MARKET OVERVIEWThe Whistler real estate market was touched by the 2008 global financial downturn, but the anticipation of the 2010 Winter Olympics temporarily lessened the effect.\u201cWe weren\u2019t hit as hard as other resort areas,\u201d Ms. Thornhill said.After the Olympics, a swell of listings caused a 25 percent price drop, according to Craig Mackenzie, an agent with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Canada.But since the last ski season, fueled by a strong economy in Vancouver, demand has outstripped supply and prices rose sharply. There is a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d for homes under a million Canadian dollars, Ms. Thornhill said, helped by a favorable exchange rate and low interest rates.Whistler is experiencing \u201ca seller\u2019s market,\u201d said Patrick Kelly, the president of the Whistler Real Estate Company. With about 250 listings, well below historical levels of 600 to 700, properties move \u201cpretty rapidly,\u201d he said.Sixty to 70 percent of demand is for townhouses or condominiums; about half for properties that can be rented nightly, according to Mr. Kelly.\u201cWe are seeing bidding wars,\u201d Mr. Mackenzie said, adding that about 5 percent of properties are selling over the asking price.The \u201cbest value\u201d is in the luxury market for homes 3 million Canadian dollars and up, where sales are \u201ca little slower,\u201d Ms. Thornhill said.The priciest listing, at 16.5 million Canadian dollars (about $12.35 million) is a 12,000-square-foot house on a lot two-thirds of an acre close to the village, Mr. Mackenzie said. One-bedroom condos start around 400,000 Canadian dollars (around $299,500).Though Whistler has \u201cvery severe restrictions\u201d on growth and development, many 1970s kit-built A-frame and Gothic arch houses, 800 to 1,200 square feet, are being knocked down and replaced with conventional homes up to 3,500 square feet, Mr. Mackenzie said.The Athletes\u2019 Village from the 2010 Winter Olympics now provides housing for locals.WHO BUYS IN WHISTLERVancouver residents who want a weekend home near the ski slopes or by Whistler\u2019s five lakes make up the bulk of buyers, agents say, followed by purchasers from the United States, largely Seattle and California.International buyers, which make up 20 percent of the market, also come from Hong Kong, China, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and Britain.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign buyers, but Ian Davis, a lawyer with Race and Company based in Whistler, said it is \u201cnot quite so simple\u201d for foreign owners to sell. Foreign owners have to go through a federal \u201ctax clearance process\u201d during which up to 50 percent of sales proceeds can be held up to four months.It is generally \u201ca little more difficult\u201d for foreign buyers than local residents to get financing. Foreigners can receive up to about 65 percent of the purchase price compared with 80 percent for Canadians, Mr. Davis said.Property transfer taxes start at 1 percent of the first 200,000 Canadian dollars, 2 percent of the next 1.8 million, and 3 percent over 2 million.A goods and services tax equal to 5 percent of the value of the property is levied on new construction and triggered on resales used as vacation rentals by the current owner. Buyers who don\u2019t want to rent out their property, should instruct the real estate agent \u201cto look for properties that haven\u2019t rented before\u201d and are exempt from the goods and services tax, Mr. Davis said.TAXES AND FEESAnnual taxes on this property were 15,188 Canadian dollars ($11,374) for 2016, according to Ms. Thornhill.Legal fees are charged on a sliding scale, with a base fee of 1,100 Canadian dollars; closer to 1,500 if a mortgage is involved, Mr. Davis said. Title insurance, registration and search charges add another 500. Tax on legal fees is 12 percent.Real estate agent commissions, usually paid by the seller, vary from 6.5 to 7.5 percent of the first 100,000 Canadian dollars, with 2.5 to 3.5 percent charged on the balance.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, French; dollar (1 Canadian dollar = $0.75)CONTACTAdvertisement"}

This was colorful music \u2014 Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse,\u201d Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d and a closing assortment of dance-themed bonbons, some more tightly executed than others \u2014 that here often lacked color. (And why is the roster so overwhelmingly male?)But the musicians were visibly having the time of their lives. You would not know \u2014 sitting among the gown- and tuxedo-clad crowd \u2014 that these artists\u2019 home country is grievously suffering. In brief remarks from the stage that focused on his and the players\u2019 love of, and joy in, music, Mr. Dudamel dropped an oblique reference to \u201cthe troubling times we are living in,\u201d and that was that.But is that enough? It is a question that has dogged Mr. Dudamel\u2019s career. The smiling international face of El Sistema, he has come under criticism for remaining a largely silent (and therefore acquiescent) beneficiary of government support.There are no easy answers, either for Mr. Dudamel or for us, to these kinds of ethical quandaries. And this is hardly the first time we\u2019ve had to check our moral compasses as classical listeners. Mr. Dudamel has strained to remain above the partisan fray. But what are we to make of the more overt, unapologetic political activity of the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a very public booster for Vladimir V. Putin, who was advocating anti-gay laws and squeezing any political dissent as he remains a crucial ally of Mr. Gergiev\u2019s Mariinsky Theater?When Soviet artists toured America during the Cold War, were they thawing a conflict, or were they whitewashing human-rights violations? Even if a repressive government is far different from a powerful individual, many have objected to the policy positions and political actions of the industrialist David H. Koch. Should these people\u2019s feelings about Mr. Koch affect their enjoyment of New York City Ballet, which performs at the David H. Koch Theater?But there is no disentangling the performance of classical music from a state of political affairs that many object to. If we want art \u2014 and we should \u2014 we need to realize that purity in this regard is impossible.So I don\u2019t think it makes sense, for example, to boycott City Ballet to avoid the Koch Theater. But neither should its name be ignored. If you want to cheer the Bol\u00edvars\u2019 signature spirited rendition of \u201cMambo,\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d I would say that it is your responsibility also to learn about \u2014 and in some way keep in mind as they play \u2014 the situation facing their countrymen.When you go to the symphony, study the list of donors in the playbill and Google their professional activities. If these days we insist on knowing the farm our restaurant chicken comes from, why shouldn\u2019t we know the doings of the private-equity firms supporting our orchestras?The key for contemporary listeners is to keep not just our ears open, but also our eyes. There is no such thing as apolitical culture \u2014 Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse,\u201d for one thing, lurches like the nauseating World War I hangover that it is. And there should be no such thing as apolitical culture consumers.\u201cIn El Sistema\u2019s orchestras,\u201d Mr. Dudamel wrote last year, \u201cthe son of an opposition leader and the daughter of a government minister may sit next to each other creating beautiful music. In that moment, they know no politics.\u201dWe in the audience should not grant ourselves the same luxury.Advertisement"}

DiNapoli, the state comptroller, said the industry \u2014 one of the city\u2019s and state\u2019s biggest economic drivers \u2014 appears poised to benefit from a recent trend in large mergers and positive economic news, like the American economy\u2019s third-quarter growth of 2.9 percent reported on Friday. Wall Street reaps revenue from advising on deals as well as trading for clients, and robust deal activity and an expanding economy would bolster those businesses.\u201cOf course, no one has a crystal ball, and we know volatility is the name of the game. At this point, we just don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that causes concern,\u201d Mr. DiNapoli said on a conference call Friday. \u201cI guess we see some overall signs as far as the economy that are positive. We expect Wall Street will benefit from that.\u201dBut Wall Street is not as dominant a factor in the everyday economy of New York City as it used to be. The securities industry cut 8 percent of its jobs from 2007 to 2015, while other private sector jobs grew 17 percent. From 2010 to last year, Wall Street accounted for 11 percent of wage growth, far less than the 39 percent attributed to it from 1990 to 2007.Technology, advertising, media and information and business services have picked up the slack, the report said.And New York City had 19 percent of the securities industry jobs nationwide last year, down from 32 percent in 1990. Texas and Pennsylvania have picked up the most securities industry jobs from 2010 to 2015, the comptroller\u2019s report notes.Still, the average salary of a New York securities industry employee dwarfs that of other local private sector workers even though salaries have been declining, falling another 4 percent last year, to $388,000. That compares with the average salary of $74,100 for other private sector workers.Bonuses are a big guessing game because factors can shift quickly as companies close their books on the year. Last year\u2019s bonuses were down for the second consecutive year, falling 9 percent to an average of $146,000.Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm, projected in August that incentive pay for investment bankers could fall 5 percent to 25 percent this year, while for traders, it could drop 5 percent to 15 percent.The finance industry is a crucial component of the state\u2019s and city\u2019s annual tax revenue, with profits on the line for luxury retailers, restaurants and real estate, among other industries that feel the ripple effects from Wall Street\u2019s waxing and waning fortunes. The securities industry accounted for 18.5 percent of the state\u2019s tax collections last year and 7 percent of the city\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Medical Charities Once Advised on Coping With a Disease. Now They Try to Cure It.", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byGiving Special SectionWASHINGTON \u2014 Like every mother who has a sick child, Katie Clapp remembers with painful clarity the moment 24 years ago when her doctor called to say that her young son, Andy, had Fragile X, an inherited disease that causes intellectual disability.Ms. Clapp did not give up on Andy, and within two years she helped establish a foundation that has spent decades and millions of dollars on research for a cure.At the time, that kind of response was rare. Medical and disease charities once focused almost entirely on raising awareness and encouraging prevention, leaving the search for cures to the imperfect and often serendipitous interplay among government agencies, university researchers and drug companies.No more. Driven by the sequencing of the human genome and the rise of social media, thousands of charities have sprung up in recent years with the explicit goal of underwriting, coordinating and even overseeing the research for cures.The new organizations, known as venture philanthropies, have transformed basic medical research, drug discovery and the medicine approval process.\u201cTwenty years ago, just about the only thing disease foundations could do was to share experiences about how to care for kids with these terrible diseases,\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in a phone interview. \u201cNow, their aspirations are to come up with real solutions and maybe even cures.\u201dDr. Collins\u2019s career illustrates the transformation. In 1989 he was on a team that identified the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, an advance many at the time hoped would lead to the rapid development of a cure. But 10 years later, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation was so frustrated by the lack of treatments that it made the risky decision to invest millions in a small California biotechnology company.That investment, which eventually grew to $150 million, led to the approval in 2012 and 2015 of breakthrough treatments, and in 2014 the foundation sold its rights to future royalties for $3.3 billion, which it will use for additional investments.\u201cMost rare-disease organizations are not going to have the ability to raise that kind of money,\u201d Dr. Collins cautioned.Smaller charities like Ms. Clapp\u2019s Fraxa Research Foundation are involved in efforts to fund research assistants who search university laboratories for projects biotechnicians could adopt and drive toward a cure.\u201cI will take a motivated mom over 10 scientists,\u201d Dr. Austin said. \u201cSome of these people are forces of nature.\u201d\u201cWhen we partner with a company, it\u2019s a business alliance with a contract, milestones and deliverables,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis resonates with some donors.\u201dPerhaps even more remarkable, foundations are increasingly playing a role in the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval process. Dr. Richard Pazdur, the drug agency\u2019s cancer chief, said in an interview that he now met routinely with foundations.\u201cThey\u2019ve become so sophisticated and interested in the science that we discuss clinical trial design and even potential registration strategies with them,\u201d Dr. Pazdur said.Disease charities are only about a century old. The American Lung Association was founded in 1904, largely to fight tuberculosis, but it soon turned its attention to the prevention of lung cancer. The American Cancer Society was founded in 1913 to fight the stigma associated with cancer and promote early diagnosis.In the 1980s, researchers understood the genetic basis of only a handful of diseases, Dr. Collins said. After the Human Genome Project, that number has grown to roughly 5,800, he said, with a similar number of rare disease charities being founded to research them and to be patient advocates.But venture philanthropy also has risks. Collaborating with drug companies, for instance, can create conflicts in organizations\u2019 advocacy for patients and their families. Some foundations have effectively become lobbying arms of drug makers. For example, Kalydeco, the drug underwritten by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, was priced at more than $300,000 a year. The high price was an important reason the foundation was paid more than $3 billion.She enrolled Andy in the study and was convinced he was improving. He spoke seven-word sentences instead of solely three-word ones. He became social and happy.Then Andy seemed to regress, and the Novartis trial proved a failure, plunging Ms. Clapp into despair. Her foundation is now financing grants to discover what went wrong. Andy, now 27, is back to speaking in three-word sentences and has lost the sociability he briefly experienced.\u201cI was really sad, and it took me awhile to bounce back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the end the trial gave me hope because now we know improvement is possible, and that it\u2019s not too late: I saw how Andy could be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She had started out creating gluten-free muffin mixes in her living room in North Carolina, and by that time had \u201cthree baking mixes in two to three stores.\u201dThe mentors and guidance provided by the accelerator convinced Ms. Smith that she could be the Betty Crocker of clean eating.\u201cI never thought about how big I could get,\u201d she said.She came up with the business concept while working at Deloitte, before starting as a student at Booth, but the accelerator, and the cash prize that came with it, helped her take the next step with her start-up.Within months of entering the program, Ms. Smith competed against 100 other teams and was awarded some $30,000 in 2014. Since then, she has increased her business\u2019s sales exponentially.Her business, now called Simple Mills, has products in more than 5,000 stores and her company has raised $5 million to date. She would not disclose annual sales.Ms. Smith is on a leave of absence from business school as she works to expand her business.Like many entrepreneurs with little business experience, she sought help when she was relatively young.\u201cI was 23 when I had the idea for Simple Mills and was 24 when I won the challenge,\u201d Ms. Smith recalled. \u201cI was attracted to Booth\u2019s program for the number of resources available to entrepreneurs.\u201dAlthough definitions vary, there are more than 230 accelerator programs worldwide that have provided $19 billion in funding for more than 6,000 companies to date, according to Seed-DB.com, which provides information on accelerators nationwide.Out of the 160 accelerators based in the United States, about 35 programs are connected to universities.In essence, accelerators aid start-ups with funding, mentorship and, often, office space. They all provide an essential advantage for any entrepreneur: comprehensive support.She added that 40 percent of companies at accelerators raise $250,000 or more in angel or venture capital funding \u2014 an indication that the programs are giving entrepreneurs a leg up.\u201cIt\u2019s like a crucible,\u201d Professor Kaplan said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly intense and tough.\u201dThe winners are chosen in June and a total of $250,000 is spread among the 10 finalists. The amounts given can vary. \u201cLast year, the winner received $90,000 of the $250,000,\u201d he said.Occasionally an accelerator can produce a superstar.GrubHub went public two years ago, one of only a handful of start-ups to do so.Mr. Maloney said the accelerator helped him refine and build on his idea for GrubHub, which had signed on only 100 Chicago restaurants when he went to Booth.\u201cI knew I had something,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know what it was. I met a lot of smart, hyper-educated people trying to solve the same problem.\u201d\u201cThe mentoring is the linchpin,\u201d Mr. Maloney said. \u201cThe key benefit of the program was being able to model and communicate the power of the business.\u201dStill, not all accelerators are equal. Mr. Maloney\u2019s advice for start-up owners who are considering one is to look at the people involved. Ms. Smith recommends examining the kind of experienced entrepreneurs the accelerator works with and how much one-on-one advising is offered.Not all would-be start-ups can get in. Most programs have a competitive selection process. At New Venture Challenge, for example, two-thirds of those who apply do not make the final cut. Accelerators affiliated with business schools typically require participants to be enrolled students.The programs may also require an investment stake in companies, \u201cgenerally about 5 percent to 10 percent of investment capital in exchange for seed capital \u2014 usually between $15,000 to $25,000\u201d \u2014 according to Amisha Miller, a senior program officer with the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City, Mo., which researches entrepreneurial activity.Ms. Smith said she found it \u201cinvaluable\u201d that her program included a network of people who were also entrepreneurs at various levels. Some were already involved in start-ups, so she could trade notes with them and gain support. These businesspeople were also in a position to offer funding as angel investors.\u201cI love working with other student entrepreneurs to help them think about their businesses,\u201d Ms. Smith added. \u201cI would probably still have Simple Mills, but I\u2019m not sure it would be anywhere near as big.\u201dThe program at the University of Chicago, she said, \u201chelped me realize just how big this could be and to run after that dream.\u201dThese independent entities usually offer co-working spaces; classes in business formation, marketing and funding; and opportunities for networking. Some who have participated advise picking one that offers soup-to-nuts support, including technical advice and access to funding.Above all, experts advised, make sure the support network of the accelerator is going to work with your personality and business model. Some may be too aggressive, while others provide only meager guidance.\u201cThe top two qualities of the best accelerators for you,\u201d Professor Hochberg said, \u201care fit and experience of the mentors and managing directors.

It is the sort of concentrated power that helped give rise to opponents like Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders.A handful of conglomerates already command most of the American media market. Their influence could grow soon. The media tycoon Sumner Redstone wants his Viacom and CBS to merge. AT&T\u2019s bid to acquire Time Warner would unite one of the largest American telecommunications operators with the owner of HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio. AT&T also recently bought the satellite-TV provider DirecTV.Political opposition has been swift. Mr. Trump, who lags in the polls but nevertheless appears set to win support from at least four out of 10 American voters, said combining AT&T and Time Warner represented an example of the sort of dominant structures he is fighting. He vowed to block the deal and try to break up Comcast\u2019s acquisition of NBCUniversal, a transaction completed in the more sedate political climate of 2013.Mr. Sanders, an influential progressive known for hammering Wall Street, said hours after the AT&T deal was unveiled over the weekend that it should be killed.

{"Headline": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Governor Warns of Fiscal \u2018Death Spiral\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byReach for your wallets. It is going to be expensive to pull America\u2019s largest territory out of its death spiral, Puerto Rico\u2019s outgoing governor warned the island\u2019s new federal oversight board on Friday.He urged the board\u2019s seven members to join him \u201cin one voice before Congress\u201d to seek help.Twenty floors below the room in Lower Manhattan where the governor made his remarks, protesters chanted their opposition to colonialism \u2014 which is how they view the power that the panel holds to make decisions about Puerto Rico\u2019s future.It was the first substantive meeting of the board, known in Spanish as the junta, the Spanish word for political group, that Congress created this year to direct Puerto Rico\u2019s financial affairs. The group is similar to the control boards that have led other distressed American jurisdictions, like New York City in the mid-1970s. But because of heightened sensitivities about Puerto Rico\u2019s colonial history, Congress gave Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, and not the board, the authority to draft the 10-year fiscal plan that will become the basic road map for moving Puerto Rico out of its financial troubles.Most of Friday\u2019s meeting was devoted to the governor\u2019s delivery of his fiscal plan and questions from the board. Next, the board will review the plan and decide whether amendments are needed.\u201cPuerto Rico needs a plan in place immediately,\u201d he said.But the board members seemed inclined to proceed cautiously. Puerto Rico\u2019s debt structure is dauntingly complex. And all board members are aware that their decisions could set a precedent: The arrangements they make for Puerto Rico could be sought in the future by severely troubled states such as Illinois, Pennsylvania or New Jersey. These states have some of the same problems as Puerto Rico \u2014 in particular, unfunded pension promises to retired public workers that are rising so fast that they are crowding out other essential government services and making it more expensive to borrow.Like Puerto Rico, America\u2019s states are barred from seeking help under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code, the chapter that distressed cities and other local governments can use. But the law that gave rise to the oversight board and the stay on lawsuits, known as Promesa, also gives Puerto Rico certain debt-restructuring powers that are normally available only in bankruptcy. Puerto Rico can use those powers only if a majority of the board members agree.During the meeting, Andrew G. Biggs, a board member who is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, seemed to be trying to figure out where Puerto Rico\u2019s cash had been moved to as the island\u2019s troubles accelerated last spring. He asked how much money the government had parked in commercial banks and how far it had fallen behind on paying its vendors.Juan Zaragoza, Puerto Rico\u2019s treasury secretary, gave a detailed description of how revenue arrives at the island\u2019s treasury and what the government is doing to collect more taxes. He said there were about $1 billion worth of unpaid bills outstanding, and that the government had written about $350 million in checks but had not yet sent them \u2014 a practice that could make it look as though the bills had been paid, even though vendors have not received their money.That prompted another board member, Carlos M. Garc\u00eda, the head of a private equity firm in the Boston area, to question the governor\u2019s fundamental premise that Puerto Rico\u2019s government lacked enough money to govern.\u201cYou\u2019re currently at high tax collections, and you\u2019re currently not paying debt service,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy does the government not have enough money to pay vendors or provide essential services?\u201dMr. Garc\u00eda was a president of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico under a previous administration, which was led by a rival political party. He seemed skeptical in general of the governor\u2019s description of the island\u2019s problems and what had caused them.Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla did not waver. He said his fiscal plan called for Puerto Rico to improve its financial reporting, to merge branches of government to end duplication, to ease certain regulations and to court investors, especially those interested in financing infrastructure and energy projects.The governor also said that current efforts to collect more tax revenue and reduce government spending would continue, but he pleaded with the board not to \u201cdouble down on austerity.\u201d\u201cYou will soon realize that any reduction in spending implies intolerable effects in aggregate demand, and will further throw Puerto Rico into a death spiral that will directly affect creditors\u2019 recoveries across the board,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla said.Without help from Washington, he warned, the government could end up with a total accumulated debt of $59 billion over the next 10 years.Federal assistance, Mr. Garc\u00eda Padilla suggested, could take the form of improved Medicare and Medicaid programs, and tax measures that could help Puerto Rico become more competitive as an offshore manufacturing site for United States companies.Advertisement"}

Phi.The letters could be the name of a college honor society or maybe a fraternity or sorority. But in finance, they represent the progression of thinking about investments and how to judge them. Phi is the newest one.Alpha measures an investment\u2019s performance against a market index. If the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up 10 percent and a mutual fund is up 15 percent, for example, that 5 percentage point difference is alpha.Beta is the return of any given market. And charting beta is what a passive index fund does. Comparing different indexes\u2019 beta \u2014 say domestic equities and international bonds \u2014 helps investors in deciding how to allocate their investments.For individuals, high gamma is generally achieved by seeking advice from a qualified investment professional. But not always. The original Morningstar paper on gamma discussed the need for intelligent decisions across five areas, including tax management and withdrawal strategies.What phi aims to add is a way for investors to quantify how their motivations \u2014 or those of the people managing their money \u2014 will affect long-term investment returns.Suzanne Duncan, global head of State Street\u2019s Center for Applied Research, who led the team that surveyed and studied about 7,000 individuals and investments professionals over 18 months, said their research began by looking at the role incentives play in making investment decisions. But, she said, it quickly shifted to examining what motivated a person to invest \u2014 or not \u2014 in the first place.\u201cWe understood quite quickly and clearly that most individuals and professionals are working with a market-based motive,\u201d said Ms. Duncan, who conducted the study in conjunction with the CFA Institute, which administers the chartered financial analyst designation. \u201cIt can manifest itself in a passion for markets with individual investors. But for most, it\u2019s a fear of markets.\u201dAnd both of these motivations, the study found, can negatively affect long-term returns.To score high on phi, Ms. Duncan said, people need to have a deeper sense of purpose in what they are doing, whatever the job. \u201cIt\u2019s not about outperforming markets or peers, and it\u2019s not an asset-gathering measure of performance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe performance has to be defined as sustainable and with a deeper sense of purpose.\u201dShe noted that in the research, financial services professionals had low phi scores, ranking 12th out of 14 industries. Phi is \u201ca unicorn in our industry,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not a unicorn in other industries.\u201dMs. Duncan cited companies like Whole Foods Market, Southwest Airlines and Disney for instilling a high sense of passion, or phi, in their employees.Qualities that you might think are desirable are not, when it comes to phi. For example, answering that you have a passion for the markets or that you like your job because you work with smart people will not raise your phi score. Both responses seem good at first, but there is the risk that there is no greater purpose in what you are doing.\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting because it talks to a very needed culture shift to our industry,\u201d said Rebecca Fender, head of the future of finance initiative at the CFA Institute. \u201cPhi takes this heretofore very unquantifiable subject and puts some numbers around it so we can have a more meaningful conversation with the industry.\u201dWhile the study found that wealth was not a differentiator for phi scores, there were generational differences. Millennials scored high on the test and, more generally, as people got older, their phi scores increased.When it came to the types of investors who score high on the phi test, Ms. Duncan was careful not to overgeneralize. But she said the research found that people who invested with a socially responsible mind-set scored better. Their dual goal of seeking profit but doing so to achieve some social benefit naturally gives them a purpose beyond returns.But what about those who invest more broadly or do so to maximize their gains? It\u2019s not easy to change them.Individuals seeking to improve their phi have to move their focus beyond competing with their neighbors and looking toward a specific goal. Ms. Duncan said there were three areas where they should focus \u2014 their purpose, habits and incentives.In terms of purpose, individuals need to ask soul-searching questions about what they want their life to be. With investing, the investment goal ranks below the purpose of those investments \u2014 what they might use the money for in the future and not the sheer amount in the portfolio.To stay on the path to that purpose, investors need to change habits that distract from it.\u201cIn the case of individual investors, the cue is this market motive,\u201d Ms. Duncan said. \u201cThey need to replace the market motive with the purpose motive, which is phi.\u201d\u201cThose with high phi will have sustainable performance to a much greater degree,\u201d she added. \u201cThe purpose motive breaks the bad habit\u201d of following the markets.The incentives to get people to shift their purpose and break bad habits, she said, are taken from nudge theory, a term coined by the economist Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, a legal scholar. The idea is to persuade someone to adopt better behavior, like automatically signing people up for retirement plans or getting them to agree to increase their contribution rate to the plans when they get a raise.For investment professionals, Ms. Duncan said, the way to increase phi is to change motivation that is often tied to compensation. The study discusses four ways of doing this, including laying out a compelling vision for the future, challenging investment professionals\u2019 assumptions and discussing their values and beliefs.At its simplest, this could mean changing annual bonuses so they are paid out over several years, with a greater reward if the performance is sustainable.The study showed that changes that increased phi had a meaningful impact on a person\u2019s investment strategy.Every one-point increase in people\u2019s orientation toward investment goals with a purpose \u2014 and the scale is 0 to 3 \u2014 equated to 42 percent greater odds that the investors know what they are paying in fees, 37 percent greater odds that investors are not rejecting their financial adviser, 38 percent greater odds that the people consider investing in socially responsible investments and 79 percent greater odds that investors will trade less frequently, the research found.For investment professionals, that same one-point increase resulted in a 21 percent greater likelihood of excelling at long-term goals and 37 percent greater chance of scoring higher on client satisfaction.\u201cThis is intended to start a thought process of leaders in the industry,\u201d Ms. Fender said. \u201cCulture can\u2019t be changed overnight. It\u2019s essential to reconnect the investment profession with its stated purpose of improving society.\u201dAnd for those seeking an adviser, administering a phi test would surely help. As a group, wealth managers have higher phi than others in financial services. One reason is they are more connected with the people they serve.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Latest Unpaid Trump Vendor Is His Own Pollster, Filing Shows", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byOver the years, Donald J. Trump or his businesses have been accused of stiffing carpenters, dishwashers and lawyers, leaving a trail of lawsuits and grudges in his wake. Now he is in a billing dispute with one of his own campaign aides.The amount is listed as a \u201ccontested debt\u201d in the Oct. 27 filing. Under F.E.C. rules, contested debt refers to \u201ca bona fide disagreement between the creditor and the committee as to the existence of a debt or the amount owed by the committee.\u201dCandidates frequently run up debts during campaigns. It is less common for them to dispute what they owe, though not unheard-of. In his most recent filing in October, for example, Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator and former Republican presidential candidate, reported $22,750 in disputed debt to Optimizely, a web services firm. Ben Carson\u2019s campaign listed disputed debt to Parker Air for travel expenses in April; that dispute was resolved for a lesser amount in May.Mr. Fabrizio was hired in the spring as Mr. Trump found himself in a protracted primary fight for the Republican nomination. A veteran pollster, he was an ally of Paul Manafort, the ousted Trump campaign chief, with whom Mr. Fabrizio worked on then-Senator Bob Dole\u2019s 1996 presidential campaign.Mr. Fabrizio also has worked for Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses over the years. But he is known for presenting bad news to clients in unvarnished fashion, something that Mr. Trump has not always handled well during the presidential campaign. Among other things, he participated in a meeting in August in which advisers urged Mr. Trump to maintain his focus and stop engaging in self-defeating fights.A Republican with knowledge of the dispute said Mr. Fabrizio\u2019s bills were under review by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner holds no official title with the campaign, but he assumed oversight of the budget during the summer.Advertisement"}

Poland", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate17 Photos8,000,000 ZLOTYS ($2,088,773)The house, which encompasses around 7,500 square feet, was completed in 2005 and updated in 2015; it sits on a 0.62-acre lot. Past the front doors, the entry hall, which connects the living, cooking and eating areas, has a grand travertine staircase. There is a half-bath near the entrance. The living and dining rooms share a large rectangular space to the right of the entryway.Many of the furnishings were brought from France, where the sellers traveled and appreciated the architecture, and the home is being sold furnished, said Dorota Nowakowska, an agent with Poland Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing.To the left of the entrance are the kitchen, a two-car garage, a TV room and a full bathroom with a shower and a Turkish sauna. There is a second staircase near the garage.The ground floor has three fireplaces. One is in the entryway; another is the focal point of the living room; the third is in the kitchen, which is outfitted with white walls and dark teak countertops.Upstairs, just past the central staircase, is a sitting area that leads to the master bedroom. The master suite has two closets, a sloping ceiling with gabled windows and a bright bathroom with a claw-foot tub, a shower and white cabinets. A hallway leads to the other three bedrooms, of which two have en-suite baths. One bedroom is ideal for guests because it has a sitting room and can be reached by a door near the garage and the second staircase, Ms. Nowakowska said.Within a 15-minute drive are stables, a shopping center and restaurants. The forest, around 150 square miles, has trails and is popular for running and cycling. The property is about a 30-minute drive to the international airport and about a 25-minute drive to Warsaw\u2019s center.MARKET OVERVIEWPoland\u2019s housing market is still developing; prices are lower than in other European countries for comparable properties and the inventory is smaller, people working in the real estate market there said. As the Polish economy performs well, a wealthier population has been increasing demand for luxury homes in Warsaw and in other cities and resort areas.Prices for luxury properties have been stable since around 2013, said Arkadiusz Wojciechowski, a managing director of Poland Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. However, the volume of transactions has risen, as a handful of prestigious high-rise developments expanded the inventory at the market\u2019s high end.The luxury market for new construction is still small \u2014 there are around 90 to 100 new properties on the market in Warsaw with an asking price of more than $1 million \u2014 so sales in individual buildings can have an effect on price trends, Mr. Kirejczyk said.Mr. Wojciechowski estimated that new apartments cost an average of $4,000 to $5,000 per square meter, or $372 to $465 a square foot. Luxury apartments and single-family homes start at around $1 million, but $500,000 can purchase an apartment in a renovated building with a concierge and a doorman, Mr. Wojciechowski said. Luxury properties typically sell for slightly below asking price, but in exceptional situations there are steep discounts \u2014 as much as 50 percent, he said.In the luxury market, 90 percent of purchases are financed with cash, he added.Daniel Kopania, a Warsaw-based partner with the international law firm Clifford Chance and the head of its Polish real estate department, said that compared with many other countries in the European Union, Poland\u2019s housing prices are \u201cstill attractive.\u201d The residential property tax is relatively low in Poland, he added.WHO BUYS IN WARSAWForeigners who live in Warsaw for work tend to rent. The vast majority of luxury homes are being sold to wealthy Poles, Mr. Wojciechowski said.However, he said, the share of foreigners buying high-end homes in the city has been growing over the last two or three years. These buyers have been coming from the United States, Western Europe and Dubai, and they tend to have connections to Poland \u2014 for example, they have family there, or are of Polish ancestry.BUYING BASICSFor a prospective buyer who cannot obtain an exemption, a permit takes around two months, Mr. Kopania said, once all the necessary documents have been gathered for the application.Buyers typically cover most closing costs in Poland, and those costs vary significantly according to whether the property is new or previously owned, Mr. Kopania said. For a new house or apartment, the buyer typically pays a Value Added Tax of 8 percent. (For large new properties \u2014 houses of more than 300 square meters, or 3,230 square feet, or apartments of more than 150 square meters, or 1,500 square feet \u2014 there is a different tax structure, he said.) Parking spaces for apartments are often taxed at a higher rate of 23 percent, as are detached garages of single-family homes. For an existing house or apartment,there is no V.A.T., but a 2 percent tax commonly known as a transfer tax.Transactions are typically handled by notaries. Lawyers tend to be used in complicated or high-value transactions, meaning those above around a million dollars, Mr. Kopania said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYPolish; zloty ($1 = 3.83 zlotys)TAXES AND FEESAnnual property tax is 1,270 zlotys, or $332.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For AT&T Chief, Time Warner Deal Is the Peak of an Ambitious Climb", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byRandall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, could easily be pigeonholed as just another empire-building executive with a white-bread r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He is a 56-year-old Republican from Oklahoma atop a 140-year-old company, whose extracurricular highlights include serving as president of the Boy Scouts of America and shaping professional golf as a policy board member for the PGA Tour.Just five weeks ago, in the midst of the negotiations to acquire Time Warner, he ducked away to a hotel ballroom in Dallas to address 2,000 members of various AT&T employee resource groups \u2014 clubs for veterans, millennials, African-Americans and more.Typically this would be an occasion to spotlight the company\u2019s successes and hand out awards. But unbeknown to most executives in the company, he had scrapped the speech prepared for him and written his own remarks. \u201cOur communities are being destroyed by racial tension,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re too polite to talk about it.\u201dWith a Southern drawl, a vestige from his childhood in Moore, Okla., he reflected on racial tensions in America. He said his best friend, who is black, had recently spoken to him about the racism he had faced over the years. And Mr. Stephenson addressed the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 becoming the rare chief executive to touch what has become a divisive social and political subject. When someone says, \u201cBlack lives matter,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said, \u201cwe should not say, \u2018All lives matter,\u2019 to justify ignoring the real need for change.\u201dHe closed with a call to action. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to be tolerant of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cTolerance is for cowards. Understand each other.\u201dTo many AT&T employees in the room, it was a surprise. The boss had emerged as an advocate for social justice. He got a standing ovation.But several people who have known Mr. Stephenson for years said the moment reflected the people skills \u2014 and the willingness to go out on a limb \u2014 that have helped drive his career. \u201cI wish everyone at his level would make the same kind of commitment,\u201d said Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, who has worked with Mr. Stephenson on early childhood education and health initiatives.\u201cThe scouts, the education, helping improve an entire neighborhood in D.C. \u2014 he\u2019s not just doing it out of the goodness of his heart. They could also be future customers,\u201d Mr. Powell added. It\u2019s something other corporate leaders should learn from, he said.Mr. Stephenson grew up in suburban Oklahoma. His family ran a cattle feed business and he studied accounting at the University of Central Oklahoma. But in 1982, while still in college, Mr. Stephenson joined Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, and soon he was working the night shift in a data center, changing out tapes on mainframe computers.At the time, Southwestern Bell was part of the old AT&T, the sprawling network of telephone systems that connected much of the United States known as Ma Bell. Then antitrust regulators broke up AT&T, shattering the company into seven \u201cBaby Bells\u201d in 1984.After bouncing around the tax and finance departments for a few years, Mr. Stephenson moved to Mexico in 1992 to help oversee a joint venture in the country for Southwestern Bell, known as SBC. It was a long way from Oklahoma, but Mr. Stephenson adapted quickly. He immersed himself in the culture and sent his children to Mexican schools \u2014 and took up intensive Spanish lessons.\u201cUsually we speak English to Americans,\u201d said Jaime Chico Pardo, a senior Mexican telecom executive involved in the joint venture who later served on AT&T\u2019s board. \u201cBut he said, \u2018Talk to me in Spanish, or otherwise I\u2019ll never learn.\u2019\u201dAT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Mr. Stephenson\u2019s time in Mexico also gave him a crash course in empire building.Among the habits he learned: keeping an up-to-date list of potential acquisition targets, and being ambitious in striving to make his company bigger and more influential.In 1996, he moved back to the United States. By 2005, he was a member of SBC\u2019s board \u2014 and that same year, SBC and AT&T were reunited in a merger. Two years later, Mr. Stephenson became chief executive.Upon assuming the role, Mr. Stephenson did something unexpected: He moved the company headquarters about 300 miles north, to Dallas from San Antonio, a decision he called in a recent interview \u201cthe hardest I\u2019ve made as C.E.O.\u201dBut the reasons were simple. \u201cFirst and foremost, to get our people access to great airports,\u201d he said. (Dallas has two international airports.) Also, he said, Dallas had one of the best labor markets in the country for engineers, sales personnel and managers.Less than a decade later, AT&T has made a big impact on the city. AT&T is the lead sponsor of the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 futuristic football stadium, and has its name on the city\u2019s main performing arts center.\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing for Dallas,\u201d Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, said in an email. \u201cThe jobs. The improvement downtown.\u201dAmong Mr. Stephenson\u2019s favored new projects is the development of the Trinity Forest Golf Club, which is designed to lure a big golf tournament back to Dallas.He professes to be bad at the game himself \u2014 \u201cI stink,\u201d he said recently \u2014 although he has a 13 handicap, according to the United States Golf Association. But it\u2019s a \u201cthinking man\u2019s game,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you spend three or four hours walking 18 holes, you get to know somebody.\u201dSince the federal government broke up AT&T more than three decades ago, the company has been deliberately reassembling itself as a media powerhouse. Over the last 15 years, AT&T has struck more than $200 billion of deals. Mr. Stephenson was involved in them all, and has presided over some 44 acquisitions as chief executive.But until this month, his most ambitious deal was the one that got away. In March 2011, as word spread that Sprint was closing in on a takeover of T-Mobile USA, a rival wireless provider, AT&T and its advisers stayed quiet as they labored on what they had code-named \u201cProject Auto.\u201d To help keep their work secret, AT&T was code-named \u201cTesla\u201d; T-Mobile \u201cMercury\u201d; and T-Mobile\u2019s majority owner, Deutsche Telekom of Germany, \u201cDaimler.\u201dAnd then, on a Sunday, AT&T announced an audacious $39 billion takeover of its smaller rival \u2014 a move that would have made it the nation\u2019s biggest carrier and reduced the number of major American service providers to three from four.Critics emerged quickly, and vociferously. AT&T believed it could get the deal through the thicket of regulatory approval. \u201cWhen you get to the facts, this is a deal that gets approved,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said at the time.Yet the T-Mobile case proved to be one of overweening ambition and an inability to read the political terrain.In the view of Gene Kimmelman, then a senior official in the Justice Department Antitrust Division, Mr. Stephenson and his lieutenants were willing to compromise and find ways to placate the government. But the problem was that the government was opposed to the very idea of AT&T\u2019s buying T-Mobile in the first place.\u201cIt was obvious from the get-go that they were willing to spin off assets and accept certain conditions on their deal,\u201d said Mr. Kimmelman, who is now chief executive of Public Knowledge, an antitrust public advocacy group. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand that this was a situation where antitrust officials thought the deal was dangerous.\u201dBy year\u2019s end, Mr. Stephenson was forced to walk away, paying T-Mobile $3 billion in cash and valuable wireless spectrum. But the AT&T chief learned some lessons from the defeat, according to people who know him. Mr. Stephenson was soon more engaged in Washington, becoming chairman of the Business Roundtable, a pro-business advocacy group. It reflected a realization, friends say, of the significance of politics in business at that level.\u201cHe learned from that,\u201d said W. James McNerney Jr., who until last year was chief executive of Boeing, and has worked closely with Mr. Stephenson.The first sign that Mr. Stephenson\u2019s ambitions had not been tempered came in 2014, when AT&T agreed to a $49 billion takeover of DirecTV. This added some 38 million satellite TV subscribers to the empire, giving the company more clout to negotiate with content providers \u2014 companies like CBS, Fox and even Time Warner, which produce the television shows and movies that AT&T funnels to customers\u2019 screens.Yet while AT&T is best known for its wireless phone plans, its operations encompass more areas: broadband internet for consumers and businesses; DirecTV subscriptions in the United States and Latin America; and, more recently, a joint venture focused on online video, Otter Media.Expansion has cost Mr. Stephenson some allies. Though AT&T has flirted with the idea of an international empire in other ways \u2014 it weighed a bid for Vodafone, the European wireless giant, several years ago \u2014 Mr. Stephenson has instead kept his cross-border ambitions closer to home. Around the time of the DirecTV deal, AT&T also bought a Mexican service provider, Grupo Iusacell S.A., and Nextel Mexico. Along with the acquisition of DirecTV\u2019s Latin American business, this put Mr. Stephenson in direct competition with his former mentor, Mr. Slim.\u201cCarlos and I have spoken, and he\u2019s a very dear friend,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said at the time of the deal. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s going to be a competitor, and we recognize that, and off we go.\u201d\u201cHe had an understanding that his business was already being dominated by video,\u201d Mr. Chernin said.And then he turned to his Carlos Slim-inspired spreadsheet. Buying Time Warner is the final step in what AT&T calls a \u201cvertically integrated\u201d conglomerate: One part of the company would produce \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Batman movies and CNN, and then make them available on satellite TV, smartphones and tablets. All the while, the same company would also collect copious amounts of data on its customers, helping advertisers more perfectly target audiences while collecting more money to pay for content.\u201cWe did this with one thing in mind,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to change the game. This is an environment just begging for innovation.\u201dSkeptics of Mr. Stephenson\u2019s strategy instead see more dangers in having one company own both the \u201cpipes\u201d of the internet and some of the most valuable content to flow through them. \u201cWhat\u2019s most clear is that the new AT&T is like the old Ma Bell, in that it intends to be the dominant player,\u201d said Mr. Kimmelman of Public Knowledge. \u201cIt\u2019s not a monopoly \u2014 but certainly a dominant force in the market.\u201dAs was the case when AT&T bid for T-Mobile, criticism of the Time Warner deal has come swiftly from both sides of the aisle. Hillary Clinton urged a thorough review, while Donald J. Trump called for an outright rejection of the takeover.Mr. Stephenson professed no surprise at the response. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve done large-scale deals, that first day there\u2019s always a lot of commentary on it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been calling for a thorough review \u2014 it\u2019s just the volume level.\u201dHe also discounts the warnings that merging AT&T and Time Warner will be a repeat of the disastrous union of AOL and Time Warner, considered the worst deal of all time. \u201cAOL was just bought for $4 billion,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is going to buy AT&T for $4 billion.\u201d (AT&T has a market value of more than $220 billion, though its stock has dropped about 7 percent since news emerged of its plans to buy Time Warner.)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Russia\u2019s \u2018Frozen Zone,\u2019 a Creeping Border With Georgia", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byBut while dismissed by most of the world as a make-believe border, the dirt track now running through this tiny Georgian village nonetheless means that Vephivia Tatiashvili can no longer go to his three-story house because it sits on land now patrolled by Russian border guards.That track marks the world\u2019s newest and perhaps oddest international frontier \u2014 the elastic boundary between Georgian-controlled land and the Republic of South Ossetia, a self-proclaimed breakaway state financed, defended and controlled by Moscow.Mr. Tatiashvili\u2019s troubles started early in the summer when earth-moving equipment turned up without warning and started digging a wide track through an apple orchard and a field of wildflowers on the edge of the village. He was out at the time, so he avoided being trapped.There is no fence or barbed wire, but Mr. Tatiashvili does not dare to cross the track to visit his house for fear of being arrested, as his elderly neighbor was, by Russian border guards.\u201cIt is too dangerous for me to go home,\u201d he said, complaining that the boundary has become so mobile that nobody really knows its final destination. Mr. Tatiashvili now lives in his brother\u2019s house, away from the border in the village center.The destitute mountainous area of South Ossetia first declared itself independent from Georgia in 1990, but nobody outside the region paid much attention until Russia invaded in August 2008 and recognized South Ossetia\u2019s claims to statehood. With that, the territory joined Abkhazia in western Georgia, the Moldovan enclave of Transnistria and eastern Ukraine as a \u201cfrozen zone,\u201d an area of Russian control within neighboring states, useful for things like preventing a NATO foothold or destabilizing the host country at opportune moments.The leader of South Ossetia, Leonid Tibilov, has said he plans to hold a referendum like the one in Crimea in 2014 on whether to request annexation by Russia.But even without a referendum, the nominally independent country is already Russian territory in all but name. It has its own small security force, but its self-declared frontiers are mainly guarded by Russia\u2019s border service, an arm of the Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet version of the K.G.B. It houses three Russian military bases with several thousand troops and, with no economy beyond a few farms, depends almost entirely on Russian aid for its survival.The green border signs that first appeared last year and now keep popping up along the zigzagging boundary warn that \u201cpassage is forbidden\u201d across what is declared to be a \u201cstate border.\u201d Which state is not specified, though locals are in no doubt about its identity.\u201cRussia starts right here,\u201d said Mr. Tatiashvili, pointing to the freshly dug track that separates his house from Georgian-held land.\u201cBut who knows where Russia will start tomorrow or the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they keep moving the line, we will one day all be living in a Russian-Georgian Federation.\u201dOne of the new signs \u2014 written in English and Georgian \u2014 is just a few hundred yards from Georgia\u2019s main east-west highway, and it puts a short part of an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to a Georgian port on the Black Sea within territory controlled by Russia.So tangled is the dispute over what land belongs to which side that each has its own definition of the line. Russia and South Ossetia insist that it is a border like any other \u2014 Venezuela, Nicaragua and Nauru also recognize it \u2014 while Georgia calls it \u201cthe occupation line.\u201d The European Union, which has around 200 monitors in Georgia to keep tabs on the agreement that ended the 2008 Russian-Georgian war, also says there is no actual border, only an \u201cadministrative boundary line.\u201dKestutis Jankauskas, the head of the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia, said it was hard to know where this boundary line exactly runs. It was never recognized or agreed upon, and its location depends on which maps are used. Russia, he said, is using a map drawn by the Soviet military\u2019s general staff in the 1980s.It demarcates what in the Soviet era was an inconsequential administrative boundary within the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia but what is now hardening into a hazardous frontier.The fitful movement of the boundary seems to be driven mostly by Russia\u2019s desire to align what it sees as a state border with this old Soviet map. So far, the movement has always been forward, often by just a few yards but at other times by bigger leaps.Because the line is so uncertain and, in many places, still completely unmarked, Georgian villagers sometimes find themselves on the wrong side and under arrest by Russian border guards or local security officers.To help get people out of detention, recover cattle that have strayed into Russian-controlled land and settle quotidian disputes like who owns which apple trees or vineyard, Europe\u2019s monitoring mission organizes a monthly meeting of Georgian, Russian and South Ossetian officials.As happened when the two pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine declared themselves independent states in 2014 and said they would like to be absorbed by Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin has mostly feigned ignorance of what his country\u2019s surrogates are up to in Georgia.Asked in April about South Ossetia\u2019s plans to hold a referendum on joining Russia, Mr. Putin suggested that Moscow was mostly a bystander. But if South Ossetia wants to hold a referendum, Mr. Putin said, \u201cwe cannot resist it.\u201dWhile Russian military, border and diplomatic personnel have poured into South Ossetia, the local population of Ossetians \u2014 an ethnic group whose language is distantly related to Persian \u2014 has steadily drifted away, shrinking by around half from a prewar level of roughly 70,000. An ethnic Georgian population of around 25,000 who used to live there have long since fled.Like Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, the border markings deep into what Georgia insists is its territory are slowly creating \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d that, no matter what the international community might think, are a reality that everyone has to deal with, particularly residents.Elizbar Mestumrishvili, 75, a farmer who lives next to Mr. Tatiashvili\u2019s now-marooned house, can still get to his home, as it lies on the Georgian side of the new dirt track.But he is wary of going to the bottom of his garden, which lies within a 60-yard frontier zone that Russian and South Ossetian security officers claim the right to patrol. Pointing to a row of vines drooping with plump grapes, he said it was unwise to walk any farther because \u201cthey might come and set up a border post.\u201dThe so-called borderization of a previously vague administrative boundary created political headaches for Georgia\u2019s government ahead of parliamentary elections on Oct. 8. It still won the election but had to fend off attacks from rivals who said it had responded too meekly to Russia\u2019s \u201ccreeping annexation.\u201dWhen it defeated supporters of former President Mikheil Saakashvili in elections four years ago, a coalition led by Georgian Dream, a party set up by an enigmatic billionaire, pledged to reduce tensions with Russia, which loathed Mr. Saakashvili. Instead, Russian border guards have moved deeper into Georgian territory.\u201cThere is no improvement. I would say the opposite,\u201d Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili said in an interview. \u201cUnfortunately, Russia never appreciates when you concede or make a step forward or compromise. They always take it for granted.\u201dAll the same, he insisted that even though his government had no intention of repeating Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s disastrous 2008 attempt to confront Russia militarily, the border will not last.\u201cIt has no prospect,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are trying to build this border, these fences, inside our country. We think it is temporary.\u201dAn article on Oct. 24 about Russia\u2019s elastic boundary with Georgia referred imprecisely to the approximately 200 European Union monitors who are in Georgia to keep tabs on the agreement that ended the 2008 Russian-Georgian war. They are unarmed police officers, former and current military personnel and civilians; not all 200 are police officers.Advertisement"}

Williams Jr., a onetime president of Washington Mutual \u2014 as senior executives.The hires are meant to help the five-year-old firm grow as it competes in the business of buying and selling stock in privately held companies. As a merchant bank, Disruptive Technology Advisers helps companies find buyers for their shares and often invests as well.Among the companies it has worked for, according to news reports, are the data analysis provider Palantir Technologies, the file-sharing giant Dropbox and the genetic testing service 23andMe. The firm declined to comment on any of its clients, citing confidentiality.The roughly 20-employee investment bank characterizes itself as better aligned with its clients than the firms that dominate the industry.In an interview, Mr. Davis declined to discuss the firm\u2019s volume of deals, though he said that it had raised more than $1 billion for clients over roughly the last three years.Mr. Kennedy will serve as the firm\u2019s chief operating officer and Mr. Williams as chief revenue officer.\u201cWe think that this is a huge opportunity to create the standard-bearer for a merchant bank serving the private markets,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said.Mr. Davis and Mr. Kennedy met while Mr. Kennedy was still the head of UBS\u2019s private solutions business, where he focused on helping private companies with investment banking and wealth management.Mr. Kennedy brought along Mr. Williams, a former client who worked at Washington Mutual while the bank was in bankruptcy and then at an affiliate of the Fortress Investment Group and at an environmentally focused start-up.\u201cThey\u2019ll help us to scale the opportunity that we have in servicing private companies in the most exciting time for a business such as ours,\u201d Mr. Davis said.Though 2017 is shaping up to be a big year for initial public offerings of unicorns, or billion-dollar start-ups \u2014 the parent company of Snapchat, for example, is already moving toward a market debut \u2014 Mr. Davis said he expected money to keep flowing back to the private markets.\u201cThe more that the I.P.O. market opens up from our perspective, the more recycled capital that will flow back into the private markets,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Tax Plan Would Add to Debt and Hillary Clinton\u2019s Wouldn\u2019t, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byThe review by the Tax Policy Center, a joint research arm of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, is the first to examine the plans since Mr. Trump significantly rewrote his proposal after criticisms of its costs and inequities and Mrs. Clinton on Monday proposed to double the existing tax break for parents with young children.\u201cThey really couldn\u2019t be more different,\u201d Len Burman, director of the center and a professor at Syracuse University, said in a conference call with reporters.It is unclear that either plan would pass in Congress. If Republicans keep control of the House, even if they lose the Senate, they would probably block Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposed tax increases. And while Mr. Trump\u2019s plan is similar to one that House Republicans have outlined, many Republicans would probably object to its cost given the size and projected growth of the federal debt as an aging population drives spending higher.Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts would be the deepest ever, reducing revenue $6.2 trillion in the first decade and mostly benefiting corporations and the highest-income Americans, the center said. Some middle-income families, however, would receive a tax increase.With interest, the cost would be $7.2 trillion over 10 years, nearly doubling the growth in the federal debt that is otherwise projected. The cost would build in subsequent decades, though Mr. Trump denounces the size of the debt at nearly every campaign appearance.Mrs. Clinton would substantially raise taxes on high-income taxpayers, mostly on the top 1 percent; slightly reduce taxes on average for middle- and low-income households; and overhaul corporate taxes. Her plan would increase federal revenue $1.4 trillion over the first decade. Rather than lower the federal debt, however, Mrs. Clinton would use the money to pay for education and other initiatives.While Mr. Trump, with exceptions, would simplify the tax code, Mrs. Clinton would make it more complex for taxpayers other than small businesses, the center said. For example, the wealthiest households would face a 4 percent surcharge on adjusted gross income exceeding $5 million, a minimum tax rate of 30 percent, a 28 percent cap on deductions and other tax breaks and a higher capital gains tax on assets held less than six years.Under current law, much of their income is taxed as capital gains, at a preferential rate of 23.8 percent instead of higher income-tax rates. Though Mr. Trump would repeal that break, his plan would allow money managers to pay a new 15 percent business rate and \u201cretain a substantial tax advantage on their income compared with wage earners,\u201d according to the center.The Trump plan would give the richest 0.1 percent of taxpayers \u2014 those with incomes of more than $3.7 million this year \u2014 an average tax cut of $1.1 million, for a 14 percent increase on average in their after-tax income. The middle one-fifth of Americans by income would receive a tax cut increasing after-tax income less than 2 percent, on average, while the poorest fifth would get a break of less than 1 percent.But many large families and single parents \u2014 a separate study put the number at about eight million families \u2014 would face tax increases under Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals. That reflects his proposals to repeal personal exemptions and the head-of-household filing status.Mr. Trump would reduce the top marginal tax rate for individuals, now 39.6 percent, to 33 percent, and the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent.Absent clarification from the campaign, the center assumed that choice would be available and concluded the change could lead to significant tax avoidance \u2014 of income taxes and payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare \u2014 as high-wage employees reclassify themselves as pass-through businesses for tax advantage.Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump would also repeal taxes on the wealthy that help finance the Affordable Care Act, and eliminate estate and gift taxes. He would tax some capital gains at death and cap some itemized deductions, to hold down his plan\u2019s costs.Mr. Trump, in his plan, does not address the tax breaks so beneficial to real estate developers that may have allowed him to avoid federal income taxes for as much as 18 years. Roberton C. Williams, an economist at the tax center, said about one-tenth of 1 percent of high-income taxpayers avoided any federal income taxes.But the number may be larger: Mr. Burman noted that Mr. Trump would not have qualified as rich in the years in question because of the big real estate losses he was claiming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prepaid Debit Cards Users Will Get New Federal Protections", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byPrepaid debit cards are a financial lifeline for many people, but a risky one. They lack many of the basic consumer protections that credit cards and bank debit cards are required to offer. That will change next year, with a raft of new federal rules intended to clamp down on a product that has been growing rapidly despite concerns about high fees, poor disclosures and weak protections for customers when something goes wrong.\u201cThe rules bring prepaid cards out of the shadows, with protections that in many ways are stronger than those for traditional bank accounts,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, the associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, which lobbied for the new rules. For instance, she said, the rules require clear fee disclosures and limits on overdraft fees \u2014 protections she would like to see extended to bank accounts.Prepaid card issuers will also have to offer liability protection on par with the coverage that applies to credit cards. If a customer\u2019s prepaid card is lost or stolen and the cardholder notifies the provider within two days of discovering the loss, responsibility for unauthorized charges will generally be capped at $50.In late 2014, the agency released a draft of the rules. The final version, released this week, covers a broad swath of products, including government cards used for Social Security payments and other benefits, payroll cards and funds stored in mobile apps like PayPal and Google Wallet.One of the most controversial provisions in the new rules relates to the credit lines some providers offer on their cards, which kick in when a customer\u2019s balance dips below zero. Those fees can take customers by surprise and become a debt trap, critics say.The rules require prepaid card merchants to evaluate a customer\u2019s ability to repay before issuing them a credit line, and impose a 30-day waiting period before companies can offer a credit line on a new card account.In response to the new rules, the trade group said in a statement, \u201cWhile we are still analyzing the lengthy final rule to determine its full impact, it is already clear that the C.F.P.B. has dismissed many of our serious concerns and moved forward with a rule that will harm the very consumers it aims to protect.\u201dBy contrast, consumer advocates praised the changes as vital protections for cardholders.\u201cResearch shows many consumers turn to prepaid cards to control spending and to avoid overdraft fees,\u201d said Nick Bourke, the director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable Trusts.But the new regulations do not directly address one of the biggest hardships for prepaid card customers: the cascade of financial problems that system failures can set off.The rules do not detail remedies and penalties for such incidents, but they give regulators more leeway to hold companies accountable.\u201cNo amount of rule making can create a force field around providers\u2019 systems and products to categorically prevent this from happening in the future,\u201d said Kristine Andreassen, a lawyer with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deutsche Bank\u2019s Appetite for Risk Throws Off Its Balance", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byThe global banking giants \u2014 think of JPMorgan Chase or HSBC \u2014 make a nice return by capturing their share of the trillions of dollars that course through financial markets each day.But few are as reliant on this business \u2014 be it swapping currencies, selling bonds or structuring derivatives \u2014 as Deutsche Bank, the giant lender that has made its name not as a home for German savers but as a place for hedge funds and other risk-loving investors to put on some of their boldest financial bets.And that is why its swooning stock price last week set off alarm bells in finance ministries, central bank suites and trading floors from Hong Kong to New York.More than eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shock waves around the world, the fear is whether Deutsche Bank and its highly leveraged balance sheet of 1.6 trillion euros might teeter and set off another bout of financial contagion.There has also been a growing realization that Deutsche Bank, even with its thin cushion of cash, is in much better financial shape than Lehman Brothers was. In a letter to employees on Friday, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive, John Cryan, highlighted the \u201cstrong fundamentals\u201d of the bank.It has \u20ac220 billion, or $247 billion, in ready liquidity, compared with $45 billion for Lehman in 2007, and the bank can also tap central banks in the United States and in Europe for a financial lifeline if need be.That does not mean, however, that traders and regulators will stop fretting about, among other things, the \u20ac42 trillion worth of derivatives that sit on its books, an amount about 11 times the size of the German economy. The market value of that figure, \u20ac18 billion, is a lot lower, but as a headline sum it still scares.More than all other universal banks \u2014 those institutions that collect deposits and also have investment banking businesses \u2014 Deutsche Bank has cultivated bankers with an expertise in conceiving of, promoting and trading some of the most cutting-edge financial instruments around.Its past leader, Anshu Jain, came to the firm in the 1990s from Merrill Lynch and rose to the top through his success in selling derivatives to hedge funds.Long before he became co-chief executive in 2012, Mr. Jain and a loyal cadre of like-minded bankers and traders consolidated power in London (the bank\u2019s headquarters are in Frankfurt), where they established the bank as a behemoth in the markets. Deutsche Bank became one of the few banks large and aggressive enough to put its capital at risk by trading and housing derivatives, securitized mortgages and credit default swaps for those who wanted to deal in them.\u201cWhat makes Deutsche Bank systemic is their sheer size combined with the leverage that is required to stay in the flow and be an intermediary,\u201d said Anthony J. Perrotta Jr., an expert in the structure of financial markets at TABB Group, a consulting firm. \u201cBut as capital becomes more scarce, this becomes a fragile equation.\u201dA simple calculation bears this out. Deutsche Bank has \u20ac67 billion ($75 billion) in equity that supports assets of \u20ac1.6 trillion ($1.8 trillion), which mean it is levered at a ratio of 25 to 1.By comparison, JPMorgan has $224 billion in cash backing $2.4 trillion in assets, which produces a far healthier ratio of 9 to 1.According to the last annual report, Level 3 assets stood at \u20ac32 billion \u2014 about half the amount of the bank\u2019s equity buffer, although that figure has come down sharply in recent years.To get a better sense of how these types of assets ended up on its balance sheet, it is worth taking a closer look at the professional makeup of Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment bank.In good times this unit of the bank drove its profits. It was also the investment bank that was largely responsible for the $7.5 billion in losses that Deutsche Bank showed last year.Because of new European Union regulations, Deutsche Bank is required to disclose the number of those who take significant risks with the bank\u2019s capital and how much they are paid.Last year, the bank reported that its investment bank employed 1,871 so-called material risk takers, or M.R.T.s as they have come to be known in European regulatory circles, who were paid \u20ac1.7 billion.That was down from a year earlier, when 2,057 M.R.T.s took home \u20ac2 billion.Stuart Graham, a banking analyst with Autonomous Research in London, says that Deutsche Bank has more high-paid risk takers than any other bank \u2014 including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.Barclays, a longtime Deutsche rival, is also a deposit-taking bank that relies on traders to increase revenues. But the British bank reports having just 842 maximum risk takers in its investment bank.While this culture of making big bets with the bank\u2019s cash may have worked in a previous era, in today\u2019s market, where a premium is placed on managing risk as opposed to taking it, such an aptitude becomes a liability.So, even though Deutsche Bank may have a \u20ac220 billion cash cushion, it is this unknown liability that is causing some investors to play it safe and ask for their money back.\u201cIf you are a counterparty, you have to trim back exposure as fast as you can,\u201d said David Hendler, a credit analyst with Viola Risk Advisors.Most analysts believe that Deutsche Bank needs to raise an extra \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac7 billion from investors in order to calm concerns about its financial health, especially in light of the fact that the Justice Department may require the firm to pay a penalty of at least this amount.But there are a few who think that for Deutsche Bank to be able to survive a crisislike atmosphere, it needs a lot more money than that.Robert Engle, an economist at New York University who was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on volatility and capital markets, has designed a model that ranks financial institutions in terms of their systemic risk.The barometer takes into consideration leverage, the bank\u2019s stock price and its equity base, and as such it represents a real-time measure of the dangers a bank poses to the financial system at a given moment in time.Global regulators use it as well to complement their own internal models.Other European banks, like BNP Paribas and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, rank closely behind Deutsche Bank in this regard. What sets Deutsche Bank apart from its European and American peers is its reliance on debt, the N.Y.U. model shows.Since September, the bank\u2019s risk, calculated on the basis of its leverage, has increased sharply relative to other comparable institutions, according to the N.Y.U. gauge.\u201cThere is just a lot of risk for Deutsche Bank right now,\u201d Mr. Engle said. \u201cWe have been worried about European banks for quite a while.\u201dAn article on Monday about concerns over Deutsche Bank\u2019s riskier assets misstated a comparison for the amount of derivatives on the German company\u2019s books. The amount \u2014 about \u20ac42 trillion in derivatives \u2014 is equal to about 11 times the size of the German economy; it is not equivalent to the size of the country\u2019s economy.Advertisement"}

Both of us saw instances of nominations that were doomed by the arguably legal but unsavory use of tax loopholes, as well as by the failure to pay Social Security taxes, the taking of excessive deductions for home offices or the sidestepping of sales taxes on out-of-state purchases. Explaining to the Senate and to the American people how a billionaire could have a $916 million \u201closs carry-forward\u201d that potentially allowed him to not pay taxes for over a decade, perhaps for as long as 18 years, would have been far too difficult for the White House when many hard-working Americans turn a third or more of their earnings over to the government.There is also no fiduciary duty to one\u2019s family to minimize taxes by taking advantage of loopholes. Quite to the contrary, many of us want to set an example that teaches our children the responsibilities as well as the enormous benefits of being an American.Even in large public companies, the argument that there is a fiduciary duty to shareholders to structure deals to minimize taxes is false. The law does not require corporate officers and directors to avoid taxes, much less to aggressively take advantage of strategies to eliminate them for years to come.The final deal killer here is Mr. Trump\u2019s objection to the release of even the limited information that has come out, and his refusal to disclose more. At the White House we asked nominees for Senate-confirmed positions to sign a waiver so we could get tax information from the I.R.S., and we also asked nominees to be ready to provide their tax returns to the Senate upon request. Several of the committees most important to national security and the economy \u2014 such as the Armed Services Committee and the Committee on Finance \u2014 routinely insist on receiving tax returns. Neither of us can recall a single nominee who refused, and with good reason. If the White House were to so much as delay in disclosing the tax returns of a nominee, much less tell the Senate that a nominee did not want to disclose them, the nomination would be dead on arrival.No presidential nominee with Mr. Trump\u2019s tax situation, his years of undisclosed tax returns, and his attitude toward paying taxes could have been approved by the Senate. Indeed, no president would have dared nominate him. All of us should weigh that heavily in assessing Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for the Oval Office.Norman Eisen, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2009 to 2011 and ambassador to the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2014.

Trump and Hillary Clinton unleashed a barrage of spending in September, with both candidates burning through more money than they raised as the fall campaign sprint began.Mr. Trump spent $70 million in September, according to reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission, more than double the $30 million his campaign laid out in August and more than three times what he spent in July. He began the final full month of the campaign with just $35 million in cash on hand.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign spent even more, $95 million, according to figures provided by her campaign, and began October with $59 million on hand. Both candidates\u2019 coffers are relatively small by the standards of modern campaigns.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign spent at least $1 million on his own aircraft and Trump-owned hotels, resorts or office buildings. In addition to the $21 million Mr. Trump spent on online advertising \u2014 his single largest expense \u2014 he was billed at least $5 million by Cambridge Analytica, a publicity-shy data mining and analytics firm owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s chief financial benefactor, the wealthy investor Robert Mercer.The purpose of the spending was listed as \u201cdata management\u201d in election commission reports. In August, Mr. Trump paid the same firm just $250,000.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s cultivated image as a candidate who tells it as it is and draws his inspiration from his crowds, his campaign also paid at least five pollsters in September. The month began a period in which Mr. Trump has struggled to stay on message and find a solid footing against Mrs. Clinton, while he feuded with a former beauty queen and fended off accusations of sexual harassment and abuse from a growing roster of women.And even as the Democrats vastly out-organized Mr. Trump, his spending on payroll went up only modestly in September, suggesting that he has given up on trying to compete with Mrs. Clinton in the field. While she has a staff of hundreds, Mr. Trump has reliably spent more on hats and other merchandise for supporters than he has on staff.He also reported what was said to be a final payout of $100,000 to his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was fired months ago but continues to travel with Mr. Trump on the trail.All in all, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign took in about $55 million in September compared with $84 million for Mrs. Clinton, according to a tally her campaign released this month, a record for the Democratic nominee in her second presidential bid.While presidential campaigns typically accelerate their spending heavily in the fall, they also usually keep raising more and more money as party donors come off the sidelines and the stakes of the race become clear. But Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising has remained relatively flat since he became the nominee.Two-thirds of the cash his campaign raised in September came directly from grass-roots supporters, indicating his struggles in bringing wealthy Republican donors on board. On Thursday, his campaign announced via text message that Mr. Trump had raised $9 million in a single day from 125,000 people after the third and final presidential debate.More money is sitting in joint funds whose proceeds are shared with Republican Party committees, though it is unclear exactly how much of that is owed to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cMr. Trump has said many times that this is not a campaign, it\u2019s a movement,\u201d said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director, in an email.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rodrigo Duterte Gets Closer to China, and the Neighbors Notice", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisBEIJING \u2014 After unleashing an anti-American tirade in Beijing last week, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines left some Chinese, who like tightly scripted state visits, wondering if their unpredictable guest could be trusted.Yet his alacrity in accepting direct talks over the disputed South China Sea, and his gratitude for $24 billion in investment and financing deals, also left the broad impression that China may have started a strategic realignment in Southeast Asia by bringing an important American ally to its side.Countries like Vietnam, which had been edging closer to the United States, and Malaysia and Thailand, which were moving toward Beijing, may now see the value in drawing closer to China, analysts said.\u201cChina has improved relations with Duterte immediately, and set up a way to settle the South China Sea disputes peacefully,\u201d said Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University and a prominent foreign policy hawk. \u201cGenerally speaking, this problem in the South China Sea is over, and the United States cannot do anything now.\u201dThe Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States since 1951, has been regarded as one of the fundamental pro-American countries in Asia.He also said he would form a triple alliance with China and Russia to \u201cface the world.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a gift, not a victory,\u201d Mr. Yan said of Mr. Duterte\u2019s remarks. \u201cVictory means you get something through your own effort. We did nothing. It\u2019s a gift.\u201dAt the same time, Mr. Duterte\u2019s hosts were startled by his anti-American remarks, raising concerns that he could become a liability.There is little chance, for example, that Beijing policy makers would want a China-Russia-Philippines alliance, said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.\u201cI don\u2019t think at this moment Beijing wants a really close partnership with him, especially if that partnership could be seen as an anti-U.S. alliance,\u201d Professor Zhang said.On social media, there was skepticism about Mr. Duterte\u2019s sincerity. Perhaps he was engaging in a game like one played by couples in Shanghai, who arrange fake divorces to evade restrictions on property purchases, one person wrote on Weibo.Others on social media made fun of Mr. Duterte as the ruler of a country that is often belittled here as a place for abundant tropical fruit but not much more. One cartoonist depicted Mr. Duterte as a banana salesman who had plenty for sale now that the embargo of the last four years had been lifted.Still, the Philippine delegation\u2019s visit was viewed as a success on several fronts.The Philippine defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, met with his Chinese counterpart, Chang Wanquan, and agreed to a renewal of ties between the two navies. There were no specifics on what the new relationship would entail, but the encounter struck a different tone to the strained relationship under President Benigno S. Aquino III.That company carried out most of the reclamation for creating the artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea that the former Philippine government protested in its recent case against China at The Hague.The Philippine trade secretary, Ramon Lopez, said that China had agreed to spend $15 billion on projects to help achieve the biggest infrastructure boom in the Philippines since the authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand Marcos.Trinh Nguyen, an economist specializing in the Asian Pacific region at Natixis Bank, sounded a note of caution about the value of the Chinese investments.\u201cPledges do not necessarily translate into realized foreign direct investment for the Philippines,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just a symbol of the Chinese government\u2019s good will toward the country.\u201d In Indonesia, for example, China outbid Japan on a high-speed train line, but the project has been badly delayed and yet to deliver results, she added.Despite Mr. Duterte\u2019s anti-United States stance in Beijing, he refrained from specifically stating that he would halt American access to five Philippine bases. In the longer term, China would relish such a policy because it would further the country\u2019s goal of control of the South China Sea and complicate American military planning.But such a pledge was not expected on the first visit, and China was satisfied with Mr. Duterte\u2019s decision to accept the plan for direct talks on the South China Sea, a position that is contrary to American policy, analysts said.The United States has argued that disputes over territory and fishing rights in the waterway should be settled among all the countries involved in the dispute, and preferably under the auspices of the regional group, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Mr. Zhang, the Lingnan University professor, said Mr. Duterte had \u201cconfirmed that the bilateral approach does work better.\u201d\u201cThis lends major support to China,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.He also noted that the American strategy needed a \u201cvictim\u201d of China to rally other countries around, but that Mr. Duterte had removed the Philippines from that posture.There is no doubt that Mr. Duterte\u2019s success with China has rattled Southeast Asian nations who seek its economic largess but fear its strategic ambitions, said Alexander L. Vuving, a professor of international relations at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii.Vietnam is now being forced to rethink its stance of leaning toward the United States, he said. But more likely than tilting toward China, Vietnam will seek to persuade Washington to strengthen its commitment to the region, he said.\u201cDuterte\u2019s pivot causes confusion,\u201d Mr. Vuving said, \u201cbut also validates Vietnam\u2019s current approach to China, which combines deference with resistance and avoids relying on a single great power.\u201dA news analysis article on Oct. 25 about China\u2019s improved relationship with the Philippines, an important American ally, following a visit by the Philippine president to China referred incorrectly to an economist at Natixis Bank who discussed Chinese investments in the Philippines.

The film\u2019s original distributor, the Walter Reade Organization (named for its founder, a pioneer of art-house distribution), did not file for a new copyright after changing the title from the original \u201cNight of the Flesh Eaters\u201d to \u201cNight of the Living Dead.\u201d That meant the movie went into the public domain almost immediately. As was once the case with Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d the movie has been subjected to many unofficial, though legal, iterations.\u201cWe got our baby back,\u201d Gary Streiner, one of the film\u2019s producers, said in a phone interview.The process, Mr. Streiner said, began in earnest last year, when he; his brother, Russ (who co-produced and also played Johnny in the movie); and the screenwriter John Russo resolved to make a proper inventory of the film\u2019s surviving elements, going through their own archives and the archive of the lab that originally worked on the film.They turned to MoMA for help, partly because of its history with the film and partly for a practical reason. \u201cOur vaults are in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Katie Trainor, the MoMA\u2019s film collections manager. \u201cOnce they had the materials together, they did not want to risk shipping them; they drove them from Pittsburgh. They were literally looking over my shoulder as I was inspecting the materials.\u201dMr. Streiner recalled his relief at finding the negative in decent shape: \u201cWe could have opened the cans and found dust!\u201dThe restoration was backed by, among others, the Film Foundation, the preservation nonprofit started by the director Martin Scorsese. In an interview, its executive director, Margaret Bodde, said, \u201cThe movie had been on a wish list of ours for some time,\u201d and it helped \u201cthat we had the director around to consult with, which is too rare in film restoration.\u201dMr. Romero said that it had been years since he had seen the film presented in its proper aspect ratio, a squarelike 1.37 to 1; many versions had been cropped to wide-screen proportions. \u201cThe restoration is very beautiful, and of course the movie\u2019s pimples do show,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a copy of the script visible in one of the frames! I won\u2019t tell where. It will be a little challenge for fans to spot it.\u201dAs Ms. Trainor toiled with the filmmakers, she learned what a shoestring Image Ten had worked on. \u201cThe car in the opening scene belonged to the Streiners\u2019 mother,\u201d she said. \u201cThey borrowed it from her, and she didn\u2019t realize they\u2019d smashed the windshield because they replaced it before returning it to her. The dent they show in the car after it rolls into the tree was there to begin with, though.\u201dJosh Siegel, curator of film at MoMA, said in an interview, \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate turn of historical fate that Image Ten created one of the most successful horror films of all time and didn\u2019t reap the benefits of it.\u201dOver the years, members of the original filmmaking team have tried to mine some profit from their vision, creating alternate cuts, even a colorized version. Because restoration at a certain level has been deemed to create new intellectual property, this is the first time the film as they wanted it seen will, to an extent, belong to them.An article last Sunday about the film \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d misstated the surname of the executive direc-tor of the nonprofit organization Film Foundation.

If the lease is successfully transferred, there is an additional $150 charge.Higher-price packages include 12 photographs, eliminate the success fee and put the vehicle in a higher listing position on the Swapalease website.It is not a surefire method. For one thing, the makers of some vehicles, including Land Rovers leased through the Land Rover Financial Group, and Volvos leased through Volvo Car Financial Services, do not allow transfer of leases.Even if the company does allow a lease transfer, the original lessee may remain liable for the new lessee\u2019s payments if that person defaults, damages the vehicle or drives over the allotted mileage.There may be additional costs. To increase the likelihood of finding someone to take over a lease, it is often necessary to offer some sort of cash incentive.In addition, the auto financing company may charge a lease transfer fee, which is typically paid by the person unloading the lease. That fee varies by state and can be as much as $595 in the case of a Fiat Chrysler, General Motors or Mercedes vehicle leased from the companies\u2019 financing arms, or as low as $75 in the case of Ford.Advertisement"}

American mobile phones never worked in the country, and even after the recent nuclear deal, many economic sanctions remain in place, frustrating foreign businesses interested in cracking the Iranian market.So it was something of a shock when, having fallen asleep after arriving at his sick grandmother\u2019s house in Tehran, the businessman, Faryar Ghazanfari, an intellectual-property lawyer, heard a buzzing coming from the bag.At first, he thought it was an alarm. Then he picked up. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what was happening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was San Francisco. A colleague wanted an update on a patent case.\u201dThe agreement is one of the few signs that the promises President Hassan Rouhani made long ago of welcoming Western businesses and ending Iran\u2019s isolation are at last beginning to be realized.\u201cThis is a step in the right direction,\u201d Masoud Daneshmand, an official at the Iran Chamber of Commerce, said of AT&T\u2019s partnership with RighTel. \u201cThe fact that phones are working in Iran and the United States is a sign of good will on both sides.\u201dBut enough sanctions remained that Western banks refused to finance commerce with Iran without specific licenses from the United States Treasury. That seemed to choke off most business opportunities outside the oil and gas sector and the airlines. But for whatever reasons, AT&T decided to move ahead, apparently determined to shun publicity about its moves.The Treasury would also not speak about the deal, saying in a statement that it \u201cgenerally does not comment on specific licenses or engagement with private parties.\u201dNevertheless, having working American mobile phones in Iran sends a powerful message that times are changing, albeit very slowly.\u201cNow we are, of course, hoping that the United States lifts all trade restrictions on Iran,\u201d Mr. Daneshmand said. \u201cIn return, we will lift visa restrictions for Americans.\u201dAT&T still faces the many hurdles that all companies have in doing business in Iran. In addition to its endemic corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency, Iran works on a calendar different from the West\u2019s, with different months and a Thursday-Friday weekend. The communication infrastructure is poor but improving, and many websites are blocked by the government.And there is still the possibility of opposition from conservative clerics and Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who could end the arrangement in a flash if he felt it was inappropriate.For many, perhaps, but by no means all. \u201cIf we get service in return, it is not that bad,\u201d said Mohammad Javad Helali, a Shiite Muslim cleric connected to the hard-line faction. \u201cWe just hope that the services will be free from infiltration by American intelligence services.\u201dThe opening up of phone service is undoubtedly a welcome surprise to Iranians and the approximately two million Iranians living in the United States, many of whom travel frequently to their home country.Azad Jafarian, an Iranian-American filmmaker, said his mother had just flown in from Los Angeles through a connection in the Persian Gulf state of Qatar, and he smiled when he saw her turning off the flight mode on her cellphone, bringing it back to normal operating status.What happened next startled him. \u201cI was driving her home, I saw her swiping her phone, and seconds later the phone started ringing,\u201d Mr. Jafarian recalled. In a light panic, he told her to turn it off. \u201cI was like, \u2018This can\u2019t be real.\u2019\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Oct. 9 about AT&T\u2019s partnership with an Iranian company to provide voice and data service in Iran to AT&T\u2019s customers with American phones referred incorrectly to a representative of AT&T who acknowledged the partnership.

{"Headline": "Warrant for Mexican Ex-Official, Now on the Run, Is Seen as a Step in Graft Fight", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The lush Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Mexico, suffered all kinds of mismanagement during the nearly six years that Javier Duarte was governor.Tens of millions of dollars meant for social programs were diverted to phantom companies. Older people were so impoverished by looting of the state\u2019s pension funds that they marched in protest. The state\u2019s main university was stripped of much of its budget. And all the while, Veracruz was plagued by violence, including the murder of 17 journalists, according to figures compiled by a special state committee.Now it has all appeared to have caught up with Mr. Duarte. Last week, he resigned the governorship, 48 days before the end of his six-year term. Then a federal judge this week issued an arrest warrant for him on racketeering and money-laundering charges. Mr. Duarte, who has denied the charges, vanished before he could be taken into custody.For Mexicans, the sight of a public official accumulating an inexplicable fortune while in office is bitterly familiar. It is much more unusual to see such officials called to account, and the question raised by the Duarte case is whether it is a turning point. Will it be the first of many such prosecutions meant to seriously address corruption, or just a one-of-a-kind escape valve for public pressure?\u201cCorruption has started to have a political cost,\u201d said Juan E. Pardinas, the director general at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness. \u201cThe discussion has already changed the luck of these people.\u201dFirst, though, the authorities have to track down Mr. Duarte. The interior minister, Miguel Angel Osorio Chong, bristled on Wednesday when reporters asked whether the government had somehow let Mr. Duarte escape.\u201cHow strange to bring this up, when the facts show that it is this government that is going after these types of actions, \u201d he said.Until now, the government has seemed reluctant to combat the culture of impunity that lets corruption fester.Public disgust was galvanized two years ago by a report that President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s wife had quietly bought a luxury mansion from a government contractor on highly favorable terms. Since then, corruption has emerged as a central political issue, contributing to electoral losses for the president\u2019s party in several states, including Veracruz.There have also been moves in the national legislature to strengthen Mexico\u2019s anticorruption laws, but the measures are complex and will not take full effect for a year or more.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government has said it supports a web of new agencies set up to audit public funds and swiftly punish their misuse, but has moved slowly. The president has not proposed a candidate to be the new anticorruption prosecutor, and the office of federal comptroller has gone unfilled for three months.Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto argues that corruption is a social problem and that all Mexicans share the blame.\u201cThere is nobody who can dare to cast the first stone,\u201d he said in a speech on Sept. 28. \u201cEverybody has been part of a model that we are shaking off and want to change.\u201dAmong those who have benefited most handsomely from that model are some of Mexico\u2019s state governors, who face few checks on their power. With rare exceptions, though, governors suspected of corruption have been untouchable.In part, they have been shielded by laws that make it difficult for the federal authorities to audit state governments swiftly and prosecute wrongdoing by state officials. But the governors\u2019 impunity is also linked to the important role they play in electoral politics.\u201cThe money from Veracruz goes to the whole country,\u201d Mr. Pardinas of the competitiveness institute said.Mr. Duarte, 43, belongs to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., which ruled Mexico almost without challenge for generations until losing the presidency in 2000; Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto won it back for the party in 2012.Two other outgoing P.R.I. governors also face allegations of corruption, which they have denied. But so does a former governor from the opposition National Action Party, who, like Mr. Duarte, disappeared last week after a warrant was issued for his arrest.\u201cThere is a risk that all the parties end up swapping prisoners, and there\u2019s no change at the roots\u201d of corruption, said Mauricio Merino, a professor of public administration at CIDE, a university in Mexico City.Mr. Duarte\u2019s case looms the largest right now, both for the amount of public money that is missing and for the anger he has engendered in Veracruz.The federal auditor, Juan Manuel Portal, said this year that he had asked the state to explain discrepancies of almost $2 billion over four years.The party withdrew its protection for Mr. Duarte after the opposition won the June election in Veracruz, normally a bastion for the P.R.I. \u201cIt is absolutely clear to me that the party responded with a great deal of rancor and left him on his own,\u201d Mr. Merino said.Under Mr. Duarte, Veracruz\u2019s troubles had been mounting for years, as social programs and public works projects slowed to a halt, according to Hilario Barcelata, director of the public finance observatory at the Universidad Veracruzana, which the government starved of cash.\u201cThe state government turned into a criminal organization that handled the state finances however they felt like doing,\u201d Mr. Barcelata said. \u201cBut this was only possible due to complicity with the federal government.\u201dWhy? Alberto Olvera, a history researcher at the university, said that \u201cDuarte\u2019s reckless practices would support the federal government\u2019s political agenda and benefit some officials at the federal level.\u201dThe lawmakers and others who helped devise the country\u2019s new anticorruption mechanisms argue that they will go a long way toward preventing any future governor from doing what Mr. Duarte is accused of doing \u2014 once the mechanisms are in place, that is.\u201cA little bit of patience will help,\u201d Mr. Merino said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Almost a Century, the 2nd Avenue Subway Is Oh-So-Close to Arriving", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byIt has occupied a special place in New York City\u2019s imagination for nearly 100 years: an unfinished dream, a punch line for delays, a construction nightmare. Some New Yorkers wondered if they would ever live to see the day when it came to life.After decades of failed efforts, the first segment of the Second Avenue subway line is scheduled to open in December, with three new stations on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Thomas F. Prendergast, said in an interview last week that the line was set to open by the end of the year. It was important to show riders that \u201cwe live up to our promises,\u201d Mr. Prendergast said. \u201cWe\u2019re now within striking distance of having it done.\u201dStriking distance is one thing; up and running is another. There is plenty of work left to do, and workers are racing to make sure the line is ready on time. The new stations are nearly complete, and crews are operating trains on the tracks. But hurdles remain, including testing the fire alarm system as well as the escalators and elevators at the 72nd Street station.The Second Avenue line has been on the drawing board since the 1920s and will be the most ambitious expansion of the subway system in a half-century. It will also be a critical milestone for the authority at a time when both New York\u2019s population and the number of tourists flooding the city have reached record levels, placing enormous pressure on public transit.On a recent morning, dozens of construction workers were busy outside the 72nd Street station, where some of them were installing panels on the side of a building. Bambi Kapp lives nearby and talks regularly with workers about how the project is coming along. Some have told her it will open in December. Others have said February.\u201cThey\u2019re optimistic, and clearly there\u2019s progress,\u201d Ms. Kapp said.Still, despite the excitement, the first segment is much shorter than once envisioned. It was supposed to run the length of Manhattan, taking some of the burden off the crowded Lexington Avenue line. For now, it is a nearly two-mile extension of the Q line. As such, Q trains will travel to the station at 63rd Street and Lexington Avenue before reaching new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets. Eventually, the line will extend north to 125th Street in East Harlem.For those who live on the Upper East Side, though, the subway may soon provide relief. A video emerged this month showing the first test trains running. At long last, construction-weary residents are shifting from skeptical to celebratory.\u201cI think we should throw champagne on the cars like they do with yachts,\u201d said Linda Orhun, a wellness consultant who lives on East 75th Street. But, she added: \u201cSeeing is believing. It\u2019s been a long haul.\u201dThe latest push began in the 1990s. The project won considerable support from Sheldon Silver, the powerful speaker of the New York Assembly who represented the Lower East Side before being convicted on corruption charges last year. The federal government promised more than $1 billion for the line, while the authority has covered much of the cost through its long-term capital plans.At several recent transportation authority board meetings, Kent Haggas, an independent engineer for the project, has warned that the opening could be delayed again. In September, he said that about 300 tests were still needed and that workers had to speed up the rate at which they were finishing them.\u201cThis is our No. 1 concern,\u201d said Mr. Haggas, who is expected to provide a monthly update at a board meeting this week.Mr. Prendergast has not ruled out opening the new line but temporarily bypassing 72nd Street if that station is not yet ready. After a board meeting last month, he said trains had temporarily bypassed stations after the bombing in Chelsea on Sept. 17.He said last week that it was too early to discuss skipping stations and that he was focused on making sure they were all ready on time. \u201cWe haven\u2019t given up on anything at this point,\u201d he said.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who controls the authority, has pressed officials to meet the December deadline, Mr. Prendergast said. The governor meets with leaders at the agency each week to discuss the project and regularly visits different stations to monitor the contractors\u2019 work, said James Allen, a spokesman for the governor, a Democrat.In the shadow of the construction on 72nd Street, the Trend Diner advertises a \u201cHard Hat Special\u201d: 10 percent off for subway workers. The restaurant\u2019s manager, Nicanor Gonzalez, said that business was rough and that he hoped it would improve once the construction clutter was gone.\u201cThey say December \u2014 I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s ready.\u201dEven if passengers do start coming through the turnstiles by then, it would be difficult to claim the line was on schedule after such a tortured history, said Joseph B. Raskin, a former New York City Transit employee and the author of a book on subway lines that were never built.\u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s on time,\u201d Mr. Raskin said. \u201cI guess you could say: Better late than never.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I just want to protect my home.\u201dThe country\u2019s creditors have pressed the government to allow the auction of delinquent debtors\u2019 properties, collecting billions of euros that could be used to prop up tottering Greek banks.Greek banks hold 108 billion euros, or about $119 billion, in bad loans, just under half of all loans given out. Of these, 41 percent are delinquent mortgages.The real challenge is to address the problem of bad loans in a way that offers some hope to debtors like Mr. Hanis but does not undermine the banking system.That circle may be impossible to square.The country has been given three international bailouts worth more than \u20ac300 billion over the past six years, but it cannot recover if its banks are foundering.Government officials have insisted that homes are safe. Giorgos Stathakis, the economy minister, said in a statement that \u201cfirst homes are already protected as regards debts to banks.\u201dThe authorities, he added, are also \u201cexamining further intervention for debts exclusively to the state,\u201d meaning debts like unpaid taxes.Yet in the spring, the government lifted a ban on the sale of delinquent mortgages and loans to small businesses. In the summer, new laws were passed that allowed banks to initiate foreclosures if debtors are regarded as uncooperative.Every Wednesday, when foreclosure auctions are held, protesters gather outside Greek courts, blocking access to legal staff, barging into courtrooms and, on occasion, clashing with the riot police.Among those protesting are groups like the left-leaning Repossessions Stop and Den Plirono (I Won\u2019t Pay), as well as right-wing groups.Stefanos Grigorakis of the United Pan-Popular Front, a nationalist group, joined one recent Wednesday protest outside the Athens county court. He said the government\u2019s reassurances were disingenuous.\u201cIt\u2019s deception, so people sit back on their couches,\u201d he said. \u201cGreeks have to wake up. They handed over the public wealth,\u201d he added, referring to the government\u2019s plans for state privatizations. \u201cNow they\u2019re coming to take our houses.\u201dSuch protests have blocked dozens of repossessions in recent weeks. Auctions began in September, when Greek lawyers returned to work after a nine-month strike over cuts to their pensions.In a speech in Parliament this month, Mr. Tsipras defended his government\u2019s efforts to protect homeowners. He said there had been only 500 repossessions this year and none in 2015, when his leftist Syriza party came to power, compared with thousands under previous governments.Greek notaries and the association of Greek borrowers said the numbers were higher, though they did not have exact figures.The head of the borrowers\u2019 association, Vangelis Kritikos, said about 50,000 properties would be up for repossession next year. \u201cPeople are panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day we get about 500 calls.\u201dAfter violent clashes in Thessaloniki at a planned foreclosure auction in the first week of October, Greek notaries said they would no longer attend auctions for primary residences and urged the government to pass a law categorically protecting them.The deputy finance minister, Tryfon Alexiadis, declared a ban on foreclosures of primary residences with a taxable value of \u20ac300,000 or more. Strong words aside, the authorities stopped short of legislation. According to the political opposition and other critics, that was because creditor representatives were in Athens and would have objected.Negotiations between Greece and its creditors have several times touched on the huge burden that nonperforming loans have placed on Greek banks, but the issue remains unresolved.Unless it can be solved, Greek banks will be unable to pump money back into the economy. They have already been recapitalized three times in three years.As is customary, officials of the eurozone countries, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund would not comment publicly while bailout negotiations were underway. Privately though, officials said it was not the first time that the Greek government had ventured a \u201cunilateral action\u201d that it had then revoked.All three institutions have pointed to bad loans as a major problem, calling for a crackdown on delinquent debtors, particularly strategic defaulters (who have money but do not pay) and the development of a market where bad loans could be traded.Yannis Stournaras, the head of Greece\u2019s central bank, also highlighted the issue last month, saying that \u201ctackling the high stock of nonperforming loans is the greatest challenge facing the Greek banking system and the Greek economy.\u201dGreek bank officials, in talks with foreign envoys, have proposed that auctions be conducted electronically to overcome the problem posed by angry protesters at courthouses.In the meantime, Greek homeowners like Mr. Hanis, the retired accountant, remain in limbo. He took out two mortgages, in 2001 and 2012, worth \u20ac71,000. Once his pension was cut, he asked for help from banks, which advised him to take out new loans to pay off the old ones.\u201cIt\u2019s like Greece getting more loans from the lenders,\u201d he said. \u201cJust more debt to pay the old debt, but what else could I do?\u201dMr. Hanis applied to a government program introduced in 2010, at the peak of the crisis, that aims to reduce monthly payments for people with serious financial problems. The program has since been qualified by so many conditions that inclusion is difficult.About 150,000 applications are pending. His hopes now hang on a court case in November.Mr. Hanis\u2019s lawyer, Dimitris Anastasopoulos, said he had represented \u201cabout 1,000 people\u201d during the crisis years, \u201cnot including the hundreds of people who walked in here to seek advice.\u201dA key problem, he said, is that the Greek authorities have focused more on giving homeowners a false sense of security than providing them with information about their options.\u201cSuccessive governments convinced people that they won\u2019t lose their homes while they tried to figure out what to do,\u201d Mr. Anastasopoulos said. \u201cThey issue a law saying, \u2018We can take your house.\u2019 Then, they reassure you that it\u2019s protected.\u201dMany homeowners are desperate, he said, citing a client who recently told him that he had contemplated suicide.Mr. Hanis fears a rejection, but said he would continue to fight.\u201cI\u2019m going to appeal for a reprieve,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I just can\u2019t make the payments.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Using some of the same tactics that drove food companies to move away from caged hens, advocates are asking whether the conditions for the cage-free chickens are much better.The video focuses on a hen that Direct Action rescued and named Ella. When the organization found her in the cage-free barn, she was struggling to pull herself up and had lost most of her feathers. Her back was covered in feces.\u201cThere were birds rotting on the floor, and there was one dead bird that seemed to have lost her head,\u201d said Wayne Hsiung, who helped make the video for the group, which is better known as DxE. \u201cThere were birds attacking birds, and the smell was horrible.\u201dThe egg industry has long warned that hens living cage-free in aviary systems will experience higher mortality rates and more disease. Research by the Coalition for Sustainable Egg Supply, which is financed by egg producers and food companies, found \u201csubstantially worse\u201d levels of aggression and cannibalism in cage-free systems, also known as aviary systems, compared with caged systems. It has also found more damage to the birds\u2019 sternums.\u201cConsumers have an idyllic vision of what cage-free farming looks like,\u201d Mr. Hsiung said. \u201cThey need to be shown the truth, which is that cage-free is far from humane.\u201dYet, partly in response to graphic videos and reports about the conditions of caged chickens, consumers pressured companies from McDonald\u2019s to Walmart and Costco to turn to cage-free eggs. Those companies have rushed to promise buying only cage-free eggs in the years to come, which has pushed egg producers to invest tens of millions of dollars in aviary systems. Many animal rights activists have applauded those commitments.Direct Action, which mounts protests on the treatment of animals with a goal of ending meat consumption, decided to test these companies. The group bought a carton of cage-free eggs sold under Kirkland, and traced them back to Pleasant Valley Farms, an egg producer in Farmington, Calif.Volunteers from Direct Action shot the video over several visits to the barns in late September and early October. Most, but not all, of the video was taken at night. The group did not seek permission to enter the farm, Mr. Hsiung said, but he argued that the group had not broken any laws because they had suspected animal cruelty and that gave them a right to enter the property.On Thursday evening, though, Pleasant Valley released a statement describing the group\u2019s actions as a \u201cbreak-in and trespassing\u201d and criticized the content of the video. \u201cThe video does not accurately show what truly goes on in our barns and appears to be staged for production effect,\u201d the farm said.Pleasant Valley said that because members of Direct Action may have contaminated the barn, the company had destroyed all the birds in it.Costco said in a statement that the video appeared to involve just one barn out of the many that it uses to supply the eggs sold under its Kirkland brand.\u201cWe have reinspected the barn and other operations of this supplier, and based on these inspections and prior audits, we are comfortable with the animal welfare aspects of the operation,\u201d the company said.Paul Shapiro, vice president for farm animal protection at the Humane Society of the United States, said that cage-free hen housing was without a doubt better than battery cages, though not without problems.He noted that an assessment by researchers in the Netherlands that ranked various types of hen housing for animal welfare on a scale of 0 to 10 gave aviary systems a 5.8, while cages were 0. \u201cWith companies like Costco,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s better to welcome them for taking the first steps rather than punish them for not taking the last step.\u201dBut Mr. Hsiung said that people should understand more about what the cage-free conditions are like.\u201cI give animal rights activists credit for pressuring corporations to make a change,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether this is the right change is up for debate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton, now entering its final week, has divided Americans and taken politics to a new low. But they are hardly the only people on the Nov. 8 ballot, nor the only ones battling for leadership in a polarized country.\u201cPlease re-elect Gerald,\u201d she says, with mock sincerity. \u201cPlease.\u201dBut other low-altitude races reflect the more turbulent currents of American politics at a time when the country\u2019s social and political rifts have been laid painfully bare. Here in Irvine, for example, religion, race and money are factors, as are the national splits inside the Republican and Democratic Parties. And if the prizes are far less powerful than that in the presidential race, the contests themselves can be no less ferocious.The election drama in California instead lies within the Democratic camp. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who challenged Mrs. Clinton from the left during the party primary contests, still has many staunch supporters. Some Democrats see their party\u2019s nominee as a mortal enemy, and the scars of the rivalry are still tender as the election draws near.It has certainly been a hard-fought campaign. Candidates have distributed fliers and emails accusing one another of not paying taxes, having large business debts or, in one case, a hit-and run conviction in a road accident in 1999. Some candidates were backed by big party machines and donors, especially on the Republican side, and local construction companies were also powerful players.But Ms. Ali\u2019s most potent challenge came from close by: Farrah N. Khan, a fellow Democrat who was also born in Pakistan.Ms. Khan, 44, a businesswoman, had stolen a march on Ms. Ali by garnering the endorsement of young Democrats at the 30,000-student University of California, Irvine, a crucial battleground in the election.Both women spend their afternoons on the leafy campus, canvassing students for support. The rivalry is personal. Ms. Ali accused some student leaders, now backing Ms. Khan, of \u201cspying\u201d on her campaign. \u201cWhen people come into your home, pretend to be your friend, then stab you in the back, there\u2019s something really wrong with that,\u201d she said.Student leaders on campus dismissed those charges: Ms. Ali was sore, they said, because they refused to endorse her.These young activists told me they had taken Mr. Sanders to heart when he called on them, after his defeat to Mrs. Clinton, to start their political revolution at the grass-roots level. \u201cIn California, the question is not about Trump or Hillary,\u201d Cassius Rutherford, 19, said. \u201cIt\u2019s about what kind of Democratic Party we want to have.\u201dThis tiny race in Irvine also had echoes of the religious and identity politics that have rung loudly in the presidential campaign.I found Ms. Khan at her suburban home, where six students, all Sanders supporters, had gathered around her dining table to canvass voters by phone. Insinuations that she was soft on extremism were unfair, she said. She had opposed the White House counterterrorism program only because it unfairly singled out Muslims. (So did the American Civil Liberties Union.)She was fending off other attacks, too. One set of opponents had registered a $50,000 fund to attack her, she said. Then there were the lawn signs, posted around Irvine, that accused her of being \u201canti-Israel.\u201dShe said it was a ridiculous charge \u2014 in her spare time, she runs an interfaith council that includes rabbis, Christian ministers and imams.The signs did not say who had financed them, although Ms. Khan said she was pretty sure who it was. She declined to name names.\u201cI don\u2019t want to get drawn into negative campaigning,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The company also offers dozens of colors, fabric swatches and full-size paper printouts of sofas to let customers see how the pieces will look and fit in their homes.The BenchMade Modern factory in Los Angeles tracks the construction process, gives customers live online updates and provides free delivery. The typical turnaround time for production is seven days.\u201cI wanted to take away customers\u2019 frustrations,\u201d said Mr. Blazona, a former Pottery Barn designer whose company now has 16 employees. \u201cWith big furniture retailers, you can buy sofas in a few sizes and colors, and they\u2019re shipped in two to four weeks.\u201dAs retailers like Ikea and Crate & Barrel lose their luster among some shoppers, a range of furniture start-ups like BenchMade Modern see an opportunity. They are courting customers, increasingly millennials, who want unique furniture that will last. And fast delivery becomes increasingly important as more online retailers offer shorter delivery times for all types of goods.BenchMade Modern, based in San Francisco, is already breaking even, Mr. Blazona said. To keep costs low, he is using a hybrid store model, in which furniture is sold online and in a showroom in the Mission District of San Francisco. To speed the process, orders are sent directly to the factory.Technology is making it easier, and cheaper, to offer made-to-order.\u201cThe days of the megafurniture store are gone,\u201d said Mr. Blazona, who designed his eight-piece sofa collection in a clean, Modernist style. \u201cThey\u2019re very expensive to run.

He said he first researched West Elm and Room & Board offerings.Mr. Hancock, an advertising account manager, heard about BenchMade Modern via word of mouth. He bought from the firm because of the custom sizes that could fit into a long space. The short delivery time and comparable prices were also big selling points.\u201cI\u2019d rather buy from a smaller company,\u201d said Mr. Hancock, \u201cbecause you feel like you\u2019re part of the process.\u201d He added that he was impressed that Mr. Blazona personally called him to confirm the furniture order.\u201cThe days of walking into Pottery Barn and buying a whole bedroom suite\u201d are gone, Ms. Fine said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a huge appetite for customization.\u201dThe lower barriers to entry are also prompting more design-driven furniture businesses. John Humphrey started Greycork in Rhode Island in 2013 with a mission of offering well-designed furnishings made from high-quality woods like Baltic birch from Scandinavia or Russia and American ash. Four Greycork designers are Rhode Island School of Design graduates. The furniture can be assembled by consumers in minutes. The company also offers free shipping and free 60-day trials.Mr. Humphrey, a former analyst at a venture capital firm, expects Greycork revenue to reach $1 million this year. His goal is to scale up quickly, as Warby Parker did, by offering affordable pieces. He is offering a coffee table for $185.His online financing campaign via Indiegogo set out to raise $50,000 and ended up with just over $270,000. Since then, he has raised another $2 million from venture capital and angel investors.The company, he said, was particularly focused on attracting millennials, a growing consumer market of those ages 18 to 34. \u201cThe opportunity is very large,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a brand that speaks to millennials.\u201dMillennials became the largest furniture consumer group in the United States in 2014, according to Fung Business Intelligence research. Their spending on furniture increased 142 percent from 2012 to 2014.But while the start-ups have opportunities in the market, they are facing production issues. Greycork\u2019s far-flung furniture supply chain, Mr. Humphrey said, was difficult to manage as wood was shipped from Russia and fabric imported from China for pieces assembled in the southeastern United States. \u201cWe\u2019re working down the learning curve,\u201d he said.Some furniture start-ups have set their sights on the typical Ikea customer.Brad Sewell, a former Apple engineer, started Campaign Living last year. It is taking preorders and aims to offer furniture with simple lines and deliver it in three to five days. The affordable furnishings can be assembled in a few minutes without tools and easily repacked in two boxes. An armchair, for example, sells for $495.Campaign Living, which has three employees, has raised over $1 million in seed money, said Mr. Sewell, whose company is based in Emeryville, Calif. \u201cEveryone needs a place to sit,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s enough space for everyone to exist.\u201dHis offerings don\u2019t fit into the \u201cdisposable furniture\u201d category that many young people may be accustomed to. He spent a year creating prototypes. He said he had tested furniture frames using hydraulic cylinders in Detroit that simulated the load of a 250-pound human.Furniture frames are made from laser-cut steel. The legs are crafted from sustainable woods from the Midwest. Particle board is banned. He said he hoped his furniture would be handed down through generations.The offbeat signature styles of some of the new designers may never be a huge part of the $96 billion furniture industry, but start-ups are finding ways to reach their target audiences with them.Akron Street, a small New York company founded by two designers, Hansley Yunez and Lulu Li, has also offered up easy-to-assemble pieces. Its 12-piece furniture line, which went on sale last summer, is made with white oak from Appalachia. A solid wood coffee table, for instance, is $295.The company began with a $140,000 family loan. Since then, the founders have bootstrapped the financing. They designed the website themselves, and advertising and marketing are done by word of mouth or on Craigslist. The furniture showroom is the couple\u2019s East Village apartment in New York City.Already, the company has a waiting list for some furniture pieces.\u201cPeople may not want all the same furniture,\u201d said Mr. Yunez, who is also courting millennials. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a sense of identity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "MetLife Again Faces Off With Regulators Over Its Too-Big-to-Fail Status", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three judges at Washington\u2019s federal appeals court on Monday questioned the government\u2019s analysis that led to MetLife\u2019s designation as a \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d financial company, as the Justice Department appeals a lower court\u2019s decision to strip the insurance giant of that label.During arguments that lasted a little more than an hour, the judges explored whether banking regulators should have more explicitly examined the likelihood that MetLife would have failed \u2014 one of the insurer\u2019s central arguments \u2014 rather than just looking at what would happen if it did.They also questioned whether regulators delved deeply enough when analyzing how the insurer\u2019s hypothetical failure would impact the financial system as a whole.Judge Patricia Millett of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the regulators\u2019 conclusions lacked \u201cconcreteness.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not specific enough when you say, \u2018Well, it\u2019s a really bad situation so we assume bad things are going to happen,\u2019\u201d she said.It was the second time lawyers for the regulators and MetLife faced off in court in the fight over whether the insurance company deserved to be labeled a so-called systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, something that brings new standards and extra regulatory oversight.The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act empowered a group of regulators known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate some nonbank firms that could pose a risk to the financial system in times of trouble as SIFIs.But Judge Rosemary Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia threw out MetLife\u2019s SIFI designation in March, arguing that regulators had failed to adequately assess the likelihood that the insurer would experience severe financial distress or the consequences a failure would have on the broader economy. She also noted that regulators did not consider the potential costs of the designation.All three judges at Monday\u2019s arguments pressed Mark B. Stern, a lawyer for the Justice Department, on the issue of vulnerability, including whether regulators had a duty to look at a firm\u2019s likelihood of failure.\u201cThe prediction is a 100 percent chance that it will fail,\u201d said Judge A. Raymond Randolph. \u201cThat\u2019s what the assumption is.\u201dIn response, Mr. Stern argued that the council considered a host of \u201cinterrelated factors\u201d such as leverage that go to the issue of vulnerability, asserting that regulators were never required to assess the likelihood of distress on its own.\u201cWhat the council is trying to determine is not whether but how distress will affect an institution \u2014 in this case, MetLife,\u201d he said.He added that predicting the likelihood of failure was tremendously difficult, noting that very few people, except perhaps those featured in the recent movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d would have forecast the collapse of American International Group before the financial crisis. But Mr. Stern argued that its near-failure in September 2008 and the consequences were devastating.\u201cA.I.G. is instructive,\u201d Mr. Stern said.While the line of questioning at the hearing appeared sympathetic to MetLife\u2019s arguments, the judges also asked some pointed questions of the insurer\u2019s lawyer, Eugene Scalia, son of Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice. They pressed him about whether regulators had acted within the law in applying the SIFI designation, even if they did not conduct the exact analysis that the insurer itself would have preferred.In addition, the judges asked Mr. Scalia about whether it was the job of the regulatory council to estimate the potential costs and benefits of the SIFI label.Mr. Scalia emphasized that the designation itself had already posed significant costs on the firm, including millions of dollars in assessments to the government. He said that MetLife had hosted about a dozen examiners who were overseeing its activities before the March ruling.\u201cWhat the council did was trigger\u201d the duties and burdens now facing MetLife, he said.Any court ruling could have broad implications for the council\u2019s designations process going forward, including the handling of firms it has already labeled. In addition to MetLife, regulators have named A.I.G., Prudential Financial and General Electric\u2019s finance unit as SIFIs, though G.E. succeeded in removing the label earlier this year after shedding significant assets.Before the arguments, analysts had predicted the federal government had a slight edge in its appeals case, because two of the judges, Ms. Millet and Sri Srinivasan, were appointed to the court by President Obama; this potentially makes them more inclined to defer to the expert judgment of the regulators who came to assume these new regulatory mandates during the Obama administration. Judge Randolph is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, and Judge Collyer of the Federal District Court was appointed by former President George W. Bush.The tough questions posed at the hearing suggested the court may not be so lenient, though there is a high bar for judges in deciding that regulators have acted inappropriately.The government has also tapped some financial policy heavyweights on its behalf. The former Federal Reserve chairmen Ben Bernanke and Paul Volcker filed a friend-of-the-court brief this summer that supported the council\u2019s conclusions. And more than a dozen current and former members of Congress \u2014 including former Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and former Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, the primary authors of the Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 submitted their own filing.\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision, if upheld, would fundamentally undermine the program that Congress put in place when it enacted Dodd-Frank to try to prevent such financial crises from occurring in the future,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could a President Clinton Be Tough on Wall St.? Her Staff\u2019s Emails Hint Yes", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byDealBookWhen Hillary Clinton was battling Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, she made spirited attacks on Wall Street and corporate America.\u201cProsperity can\u2019t just be for C.E.O.s and hedge fund managers,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in one speech.In another: \u201cNo bank is too big to fail, and no executive is too powerful to jail.\u201dAnd the recent dumps of emails and other material from WikiLeaks have tended to reinforce that impression. Behind the scenes, according to the transcripts of her paid speeches to the big banks, she often appeared conciliatory toward the financial industry. In one speech, she characterized the blame laid on banks as \u201cpoliticizing what happened,\u201d and even implied that bankers should play a role in setting appropriate regulation: \u201cYou guys help us figure it out, and let\u2019s make sure that we do it right this time.\u201dSuch ideas, of course, would be anathema to Mr. Sanders.But while some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s detractors spread the view that she is bought and paid for by Wall Street, the WikiLeaks documents point to a slightly different dynamic. Readers may want to take a closer look not at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s speech transcripts \u2014 in which she does say a lot of what her audience presumably wanted to hear \u2014 but to the remarkably telling back-and-forth of emails among her staff members during the campaign. While the full record suggests that Mrs. Clinton may be a pragmatist, the emails sent by her staff hint that she may be inclined to impose heavier regulations on the financial industry than is fully understood.For people who don\u2019t like her coziness with Wall Street, this bit of nuance may be welcomed. For those who take comfort in her familiarity with the world of high finance, the leftward tug she seems to be feeling may disappoint.In one email, Mandy Grunwald, a consultant to the Clinton campaign, wrote that her understanding at one point last year \u201cfrom H.R.C. is that she left her call kind of leaning toward endorsing Glass-Steagall.\u201dMrs. Clinton has long said she won\u2019t reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that separated investment banking from commercial banking. The measure, a bulwark of the financial services industry for decades, was repealed during her husband\u2019s presidency, a move that has been blamed, in part, for the financial crisis. That Mrs. Clinton even toyed with endorsing Glass-Steagall is a surprise, even though she never went through with it. \u201cI understand that we face phoniness charges if we \u2018change\u2019 our position now \u2014 but we face political risks this way, too,\u201d Ms. Grunwald wrote.In another email message, in 2015, one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign speechwriters, Dan Schwerin, told others on his team that he had met with Dan Geldon, an adviser to Ms. Warren. \u201cHe was intently focused on personnel issues, laid out a detailed case against the Bob Rubin school of Democratic policy makers, was very critical of the Obama administration\u2019s choices, and explained at length the opposition to Antonio Weiss,\u201d a former banker at Lazard who had been nominated by President Obama for a role at the Treasury, over the objections of Ms. Warren. (Mr. Weiss withdrew his nomination and he instead became counselor to the secretary of the Treasury.)Mr. Schwerin continued to describe the meeting with Mr. Geldon and the guidance from their respective bosses: \u201cWe then carefully went through a list of people they do like, which E.W. sent over to H.R.C. earlier. We have already been in touch with a number of them, and I asked if he would be comfortable introducing me to the others, to which he seemed reasonably amenable.\u201dReading between the lines, it is hard to believe that Mrs. Clinton plans to dismiss Ms. Warren\u2019s concerns about the appointment of Wall Street insiders to critical government posts \u2014 which means that it is unlikely that many, if any, individuals with significant experience on Wall Street will end up in positions of power if she were to win. Maybe Mr. Schwerin was just going through the motions to placate Ms. Warren, but his actions and words seemed more genuine than that, and there was very little he said that was dismissive of Ms. Warren\u2019s views. (I\u2019ve written extensively in this column \u2014 often to the consternation of some readers \u2014 that it is foolish to disqualify individuals for public service because of their experience on Wall Street, but that\u2019s an issue for another day.)Another email by Mr. Schwerin that has been widely circulated in recent days \u2014 most frequently to attack Mrs. Clinton as two-faced \u2014 may be read to suggest something else. In it, Mr. Schwerin acknowledges that in a speech Mrs. Clinton gave to Deutsche Bank in 2014, he \u201cwrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats.\u201dHe went on to explain that if the speech were released, the \u201cupside would be that when people say she\u2019s too close to Wall Street and has taken too much money from bankers, we can point to evidence that she wasn\u2019t afraid to speak truth to power. Downside would be that we could then be pushed to release transcripts from all her paid speeches, which would be less helpful though probably not disastrous.\u201dThe email clearly demonstrates how focused her team was on how she would be perceived. And it does raise ethical questions about whether the campaign was hoping to deceive the public about what she had said.But embedded in those is emails was Mr. Schwerin\u2019s casual reference to bankers as \u201cfat cats\u201d \u2014 which most people on Wall Street consider a pejorative, even if most people on Main Street think of it as a harmless phrase \u2014 a tiny clue about how the Clinton machine may really perceive Wall Street. Yes, she may have to play along with them to get paid for speeches and for fund-raising, but you get the vibe from her staff members that the relationship would be somewhat less chummy when it comes to governing and policy.Finally, there is this: While Mrs. Clinton hasn\u2019t endorsed Glass-Steagall, she has publicly endorsed the idea that Wall Street banks should pay a \u201crisk fee\u201d based on their size. In one email exchange that was unearthed, Gene Sperling, another Clinton adviser, estimated that the proposal could mean \u201cGoldman and JP owe $8 billion or $18 billion.\u201d Such a sizable charge would be a huge surprise to Wall Street.Perhaps all these email exchanges are just a lot of two-faced talk. And maybe that\u2019s what Wall Street is counting on. But being two-faced can go both ways.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about what Hillary Clinton\u2019s staff emails suggest about her approach to Wall Street if elected, omitted, in some editions, the year of Dan Schwerin\u2019s email telling his team that he had met with Dan Geldon, an adviser to Elizabeth Warren. The email was sent in 2015. The column also misstated, in some editions, the circumstances of the withdrawal of Antonio Weiss\u2019s nomination for a role at the Treasury. Mr. Weiss withdrew his nomination; it was not withdrawn by the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Walls Here: Between Tijuana and San Diego, an Art Ethos Thrives", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byTIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 Marcos Ram\u00edrez, the ebullient artist known as ERRE, recently drove from San Diego to his workshop studio in Tijuana in a black Chevy Suburban riddled with bullet holes. The vehicle had a starring role in \u201cLa Suburban Negra,\u201d or \u201cThe Black Suburban,\u201d his 2012 installation and video about the drug trade, in which he plays a drug lord, a hit man and a cop.\u201cThe police, the bad guys, the C.I.A., the soccer moms \u2014 everybody with authority has a black Suburban,\u201d he explained as he barreled down Interstate 5 toward the border, making a slight detour for a strawberry ice cream cone.For young men growing up in Tijuana, as Mr. Ram\u00edrez did, the three characters he portrays in \u201cThe Black Suburban\u201d are potential life choices. He eventually opted for a fourth path: as a Conceptual artist whose work grapples with \u201cthe frictions produced by human interactions\u201d in the dual worlds on either side of the United States border with Mexico.Even amid calls by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, for building a wall at that border, the art scene in the San Diego-Tijuana megalopolis has assumed a consciously and exuberantly binational ethos.The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, a mere 17 miles from the Western Hemisphere\u2019s busiest land border crossing, has been at the forefront of collecting and exhibiting the work of Tijuana-based artists. The museum\u2019s leadership views the proximity to the border as a \u201csweet spot\u201d that helps lure younger audiences, said Hugh M. Davies, the museum\u2019s director.Mr. Ram\u00edrez, an internationally recognized artist whose work has appeared at the Whitney Biennial, made headlines in 1997 by installing a 33-foot-high two-headed Trojan horse in the fume-choked highway median on the American side of the border crossing. He is a ringleader of an increasingly visible fraternity of artists \u2014 Mr. Davies calls them \u201cthe straddlers\u201d \u2014 who ricochet back and forth across \u201cla linea,\u201d as the border is colloquially known.To reach his studio in the Colonia Libertad section, where he grew up, Mr. Ram\u00edrez leaves the relatively somnolent streets of downtown San Diego for a city of 1.3 million, where it\u2019s not uncommon to encounter fire jugglers, Michael Jackson impersonators or teetering clowns on stilts at traffic stops.Resonantly, perhaps, Mr. Ram\u00edrez has received a commission from the United States General Services Administration to create a work for the expanded Port of Entry in San Ysidro, Calif., the busiest border crossing.Their pilgrimage began in Brookings, Ore., where the two artists, accompanied by a filmmaker, Jos\u00e9 Inerzia, traipsed through sand and fog to plant the first obelisk on a windswept beach. For the Mexican-born Mr. Ram\u00edrez, the treaty that severed Mexico from over half its territorial lands represented a wound. \u201cIt was a wound with no scar,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo we acknowledged the loss by making a scar for the wound\u201d \u2014 with the location of each obelisk mapped on Google Earth.Mr. Taylor was game for the project after spending seven years photographing the 276 cast-iron and stone monuments, now lonely, that defined the present-day border before the fence was built. Many are in desolate wilderness areas that required Indiana Jones-style derring-do to locate. \u201cWe talk about the border as this monolithic phenomenon,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut it\u2019s a series of places with unique identities.\u201dIn a nondescript Tijuana building painted with a red heart, the 44-year-old artist Alida Cervantes explores the stratification of Mexican society. On a recent morning, her studio brimmed with paintings of voluptuous women in classical attire, inspired by glittery Oaxacan folk ceramics.Ms. Cervantes, who was born into affluence in Tijuana, grew up with the notion that it \u201cwas just dust, gas stations and prostitutes, and not a real cultural place,\u201d she said. Now her hometown fortifies her.She lives in San Diego but commutes daily to Tijuana. She views the border as a metaphor for \u201ccollisions, for things that aren\u2019t meant to be together put together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m addicted to both worlds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a boyfriend on the side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paintings That Bear the Scars of War", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byLI\u00c8GE, BELGIUM \u2014 A looted Matisse portrait of a woman in a blue dress with white frills is displayed not far from a black swastika and a life-size photo of Adolf Hitler in uniform, striding away from a hazy Eiffel Tower.Paintings rarely get to share war stories in a museum exhibition, especially works like Matisse\u2019s \u201cBlue Dress in a Yellow Armchair\u201d that have been pillaged, traded and salvaged by many hands. But this pensive painting is a testament to a dark history: ransacked by Nazis from a bank vault in 1941; shipped to Hitler\u2019s second in command, Hermann G\u00f6ring; and then ultimately displayed in a Norwegian museum until 2014, when it was returned to its rightful owners.That work and others by Picasso, L\u00e9ger, Degas and Corot represent the legacy of Paul Rosenberg, a Jewish art dealer who amassed a vast collection in his silk-lined gallery on Rue la Bo\u00e9tie in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Rosenberg and his family survived the war in exile in New York, but more than 400 paintings were lost \u2014 60 of them are still missing \u2014 and it became his quest to reclaim them work by work.The 63 works \u2014 which all passed through Rosenberg\u2019s galleries in New York and Paris \u2014 have been lent by private collectors and European and American museums. The show honors the art dealer and his relationships with emerging avant-garde artists like his next door neighbor, Picasso, and Georges Braque. It also explores state-sponsored looting during World War II with photographs and anti-Jewish posters, and propaganda produced in Rosenberg\u2019s ornate gallery and enormous townhouse, which was commandeered by the Nazis in 1941 to create an office for the Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question.The exhibition does not include Matisse\u2019s \u201cSeated Woman/Woman Sitting in an Armchair,\u201d which was recovered by the Rosenberg family last year. The long-vanished painting of a woman in an embroidered blouse was discovered in 2012 in the art trove hoarded by Cornelius Gurlitt in his Munich apartment. Organizers said that it still needed restoration before it went public.But there are other major works with somber pedigrees, like a Picasso portrait of Ms. Sinclair\u2019s grandmother on a tapestry chair with her chubby toddler in white and blue ribbons. It was stolen for Hermann G\u00f6ring and then later recovered by Rosenberg soon after the war. \u201cIf it could only tell what it saw,\u201d Ms. Sinclair said.The exhibition has also brought together rare works from private collections still caught up in thorny debates about restitution and transparency about their wartime provenance.Mr. Nahmad, who is Jewish himself and was stung by widespread publicity over the case and his offshore Panamanian company, said his participation in the exhibition has nothing to do with his current legal struggle. But the ordinarily low profile dealer is playing a highly visible role in the show \u2014 including cajoling other private collectors to make loans and seeking to stage an exhibition at a New York museum that has not been announced yet.\u201cThere is a lot of history in this exhibition and this is not a pure show,\u201d he said, after appearing at the opening with Ms. Sinclair, who asked him to join the exhibition in April. \u201cTo see Hitler, the occupation, the gallery and the Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question... It touched me.\u201dThe exhibition is also helping to inaugurate the recent makeover of La Boverie, a 1905 building, which completed a 25 million-euro expansion by the architect Rudy Ricciotti last May. The show is financed in part by the city of Li\u00e8ge and by Belgium\u2019s national lottery. The building also played a role on the eve of the war in 1939, when the local government raised money to buy nine works offered by Nazi authorities at a Lucerne auction in an effort to dispose of thousands of \u201cdegenerate\u201d artworks, confiscated from German museums, by some of the greatest artists of the period, including Gauguin, Chagall, Matisse and Picasso.Those purchases, such as Gaugin\u2019s \u201cMagician of Hiva Oa,\u201d are on display in the show, as is a Picasso portrait of a picnicking family, \u201cLa Famille Soler,\u201d that is exhibited next to a gauzy, traditional painting by Rodolf Otto of a German peasant family of parents and children to illustrate the Nazi taste for more sentimental, realistic works.When the exhibition opened, Ms. Sinclair brought relatives to study cherished family portraits that she remembered from her childhood. She said that she is continuing her grandfather\u2019s work, a reckoning of history so that the dead \u201cmay return less sadly to their graves.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fra Bartolommeo Has His Moment", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byThe Art of CollectingROTTERDAM \u2014 In 1722, a Florentine nobleman and diplomat named Francesco Maria Niccol\u00f2 Gabburri was nearing the end of Giorgio Vasari\u2019s biography of Fra Bartolommeo when he came upon an astounding fact: Most of the drawings made by the artist, one of the masters of the High Renaissance, had been all but abandoned 175 years earlier at the convent of Santa Caterina da Siena in Florence.Realizing that the convent was only a few streets away from his home, Gabburri, an art collector who worked as steward of the art collection of Grand Duke Cosimo III de\u2019Medici, decided to pop in and see if the works were still in the convent\u2019s possession. They were, and the nuns had no idea that the drawings held any value; they had been using the paper to wrap coins.Gabburri bought the entire trove of more than 500 drawings and had them mounted in two leather-bound albums with gold tooling and gilt edges, which would contain them for the next 300 years.The opportunity to exhibit more than a couple of pages at a time has allowed the Boijmans, which owns the two albums, to mount the exhibition \u201cFra Bartolommeo \u2013 The Divine Renaissance,\u201d opening on Oct. 15. It presents works from the entire span of the monk\u2019s artistic career, displaying the studies Gabburri preserved alongside the paintings that Fra Bartolommeo ultimately made from them.\u201cThe idea is that the visitor is allowed to witness the creative process from scratch \u2014 from first drawing to the finished paintings,\u201d said Albert Elen, senior curator of the museum and curator of the exhibition.Pulling together such a show was a coup for the Boijmans, as Fra Bartolommeo\u2019s work is rarely offered on loan, since it is old and fragile, and several of the paintings had never left Tuscany before.An 11th painting is included in what Mr. Elen called a \u201cbonus:\u201d Fra Bartolommeo\u2019s famous portrait of Girolamo Savonarola, the hellfire and brimstone preacher whose ideology lured the artist away from the secular life and into the monastery.Bartolommeo della Porta, known as Baccio, was born in Florence in 1473. As a young man he studied painting and set up a studio with another Florentine painter, Mariotto Albertinelli.The young Baccio was considered one of the greatest talents of his generation, alongside Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci.In his twenties, Baccio became enamored of the reformist preachings of Savonarola, a vocal critic of the ruling Medici clan who advocated the destruction of secular art and culture. The young artist joined in a \u201cbonfire of the vanities\u201d instigated by the preacher, throwing his own early drawings of nudes into the flames.In the early 1500s, Baccio joined the Dominican order of friars and stopped painting for a few years until he was asked to become head of the artists workshop at the monastery, which sold artworks to finance to its activities, and to make altarpieces for its church.If he had not entered holy orders, Fra Bartolommeo would most likely be a more recognizable name among the masters of the High Renaissance, Mr. Elen said.\u201cHe was not much known because his oeuvre is more limited to religious scenes and saints,\u201d Mr. Elen said. \u201cHe was a monk so his life story was less appealing than that of the other three. And he stayed behind in Florence, whereas in 1508 Raphael went to Rome to the Vatican to paint highly innovative frescoes, and Michelangelo was called to the Vatican, too, to paint the Sistine Chapel.\u201dFra Bartolommeo died in 1517 at the age of 44, after what Vasari describes as a \u201cviolent fever\u201d after \u201chaving eaten some figs.\u201d It is more likely that he died of malaria, which he probably caught in Rome, Mr. Elen said. His drawings were passed down through the other artists at the monastery and ended up in the hands of Suor Plautilla Nelli, the first known female artist in Florence and the prioress of the convent of Santa Caterina da Siena. Suor Plautilla used them stock drawings to form the basis of her own artwork at the convent, where Gabburri later found them.After Gabburri died, his heirs sold his collection. The albums were eventually purchased in 1840 by King Willem II of the Netherlands, whose own heirs ultimately sold them to the German art collector Franz Koenigs, who put them on permanent loan at the Boijmans in 1935. Five years later, the Dutch industrialist Daniel George van Beuningen bought the entire Koenigs collection and donated it to the museum.A highlight of the exhibition is the \u201cMadonna della Misericordia,\u201d an altarpiece designed for a chapel in the convent church of San Romano in Lucca. In the image, the Virgin Mary is gloriously central, with her arms outspread and her blue cloak held aloft by angels. Below her stands a crowd of some 40 people of all ages representing the people of Lucca, whom she protects.Along with the monumental oil painting on canvas, borrowed from Villa Guinigi, the Boijmans presents about a dozen preliminary sketches. \u201cStudy for a Lady Justice,\u201d a rapid sketch in red ink of a woman lifting a sword, was probably an early effort at planning the Madonna, according to the exhibition catalogue.The elderly woman depicted in \u201cStudy for the Face of an Old Woman,\u201d and a maiden featured in \u201cStudy for the Face of a Young Woman,\u201d both in black and red chalk on white paper, are faces that can be picked out of the crowd in the bottom right hand corner of the painting.Since he was not allowed to use live models in the monastery, Fra Bartolommeo was probably the first documented artist who worked from a mannequin, Mr. Elen said. He also used models in wax, clay and plaster.\u201cFor each and every figure in the composition, he\u2019s made at least one, and sometimes several, preliminary studies,\u201d Mr. Elen said. \u201cHe is looking for the right position of the head, the arms, the line, and he didn\u2019t stop still he was entirely satisfied.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump\u2019s son-in-law has discussed the possibility of a Trump-branded television network with a friend who has helped guide such deals.Jared Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s older daughter, Ivanka, had conversations about the idea with Aryeh B. Bourkoff, the chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment bank that has helped advise media deals.But such an effort, reported earlier on Monday by The Financial Times, would face enormous obstacles: Creating a television network would require a major cash investment, as well as a willingness by cable providers to carry the network. Without both, discussions of a television network would remain in the realm of fantasy.About a month ago, Mr. Kushner informally reached out to Mr. Bourkoff, a veteran media investment banker, about setting up a Trump television channel, according to a person briefed on the matter. But the conversation with Mr. Bourkoff was brief and has not progressed since, and the banker is unlikely to work on such a network, this person added. Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bourkoff are friends and speak frequently.A spokesman for LionTree declined to comment. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.Within Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, top aides over the summer made reference to the possibility of running a media holding after the election, guided by the belief that the Republican nominee would win and such a property could help bolster his agenda, according to a person with direct knowledge of those discussions, who also asked for anonymity.People close to the Trump campaign have noted the emphasis that Mr. Kushner has placed on digital advertising, as Mr. Parscale has amassed data that has limited applicable use in a political race.But Mr. Trump himself is said to have expressed limited enthusiasm for the idea of \u201cTrump TV.\u201dMr. Trump, who historically gets investors for his major projects, seems unlikely to put in large amounts of his own cash into a potentially risky venture.What\u2019s more, major cable providers like Charter, Time Warner Cable and Comcast might be reluctant to give Mr. Trump visibility by putting a Trump channel in their lineup.When Rupert Murdoch created Fox News two decades ago, he faced hurdles in getting a channel from Time Warner Cable. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, helped broker a deal by which Fox would be aired broadly. Mr. Giuliani is now an adviser to Mr. Trump.Starting a TV network is no easy feat, as Oprah Winfrey, the popular daytime host turned media mogul, learned.In January 2008, Ms. Winfrey announced with much fanfare that she was teaming up with the media group Discovery Communications to start OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network. Ms. Winfrey would take on responsibility for the programming, while Discovery planned to convert its Discovery Health network to the new venture and help with distribution and other operations. OWN was expected to make its debut the next year.But Ms. Winfrey struggled out of the gate. The start was delayed until January 2011, in part because of issues with programming the round-the-clock network. Discovery invested more than $500 million. It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the network broke even.That was all during an easier time for television networks, before they faced such competition from streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.The experience is a lesson for anyone in just how arduous and costly it is to start a television network, land distribution, attract viewers and, ultimately, make money.Michael de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Any switch should begin with a set of questions: Will I pay a bunch of A.T.M. fees with any new institution? Can I deposit checks using my mobile phone? Can I still pay my babysitter or my parent\u2019s caregiver via a free wire transfer, or easily transfer money to external accounts?

Several Long Island Republicans are trying to hold onto their seats in the State Senate, which Democrats are targeting in an effort to gain control of the chamber.\u201cWith this indictment, we again send a clear message: that no one is above the law,\u201d said Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, announcing the charges with Federal Bureau of Investigation officials at a news conference in Central Islip.The three defendants \u2014 Mr. Mangano; his wife, Linda Mangano; and the Oyster Bay town supervisor, John Venditto \u2014 all pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court in Central Islip on Thursday.According to the indictment, Mr. Mangano and Mr. Venditto, a Republican first elected in 1997, made sure that contracts from the town and county went to a \u201clocal businessman and restaurateur,\u201d identified by people with knowledge of the matter as Mr. Singh.With Mr. Mangano\u2019s help, prosecutors said, Mr. Singh\u2019s businesses received two county contracts worth about $437,000 in 2012, one to supply bread and rolls to the Nassau County Correctional Center, and another to feed the county\u2019s emergency workers after Hurricane Sandy.Mr. Mangano\u2019s lawyer, Kevin Keating, said the bread contract never went into effect. As for the post-hurricane contract, Mr. Keating said it was awarded to Mr. Singh because his restaurants still had electric service after the storm. (He added that Mr. Mangano had not signed that particular contract.)Mr. Singh also had two agreements to operate concessions or restaurants on Oyster Bay town property. The town also guaranteed four loans worth about $20 million that Mr. Singh\u2019s businesses received from a bank and a private financing company, prosecutors said. Because of that guarantee, when Mr. Singh defaulted on two of the loans in November 2015, the loans\u2019 holder demanded that the town pay what Mr. Singh owed.Mr. Capers said that when F.B.I. agents searched Mr. Mangano\u2019s office and home Thursday morning, they found even more gifts from Mr. Singh: a $3,624 massage chair from Brookstone, a $3,372 ergonomic office chair and a $7,304 Panerai Luminor watch.What Mr. Venditto received, prosecutors said, included free limousine service for himself, his family and his friends; discounts on fund-raisers at Mr. Singh\u2019s restaurants; and the use of a conference room at one of the restaurants.Linda Mangano also received more than $450,000 over several years for a no-show job at one of Mr. Singh\u2019s restaurants, according to the indictment. Among her supposed duties, according to Mr. Capers: serving as a food taster.The Manganos and Mr. Venditto tried to cover up the bribes, according to the indictment, with Ms. Mangano going so far as to fabricate instances of work she had done at the no-show job.Mr. Venditto was arrested at his home early Thursday, while the Manganos drove to the local F.B.I. office and surrendered.Outside the courthouse on Thursday, Mr. Mangano made clear that he would not resign.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, but I can\u2019t say any more,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you this \u2014 going to continue to govern, going to go to work, America\u2019s the greatest country in the world, and you\u2019ll all have an opportunity to hear everything, and decide for yourselves.\u201dMs. Mangano\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Venditto\u2019s lawyer, Brian Griffin, called the charges against his client \u201cunderwhelming\u201d and said that Mr. Venditto intended to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d himself against them.As politicians from both parties called on Mr. Mangano and Mr. Venditto to resign, Democrats sought to tie Republican State Senate candidates to what one called \u201cthe corrupt Nassau Republican machine.\u201d Michael Venditto, the town supervisor\u2019s son is among the Senate incumbents.An earlier version of this article misstated an allegation announced by Robert L.

O\u2019Neill, and Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio, addressed a class of Safe Horizon trainees in the agency\u2019s Brooklyn office. Since last month, advocates have been working in 13 precincts in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx. Another class of advocates will move into 13 more precincts, including some in Queens and Staten Island, next week.The department did not say how much it is spending on the program.By 2018, most precincts will have two victims advocates, one focused on domestic violence and the other on general crime; precincts with lower crime rates will have a single advocate.The advocates would sift through crime complaints each morning and eventually send a letter, signed by the precinct\u2019s commanding officer, to each crime victim. Some victims would also receive phone calls or home visits from an advocate.Safe Horizon said it would tailor its services to a victim\u2019s needs. Some may want to sit down with a counselor, while others may need help applying for financial compensation for lost property or advice about how to commute to work more safely. Others may want help navigating the bureaucracy to obtain a transfer within the city\u2019s public housing system, or guidance on what they should expect as a criminal case moves through the legal process.City officials hope that placing advocates within precincts will expand the pool of crime victims in contact with an advocate while connecting victims to services more quickly. Many of the city\u2019s victim services programs currently run through each borough\u2019s district attorney\u2019s office.\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with a lot of victims,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Neill, who was once commanding officer of the 44th Precinct in the Bronx. \u201cYou feel frustrated that you can\u2019t do more for them. And I\u2019m sure the victims feel that the police should have been able to help me a little bit more in putting me on the right track. I think this is going a long way to building trust.\u201dHe said the department would evaluate whether two advocates were enough to address the number of victims in high-crime precincts.As financing for victims services was slashed, most notably in 2008 and 2010, the number of precincts with domestic-violence advocates fell from a peak of 22 precincts and nine housing police service areas in the mid-1990s to three precincts and nine housing police service areas in recent years, Ms. Herman said. A program instituted in the mid-90s to put general victim advocates in two precincts, one in the Bronx and one in Brooklyn, disappeared by the early 2000s, said Maureen Curtis, vice president for Safe Horizon\u2019s criminal justice and court programs.Seeing an opening when Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, and the city\u2019s former police commissioner, William J. Bratton, took office several years ago, advocates began pushing the new administration to address what they saw as an imbalance in services.\u201cWe know that people who live in neighborhoods that may have more crime are not necessarily, traditionally, going to get the same response if they were to reach out and say, \u2018This is what I need,\u2019\u201d Ms. McCray said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the safety net.\u201dDanielle Sered, director of Common Justice, a project of the Vera Institute of Justice, called the new program \u201cevidence of a really important commitment to reaching victims.\u201dBut she said it was also essential to invest in programs without a link to law enforcement, for people who may be too fearful of or bitter toward the police to walk into a station house. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to trust the police to get help with their pain,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The man, Sebastian Gregerson, 29, a Muslim convert who sometimes calls himself Abdurrahaman Bin Mikaayl, was arrested in late July and indicted on explosives charges.Nearly a year ago, in fact, the F.B.I. said in a court filing \u2014 accidentally and temporarily made public in an online database \u2014 that agents suspected the two men were plotting terrorism. \u201cBased on the totality of the aforementioned information and evidence, there is reason to believe that Bengharsa and Gregerson are engaged in discussions and preparations for some violent act on behalf of\u201d the Islamic State, an agent wrote.Yet Imam Bengharsa has not been arrested or charged. It appears that the authorities do not have clear evidence that he has broken the law. His inflammatory statements are protected by the First Amendment, and agents appear to have no proof that he knew Mr. Gregerson planned to buy illegal explosives. In his checkbook, next to the notation for the $1,300 check, Imam Bengharsa wrote \u201czakat,\u201d or charity, the documents show.The case poses in a striking way the dilemma for the F.B.I. in deciding when constitutionally protected speech crosses into inciting violence or conspiring to commit a terrorist act.In testimony before Congress this week, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the challenge for F.B.I. agents was determining when someone has crossed the line from speech to criminal activity. \u201cIt\u2019s even protected speech to say I\u2019m a fan of the Islamic State so-called,\u201d Mr. Comey said.When the suspect is a cleric, like Imam Bengharsa, the matter is especially delicate.The documents say he transferred money three times to an unnamed person in Yemen.Investigators are also exploring contacts between Imam Bengharsa and other people suspected of extremism or terrorism. One is Yusuf Wehelie, 25, a Virginia man arrested in July and charged with weapons possession, which would be illegal because he has a previous felony conviction for burglary.Mr. Wehelie first came to public attention in 2010, when he and his brother, Yahya Wehelie, both American citizens, were temporarily detained in Cairo and prevented by the F.B.I. from flying home. American officials said such delays were sometimes necessary to assess whether a person posed a security threat. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations protested that the rights of such travelers were being violated.At Yusuf Wehelie\u2019s detention hearing in July, the authorities said he had told undercover agents that he supported the Islamic State and that if he couldn\u2019t join it overseas, he would attack a military recruiting center, possibly using explosives. (Mr. Wehelie\u2019s lawyer, Nina Ginsberg, said that in later recorded conversations, he disavowed those statements and later stopped replying to the undercover agents.)In Baltimore, another young man named Maalik Alim Jones was arrested late last year and charged with joining a terrorist group in Africa. Imam Bengharsa had preached on occasion at a Baltimore mosque Mr. Jones attended, but it is not clear that they knew each other.The F.B.I. has been closely watching the imam for months, law enforcement officials say. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment.The authorities are concerned that Imam Bengharsa, who claims an impressive list of scholarly credentials, may be spreading the Islamic State message that violence can be justified against perceived enemies of the faith. In view of the payment to Mr. Gregerson, they also fear he may be financing other supporters of the Islamic State. The F.B.I. has said in court that he is under investigation for conspiring and providing material support to the Islamic State.Imam Bengharsa did not reply to emails, phone messages or a note left at his townhouse in Clarksburg, Md., a town equidistant from Baltimore and Washington.He denied that he supported the Islamic State but said: \u201cIt might appear that way. I am an advocate of the United States and the West getting the hell out of the Middle East and the Muslim world.\u201dHe added a question: \u201cIf this was the case, why haven\u2019t they come to arrest me?\u201dImam Bengharsa, who was born in Libya, moved to the United States at age 10, according to a biography he posted online. He claims to have received a degree from Al Azhar University in Cairo, and additional degrees in economics and Islamic studies.He lived in Texas and later, after embracing religion, worked as a chaplain in Maryland prisons from 2006 to 2009, as an imam at the Islamic Society of Annapolis from 2009 to 2010 and at Masjid Umar, a small storefront mosque outside Baltimore, from 2011 to 2014. Last year he created the Islamic Jurisprudence Center, whose street address turns out to be a mailbox at the UPS Store near his home in Clarksburg. The authorities said he also frequently visited another mosque, Dar al-Taqwa, in the Baltimore suburb of Ellicott City.Imam Bengharsa appears to have long held very conservative views. In his 2011 lectures at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, for example, he said Muslims must strictly follow the shariah, or Islamic law, no matter where they live.In his standoff with the F.B.I., Imam Bengharsi appears to have scant support in the American Muslim community. Muhammad Jameel, the president of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, said that the imam\u2019s marriage lectures five years ago were his only connection to the mosque and that his recent statements were \u201cagainst all the tenets of Islam.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a nut,\u201d Mr. Jameel said. \u201cHe has freedom of speech. But if he\u2019s a criminal, I want to see him in jail.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bass Pro Shops to Acquire Cabela\u2019s, a Rival Outdoor Retailer", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byAcross much of the United States, it is not just a credit card; it is a Cabela\u2019s credit card.The wallet-sized piece of plastic, depicting a golden sunset slipping behind a mountain range overlooking a lake, became a status symbol for hunting and fishing enthusiasts over the years, giving its users 1 percent back in points to use in any of Cabela\u2019s 85 stores. Its popularity is attached to the near cultlike following the outdoor recreation retailer has developed since its founding in the 1960s.Many credit card issuers were eager to partner with Cabela\u2019s after the retailer, which is based in Sidney, Neb., said in December it was exploring strategic alternatives. Cabela\u2019s subsidiary \u2014 World\u2019s Foremost Bank, which was started more than a decade ago to create their loyalty credit card program \u2014 was one of the last, large co-branded credit card portfolios left in retail.After about 10 months of anticipation, Cabela\u2019s said Monday that it planned to sell its core retail business to Bass Pro Shops for $5.5 billion. Additionally, Cabela\u2019s agreed to sell $5.2 billion worth of credit card receivables and $5 billion in associated liabilities to the Capital One Financial Corporation.While the economic structure of the partnership was not explicitly disclosed, analysts and investors expected Bass Pro Shops would receive a certain amount of royalties each year as it brought in more credit card customers and let them use the brands.The combined transactions make this the fifth-largest retail deal in the United States, according to data by S&P Global Market Intelligence.\u201cThat\u2019s the key to this deal,\u201d said Bill Smead, the chief executive and chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management, which owned about $44 million worth of Cabela\u2019s stock before Monday\u2019s gain of 15 percent. \u201cThey created a cult of addicted customers and attached the most successful credit card operation to that cult.\u201dA few weeks before the announcement of the Elliott investment, Nordstrom sold its credit card business to Toronto-Dominion Bank for $2.2 billion, in a similar partnership.Bass Pro Shops has agreed to acquire Cabela\u2019s for about $65.50 a share, according to a statement Monday. Mr. Smead estimates a majority of the deal\u2019s value stems from the credit card operations.Cabela\u2019s credit card program reached significant scale despite having pretty conservative lending practices. The unit\u2019s median FICO credit score was 794 at the end of 2015, recent filings showed. Capital One can expand the Cabela\u2019s credit card business faster because it can take on more credit risk by spreading it out among a larger base, according to James Duffy, an analyst with Stifel.Analysts and investors assume Bass Pro Shops will be able to retain some of the benefits of the credit card business, but it will likely be unclear what the accounting looks like in the future. Bass Pro Shops remains privately held, largely by Johnny Morris, who started the company 45 years ago in his father\u2019s liquor store near Springfield, Mo.The potential deal brings with it significant integration risk,\u201d said Mike Zuccaro, a Moody\u2019s retail analyst, in an emailed statement. \u201cThe company\u2019s final capital structure is unclear given that expected proceeds from Capital One\u2019s purchase of certain financial services assets and assumed liabilities have not been disclosed.\u201dThe deal marries Cabela\u2019s 19,000 employees with Bass Pro Shop\u2019s 20,000, and adds 85 Cabela\u2019s stores to Bass Pro Shops\u2019 99. Bass Pro Shops also operates the White River Marine Group, which makes fishing boats.Bass Pro Shops secured $1.8 billion in financing from the merchant banking division of Goldman Sachs and $600 million from the private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management. The company also plans to receive debt financing for the transaction from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, RBC Capital Markets, UBS and Goldman.Cabela\u2019s was founded in Sidney, Neb., by Dick, Mary and Jim Cabela in 1961. Bass Pro Shops indicated that it would \u201cmaintain important bases of operations in Sidney and Lincoln.\u201d The transaction, subject to regulatory and Cabela\u2019s shareholders\u2019 approvals, is expected to close during the first half of next year.Given the complexity of both the sale of the retail business as well as the credit card partnership, the three companies hired no fewer than 13 banks and law firms to advise on the process.Goldman Sachs advised its merchant bank on the transaction, while JPMorgan advised Bass Pro Shops. Guggenheim Securities was Cabela\u2019s banker for the transaction.Davis Polk & Wardwell advised Goldman\u2019s merchant-banking division in addition to Goldman. And Morrison & Foerster was legal counsel to Bass Pro Shops on the bank transaction.Latham & Watkins provided legal counsel to Bass Pro Shops, with expert assistance from O\u2019Melveny & Myers. Sidley Austin and Koley Jessen served as Cabela\u2019s legal counsel.The Kessler Group and Credit Suisse provided financial advice to Capital One, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, as well as Chapman and Cutler, worked as its legal adviser.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Debate That Wasn\u2019t: So Many Words, So Few About Policy", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byThe three presidential debates had no shortage of discussion about groping, beauty queens and Twitter habits. A question on energy policy this month was memorable only because it gave rise to a meme about the red sweater sported by the voter, Ken Bone, who asked it. Even on Wednesday, when the moderator made policy a priority, the discussion between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton remained skin deep.Lost in the bluster and bombast has been the kind of detailed policy talk that traditionally consumes candidates this time of year. While onstage stalking and shimmying kept body-language experts busy, many who care about tax policy, immigration, health care and climate change were left with little to chew on.Undecided voters curious where the candidates stood on American relations with Israel or their views on the Keystone XL oil pipeline were left to look elsewhere. But even the subjects that did come up didn\u2019t result in robust discussions of how the nation\u2019s most pressing problems should be solved.Following are some of the issues that got short shrift.Debate audiences have heard much jousting over how little Mr. Trump has paid in income taxes, but far less about how much voters will have to pay if he or Mrs. Clinton is elected.Mr. Trump accused her of wanting a big tax increase; Mrs. Clinton said his tax plan would send the country spinning into a recession. A minor tussle about the future of \u201ccarried interest\u201d was pretty much it: more finger food than main course.Mr. Norquist, who prefers Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan, has been clamoring to hear more about how it will help businesses and spur economic growth. And why was no attention paid to the taxation of companies in the \u201csharing economy,\u201d like Uber and Airbnb?The construction of a wall along the United States\u2019 border with Mexico has been a centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, and an immigration overhaul is an important priority for Mrs. Clinton, yet the topic received scant attention.Mr. Trump promised to get \u201cbad hombres\u201d out of the country. But little light was shed on how he or Mrs. Clinton would prioritize the removal of undocumented immigrants, or what must be done differently to secure the border beyond existing measures.The future of the Supreme Court is one of the biggest concerns among Republicans and Democrats, but only cursory commentary was given to the sorts of questions that the court, and any new justices the next president appoints, may have to consider.Mrs. Clinton has said that Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama\u2019s pick to fill the current vacancy, should be approved by the current Congress, but she still has not been clear about how she would handle his nomination if she is elected and he has not yet been confirmed. On Wednesday night, she spoke only generally about how she would appoint judges who would stand up for the American people.Mr. Trump has offered little detail about what he prizes in potential Supreme Court justices, other than to say that he would fill the court with jurists in the mold of Antonin Scalia and those who are likely to overturn Roe v. Wade.Republicans have been fighting to repeal the Affordable Care Act since President Obama signed it into law, but in 2016 it has become something of an afterthought.Mr. Trump wants to replace the health law with something, he says, that \u201cworks.\u201d Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that parts of the law need fixing, but said nothing specific about how she would curb rising health care costs.Still, Mr. Rother said he sympathized with the desire to keep things simple. \u201cHillary has to be cautious given her history and her wonk tendencies,\u201d he said, \u201cand Trump is uninformed on health policy.\u201dWith so little focus on deficits, the national debt and funding for Social Security, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote to Chris Wallace, the moderator of Wednesday\u2019s debate, imploring him to press the candidates about their plans.\u201cWe have heard very little to this point,\u201d the chamber wrote, adding that \u201cwhat we have heard has been distressing, with the candidates proposing to either do nothing or actually expand (rather than reform) these programs.\u201dAt the debate, Mr. Trump said that his tax cuts would stimulate economic growth and finance entitlement programs. Mrs. Clinton said that she would tax the rich and reduce entitlement spending by making \u201charder decisions.\u201d But the discussion ran aground when Mrs. Clinton, in an aside, poked at Mr. Trump over his tax avoidance, and he called her a \u201cnasty woman.\u201dMrs. Clinton hit Mr. Trump for suggesting that global warming was a \u201choax\u201d perpetrated by the Chinese, yet she offered few solutions beyond the deployment of more solar panels. Mr. Trump underscored his support for domestic drilling and burning coal, and in the second debate he dismissed alternative energy sources by saying the United States could not be powered by wind and solar energy alone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Corzine Nears Settlement, Ads Berate Wells Fargo, Pound Plunges", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byJon S. Corzine has been through numerous lawsuits in recent years.Since he presided over the brokerage firm MF Global when it collapsed in 2011, Mr. Corzine, 69, has been the target of federal investigations, including one filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the misuse of $1 billion in customer money.In recent weeks, Mr. Corzine and the agency have struck a tentative settlement, which would include $5 million in penalties that he would have to pay out of his own pocket. That figure would be more than what the agency could expect to win at trial if he were found liable, the people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Corzine would also accept a lifetime ban from personally trading other people\u2019s money in the futures industry.A settlement, which has not yet been completed, would avert a trial for Mr. Corzine, a former Democratic senator and New Jersey governor. Had it gone ahead, it was originally scheduled to begin this month.Wells Fargo has heard from disgruntled customers, fired employees and angry lawmakers over the fake accounts scandal.In an interview, Mr. Harber said that on Aug. 24, 2015 he placed orders for about $34.8 million worth of stocks \u201con margin\u201d (which usually requires putting down some money and borrowing the rest from the broker).But given the extreme volatility in the market at the time, Wells Fargo demanded that he pay for the stocks in full, he said.At the end of the day, Mr. Harber said, Wells sold all the shares he had bought that day, resulting in a $5 million loss. He was also charged about $480,000 in broker fees. The bank said in a statement that it was \u201cstrongly defending\u201d against his complaints.Though his case is different from that of the thousands of Wells customers who had illegal bank accounts and unauthorized credit cards issued in their name, it has one crucial similarity.Mr. Harber\u2019s lawsuit is being heard in private arbitration \u2014 Wells forces many of its customers to agree to settle any dispute in arbitration as a condition of doing business with it.The pound is dropping. Fast.A sudden drop like the one it suffered \u2014 down as much as 6 percent at one point \u2014 is often called a flash crash, and is sometimes caused by computer-driven automated trades or a simple misplaced keystroke (a fat-finger error, as it is known on trading floors). In the case of the drop in Asia for the pound, experts said they were hard-pressed to identify a single cause.But over all, they pointed to a general area of unease: Britain\u2019s vote in a referendum in June to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe pound dropped as low as $1.1841 before recovering.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Tax Records Show He Could Have Avoided Taxes for Nearly Two Decades, The Times Found", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years, records obtained by The New York Times show.Tax experts hired by The Times to analyze Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 records said that tax rules especially advantageous to wealthy filers would have allowed Mr. Trump to use his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over an 18-year period.Although Mr. Trump\u2019s taxable income in subsequent years is as yet unknown, a $916 million loss in 1995 would have been large enough to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years.\u201cHe has a vast benefit from his destruction\u201d in the early 1990s, said one of the experts, Joel Rosenfeld, an assistant professor at New York University\u2019s Schack Institute of Real Estate. Mr. Rosenfeld offered this description of what he would advise a client who came to him with a tax return like Mr. Trump\u2019s: \u201cDo you realize you can create $916 million in income without paying a nickel in taxes?\u201d\u201cMr. Trump is a highly-skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes.\u201dThe statement continued, \u201cMr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for President and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.\u201dIn response to a Times article revealing pages of his 1995 income tax records, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThe only news here is that the more than 20 year-old alleged tax document was illegally obtained.\u201dSeparately, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Marc E. Kasowitz, emailed a letter to The Times arguing that publication of the records is illegal because Mr. Trump has not authorized the disclosure of any of his tax returns. Mr. Kasowitz threatened \u201cprompt initiation of appropriate legal action.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s refusal to make his tax returns public \u2014 breaking with decades of tradition in presidential contests \u2014 has emerged as a central issue in the campaign, with a majority of voters saying he should release them. Mr. Trump has declined to do so, and has said he is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.At last Monday\u2019s presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton suggested Mr. Trump was refusing to release his tax returns so voters would not know \u201che\u2019s paid nothing in federal taxes,\u201d and when she also pointed out that Mr. Trump had once revealed to casino regulators that he paid no federal income taxes in the late 1970s, Mr. Trump retorted, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201dThe tax experts consulted by The Times said nothing in the 1995 documents suggested any wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, even if the extraordinary size of the loss he declared would have probably attracted extra scrutiny from I.R.S. examiners. \u201cThe I.R.S., when they see a negative $916 million, that has to pop out,\u201d Mr. Rosenfeld said.The documents examined by The Times represent a small fraction of the voluminous tax returns Mr. Trump would have filed in 1995.The documents consisted of three pages from what appeared to be Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. The pages were mailed last month to Susanne Craig, a reporter at The Times who has written about Mr. Trump\u2019s finances. The documents were the first page of a New York State resident income tax return, the first page of a New Jersey nonresident tax return and the first page of a Connecticut nonresident tax return. Each page bore the names and Social Security numbers of Mr. Trump and Marla Maples, his wife at the time. Only the New Jersey form had what appeared to be their signatures.The three documents arrived by mail at The Times with a postmark indicating they had been sent from New York City. The return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower.The tax records obtained by The Times show that Donald J. Trump claimed a $916 million loss that could have allowed him to legally avoid paying federal income taxes for up to 18 years.On Wednesday, The Times presented the tax documents to Jack Mitnick, a lawyer and certified public accountant who handled Mr. Trump\u2019s tax matters for more than 30 years, until 1996. Mr. Mitnick was listed as the preparer on the New Jersey tax form.Mr. Mitnick, 80, now semiretired and living in Florida, said that while he no longer had access to Mr. Trump\u2019s original returns, the documents appeared to be authentic copies of portions of Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. Mr. Mitnick said the signature on the tax preparer line of the New Jersey tax form was his, and he readily explained an obvious anomaly in the way especially large numbers appeared on the New York tax document.A flaw in the tax software program he used at the time prevented him from being able to print a nine-figure loss on Mr. Trump\u2019s New York return, he said. So, for example, the loss of \u201c-915,729,293\u201d on Line 18 of the return printed out as \u201c5,729,293.\u201d As a result, Mr. Mitnick recalled, he had to use his typewriter to manually add the \u201c-91,\u201d thus explaining why the first two digits appeared to be in a different font and were slightly misaligned from the following seven digits.\u201cThis is legit,\u201d he said, stabbing a finger into the document.Real estate developers like Donald J. Trump can combine a number of breaks in the tax code to generate large deductions, which could have allowed him to avoid paying any federal income tax for decades.Because the documents sent to The Times did not include any pages from Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 federal tax return, it is impossible to determine how much he may have donated to charity that year. The state documents do show, though, that Mr. Trump declined the opportunity to contribute to the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Memorial Fund, the New Jersey Wildlife Conservation Fund or the Children\u2019s Trust Fund. He also declined to contribute $1 toward public financing of New Jersey\u2019s elections for governor.The tax documents also do not shed any light on Mr. Trump\u2019s claimed net worth of about $2 billion at that time. This is because the complex calculations of business deductions that produced a tax loss of $916 million are a separate matter from how Mr. Trump valued his assets, the tax experts said.Nor does the $916 million loss suggest that Mr. Trump was insolvent or effectively bankrupt in 1995. The cash flow generated by his various businesses that year was more than enough to service his various debts.But fragmentary as they are, the documents nonetheless provide new insight into Mr. Trump\u2019s finances, a subject of intense scrutiny given Mr. Trump\u2019s emphasis on his business record during the presidential campaign.The documents show, for example, that while Mr. Trump reported $7.4 million in interest income in 1995, he made only $6,108 in wages, salaries and tips. They also suggest Mr. Trump took full advantage of generous tax loopholes specifically available to commercial real estate developers to claim a $15.8 million loss in 1995 on his real estate holdings and partnerships.But the most important revelation from the 1995 tax documents is just how much Mr. Trump may have benefited from a tax provision that is particularly prized by America\u2019s dynastic families, which, like the Trumps, hold their wealth inside byzantine networks of partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations.The provision, known as net operating loss, or N.O.L., allows a dizzying array of deductions, business expenses, real estate depreciation, losses from the sale of business assets and even operating losses to flow from the balance sheets of those partnerships, limited liability companies and S corporations onto the personal tax returns of men like Mr. Trump. In turn, those losses can be used to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income from, say, book royalties or branding deals.In the absence of any disclosures from Mr. Trump, The New York Times and other news outlets have attempted to fill in the gaps.Better still, if the losses are big enough, they can cancel out taxable income earned in other years. Under I.R.S. rules in 1995, net operating losses could be used to wipe out taxable income earned in the three years before and the 15 years after the loss. (The effect of net operating losses on state income taxes varies, depending on each state\u2019s tax regime.)The tax experts consulted by The Times said the $916 million net operating loss declared by Mr. Trump in 1995 almost certainly included large net operating losses carried forward from the early 1990s, when most of Mr. Trump\u2019s key holdings were hemorrhaging money. Indeed, by 1990, his entire business empire was on the verge of collapse. In a few short years, he had amassed $3.4 billion in debt \u2014 personally guaranteeing $832 million of it \u2014 to assemble a portfolio that included three casinos and a hotel in Atlantic City, the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, an airline and a huge yacht.Reports that year by New Jersey casino regulators gave glimpses of the balance sheet carnage. The Trump Taj Mahal casino reported a $25.5 million net loss during its first six months of 1990; the Trump\u2019s Castle casino lost $43.5 million for the year. His airline, Trump Shuttle, lost $34.5 million during just the first six months of that year.\u201cSimply put, the organization is in dire financial straits,\u201d the casino regulators concluded.Reports by New Jersey\u2019s casino regulators strongly suggested that Mr. Trump had claimed large net operating losses on his taxes in the early 1990s. Their reports, for example, revealed that Mr. Trump had carried forward net operating losses in both 1991 and 1993. What\u2019s more, the reports said the losses he claimed were large enough to virtually cancel out any taxes he might owe on the millions of dollars of debt that was being forgiven by his creditors. (The I.R.S. considers forgiven debt to be taxable income.)But crucially, the casino regulators redacted the precise size of the net operating losses in the public versions of their reports. Two former New Jersey officials, who were privy to the unredacted documents, could not recall the precise size of the numbers, but said they were substantial.Now, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax records, the degree to which he spun all those years of red ink into tax write-off gold may finally be apparent.Mr. Mitnick, the lawyer and accountant, was the person Mr. Trump leaned on most to do the spinning. Mr. Mitnick worked for a small Long Island accounting firm that specialized in handling tax issues for wealthy New York real estate families. He had long handled tax matters for Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, and he said he began doing Donald Trump\u2019s taxes after Mr. Trump turned 18.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Mitnick said he could not divulge details of Mr. Trump\u2019s finances without Mr. Trump\u2019s consent. But he did talk about Mr. Trump\u2019s approaches to taxes, and he contrasted Fred Trump\u2019s attention to detail with what he described as Mr. Trump\u2019s brash and undisciplined style. He recalled, for example, that when Donald and Ivana Trump came in each year to sign their tax forms, it was almost always Ivana who asked more questions.But if Mr. Trump lacked a sophisticated understanding of the tax code, and if he rarely showed any interest in the details behind various tax strategies, Mr. Mitnick said he clearly grasped the critical role taxes would play in helping him build wealth. \u201cHe knew we could use the tax code to protect him,\u201d Mr. Mitnick said.According to Mr. Mitnick, Mr. Trump\u2019s use of net operating losses was no different from that of his other wealthy clients. \u201cThis may have had a couple extra digits compared to someone else\u2019s operation, but they all benefited in the same way,\u201d he said, pointing to the $916 million loss on Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.In \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d his 1987 best-selling book, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Mitnick as \u201cmy accountant\u201d \u2014 although he misspelled his name. Mr. Trump described consulting with Mr. Mitnick on the tax implications of deals he was contemplating and seeking his advice on how new federal tax regulations might affect real estate write-offs.Mr. Mitnick, though, said there were times when even he, for all his years helping wealthy New Yorkers navigate the tax code, found it difficult to face the incongruity of his work for Mr. Trump. He felt keenly aware that Mr. Trump was living a life of unimaginable luxury thanks in part to Mr. Mitnick\u2019s ability to relieve him of the burden of paying taxes like everyone else.\u201cHere the guy was building incredible net worth and not paying tax on it,\u201d he said.Steve Eder and Patricia Cohen contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Campaign to Bring Casino Gambling to North Jersey Appears Doomed", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byFor those looking for a good bet on election night results, the smart money in New Jersey says a referendum on whether to expand casino gambling in the state is headed for defeat.\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d said Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democratic state senator who has long favored such an expansion. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance it will win.\u201dAt least this time around.The question at the moment seems to be how badly the measure will lose.At a rally on the Atlantic City boardwalk on Thursday, Don Guardian, the mayor, a Republican, called on opponents of the measure to deliver an \u201cabsolutely crushing mandate\u201d to discourage proponents from ever trying to revive the issue. Five casinos in the city have closed in the past two years, thousands of jobs have vanished and the local government is awaiting a potential state takeover.\u201cWe have to make that spread as big as possible so it doesn\u2019t come back again,\u201d said Bob McDevitt, the president of the union that represents Atlantic City casino workers, who also spoke at the rally.If it passed, the referendum would allow new casinos to open in North Jersey, close to the tourists and residents of Manhattan. Supporters argue that an expansion is necessary to stem the tide of gamblers defecting to casinos in other states.Atlantic City once had an East Coast monopoly on casino gambling. But casino revenues in New Jersey have fallen by more than half after peaking at $5.2 billion in 2006, when surrounding states, eager for tax revenue, began to allow gambling halls to open.Analysts now regard the Northeast market as saturated, with about 30 casinos, racetrack slot parlors and tribal gambling operations between Washington and Maine \u2014 and more to come.Mr. Gural and Paul Fireman, a former chairman of Reebok International, contributed $5 million each to the campaign; the horse racing industry and the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce contributed more modest sums.Mr. Fireman has proposed a $4.6 billion gambling resort with a 95-story tower next to a 160-acre golf course he currently operates on the waterfront at Jersey City\u2019s southern edge.The two men, who have also contributed generously to New Jersey politicians in recent years, lined up support from local officials in North Jersey, as well as from Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and Stephen M. Sweeney, the Democratic State Senate president. But their campaign has failed to resonate with voters amid the state\u2019s fiscal problems, the trial surrounding the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal and Mr. Christie\u2019s plummeting popularity.\u201cIt was a perfect storm for us,\u201d said Mr. Gural, who owns two casinos in New York State and is an owner of the land beneath the Sands casino in Bethlehem, Pa. \u201cCertainly, Bridgegate didn\u2019t help us when people hear this message, \u2018Don\u2019t trust Trenton.\u2019 And not one politician defended themselves.\u201dIn addition, the referendum never specified where the casinos would go or at what rate the state would tax their revenues.Mr. Gural publicly proposed a tax rate of roughly 45 percent, the same rate Pennsylvania applies to casino revenues and more than four times the 9.25 percent rate paid by Atlantic City casinos. Mr. Fireman sought the same rate as the Atlantic City casinos.\u201cWe thought our interests and the interests of the people of New Jersey were aligned,\u201d said Charles Degliomini, executive vice president of the company that is building Montreign.Another contributor to the \u201cTrenton\u2019s Bad Bet\u201d campaign was Morris Bailey, a New York real estate investor who owns the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City with the Mohegan tribe, which also operates a major casino in Connecticut.Genting has made no secret of its plans to compete for a full-scale casino license in New York City or its suburbs in the coming years, and most analysts expect Caesars Entertainment, MGM and other Atlantic City casino operators to do the same. That could set off a retaliatory move by New Jersey to allow a casino to open near Manhattan.Adding to the confusion, some operators of Atlantic City casinos have built gambling halls in Pennsylvania, where the spread of casinos \u2014 there will soon be 13 \u2014 has been most responsible for the steep drop in Atlantic City\u2019s gambling revenue over the past decade. For example, Caesars Entertainment, which owns two Atlantic City casinos, also operates Harrah\u2019s casino resort in Chester, Pa.At this point, those who support adding more casinos in New Jersey concede that their chances of success on Election Day are nil. Mr. Gural and Mr. Firestone stopped contributing to their advertising campaign weeks ago.But Mr. Gural said the fight was not over.\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent certain there\u2019ll be a casino in the Meadowlands some day,\u201d he said. \u201cThis argument will be moot. Nobody\u2019s going to Atlantic City.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the source of $8 million in contributions to the \u201cTrenton\u2019s Bad Bet\u201d campaign. They were from companies associated with the Malaysian billionaire K.T. Lim, not from his family.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emails With My Favorite Trump Supporter", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSan Francisco \u2014 I have an old friend. If I need something, he\u2019s the guy I call. A good father, a good husband. He\u2019s got a Ph.D. and is a well-respected college professor. That I also believe he\u2019s a racist, misogynist, homophobic lunatic, I\u2019ll get to in a moment, because I first want to make very clear that I love him like a brother.In high school my friend and I ran track together and because I was slow, he\u2019d wait up for me, jogging in place at the top of each hill. And on those long runs we\u2019d talk about philosophy and our own \u201cpuny existences.\u201d That\u2019s the sort of guys we were. Lucky to have each other because our teammates thought we were freaks.Today we live far apart, and mostly communicate by email. Lately I spend much of life, when I should be working or paying attention to my daughter, sending my friend screeds. And when I\u2019m not writing them on the screen, I\u2019m writing them in my head. I am \u2014 and I\u2019m not proud of this \u2014 completely obsessed with my friend\u2019s position in this election.My unhinged response read, in part: \u201cBonhoeffer\u2019s courage is the same COURAGE as voting for Trump??? I expected more from you, a lot more. The only saving grace is that millions of Christians aren\u2019t buying it. I\u2019ll pray for you, my friend. And one day when you have to explain to your kids how you, as a Christian, but more important as a human being, could have supported this ticket, I\u2019ll tell them that you truly believed you were helping save the country from a monster enabler of sexual predators and rapists of 12-year-olds \u2014 you had no choice. The all-white echo chamber where you received your information had so distorted your ability to see that you were temporarily blinded from reason.\u201dMy friend responded, as he always does, mildly, asking me to please watch my language. Can\u2019t we discuss these issues without resorting to vitriol?\u201cI love how this election has turned you into a moralist,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re like an even more miniature Tim Kaine. My son (who was reading over my shoulder) asked me to tell you to \u2018give Donald Trump credit for being a human being.\u2019 Once again, instead of seriously engaging with the issues at hand, you sling out insults. It\u2019s a very cogent article, one you are free to disagree with. But this isn\u2019t engagement. You are not addressing the very legitimate concerns about Hillary. That is problematic. Happy birthday by the way.\u201dAs furious as I get, deep down, I don\u2019t actually doubt his sincerity when he tells me, mildly, always mildly, about Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201catrocities.\u201dThinking about my friend makes me also think of my father. If my friend is the definition of a reluctant Trump supporter, my father, had he lived to enjoy this carnival, would have been the candidate\u2019s poster child.I have it on good authority (my mother) that my father wept for hours on the night Bobby Kennedy was killed in 1968. In the \u201970s and early \u201980s, he was an active member of the finance council of the Democratic National Committee. But by the \u201990s he had come to embrace a shouting Fox News worldview of anti-immigrant and misogynist fervor, and he railed against what he called my hopeless political correctness.The story of my father\u2019s conversion is complicated, but if there was one event that led to his nursing his grievances, it is that in the early 1990s, he was sued for sexual harassment by one of his former employees. Though the case was settled out of court and my father was never in jeopardy of losing his law license, he stepped down from something called the Character and Fitness Committee of the Illinois State Bar Association. You might laugh at this, but it\u2019s a real thing, and my father was especially proud of his service on this committee that measures a would-be lawyer\u2019s moral fiber.He felt misunderstood, maligned. Did he do it? He always said the allegations were patently untrue, but few people believed him.By the time of the Obama administration, he had begun referring to the president with a Yiddish term I won\u2019t repeat here (not, Dad, out of political correctness, but because it revolts me to this day and I can still hear you saying it in my ears). What he often had to say about women, especially my mother, who had left him, I won\u2019t include here, either. But when I heard the Access Hollywood tape of Mr. Trump, I called my brother and asked him who the guy on the tape sounded like.\u201cYou gotta ask?\u201dBut he was my father; I loved him. When he died a few years ago, I happened to be staying with my old friend when I received the news. That weekend we ran together and talked. \u201cDidn\u2019t he teach you how to play chess?\u201d my friend asked. \u201cWho introduced you to Dickens?\u201dHe helped me remember that, behind the anger, my father was still, and always, my father. I can\u2019t expunge him from the record, my record. And to be honest it now brings me a warped kind of joy to think of what a kick he\u2019d have gotten out of this last (ineffectual) roar of men of a certain age.In 2014 my friend\u2019s father died as well. We commiserated over email, about however much you think you\u2019re ready for it, nothing prepares you for the void fathers leave behind.In a bit I will send a message to my friend to say he\u2019s a revolting Neanderthal, that I\u2019m not kidding, that I believe he\u2019s a danger to himself, his students, the Republic itself. I\u2019ll also say hey to Diane and the boys. That new school working out?How comforting our most deeply held political convictions are, in contrast to our love, which, though inexplicable, is somehow always \u2014 to use one my friend\u2019s favorite words \u2014 merciful.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Private Solution to Deutsche Bank\u2019s Public Woes", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsDeutsche Bank\u2019s sliding share price and capital shortfall call for some creative solutions. And they do not get much more out of the ordinary than an idea that Germany\u2019s corporate titans might take stakes in the lender to help it manage the impact of a potential $14 billion fine from American regulators, as Handelsblatt reported on Oct. 6. It is a less nutty concept than it sounds.German companies are swimming in cash, which is currently earning little on deposit. The members of the DAX, a stock market index of 30 blue-chip German companies, had $80 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the last financial year, according to Eikon data \u2014 excluding financial companies and carmakers, whose cash levels are flattered by big finance arms. A big chunk of this corporate liquidity is no doubt on deposit at Deutsche Bank, so it carries the low but real risk that it could be eroded were Deutsche Bank subject to the kind of ferocious \u201cbail-in\u201d rescue inflicted on Cypriot banks in 2013.Deutsche Bank is not facing anything like that kind of situation, but it might need to raise capital. Shareholders of companies like Siemens and SAP would, or at least should, balk at the idea of putting money into an institution hit by huge legal and operational risks. Customers owning big stakes in banks can create the risk of biased lending policies.Still, if German corporations decided freely to help Deutsche, it would relieve Berlin of a politically toxic situation ahead of federal elections in 2017. A private, nontaxpayer solution might also protect Germany from taking the highly embarrassing step of flouting European Union laws that make it hard for governments to bail out banks until creditors have taken losses first.More surprisingly, it might not be totally bad for German companies. First, the survival of Deutsche Bank is a useful counterbalance in a global capital market dominated by American banks. It could even be argued that at 0.25 times book value, a Deutsche Bank that does not collapse would enable an investor to double its money or more.The support could wind up being largely symbolic. German blue-chip companies could agree to underwrite a bigger rights issue, picking up the so-called rump left behind if Deutsche Bank shareholders opted not to participate. It would still be a strange and suboptimal way for Berlin to dodge a bullet \u2014 but better than many of its alternatives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Spain", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate21 Photos$2.91 MILLION (2.6 MILLION EUROS) This seven-bedroom six-bathroom villa, built in 2002 on a 2.2-acre plot, has the thick, whitewashed walls, multiple patios, ornate grilled windows, hand-painted tiles and terra-cotta-tiled roof of a traditional Andalusian home.The 6,437-square-foot villa, in the gated development of El Madro\u00f1al in Benahav\u00eds, has views of the Mediterranean Sea from all three levels. It also has a 36-by-12.5-foot swimming pool with a blue-and-white mosaic of hand-painted tiles on a nearby wall depicting a Spanish cowboy.A driveway flanked by cork trees leads to the main entrance of the villa. The antique wooden front doors open to a foyer displaying a painting resembling the Infanta Margarita Teresa, who was depicted in works by Vel\u00e1zquez; paintings of Spanish royalty also hang in other rooms. The villa\u2019s furniture and art are included in the asking price.Floors of handcrafted terra-cotta tiles are found throughout much of the villa. To the right of the foyer is an open-plan living room and dining room. The living room has a fireplace and leads into a lengthy veranda with another fireplace and ceiling beams. Tall wooden doors open to the pool area.Also on the main level is the rustic-style kitchen with ceramic tile countertops and appliances by Smeg; and an independent two-story guest wing with a separate entrance, a lounge with a fireplace and a bedroom with an en-suite bathroom.Stairs with a wrought-iron balustrade lead to the upper floor of the villa, which has a master suite with a vaulted beamed ceiling, a fireplace, a canopy bed, a dressing room and an en-suite bathroom with access to a balcony and an open terrace. Across a corridor with a balcony are two bedrooms that share a bathroom.The lower level, which was refurbished in 2015, has three more bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, a powder room and a bricked lounge with a bar area and a wine cellar. The exit from the wine cellar to a downstairs terrace is lined with typical Arabic-style tiles. The villa is air-conditioned and has oil-fired central heating, an alarm system and a two-car garage.The garden of bougainvillea, thyme, rosemary and heather is surrounded by cork, pine, oak and arbutus trees. The villa is in a 560-acre gated development of about 108 homes, with six secured entrances, said Carlos Padilla, a property consultant who has the listing with Diana Morales Properties.The villages of La Heredia or El Madro\u00f1al, a few minutes\u2019 drive, have restaurants, cafes and grocers, and about 10 golf courses are within a half-hour drive. Nearby beaches include those in San Pedro de Alc\u00e1ntara and Puerto Ban\u00fas, which is a major tourist destination, with upscale shopping, restaurants, clubs and the largest mall in the area.Just north of the development is the Sierra de las Nieves, a Unesco biosphere reserve. Twenty minutes away by car is Marbella, the prime real estate market on the Andalusian coast. The international airports in M\u00e1laga and Gibraltar are both within an hour\u2019s drive.MARKET OVERVIEWDefinitions of the Costa del Sol can differ, but it is frequently seen spanning roughly from Nerja in the northeast down to Algeciras in the southwest, and running up to 10 miles inland. However, few brokers dispute that its heart and soul is Marbella, a cosmopolitan city of almost 150,000 near the geographic center of that stretch.The prime real estate area is the seaside \u201cGolden Mile\u201d from Marbella to Puerto Ban\u00fas, a strip of several miles developed with five-star resorts and apartment complexes. The few villas there are in high demand and can command prices as high as 10 million euros, or about $11.2 million, said Kristina Szekely, the owner of Kristina Szekely Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, which is based in Marbella.Two-bedroom apartments on the \u201cGolden Mile\u201d can be found for as little as 300,000 euros, or about $336,000, said Mike Braunholtz, the chief executive of the Prestige Property Group in London, which handles a lot of sales in the area.While the Costa del Sol suffered, like the rest of Spain, after the 2008 global real estate crisis, with home prices typically falling 15 to 20 percent, Marbella was one of the first places to recover, Mr. Padilla said. The market is now even seeing price increases in more popular enclaves, brokers said.Other parts of the Costa del Sol, particularly the area between Marbella and M\u00e1laga, which was popular among British tourists in the 1960s and \u201970s, are significantly lower priced and have not fared as well since the 2008 crisis, Mr. Braunholtz said.Benahav\u00eds is a small town, but has several well-regarded residential areas, such as El Madro\u00f1al, La Zagaleta, La Alqueria, La Quinta and El Paraiso, which represent about 90 percent of the municipality\u2019s area, Mr. Padilla said. Prices have recovered fully since the 2008 crisis, and currently villas range from about 700,000 euros, or about $784,000, to 18 million euros, or about $20 million, he said.WHO BUYS ON THE COSTA DEL SOLThe 2008 global real estate crisis and the British vote in June to leave the European Union, which has sent the value of the pound sterling plummeting, have both affected the composition of foreign buyers on the Costa del Sol, Ms. Szekely said.\u201cBefore it used to be one-third Spanish buyers, one-third British buyers and one-third mixed buyers,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s very mixed.\u201dBuyers are coming from the Middle East, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland and Russia; North Americans are buying, but not in large numbers, brokers said. While Chinese buyers are still not numerous, there are more of them than ever before, they said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign home buyers in Spain; however, they must obtain an identification number, a simple process that typically costs about 250 euros, or about $280, Mr. Padilla said.A lawyer is recommended, though not necessary, brokers said. A typical lawyer\u2019s fee for a property conveyance is about 0.75 percent to 1 percent of the property\u2019s sales price, Ms. Szekely said.Besides nominal notary fees and registration fees, home buyers must pay a purchase tax that varies based on the home\u2019s sales price, but is typically 10 to 12 percent of the home\u2019s price, Mr. Padilla said.Foreign home buyers can obtain mortgages from Spanish banks, which typically finance up to 60 percent of the official property valuation, he said.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; euro (1 euro = $1.12)TAXES AND FEESProperty taxes are about 2,425 euros a year, or about $2,716.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adam Curtis and the Secret History of Everything", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Outwardly, Curtis\u2019s films are journalistic expos\u00e9s in a documentary mode. They often extend to three or four or even five one-hour episodes; more recently they\u2019ve consisted of single continuous presentations lasting more than two hours. Curtis is not an underground presence, not in England. He is a longtime employee of the BBC, a.k.a. (sentimentally) \u201cthe Beeb,\u201d a pillar of 20th- and 21st-century British self-understanding. The films take familiar subjects \u2014 the Cold War, the growth of public relations or financial or military-industrial bureaucracies, the premises of the ecology or anti-psychiatry movements, the enmeshment of Western democracies in quasi-colonial military adventures in the Middle East \u2014 and render them strange. Stories that might seem like \u201csocial studies\u201d fodder become, in Curtis\u2019s hands, compulsive, like a giddy horror film you can\u2019t quit watching.Now, I won\u2019t offer too much more of this rote, no-longer-very-New Journalism stuff \u2014 I swear never to mention anything either Curtis or I ate or drank \u2014 but it\u2019s crucial that I offer a behind-the-curtain glimpse here, because it exemplifies a difficulty native to Curtis\u2019s films. This difficulty could be called: Where Is This Voice Coming From? One of Curtis\u2019s central subjects, running through all his work, is the possibility that we\u2019re listening to the wrong voices in public life, and in our own heads; that the ideas we find authoritative and persuasive about our politics and culture are in fact a tenuous construction, one at the mercy of bias, invisible ideological sway and unprocessed, untethered emotions (principally, fear).And, despite the humble cards I\u2019ve played (weather, map, hangovers), let\u2019s not ignore my present platform. \u201cThis is a film about a curious afternoon in the summer of 2016, when The New York Times came to make a polite visit to the BBC, in order to enclose one of England\u2019s most unusual journalists within its own sphere of influence.\u201d For some readers, these major-brand affiliations may be ennobling, and inspire confidence. For those more suspicious, the names of the mighty news organizations will be proof that deeper truth has, like Elvis, left the building.I arrived, in fact, as Curtis was laboring at edits on his new film, \u201cHyperNormalisation,\u201d a nearly three-hour epic pegged to several present crises: Brexit, European immigration, suicide bombing, the war in Syria. The sequence under Curtis\u2019s editorial hand today involved the financial firm BlackRock, which operates a powerful computerized risk-management network called Aladdin on the outskirts of an innocuous town in Washington State. Curtis\u2019s belief is that Aladdin, in guiding the investment of now more than $14 trillion of assets around the world, has become an enormous unacknowledged force for stasis in an innately dynamic world.But how to show it? All he had to work with were a few archival talking-head clips, an Aladdin advertising reel, some footage he shot of the sheds housing Aladdin\u2019s server farms and his own narration. Curtis was frustrated. \u201cHow do you illustrate something invisible?\u201d he asked, as if he\u2019d never solved this problem before, or at least not to his satisfaction. \u201cIt\u2019s not even people doing keystrokes on computers. It\u2019s just things roaring away. I\u2019ll show you this 37-second shot, my driving past those sheds.\u201dAs we watched, Curtis told me about his admiration for the recent movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which tried to portray, for a popular audience, another facet of those invisible forces at work. \u201cThis is the whole thing about \u2018good and evil\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s a na\u00efve view of the world. The problem is bigger, it\u2019s a system.\u201d Curtis and I briefly discussed a word coined by the critic Timothy Morton to describe a problem so vast in space and time that you are unable to apprehend it: a \u201chyperobject.\u201d Global warming is a classic example of a hyperobject: it\u2019s everywhere and nowhere, too encompassing to think about. Global markets, too. But naming a hyperobject alone is of limited use; human cognition knows all too well how to file such imminent imponderables away, on a \u201cto-do\u201d list that\u2019s never consulted again.\u201cThe Power of Nightmares,\u201d a study of the parallel growths of radical Islamist violence and the neoconservative movement that defined the U.S. response to 9/11, was the first Curtis film that Morris, or I, had seen. The film\u2019s thesis: that the present disaster was in some sense called forth by two oddly compatible apocalyptic responses to the anxieties raised by the fulfillments and disappointments of Western-style liberalism. Uncomfortable in 2004, the film\u2019s assertions still attract dispute even as the central thesis has trickled into the popular imagination such that many who have never seen Curtis\u2019s film now accept it as a given.If Americans like Morris and myself have tended to learn of Curtis\u2019s work beginning with \u201cThe Power of Nightmares,\u201d his British viewers usually started earlier, with his landmark treatises on the biases of technological utopian social thinking (\u201cPandora\u2019s Box,\u201d 1992); on propaganda, historical amnesia, brainwashing and nostalgia (\u201cThe Living Dead,\u201d 1995); on the growth of popular psychiatry and public relations, and the merging of the cult of personal fulfillment with consumerist imperatives (\u201cThe Century of the Self,\u201d 2002). \u201cThe Century of the Self,\u201d in particular, is seen by many in Britain as Curtis\u2019s signature accomplishment. These early works construct a kind of \u201cbible\u201d of Curtis\u2019s thinking, upon which his later arguments build.The British director Stephen Frears began with \u201cThe Mayfair Set\u201d (1999), which depicts a group of entrepreneurs who, starting in the \u201960s, dismantled the power of the British state and helped usher the free market back into politics, with disastrous results. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely brilliant,\u201d Frears says. \u201cI was just watching television, and I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. It was such a dazzling analysis. He\u2019s a cult figure in England, but he has access. The BBC is the greatest broadcasting organization in the world. In \u2018Bitter Lake,\u2019 he had all the material. He\u2019s standing in the right place, inside that archive.\u201d Even among those skeptical of Curtis\u2019s narratives, his masterly use of the BBC archive \u2014 his uncanny capacity to excavate sequences from the dark side of journalism\u2019s moon and the expressive power he finds in their juxtaposition \u2014 produces awe. Curtis possesses a \u201cdazzlingly acute eye,\u201d wrote Andrew Anthony in The Observer, even as he accused him of \u201csuperimposing his own creative theory as journalistic fact.\u201dCurtis is justly proud of his adeptness in the archives: \u201cIt\u2019s all stored in a giant warehouse on the outskirts of West London, deliberately kept anonymous. It\u2019s the biggest film archive in the world. The cataloging is good, although it\u2019s been done at different stages. But, because the BBC is an organization that has a vast global news output, I discovered that, throughout the 1980s, there were these giant two-inch videotapes, called COMP tapes, onto which satellites would just dump stuff overnight. And they\u2019re not well cataloged. You can go to a news item and see; if there was a COMP tape for that day, you can order it up. Those two-inch tapes start to degrade, but they\u2019ve been transferred, and they\u2019re amazing.\u201dPause.\u201cOr no. Sometimes they\u2019re very boring. Sometimes they\u2019re like an hour of a chair waiting for someone to come to it. I don\u2019t do that Andy Warhol stuff of a chair for an hour. But then, someone will come to the chair and prepare, and you\u2019ve got that moment. When one of those COMP tapes turns up for me because of something I\u2019ve ordered, I just press fast forward and go through it all. Until something catches my eye, and then I will then digitize it. And I\u2019ve got a very good memory. I have a pattern memory, an associative way of thinking.\u201dPause.\u201cIf you really want to know, it\u2019s like a computer game, the archive. There are different levels. Most people can only get to Level 1. I can get to Level 6.\u201dCurtis\u2019s brief against world leaders \u2014 or at least the policies they\u2019re chosen to embody, at the cost of great misery \u2014 is pretty savage. Neoliberals fare as poorly as neocons. He\u2019s got no love for tyrants either. But he doesn\u2019t opt, as Moore did with Wolfowitz, to expose his politicians as pathetic. The tiny portraits he carves from the archives are, instead, strangely tender. The human souls in question often appear introspective, as if measuring their self-possession, or discreetly consulting some inner oracle. Bill Clinton coughs. Hillary Clinton nods to herself, hesitates, smiles. Putin shrugs. Hafez al-Assad merely waits, thinking.Curtis\u2019s films often have surprise bonus protagonists \u2014 guest stars, in television terms. In \u201cHyperNormalisation,\u201d it is Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi who steals the show, thanks to a stream of uncanny archival appearances of this kind, including one in which he pours himself a healthy glass of milk from a pitcher. Curtis, by testimony of his narration, regards the sinister, flamboyant Qaddafi as the West\u2019s polymorphous dupe, less a monster than a man monstrously acted upon \u2014 a fictional character in a story the West told itself to skirt harder truths. \u201cViolence born out of political struggles for power,\u201d Curtis said, \u201cbecame replaced by a much simpler image, of the head of a rogue state, who became more like an archcriminal who wanted to terrorize the world.\u201dWith each new bit of footage, a glance, a shy smile, Qaddafi\u2019s human presence seeps unexpectedly into the viewer\u2019s sympathies. Reagan\u2019s does as well. Curtis\u2019s politicians, ultimately, contend with their own bafflement in the face of the unseen forces shaping their world. They\u2019re traveling with us, stuck inside the hyperobject.Curtis earned a degree in the human sciences at Oxford, then briefly taught there. Unsatisfied with academia, he took a job at the BBC, eventually going to work in the early \u201980s as a segment producer on \u201cThat\u2019s Life!\u201d a kind of cross between \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cCandid Camera.\u201d There, Curtis learned his craft. \u201cOne week I was sent up to Edinburgh to film a singing dog,\u201d he said. \u201cHis owner said that when he played the bagpipes, the dog would sing Scottish songs. We set the camera up. The owner dressed up in a kilt and started to play the bagpipes. The dog refused to sing. It just sat there looking at me just saying nothing. It just sat there, with a really smug look on its face. This went on for about two hours.\u201d Curtis phoned his producer. \u201cShe said: \u2018Darling, that is wonderful. Don\u2019t you see that the dog refusing to sing for a man dressed up in a kilt is actually very funny? Go back and keep filming. Film the dog doing nothing. But film the man as well.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cSo I did. We ran a long close-up shot of the dog\u2019s face with the sound of out-of-tune bagpipes. It was quite avant-garde, but the audience loved it, especially when you cut it against the face of the man puffing at the bagpipes who genuinely believed that the dog was about to sing.\u201cThat time with a dog taught me the fundamental basics of journalism. That what really happens is the key thing; you mustn\u2019t try and force the reality in front of you into a predictable story. What you should do is notice what is happening in front of your eyes, and what instinctively your reaction is. And my reaction was that I hated the dog as it looked at me silently. So I made a short film about that.\u201dDespite his Oxford education, a hint of a provincial resentment defines Curtis\u2019s attitudes toward London\u2019s cultural intelligentsia. Americans might model this as the \u201cJohn Lennon syndrome\u201d (as opposed to the sense of ease and entitlement exhibited by, say, Mick Jagger). \u201cThe snooty people disagree with me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe posh literary lot. They don\u2019t like me because they think I\u2019m not elegant and literary and I don\u2019t make enough references. And what I do is I play fast and loose \u2014 not with the facts, they\u2019re not interested in that \u2014 but with my aesthetic responses. I put pop music, David Bowie, in the middle of an Afghan film. It\u2019s all a bit vulgar.\u201d\u201cMovies are an authoritarian medium,\u201d wrote David Foster Wallace in 1996. \u201cThey vulnerabilize you and then dominate you.\u201d Wallace\u2019s cautionary tone typifies humanistic reservations about the power of the moving image, in the hands of a spellbinder like Curtis (or, in Wallace\u2019s essay, David Lynch). \u201cFilm\u2019s overwhelming power isn\u2019t news,\u201d Wallace continued. \u201cBut different kinds of movies use this power in different ways. Art film is essentially teleological: it tries in various ways to \u2018wake the audience up\u2019 or render us more \u2018conscious.\u2019\u2009\u201dCurtis alludes to such aims only in the plainest terms. \u201cI use music and all the cultural references that I would talk to my friends about, so it feels like a program made by someone you know,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, what I do deliberately, is I show the joins. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t join any two pieces of film up. So I will often in the editing deliberately make a discordant edit. It just makes you aware of what it is you are watching.\u201dHis grudge against contemporary art can seem either a provocation or an eccentricity, until he places it in relation to a few of his key terms, like \u201cconsumer capitalism\u201d and \u201cthe self.\u201d \u201cThe problem is that the central ideology of our age is the idea of self-expression,\u201d he said. \u201cThat the self, being expressive, is the good thing. It\u2019s what I trace in \u2018The Century of the Self.\u2019 Expressing yourself through consumerism is central. So, the dilemma for artists is that however radical in content their paintings, their performance art, their video works, the mode in which they\u2019re doing it \u2014 self-expression \u2014 feeds the strength of the very thing they\u2019re trying to overthrow, which is modern consumer capitalism.\u201dCurtis prefers Balzac, the novelist of intricate social tapestries, to the modernist tradition of interiority defined by Woolf and Proust. But the novelist he claims as inspiration is Dos Passos, whose \u201cU.S.A.\u201d trilogy he read when he was a boy, and whose centrifugal blend of pastiche and documentation may be the key to Curtis\u2019s style. At the other end, Curtis\u2019s artistic nemesis is Andy Warhol. \u201cI\u2019ve got this idea. I call it the I.A.R., the Inappropriate Aesthetic Response. I date it back to Warhol. It\u2019s this idea you can take horrific images like the electric chair and aestheticize them. The beheading videos, the orange jumpsuits against the desert background; ISIS uses that knowingly. I have a ruthless theory, that the radical-art movement, which grew out of the failure of revolutionary politics, becomes the outriders for the property developers. You need the aesthetic of decline in order to make those buildings desirable.\u201d\u201cHyperNormalisation\u201d is a summation of one of Curtis\u2019s major themes: that liberalism \u2014 since the collapse of certainty about how its values would transform politics, finance and journalism \u2014 has in fact become genuinely conservative. In a world of unpredictability, it has retreated from genuine frontiers, instead opting for holding actions that can make it feel stable and safe.So we live, thanks to our advanced systems of monitoring, compensation and control, in a bubble of our own devising. And in Curtis\u2019s critique, contemporary artists and hipsters do as much to create this bubble as the internet itself. \u201cOn a social-media network, it\u2019s very much like being in a heroin bubble. As a radical artist in the 1970s, you used to go and take heroin and wander through the chaos and the collapsing Lower East Side, and you felt safe. That\u2019s very like now. You know you aren\u2019t safe, but you feel safe because everyone is like you. But you don\u2019t have to take heroin, so it\u2019s brilliant. You don\u2019t get addicted, or maybe you do. Mostly you do.\u201d\u201cWhat will happen to the internet in the future?\u201d He\u2019s riffing again. \u201cWill it become a bit like a John Carpenter movie? You go there, amidst the ruins, and it\u2019s weird, and you can be nasty \u2014 just have fun and be bad, like a child. From about \u201996 to about 2005 people built these lovely websites, they put up masses and masses of fantastic information. They\u2019ve left them sitting there, but it\u2019s like a city that everyone\u2019s gone from. And what\u2019s come in instead is a weird world where you don\u2019t know what\u2019s real \u2014 just people shouting at each other. It\u2019s good fun, but it\u2019s not real.\u201dThough Curtis regards the internet with ambivalence \u2014 and who among us doesn\u2019t? \u2014 his current method of disseminating his films, and his ideas, wouldn\u2019t be possible without it, particularly in America. This contradiction he embraces. Speaking of \u201cThe Power of Nightmares,\u201d he told me, \u201cA lot of people said, \u2018Oh, the television networks in America would never show it.\u2019 What I\u2019d noticed is that the moment I put it out, it went up on the internet. I understood at that point that it would have more political power and be seen by many more people if I let it be a thing that people want to find illegally.\u201d (Virtually all of Curtis\u2019s films are available to the intrepid Googler for free viewing, but if I told you where to find them, they might vanish.)Curtis seems to cherish his place in America as a voice seeping from under the floorboards. In a way, the ruined apocalyptic John Carpenter city appears to be where he wants to live. Even in Britain, Curtis made \u201cBitter Lake\u201d not for television broadcast but as an experiment in releasing his work to the BBC iPlayer website instead. \u201cHyperNormalisation\u201d had an exclusive iPlayer release as well, on Oct. 16. It has freed him, in \u201cBitter Lake,\u201d to play with moody, wordless sequences sustained longer than anything in his earlier pieces, and to include violence too disturbing for television broadcast. \u201cIt\u2019s a good place to experiment. The woman who runs iPlayer \u2014 I was the first person to do an original thing for her \u2014 is giving me a great deal of freedom. It won\u2019t last. They will bring the palace guards into the internet quite soon, and we\u2019ll have to follow more rules, but for the moment it\u2019s a very good place to be.\u201dWas it Kashiwagi\u2019s mysterious death, which voided a several-millions debt to Trump, that spurred Trump out of the risk-laden world of actual construction, investment and management and into the realm of speculative virtuality \u2014 the practice, that is, of selling his name for others to slap onto buildings, even as he became a television and tabloid personality to make that name more valuable? In Curtis\u2019s portrait, anyway, Trump is an avant-garde figure. From the film\u2019s narration: \u201cTrump had realized that the version of reality that politics presented was no longer believable. \u2026 And in the face of that, you could play with reality.\u201dBut Trump\u2019s supporters are, of course, also deeply enbubbled. Trump, according to Curtis, may himself be only another form of feedback system, similar to a chat-bot who replies to you by restating your questions in a flattering style. \u201cHe\u2019s a hate-bot. You go, \u2018I\u2019m angry,\u2019 and he goes, \u2018I\u2019m angry, too!\u2019 And nothing changes. But the system likes it: Angry people click more.\u201dI asked whether the prospect of Trump\u2019s actually winning concerned him. At the time of my visit with Curtis, many national polls showed the candidates tied. \u201cI\u2019m trying to abstract myself from the frightened-bunny view of Donald Trump,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of something \u2014 that\u2019s what I would think \u2014 and if it\u2019s the end of something, then it\u2019s about time we started inventing something new.\u201dIn his pauses I felt Curtis\u2019s thinking as a tangible presence in the room. He wasn\u2019t so much measuring his willingness to provoke or offend as negotiating with his own frightened-bunny view of the question. \u201cI mean, I think he\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut I think there are lots of other dangerous things around in the world.\u201dHe seems to feel the same way. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m part of the conservatism that I\u2019m being incredibly rude about,\u201d he said. Uncovering this reservation seemed almost to delight him. \u201cI should have the humility to recognize that the sort of films I make are locked in the past. If I was going to really attack myself \u2014 a lot of people also did in the 1990s what I did in film. Which they called sampling. Basically just going and replaying stuff and remaking it into new things, which is really good fun. But fundamentally, it\u2019s doing what I\u2019m accusing BlackRock\u2019s computer of doing: constantly monitoring the past, reworking it into other patterns, as a hedge against the future. Am I giving you any vision of the future?\u201d The question felt earnest, but if I\u2019d said yes he\u2019d have laughed at me.\u201cIn fact, actually the great thing about human beings is that they\u2019re protean,\u201d Curtis told me, near the end, before I let him get back to his editing. \u201cThey can be anything you want them to be. They\u2019re amazing. But we\u2019re stuck with the idea that there is a fixed self. We\u2019re stuck with the idea that there is a body mass index that you must have. We\u2019re stuck that this is the food you must have. We\u2019re stuck with the system of finance. It\u2019s just stuck. And maybe, I\u2019m part of the stuckness.\u201d Several times, Curtis and I circled back to the notion of the \u201chyperobject\u201d \u2014 that which is too big in time and space to comprehend. Perhaps this is merely shorthand for the sensation of apprehending that we are creatures born into a world that seems to demand our understanding, but will never grant it. \u201cYou have to recognize that you\u2019re part of the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the point about journalism is to try to portray the thing you are part of. I think that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201dJonathan Lethem is the author of 10 novels, including \u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d He lives in Los Angeles and Maine.Produced by Rodrigo De Benito Sanz and Linsey FieldsAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Allen Roses, Who Upset Common Wisdom on Cause of Alzheimer\u2019s, Dies at 73", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byAllen Roses, a maverick researcher whose team of scientists identified two genes that put healthy people over 65 at higher risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, died on Friday in New York. He was 73.Dr. Roses had a heart attack at Kennedy International Airport on his way to a medical conference in Greece, his daughter Stephanie Roses said. Before his death, he had been testing a drug that researchers hoped would help people stave off dementia.In the early 1990s, Dr. Roses and his collaborators at Duke University rejected prevailing assumptions that the buildup in the brain of a protein plaque called amyloid directly caused memory loss and other mental impairments in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.Instead, they maintained that the plaque largely resulted from the disease, and that the deterioration of brain function actually originated from the variation of a single gene.In 2009, after financing his research with a loan of almost $500,000 on his house, Dr. Roses and his team identified a second gene that they said could help predict whether the cognitive ability of an older person, generally between 65 and 83, would decline within about five years of acquiring Alzheimer\u2019s.There are currently no treatments to prevent or delay the disease, but if therapies do become available, identifying people at risk will be vital.Delaying the onset of dementia by five years through medicine could cut the cost of patient care nationally by $50 billion annually, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. The organization paid tribute to Dr. Roses this week, saying that his research had \u201csignificantly advanced our knowledge and understanding\u201d of the disease.In countering the amyloid theory, which had become the conventional wisdom and the basis for most research funding, Dr. Roses maintained that dementia in Alzheimer\u2019s patients resulted from a gene variation that inhibits mitochondria, or mini-organs within a cell, from metabolizing glucose and oxygen, a process necessary to fuel neurons in the brain.Without the energy generated by that fuel, the neurons cannot communicate with one another. Unable to reproduce, they die and are not replaced, and brain function deteriorates.Dr. Roses, a clinical neurologist, spent most of his career at Duke and was the senior vice president for genetics research and pharmacogenetics at GlaxoSmithKline.In his research, he determined the chromosomal locations for more than a dozen other diseases, including Parkinson\u2019s, Lou Gehrig\u2019s and muscular dystrophy.Allen David Roses was born on Feb. 21, 1943, in Paterson, N.J., the son of Morris Roses, who owned a stationery store, and the former Ceil Schwartz, both Jewish immigrants from Poland who escaped the Holocaust.His father died when Allen was about 13, forcing him to help support the family by working odd jobs and running numbers for mob-connected bookies.After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh and receiving his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania, he was a medical resident at Columbia University and Duke. He served as a doctor in the Air Force in Vietnam and was discharged as a captain.Dr. Roses left Duke to join GlaxoWellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) in 1997. He returned to the university in 2007 as a professor and director of the Deane Drug Discovery Institute.He owned Zinfandel Pharmaceuticals, which has been collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese company, on clinical trials to determine whether Actos, a drug ordinarily prescribed for diabetes, can delay Alzheimer\u2019s. The trials, part of a multiyear study, have involved thousands of participants.The tests have been seeking to determine whether doctors can predict the risk of cognitive loss in people with Alzheimer\u2019s and whether a low dose of the drug can help in mild cases.Dr. Roses was also the chairman of the American Dance Festival.In addition to his daughter Stephanie, he is survived by his wife, Ann Saunders, a fellow neuroscience researcher who also teaches at Duke; three other daughters, Maija Roses, Joanna Roses Ryan and Michelle Roses Holleman; his sister, Estelle Irizarry; and four grandchildren. He lived in Durham, N.C.The heart attack that caused his death was his third since 1990, but his pace never faltered. \u201cHe treated every day like it was his last one, because he knew it probably was,\u201d Stephanie Roses said. \u201cHe woke up every morning and would blink three times and say, \u2018I have another day.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reginald K. Brack Jr., 79, Dies; Led Time Inc. Into Entertainment Era", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byThe cause was complications of progressive supranuclear palsy, a brain disorder, his family said.Mr. Brack began at Time Inc. as an ad salesman at Time magazine in 1962 and rose to chief executive in 1990. He was the first person to run the company who had not gone to an Ivy League college, and the first who had begun his career in sales and not journalism or finance.In his nearly four decades at Time Inc., Mr. Brack, who was known as Reg, helped usher in a renaissance of the company\u2019s book sales operations and of its stable of magazines as they were becoming not just publications but brands. He was the original publisher of Discover, and several titles dedicated to lifestyle and culture were introduced under his leadership, including Entertainment Weekly, Martha Stewart Living, InStyle and Vibe.Not all of his experiments were successful. In 1988 Time Inc. invested $185 million in Whittle Communications, which created advertiser-driven media for schools and doctors\u2019 offices; it collapsed in the mid-1990s.But he is credited with strengthening the magazine operations\u2019 bottom-line sensibility and with helping to open up the company\u2019s old-boy culture, especially by naming women to higher ranks. When he appointed Elizabeth Valk Long publisher of Life in 1986, she became the first woman to hold that title at any Time publication.After graduating from Washington and Lee University in Virginia in 1959, he moved to St. Louis to sell advertising at The Saturday Evening Post. He had been there for three years when he struck up a conversation with a man sitting next to him on an airplane; he had noticed the man writing on Time magazine stationery.The man asked him if he had ever considered working for Time, and Mr. Brack told him he had tried, but had been rejected. The man, who turned out to be the magazine\u2019s publisher (he did not mention his name), told him to \u201crethink that,\u201d Mr. Brack recalled in the video.He joined the company a few months later. That same year, 1962, he married Barbara Smith, whom he had met five months earlier on a blind date in St. Louis. She survives him, as do three children, Reginald, Peter and Elizabeth Brack; a brother, Dennis; a sister, Linda McFarland; and a granddaughter.At Time, Mr. Brack said, he rejected the chummy ethos of cocktail-filled restaurant lunches with colleagues and chose instead to dine with customers. He earned a series of promotions, becoming ad sales director for Time\u2019s international editions as well as worldwide sales director for the magazine. He later helped turn around Time Life\u2019s struggling book and video operations before becoming chief executive of the magazine division in 1986.He was a vocal proponent of Time Inc.\u2019s 1990 merger with Warner Communications, and he was comfortable breaking down some of the traditional walls between the business and editorial sides of publications. When he was marketing to airline companies, for example, Time would lease a Boeing 707 to fly top industry executives and their ad agencies\u2019 representatives to Paris for the annual air show, where Time journalists would give presentations on new developments in the industry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With City of Towers, China Puts Its Economic Stamp on Caucasus", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byTBILISI, Georgia \u2014 Scott Mi, a businessman from western China, stood on a balcony on one of the nine completed towers of 27 that his company plans to build and gestured toward the distant hilltop boundary of his improbable domain \u2014 a new, Chinese-built city rising atop one of the most volatile geopolitical fault lines left by the collapse of the Soviet Union.\u201cEverything you can see is ours,\u201d said Mr. Mi, the 32-year-old head of Hualing Group Georgia, a privately owned but mostly state-funded company in the vanguard of an effort by China to extend its economic reach into the rocky and often treacherous ground of the Caucasus.At the center of this push stands the Tbilisi Sea New City, a huge property development outside the Georgian capital. It is nearly 200 miles from the nearest sea, but it does sit next to a Soviet-era reservoir, a body of water that adds a splash of color to the growing parade of concrete towers, a huge five-star hotel with the region\u2019s biggest ballroom and, just down the road, a newly built shopping center as long as five football fields.The rebranding of a man-made reservoir as a sea is all part of an outsize project that defies conventional, or at least Western, business thinking.It is introducing Chinese-style economics to a country that, depending on your perspective, is either a critical link in a \u201cnew Silk Road\u201d between Asia and Europe or a cockpit of unresolved and potentially explosive rivalry between Moscow and the West.But what had been a noisy two-way struggle for influence and profit between Moscow and Washington has quietly expanded into a three-ring event that has left China with the most visible role.Mr. Mi\u2019s new city has done nothing less than transplant a patch of China lock, stock and barrel onto previously barren land. Down to its ornamental rock gardens, rigidly geometric street plan and high perimeter wall, it is a nearly exact replica of the property projects that transformed China\u2019s urban landscape before a recent downturn began to curb a flood of funding for construction.This is hardly surprising since most of the design and building work at the Tbilisi Sea New City has been done by workers from China, even though wages in Georgia are often lower than in much of China.\u201cYou can\u2019t make any money here,\u201d complained Liu Peiyun, a construction worker from the central Chinese region of Henan, slapping plaster on an entryway to the new city\u2019s expanding residential section. He said he had hoped to get work in Britain but had been sent to Georgia instead. He wished he had stayed at home.The use of Chinese workers initially stirred anger and even small protests. Those feelings have since faded amid dismay and also delight that, unlike many other grand plans in Georgia, the Chinese project is really happening and is now providing management and other jobs to Georgians.In contrast to the crumbling, Soviet-style apartment blocks in a nearby suburb of Tbilisi \u2014 buildings that look as if they began falling down before they were even fully built \u2014 the Chinese company offers clean if basic modern towers with elevators that work and corridors that do not smell of urine.\u201cWe are Chinese, so we build like in China,\u201d Mr. Mi said, sitting in the shiny marble-clad lobby of his company\u2019s luxury hotel.Aside from absent Communist Party slogan boards, an essential part of all such developments in China, the only missing element is the people.Nearly all the apartments of the residential towers built so far have been sold, many of them to the Georgian government to house refugees from territory seized by Russian-backed rebels.But the whole place is often eerily empty. The only noise on a recent afternoon was the distant clatter of construction and the bustle of security guards preparing for the arrival of the Chinese ambassador and Georgian leaders at a celebration of China\u2019s national day in the hotel\u2019s expansive ballroom.The economic calculus behind the project, like that of many ventures financed by Chinese state banks, is something of a mystery.Georgia\u2019s prime minister, Giorgi Kvirikashvili, a former banker, said he had not done a detailed study of its \u201cinternal rate of return\u201d \u2014 bankers\u2019 jargon for profitability \u2014 but assumed \u201cthere has to be an economic rationale.\u201dMr. Mi, who is the son of the founder and president of Hualing\u2019s parent company back in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, first came to Georgia right after the 2008 war with Russia. He acknowledged that there were initially doubts about the wisdom of sinking money into such a troubled land.\u201cOf course, some people thought this was crazy,\u201d he said.But he said the company, while not yet making a profit, liked Georgia\u2019s low taxes and business environment, and so would keep expanding. It has already built nine tower blocks under a deal with the Georgian government that gave it more than 1,000 acres around the Tbilisi reservoir in return for the construction of housing for athletes who took part in a sporting event last year.Hualing has now started work on six more towers and has plans for the remaining 12. The company also wants to set up a school, a medical clinic and other facilities to create a self-contained, Chinese-style gated community.Mr. Mi said the venture should start making money within five years. In the meantime, he added, the company is serving China\u2019s flagship economic and foreign policy program \u2014 a multibillion-dollar plan launched in 2013 by the Communist Party leader, Xi Jinping, to develop sea and land transport corridors through which China can export its goods to the world, particularly to Europe.Officially called the Belt and Road Initiative but better known as the New Silk Road, the plan involves not only developing railways, ports and other infrastructure but also increasing China\u2019s economic presence in a string of countries stretching from Central Asia to the Caucasus and then into Eastern Europe.In a sign of the Chinese government\u2019s interest despite Georgia\u2019s small size, tumultuous past and population of only 3.7 million, it recently signed a preliminary free-trade pact with the country.Last year, China sent teams of officials and businessmen to Tbilisi for a so-called Silk Road Forum, a conference focused on Georgia\u2019s role as \u201cone of the key hubs of Eurasian trade and commerce.\u201dNonetheless, Georgia and many other countries along the new Silk Road \u2014 an ever expanding concept that includes a multiplicity of different routes \u2014 have been lobbying to get a piece of what Chinese officials have said will be at least a trillion dollars in investment.Unlike Russia and the United States, however, China has so far shown little interest in remaking local politics in its own image or turning Georgia into a platform for its own geopolitical agenda.\u201cAll we want is stability,\u201d said Mr. Mi, whose company has invested half a billion dollars to become Georgia\u2019s biggest single private investor outside energy-related projects like pipelines from neighboring Azerbaijan, a major oil and gas producer.In addition to its property project outside Tbilisi, Hualing runs an industrial zone in western Georgia, a mining venture, a wood processing plant and other businesses.The United States, while Georgia\u2019s most important geopolitical patron, invested just $18.4 million in the country last year. America\u2019s most visible commercial presence in Georgia is through the franchising of fast food chains like Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s, as well as some hotels.Expectations that China would pour in money willy-nilly, however, have sometimes fallen flat. China is in negotiations to buy a small Georgian Black Sea port at Batumi but pulled out of bidding for a role in the construction of a much bigger new port at Anaklia, also on Georgia\u2019s Black Sea coast.\u201cChinese money is not as free as many imagined,\u201d said Levan Akhvlediani, the chief executive of the Anaklia Development Consortium, which is responsible for building and managing the new port. He spent months negotiating with Chinese companies to get them involved in the Anaklia project but found their demands unreasonable.\u201cThey don\u2019t just pour money in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey usually want control, and if they don\u2019t get control they are not interested.\u201dAdvertisement"}
