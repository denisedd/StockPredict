{"Headline": "Why a Media Merger That Should Go Through Might Not", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseOpponents of the proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner don\u2019t want to just block the $85.4 billion deal: They want to overturn decades of antitrust policy and case law.Until recently, that would have been all but unthinkable. But in today\u2019s superheated and politically charged environment, they may just succeed.Politicians were piling on this week to criticize the deal, including Donald J. Trump; Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for vice president; and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Al Franken of Minnesota. Still to be heard from is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a prominent foe of corporate consolidation.A younger generation of antitrust scholars who are rethinking the nation\u2019s fundamental approach to antitrust law may prove even more influential.In vertical mergers, a company buys a supplier; in horizontal mergers, direct competitors combine.But the new generation harks back to the original trustbusters of the early 20th century, who were most concerned about preventing corporations from gaining too much power.\u201cThe antitrust system as it stands is focused on prices to consumers, innovation and efficiencies,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cThat reflects the triumph of the University of Chicago school of economics. But there\u2019s an older tradition, embodied by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, that says a concentration of too much power in too few hands is bad for democracy and bad for consumers.\u201dScott Hemphill, an antitrust and intellectual property professor at New York University School of Law, agreed. \u201cVertical deals rarely get prohibited outright,\u201d he said. \u201cModern antitrust case law has pretty much kept politics out of the analysis.\u201d\u201cBut is antitrust law only about economics, or does enhanced political power play a role?\u201d Mr. Hemphill asked. \u201cWould a combined AT&T and Time Warner put too much power in one company? That\u2019s the big question.\u201dIt\u2019s a question AT&T says it is prepared to answer. \u201cIf someone is looking for a test case to overturn the time-honored judicial precedents of vertical mergers, this is not the case,\u201d David R. McAtee II, AT&T\u2019s general counsel, told me this week. \u201cWhat we have here is a classic vertical merger that will benefit consumers in an environment that\u2019s begging for innovation.\u201dGiven antitrust precedents, it\u2019s no wonder AT&T and Time Warner would expect regulatory approval, even if they have to accept some conditions imposed by the government. Time Warner is so confident the deal will be approved that it negotiated a paltry breakup fee (by megamerger standards) in the event it\u2019s blocked: just $500 million.At nearly every opportunity, Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, and other architects of the deal have repeated the \u201cvertical\u201d mantra. As Mr. Stephenson told me this weekend, \u201cThis is strictly a vertical merger. We\u2019re combining with one of our big suppliers. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a vertical merger denied by the regulators. They won\u2019t give us a free pass, but we expect that if they have concerns, they\u2019ll impose conditions to address them.\u201dMr. Stephenson is right about that. Time Warner is just one of many content suppliers to AT&T, albeit an important one. Time Warner competes vigorously with other film and television studios, cable networks, and producers of news and entertainment.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.AT&T competes in cable delivery systems, satellite and wireless. While more concentrated than news and entertainment (there are just four major wireless carriers), they are still competitive markets.This isn\u2019t a \u201chorizontal\u201d American Airlines-US Airways merger (which inexplicably passed antitrust review) or even the earlier 21st Century Fox bid, which Time Warner rebuffed in part because of antitrust concerns.Since neither firm competes with the other one, merging the two would have little or no effect on market concentration. And the deal\u2019s architects are promising a bevy of virtues for consumers, from more wireless video access to lower prices.Case closed?Thanks in large part to groundbreaking books in the 1970s by the Supreme Court nominee and Yale Law School antitrust scholar Robert Bork (\u201cThe Antitrust Paradox\u201d) and Richard Posner (now an influential judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals) at the University of Chicago Law School (\u201cAntitrust Law\u201d), vertical mergers came to be viewed as usually promoting competition and, by extension, consumer welfare.The view was embraced by the Supreme Court and embedded in the Justice Department\u2019s vertical merger guidelines during the Reagan administration.The proposed Comcast-NBC Universal deal set off an avalanche of criticism from rival media companies and consumer advocates who argued that it consolidated too much power in one company. In 2011 the Justice Department sued to block the deal on grounds it had the potential to disadvantage competitors that delivered video services, such as satellite broadcasters and telecom companies, and emerging online video providers like Netflix.In an opinion that has no doubt been closely scrutinized by AT&T\u2019s antitrust lawyers at Arnold & Porter, a federal judge ruled that the conditions Comcast accepted to ease the regulator\u2019s concerns \u201cwill provide a prompt, certain and effective remedy for consumers by diminishing Comcast\u2019s ability\u201d to \u201charm competition.\u201dWhether that has indeed been the case will no doubt be the subject of intense scrutiny by regulators. \u201cIt\u2019s important to assess how well the NBC consent decree has done,\u201d Mr. Hemphill said. \u201cOn the face of things, online video seems to be thriving. But has Comcast engaged in troubling behavior as a result of owning NBCUniversal? That\u2019s an important question for thinking about this deal.\u201dSusan P. Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School and author of \u201cCaptive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age,\u201d was an influential voice in encouraging regulators to oppose the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. She predicted the same fate for AT&T-Time Warner.\u201cI think this is unlikely to be approved,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were very few public benefits to the Comcast/NBCU deal, which should not have gone through. It\u2019s difficult even to identify a public benefit for this one.\u201dMr. McAtee of AT&T said it would \u201cbe fundamentally inconsistent and unfair\u201d for the government to reject AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner after it approved the Comcast NBC Universal merger.\u201cWe feel we have an even stronger case,\u201d he added. \u201cComcast was a dominant, entrenched cable and broadband provider, and NBC Universal had big broadcast licenses in an ecosystem where over-the-top video was still in its infancy. Yet the government approved the deal with conditions. On all counts, we have a stronger case for approval.\u201dAT&T and Time Warner executives will have many months to make their argument to consumers, Congress, regulators and the White House. But there\u2019s a risk they will find themselves in the midst of a revolution in antitrust thinking that transcends any one case.\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that both presidential candidates have said they\u2019d take a close look at this,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cSo one of the first tests for the new president will be where they come down on this: Will it be Louis Brandeis or the University of Chicago?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To the First Lady, With Love", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Four thank-you notes to Michelle Obama, who has spent the past eight years quietly and confidently changing the course of American history.Supported byShe had rhythm, a flow and swerve, hands slicing air, body weight moving from foot to foot, a beautiful rhythm. In anything else but a black American body, it would have been contrived. The three-quarter sleeves of her teal dress announced its appropriateness, as did her matching brooch. But the cut of the dress scorned any \u201cfuture first lady\u201d stuffiness; it hung easy on her, as effortless as her animation. And a brooch, Old World style accessory, yes, but hers was big and ebulliently shaped and perched center on her chest. Michelle Obama was speaking. It was the 2008 Democratic National Convention. My anxiety rose and swirled, watching and willing her to be as close to perfection as possible, not for me, because I was already a believer, but for the swaths of America that would rather she stumbled.She first appeared in the public consciousness, all common sense and mordant humor, at ease in her skin. She had the air of a woman who could balance a checkbook, and who knew a good deal when she saw it, and who would tell off whomever needed telling off. She was tall and sure and stylish. She was reluctant to be first lady, and did not hide her reluctance beneath platitudes. She seemed not so much unique as true. She sharpened her husband\u2019s then-hazy form, made him solid, more than just a dream.But she had to flatten herself to better fit the mold of first lady. At the law firm where they met before love felled them, she had been her husband\u2019s mentor; they seemed to be truly friends, partners, equals in a modern marriage in a new American century. Yet voters and observers, wide strips of America, wanted her to conform and defer, to cleanse her tongue of wit and barb. When she spoke of his bad morning-breath, a quirky and humanizing detail, she was accused of emasculating him.Because she said what she thought, and because she smiled only when she felt like smiling, and not constantly and vacuously, America\u2019s cheapest caricature was cast on her: the Angry Black Woman. Women, in general, are not permitted anger \u2014 but from black American women, there is an added expectation of interminable gratitude, the closer to groveling the better, as though their citizenship is a phenomenon that they cannot take for granted.\u201cI love this country,\u201d she said to applause. She needed to say it \u2014 her salve to the hostility of people who claimed she was unpatriotic because she had dared to suggest that, as an adult, she had not always been proud of her country.Of course she loved her country. The story of her life as she told it was wholesomely American, drenched in nostalgia: a father who worked shifts and a mother who stayed home, an almost mythic account of self-reliance, of moderation, of working-class contentment. But she is also a descendant of slaves, those full human beings considered human fractions by the American state. And ambivalence should be her birthright. For me, a foreign-raised person who likes America, one of its greatest curiosities is this: that those who have the most reason for dissent are those least allowed dissent.Michelle Obama was speaking. I felt protective of her because she was speaking to an America often too quick to read a black woman\u2019s confidence as arrogance, her straightforwardness as entitlement.She was informal, colloquial, her sentences bookended by the word \u201csee,\u201d a conversational fillip that also strangely felt like a mark of authenticity. She seemed genuine. She was genuine. All over America, black women were still, their eyes watching a form of God, because she represented their image writ large in the world.Her speech was vibrant, a success. But there was, in her eyes and beneath her delivery and in her few small stumbles, a glimpse of something somber. A tight, dark ball of apprehension. As though she feared eight years of holding her breath, of living her life with a stone in her gut.Eight years later, her blue dress was simpler but not as eager to be appropriate; its sheen, and her edgy hoop earrings, made clear that she was no longer auditioning.Her daughters were grown. She had shielded them and celebrated them, and they appeared in public always picture perfect, as though their careful grooming was a kind of reproach. She had called herself mom-in-chief, and cloaked in that nonthreatening title, had done what she cared about.She embraced veterans and military families, and became their listening advocate. She threw open the White House doors to people on the margins of America. She was working class, and she was Princeton, and so she could speak of opportunity as a tangible thing. Her program Reach Higher pushed high schoolers to go further, to want more. She jumped rope with children on the White House grounds as part of her initiative to combat childhood obesity. She grew a vegetable garden and campaigned for healthier food in schools. She reached across borders and cast her light on the education of girls all over the world. She danced on television shows. She hugged more people than any first lady ever has, and she made \u201cfirst lady\u201d mean a person warmly accessible, a person both normal and inspirational and a person many degrees of cool.She had become an American style icon. Her dresses and workouts. Her carriage and curves. Toned arms and long slender fingers. Even her favored kitten heels, for women who cannot fathom wearing shoes in the halfway house between flats and high heels, have earned a certain respect because of her. No public figure better embodies that mantra of full female selfhood: Wear what you like.It was the 2016 Democratic Convention. Michelle Obama was speaking. She said \u201cblack boy\u201d and \u201cslaves,\u201d words she would not have said eight years ago because eight years ago any concrete gesturing to blackness would have had real consequences.She was relaxed, emotional, sentimental. Her uncertainties laid to rest. Her rhythm was subtler, because she no longer needed it as her armor, because she had conquered.The insults, those barefaced and those adorned as jokes, the acidic scrutiny, the manufactured scandals, the base questioning of legitimacy, the tone of disrespect, so ubiquitous, so casual. She had faced them and sometimes she hurt and sometimes she blinked but throughout she remained herself.Michelle Obama was speaking. I realized then that she hadn\u2019t been waiting to exhale these past eight years. She had been letting that breath out, in small movements, careful because she had to be, but exhaling still.Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the author of the novel \u201cAmericanah\u201d and the book-length essay \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists.\u201d A recipient of a MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d grant, her words have been sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 and, most recently, on clothing from Dior\u2019s spring 2017 collection.Michelle Obama came into my life in stages. I knew that, like her husband, she was a Harvard-educated lawyer, but that unlike him, she had grown up on the South Side of Chicago, with parents who had not gone to college. When Barack Obama was a summer associate at her Chicago law firm, they met because she was his mentor. After his successful campaign for the U.S. Senate, I noticed that she chose not to go to Washington. Instead, he commuted to their home and two daughters in Chicago where Michelle had a big job as head of community affairs for a hospital.But she really entered my imagination once she became first lady, a tall, strong, elegant and seriously smart woman who happened to live in the White House. She managed to convey dignity and humor at the same time, to be a mother of two daughters and insist on regular family dinners, and to take on health issues and a national food industry addicted to unhealthy profits. She did this despite an undertow of bias in this country that subtly questioned everything she did. Was she too strong, physically and intellectually, to be a proper first lady?After a decade under a public microscope, she has managed what no other first lady \u2014 and few people in any public position \u2014 have succeeded in doing: She has lived a public life without sacrificing her privacy and authenticity. She made her husband both more human and effective as a president by being his interpreter and defender, but also someone we knew was capable of being his critic. Eventually, she spoke up about the pain of the racist assumptions directed at her, but she waited until her husband could no longer be politically punished for her honesty. And she has always been the best kind of mother, which means insisting that fathers be equal parents. All of this she has done with honesty, humor and, most important, kindness.Recently, over the course of the Trump-Clinton presidential campaign, Michelle has become one of the most effective public speakers of our time. That\u2019s serious. To be less serious, she has always been a woman who knows the difference between fashion (what outside forces tell you to wear) and style (the way you express a unique self). At one lunch in the White House for women who had been spokespeople and supporters in President Obama\u2019s second campaign, she invited local public school children to sing and perform. Those students, mostly African-American kids, were spirited, talented and at ease in a White House that belongs to them as much as to anyone in this country, yet they wouldn\u2019t have been there without Michelle.What will she choose to do next? That\u2019s up to her. She could do anything, from becoming a U.S. senator from Illinois to campaigning for the safety and education of girls globally. She could also choose to lead a private life. Whatever she decides, I trust her judgment.Though I\u2019m old enough to remember Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White House \u2014 and all the couples and families since \u2014 I have never seen such balance and equal parenting, such love, respect, mutuality and pleasure in each other\u2019s company. We will never have a democracy until we have democratic families and a society without the invented categories of both race and gender. Michelle Obama may have changed history in the most powerful way \u2014 by example.Gloria Steinem, a feminist activist and writer, has been touring America, campaigning for Hillary Clinton and promoting the paperback edition of her travelogue \u201cMy Life on the Road.\u201dOn a lovely early autumn day in her final October in the White House, Michelle Obama stepped out onto a sunny South Lawn and, in a way, bid farewell. The setting was her celebrated organic kitchen garden, but the subtext seemed to go far beyond any single initiative. \u201cI have to tell you that being here with all of you, overlooking this beautiful garden \u2014 and it is beautiful \u2014 it\u2019s kind of an emotional moment,\u201d Mrs. Obama said at a ceremony to unveil a bigger, fortified version of the garden. \u201cWe\u2019re having a lot of these emotional moments because everything is the last. But this is particularly my baby, because this garden is where it all started. So we\u2019re really coming full circle back to the very beginning.\u201d She recalled conversations in 2008 about the role she might play in an Obama presidency \u2014 and noted, tellingly, that the garden emerged after \u201cBarack actually won,\u201d to which she added: \u201cHe won twice.\u201d The gathered guests happily applauded.There, in a way, was the essential Michelle Obama, or at least the essential observable version of herself: speaking of broad public good (the garden, which was part of her campaign against childhood obesity) while revealing an arch sense of competitiveness. My husband won; he won twice. As their history-making time in the White House comes to an end, it\u2019s worth pondering the lessons of the Age of Obama. My own view is that both the president and the first lady have conducted themselves splendidly in the White House, managing the most difficult of tasks with apparent ease: projecting a grace that masked the ambition and the drive that took them, at early ages, to the pinnacle of American life.In this they have kept faith with a tradition that, in our country, is as old as George Washington, who embodied the classical ideal of Cincinnatus, the reluctant leader summoned from his plow to lead the nation. President Obama gets much of the public credit for handling his eight years coolly, but the first lady has been a critical element of his success. She has chosen her shots carefully \u2014 not least in choosing to make the case against Donald Trump on the campaign trail in 2016 \u2014 and is leaving the country with a warm impression of an excellent mother, a steady spouse and a sensible, devoted American.Not everyone agrees, of course; not everyone ever does. The Obama skeptics and the Obama haters have from time to time questioned her patriotism, but this is the same country that managed, in some quarters, to hold Eleanor Roosevelt in contempt. The important thing is that Mrs. Obama, a clear-eyed lawyer, found a way to withstand the scrutiny of the spotlight. In point of fact, she did more than withstand it. To borrow a phrase from William Faulkner, she not only endured it; she prevailed over it.How? By finding, or appearing to find, that most elusive of things in the modern world: balance. She was not Mrs. Roosevelt or Mrs. Carter or Mrs. Reagan or Mrs. Clinton, playing roles in affairs of state. Instead she did what the first African-American first lady arguably had to do to play a successful public role. In Voltaire\u2019s terms, she cultivated her own garden, never threatening and never intimidating her neighbors. Much more doubtless unfolded beneath the surface or behind closed doors; history will sort that out. For now, it is enough to say that she is leaving the White House a strong and popular figure with a lifetime of good will and great reservoirs of capital on which to draw as she and her husband write their next chapters.Back in 2008, musing on the life she was about to enter, Mrs. Obama recalled doubts about her garden \u2014 a bit of projection, one suspects, for doubts about the entire presidential enterprise. \u201cWhat if we planted this garden and nothing grew?\u201d Mrs. Obama asked. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about the soil, or the sunlight. And it\u2019s like, oh, my God, what if nothing grows? \u2026 It was like afterwards I remember telling Sam [Kass, the former White House senior advisor for nutrition], \u2018This better work, buddy. This better work.\u2019\u201d And so it did.Jon Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, is the author, most recently, of \u201cDestiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.\u201dThe first time I met Michelle Obama was at the White House as part of a mentoring initiative, for which the first lady had brought together a dynamic group of women to speak to urban teenage girls about their career goals. Olympians, actresses, producers, writers, an astronaut and an Air Force general gathered in the West Wing to greet Michelle before we headed out to various local schools. She was warm, gracious and charming. She thanked us for coming, hugged everybody and made us all feel like her friends. As first lady, she has ticked all the boxes: loving wife, protective mother, health and fitness advocate, garden enthusiast and, yes, style icon. These accomplishments have left traditionalists feeling satisfied.But, as is always the way, her reputation as the perfect hostess invited criticism from progressives. Enter Michelle Obama, outspoken activist, a woman who isn\u2019t afraid to remind us she is a proud African-American woman, which is, in itself, revolutionary. A former lawyer who speaks out on behalf of gay rights and gun control, she delivered an unforgettable speech at the Democratic National Convention earlier this year, shining a clear, bright light on our country\u2019s shameful history. Suddenly, the progressives were pleased and the traditionalists were confused. The media wants to pin her down \u2014 they\u2019ve been trying since Barack Obama took office in 2009. But you simply can\u2019t.Michelle Obama embodies the modern, American woman, and I don\u2019t mean that in any platitudinous or vague way. Rarely can someone express their many identities at the same time while seeming authentic. My female friends and I often talk about feeling like we\u2019re \u201ctoo much.\u201d We\u2019re complicated; we want to be so many things. I want to be a boss and also be vulnerable. I want to be outspoken and respected, but also sexy and beautiful.All women struggle to reconcile the different people that we are at all times, to merge our conflicting desires, to represent ourselves honestly and feel good about the inherent contradictions. But Michelle manages to do this with poise, regardless of the scrutiny. That, to me, is the best thing for feminism. Her individual choices force us to accept that being a woman isn\u2019t just one thing. Or two things. Or three things. The position of first lady is, unfortunately, symbolic, and that makes it fair game for media analysis ad nauseam. But no think piece can fully encompass a real woman.If feminism\u2019s goal is equal opportunity and choice, Michelle makes me feel like every choice is available. You can go to Princeton and Harvard, you can rap with Missy Elliott, you can be a mother and a lawyer and a powerful orator. You can champion the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, while also caring about fashion. You can dance with Ellen and also fearlessly remind people, on live television, of the reality of your position: \u201cI wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent, black young women, playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.\u201d You can be your husband\u2019s partner and supporter, and also use your cultural and political capital to campaign for Hillary Clinton, unflinchingly standing up to her \u201clocker room talk\u201d-ing bully of an opponent with the battle cry \u201cenough is enough!\u201d \u2014 eloquently putting into words what a lot of people, myself included, had been feeling.Michelle Obama will have her own legacy, separate from her husband\u2019s. And it will be that she was the first first lady to show women that they don\u2019t have to choose. That it\u2019s okay to be everything.Rashida Jones is a writer, actress and producer who stars in the TBS comedy series \u201cAngie Tribeca,\u201d and most recently co-wrote an episode of \u201cBlack Mirror,\u201d premiering later this month on Netflix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much Is It Worth to Hold Your Newborn? $40, Apparently", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byAfter holding his newborn son for the first time at a Utah hospital last month, a man found a strange charge on his bill: $39.35.But the story quickly gained steam: As of Wednesday, it had prompted over 11,600 comments from other users since being posted Monday evening and vaulted high up on the internet\u2019s \u201cfront page,\u201d (as Reddit calls itself) by more than 6,000 upvotes.The Reddit post touched a nerve with people because it seemed to underscore a national frustration with unexpected hospital fees and arcane medical billing.Mr. Grassley, 37, of Spanish Fork, Utah, wrote that his son was born on Sept. 4. While his wife, (whose name Mr. Grassley has not revealed) was delivering the baby, he was asked if they would like to hold their newborn after the procedure at Utah Valley Hospital in Provo.Mr. Grassley held his son between his wife\u2019s neck and chest, while a nurse took pictures. For this, the description on the bill seemed to suggest, he was charged the fee. (It\u2019s about the price of a four-month subscription to Netflix.)Ms. Frank said that the charge was incurred because an extra nurse was needed in the operating room while Mr. Grassley and his wife held their newborn son and that the nurse was necessary to ensure that \u201cboth mom and baby remain safe.\u201d\u201cOnly in the case of a C-section birth is an additional nurse brought into the operating room,\u201d the statement said.Once Mr. Grassley saw that the Reddit thread was gaining momentum, he clarified that he and his wife knew the cost for the delivery would be steep. The total charges listed on the bill, including the C-section, came to $13,280.49 before payments and adjustments.\u201cWe knew what we were signing up for and have some money saved up,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cEveryone involved in the process was great, and we had a positive experience. We just got a chuckle out of seeing that on the bill.\u201dOf course, not everyone is financially prepared to deal with exorbitant costs, which helps explain why the post prompted such attention. The Reddit thread that Mr. Grassley started was filled with horror stories about medical fees and the comparative ease of paying them in other countries.This means the federal government does not set rates for items like skin-to-skin contact or for summoning an additional nurse to the operating room after a C-section.Prices for patients with private insurance or those paying out of pocket are generally set by the hospitals. Tom Hudachko, a spokesman for Utah\u2019s department of health, said the state does not \u201chave any rate-setting authority on any plans outside of Medicaid.\u201dMs. Frank, the hospital spokeswoman, would not initially say whether the hospital itself had set the price for the nurse that Mr. Grassley was charged for.But after repeated inquiries, Ms. Frank confirmed by email that the hospital did set the charge, which was determined as \u201ca function of nursing time.\u201d\u201cWe are actively evaluating how better to define the service as it appears on a patient\u2019s bill,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

(No further comment.)Pace yourself, though: This is very much the same disorienting, relentless series, touching on techno-cultural themes \u2014 hacking, social-media mobs, drones, the narcotic allure of nostalgia \u2014 in stories that are both dreamily speculative and of-the-moment.As before, there\u2019s no theme music, no narrator to escort you into its clean dystopias. (Each episode imagines a different alternative reality, but they share a minimalist high-design aesthetic \u2014 what your nightmares would look like if they were art-directed by Apple\u2019s Jonathan Ive.) \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d buzzes onto your screen like a malware attack, dropping you in media res and leaving you, blinking, to figure out the rules. You don\u2019t watch an episode so much as get abducted into it.But the bigger canvas and larger episode order give Mr. Brooker more room to play with genre and tone. The feature-length crime procedural episode \u201cHated in the Nation,\u201d in which a London detective (Kelly Macdonald, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d) investigates a deadly online-outrage campaign, uncomfortably compares crowd-sourced justice with state surveillance. (\u201cHated\u201d is the season finale, though you can watch the self-contained episodes in any order.)\u201cNosedive\u201d \u2014 by Rashida Jones and Michael Schur from a story by Mr. Brooker \u2014 is a tart satire set in a society where social-media ratings hold totalitarian sway. It stars Bryce Dallas Howard, whose neurotic monitoring of her personal ranking will ring familiar to anyone who can\u2019t stop checking their Instagram feed for hearts. \u201cPlaytest,\u201d about an immersive augmented-reality game, feels like a digital-culture version of an \u201cX-Files\u201d horror lark.The best of the new batch, \u201cSan Junipero,\u201d is also the biggest departure. First, because it deposits its lead characters, played by Mackenzie Davis and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, in the past, 1987 to be precise. (I\u2019ll say no more, except that, per usual, the story takes more than one unexpected turn.) Second, because it\u2019s bittersweet and moving \u2014 even hopeful \u2014 rather than horrific.When the season goes dark, however, it goes very dark, as in \u201cMen Against Fire,\u201d a Rod Serling-esque parable about war and dehumanization, and \u201cShut Up and Dance,\u201d about a man who falls prey to online blackmail.That latter, while suitably ghastly, touches on themes of cruelty and vigilantism that earlier episodes, like \u201cWhite Bear,\u201d have treated better. More episodes, it seems, means a little more chaff. Typical of the Netflix large-portions ethos, a few new episodes are too long, and feel diluted compared with the lapidary early seasons.Still, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d hasn\u2019t lost its currency. Its title refers to the glass screens of computers, tablets and phones, but the machines are not the danger here: it\u2019s the anonymous, antiseptic monstrousness they can empower. The brilliance of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is that it\u2019s not about how technology imperils our humanity. It\u2019s about the all-too-human faces reflected in our own black mirrors, staring back at us.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Code Names and Covert Meetings in AT&T\u2019s Courtship of Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported bySoon after the wheels of the Time Warner private jet touched down at Dallas Love Field airport on Oct. 11, the media titan\u2019s chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, and his top lieutenants cautiously made their way to the meeting room of a nearby hangar.The temperature that morning was already rising through the 70s. The high metallic ceiling of the hangar and the roar of jet engines outside made for a very different setting than a conference room in the glass aeries of Manhattan. But the executives did not plan on staying long.Their meeting with Randall L. Stephenson, the chief executive of the Dallas-based AT&T, and a handful of other executives, was intended to be the final blessing to an informal courtship that had begun in August.Within hours, the two chief executives shook hands on the outlines of a deal, including a rough idea of what such a transaction would cost. The Time Warner jet then headed back to New York, with the hard work of deal making about to pick up in earnest.Eleven days later, the two companies announced an $85.4 billion merger that could reshape the media world.This account is based on interviews with multiple executives involved in the deal, some of whom were not authorized to speak publicly about the confidential negotiations.The companies had moved quietly to construct AT&T\u2019s takeover of Time Warner, relying only on top management teams and trusted advisers. Until late last week, they avoided having word seep out, and ended up announcing the acquisition just one day ahead of schedule.The secrecy \u2014 including code names and covert meetings in Washington and Nashville \u2014 was viewed as essential. Putting together AT&T, one of the country\u2019s most powerful internet providers, with Time Warner, home of HBO and Warner Bros., would be sure to raise concerns among lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups.Skepticism has since arisen from shareholders as well. Shares of Time Warner closed down 3 percent on Monday, at $86.74 \u2014 more than 19 percent off the deal\u2019s price tag of $107.50.Executives at both companies sought to reassure investors that the deal made strategic and financial sense despite its huge cost, and that it was likely to pass regulatory muster.Some industry analysts weren\u2019t so sure. \u201cVertically challenged,\u201d was the headline on a research note by the analyst Craig Moffett, a play on the term \u201cvertical integration,\u201d where a company combines with a customer, rather than a competitor. Nomura said the deal was \u201cpuzzling.\u201dMorgan Stanley analysts, however, called the deal a \u201cbold step,\u201d wondering whether the companies were \u201cswinging for the fences.\u201dYet for Mr. Stephenson of AT&T, the logic of buying Time Warner had been apparent for some time. The laconic Oklahoma native, who has spearheaded billions of dollars\u2019 worth of deals for the telecom colossus, famously maintains a lengthy list of potential acquisitions. And Time Warner \u2014 whose \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d series and Batman movies could become a cornerstone of a new media strategy at his company \u2014 was on it.Mr. Stephenson had already discussed the attractiveness of Time Warner with Peter Chernin, a veteran Hollywood mogul and a partner to AT&T in an online media venture, at a dinner on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in early August. Later, Mr. Chernin had breakfast with Gary L. Ginsberg, a top lieutenant to Mr. Bewkes, asking if the Time Warner chief would be up for meeting with his AT&T counterpart.On Aug. 25, Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes met for lunch at Time Warner\u2019s glass-and-steel complex overlooking Central Park, both men said in an interview on Sunday. The two had known each other for years and had sought to catch up on how their businesses were transforming in an age of cord-cutting and Netflix. The topic of a Time Warner takeover arose, and by the end of lunch both men walked away clear about AT&T\u2019s intentions.Over the next several days, AT&T and Time Warner began assembling their teams, careful to keep them tight to avoid leaks.AT&T turned to advisers including the investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Arnold & Porter. Time Warner looked to the bank Allen & Company and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore.Only a few top executives at each company \u2014 principally their chief financial officers, deal-making chiefs and general counsels \u2014 were brought into the project, code-named \u201cBobtail.\u201dAT&T was henceforth \u201cLily,\u201d named after the cheery sales representative in the company\u2019s latest ad campaign, while Time Warner was \u201cRabbit,\u201d a nod to Warner Bros.\u2019 Bugs Bunny.The next week, the senior executives huddled in a conference room in Arnold & Porter\u2019s Washington offices to get to know one another and begin sharing information.The teams were so tight that even the heads of HBO, Warner Bros. and Turner were kept in the dark. As a result, Time Warner executives had to be discreet in pulling together information about each business.The deal teams quietly labored in multiple cities, including New York and Dallas, as well as Nashville, a neutral location chosen specifically because it was thought that no one there would recognize AT&T or Time Warner executives.Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes kept in touch, including at another lunch at Cravath\u2019s Manhattan offices in late September. By the time that Mr. Bewkes\u2019s plane touched down in Dallas, board members at both companies were informed of the talks.Despite the complexity of a deal of this size, the negotiations were helped by the shared vision and complementary temperaments of the two chief executives. Time Warner\u2019s primary concern was price, especially since the conglomerate had turned down an $85-a-share takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox two years earlier.Of less concern was the prospect of government regulators\u2019 busting up the deal, as they did five years ago when AT&T sought to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion. The negotiating teams set the fee payable to Time Warner if the deal was blocked on antitrust grounds at just $500 million, well below the norms for a takeover of this size.AT&T executives and advisers also professed little worry about an interloper emerging with a rival bid. Still, if a competitor successfully wrested Time Warner away, the telecommunications company would receive a handsome $1.725 billion breakup fee for its trouble.So quickly had the talks deepened that by the week of Oct. 10, more banks were brought in, in large part to help arrange the financing for the takeover. AT&T enlisted JPMorgan Chase, a longtime lender, while Time Warner brought in familiar faces at Citigroup and then Morgan Stanley. Bank of America joined AT&T\u2019s team just last Thursday.That evening, Mr. Bewkes finally informed the heads of HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. The Time Warner chief spoke with Richard Plepler of HBO and Kevin Tsujihara of Warner Bros. before reaching John Martin, Turner\u2019s chief executive, who was in London.The offer from AT&T promised a healthy 35 percent premium over Time Warner\u2019s share price before the news report.But much of the Time Warner leadership team had also lived through the company\u2019s disastrous merger with AOL at the peak of the dot-com bubble. For one executive, the first reaction was: Do I want to go through a mega-merger again?Most major details had been completed by then, and the two companies\u2019 boards met \u2014 AT&T\u2019s in Dallas, Time Warner\u2019s in Manhattan \u2014 for a final vote.Much work must still be done if the deal is to close by the end of next year as scheduled, including a review by government regulators.Nevertheless, Mr. Stephenson has already begun a tour of the businesses that he may oversee by 2018, including a lunch with Mr. Martin of Turner at the Time Warner Center and a visit with Mr. Plepler at HBO\u2019s offices overlooking Bryant Park.He then boarded a plane to Los Angeles to meet with Mr. Tsujihara on Tuesday.Leslie Picker contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Last Growl for F.C.C.\u2019s Sharp-Toothed Watchdog", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byBut after days on the job, Mr. Wheeler quashed the idea that he would look favorably on his past employers. In a meeting at the F.C.C. with the heads of telecommunications, cable and technology lobbying groups, he held up a newspaper article quoting industry executives publicly calling for weaker oversight from the regulatory agency.\u201cThis is a rough way to begin a relationship,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said, according to one lobbyist at the gathering, which was confirmed by the F.C.C. It turned out that the chairman had big regulations in mind for those industries instead.Yet some say that even if Mr. Wheeler does not directly review the deal, his regulations have created new restrictions for AT&T and other broadband companies at a time when they are trying to find new growth beyond their internet businesses.Now nearly all of these moves have created more challenges for cable and telecom companies such as AT&T. Many of those companies say Mr. Wheeler\u2019s regulations have favored tech companies like Netflix and Google over them.At AT&T, James W. Cicconi, the recently retired head of lobbying, once called Mr. Wheeler an \u201cinspired\u201d choice. But in an interview last month on C-Span, Mr. Cicconi said AT&T was investing more in Mexico right now because \u201cit is, frankly, a better regulatory environment\u201d than in the United States.Even some tech companies that have benefited from the new regulations said Mr. Wheeler had injected the government too deeply into the free market.The F.C.C. has \u201coverreached,\u201d Barry Diller, chairman of the internet holding company IAC/InterActiveCorp, said at a conference this month. Mr. Diller supported the net neutrality rules passed last year but said that Mr. Wheeler had been \u201canti-cable\u201d and that reclassification of broadband was a \u201ccrazy overreach.\u201dMr. Wheeler, 70, said consumers needed greater government protection as the nation makes a transition to smartphones and streaming services from landline phones and television. His job, he has said, is to encourage nascent technologies and protect them from powerful incumbents that may want to block their success.\u201cInstitutions such as the F.C.C. are the point where the diverse interests of consumers and business converge in an effort to decide how society will deal with those changes,\u201d he said in a statement.Mr. Wheeler declined to comment on AT&T\u2019s proposed purchase of Time Warner. AT&T declined to comment on the F.C.C., and Time Warner didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Aides and friends said Mr. Wheeler\u2019s actions in tightening the regulatory landscape around cable and telecom firms were not surprising. He has always fought incumbent communications providers, they said: first against broadcasters as the head of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association from 1979 to 1984; and then against telephone companies as the head of CTIA-The Wireless Association from 1992 to 2004.By the time he was a venture capitalist in the mid-2000s, cable and wireless were the powerful incumbents, and he saw their grip on access to the internet as a threat to the web.At the F.C.C., Mr. Wheeler became even more strong-handed. He was publicly criticized by the late-night television host John Oliver, and protesters sat in the driveway at his home, after he released weaker early versions of net neutrality rules. The F.C.C. was flooded with millions of comments protesting the rules.President Obama, who in late 2014 posted a video message in favor of treating broadband more like a utility, was crucial to the change. Mr. Obama weighed in again early this year to support rules on set-top boxes that would require cable and satellite companies to share programming with third-party device makers and free consumers from cable box rentals.Mr. Wheeler\u2019s friendship with the president began when Mr. Obama was a junior senator in 2006 and called him to learn more about tech and telecom issues. Mr. Wheeler and his wife moved temporarily to Iowa in 2007 to campaign for Mr. Obama, and the couple became fund-raisers, collecting $700,000 for the candidate. The relationship led Mr. Wheeler into government.Now some lawmakers say Mr. Obama\u2019s comments on F.C.C. issues are examples of coordination between the White House and an independent agency. Republican leaders in Congress have called for investigations, threatened to take away F.C.C. funding and urged laws to limit the agency\u2019s abilities.\u201cFor the president to tout the achievements of the F.C.C. is a new dynamic in politics,\u201d said Richard Bennett, the head of the policy website High Tech Forum.The F.C.C. said that the White House did not drive the decision to pursue broadband reclassification or set-top box reforms and that Mr. Obama\u2019s support in both cases came months after the agency had agreed to draft rules.\u201cChairman Wheeler welcomed the president\u2019s point of view, as he welcomed the nearly four million Americans who made their views known during the proceeding\u201d for broadband reclassification, the F.C.C. said in a statement.The most effusive supporters of Mr. Wheeler are now the most bitter.Michael Powell, president of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, who at one point called Mr. Wheeler an \u201cexceptional\u201d choice as F.C.C. chairman, said in a speech in May that the cable and telecom industry had faced a \u201crelentless regulatory assault.\u201d Mr. Powell, whose group was recently renamed N.C.T.A.-The Internet & Television Association, declined to comment further.Yet while Mr. Wheeler has lost early supporters, he has won some former critics.\u201cThis is a guy I fought in the 1980s and 1990s who was Mr. Deregulator,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group instrumental in child online privacy rules. \u201cTalk about a conversion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "CenturyLink, a Network Provider, to Acquire Level 3, a Rival", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byTo those familiar with the telecommunications industry, the deal announced between CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications on Monday was not really a surprise. Both companies provide communications and services like data, voice and video transmission for large enterprises and each is trying to scrape away market share from rivals AT&T and Verizon.CenturyLink\u2019s investors were not quite convinced that acquiring Level 3 was the ticket to turn around the company\u2019s recent misfortunes, including competitive pressures from larger cable providers. Shares of CenturyLink fell 12.5 percent on Monday, while shares of Level 3 were up 3.9 percent.Based on the closing price of CenturyLink\u2019s shares from Friday, this represents a price of about $69.92 a share. Including Level 3\u2019s $10.9 billion in debt, the transaction amounts to about $36 billion. That represents a premium of almost 50 percent from Level 3\u2019s share price last Wednesday before reports surfaced of a potential deal.CenturyLink\u2019s shareholders will own 51 percent of the combined company, while Level 3\u2019s will hold the rest.\u201cThis transaction furthers our commitment to providing our customers with the network to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses,\u201d Glen F. Post III, CenturyLink\u2019s chief executive and president, said in a statement. \u201cIt is this focus on providing fiber connectivity that will continue to distinguish CenturyLink from our competitors.\u201d Mr. Post will continue to serve in his executive role of the combined company.The transaction would significantly lower CenturyLink\u2019s tax expense over the next few years. Level 3 has almost $10 billion of so-called net operating losses, a tax relief generated from periods of unprofitability.The companies also plan to achieve about $975 million a year in cost savings by eliminating duplications and improving operations, the companies said in the statement.The combined company would be based in Monroe, where CenturyLink was founded in 1968. However, they plan to keep a \u201csignificant presence\u201d in the Denver area, where Level 3 has its headquarters.CenturyLink has received financing commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley for $10.2 billion.The companies expect to complete the transaction by the end of September 2017, subject to approvals by the Federal Communications Commission, certain states and the majority of both companies\u2019 shareholders. STT Crossing, a subsidiary of ST Telemedia, which holds 18 percent of Level 3\u2019s outstanding shares, has pledged to vote in favor of the transaction.Bank of America and Morgan Stanley gave financial advice to CenturyLink, while Citigroup advised Level 3, with Lazard providing a fairness opinion. Evercore gave a fairness opinion to CenturyLink. The law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Jones Walker worked with CenturyLink, while Willkie Farr & Gallagher advised Level 3. Latham & Watkins and Credit Suisse advised ST Telemedia.An earlier version of this article misidentified the company being advised by Willkie Farr & Gallagher.

{"Headline": "Amazon Comes Up Short on Profits, Focusing on Warehouses and Movies", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported bySo after months of exuberance that pushed Amazon\u2019s shares to new highs, investors took a break, sending the company\u2019s stock down more than 5 percent after it reported its latest financial results.Amazon had warned investors not to get too comfortable with its record run of profits, promising last quarter that big increases on warehouse spending would come in the second half of the year so it can handle what it expects to be a crush of holiday orders. It is also cranking out more original video productions like \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d and \u201cTransparent,\u201d to turn its Prime membership service into an attractive alternative to Netflix.Analysts took those warnings with a Himalayan-size heap of salt. They had heard such talk from the company before about increasing investments, only to see Amazon later deliver bigger-than-expected profits. Surely, Amazon was just sandbagging again.\u201cThey said something similar about last quarter and crushed it,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cI think people expected they would do that again.\u201dInstead, Amazon reported a profit of $252 million, or 52 cents a share, for the third quarter, well below the 78 cents a share average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.That figure still represented more than three times the $79 million profit it reported in the same period last year, and Amazon\u2019s corresponding operating income of $575 million was at the high end of the range that the company had previously forecast.Revenue grew 29 percent to $32.7 billion, slightly above what analysts forecast at $32.69 billion.Amazon\u2019s biggest quarter is now coming up \u2014 the end-of-year season when shoppers go wild for presents and have increasingly turned to the e-commerce giant to buy them.But Amazon\u2019s forecast for the quarter was worrisome to some analysts. The company told them to expect as much as $1.25 billion in operating income for the fourth quarter and as little as nothing, a remarkably wide range. Amazon projected that revenue would increase in a range of 17 to 27 percent over a year ago.\u201cI think the big concern here is Amazon moving into another big, deep investment cycle,\u201d said Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities.Asked about the gap between Amazon\u2019s results in the third quarter and expectations, Brian Olsavsky, the chief financial officer of Amazon, said, in effect, we told you so.In a conference call, he said Amazon opened 18 fulfillment centers during the quarter, triple the normal rate. It will double its spending on video content production and marketing during the second half of the year compared with the same period last year.\u201cIt was built into the guidance,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "AT&T and Time Warner Seek to Mollify Deal\u2019s Critics", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byAT&T\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has no shortage of skeptics.First, there are the analysts.\u201cVertically challenged,\u201d was the headline from a research note by Craig Moffett, a play on the term \u201cvertical integration,\u201d where a company combines with its customer, rather than competitor.Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a \u201cbold step,\u201d wondering whether the companies were \u201cswinging for the fences.\u201d Nomura said the deal was \u201cpuzzling.\u201dThen, there are the investors.At midday on Monday, shares of Time Warner, the recipient of by all accounts a rich offer from AT&T, were down more than 2 percent, nearly 20 percent off the deal\u2019s price tag. AT&T\u2019s shareholders did not seem too thrilled either \u2014 its shares were off nearly 2 percent.The question for the market is whether it makes sense for a cable and wireless provider to spend all of that money to acquire the home of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros.On a conference call with analysts on Monday, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, and his Time Warner counterpart, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, sought to address some of their biggest criticisms:During the hourlong call, a form of the word \u201cinnovate\u201d was used 32 times. The two chief executives believe combining their companies will help them innovate around advertising, the shows and movies people watch and where they watch them (hint: on their cellphones).Innovation, of course is not a strategy. It is something that every top executive is focused on, with or without a deal.There is one aspect to this deal that could help the two companies foster such innovation: data. AT&T has access to 133 million mobile subscribers, as well as 25 million for video. Owning the content that its users are watching will give the company better insight on how to focus on their customers through both programming and advertising, the executives argued.One analyst asked why the combination of cable and content made sense now, despite Mr. Bewkes\u2019s decision to spin off Time Warner Cable in 2009. Mr. Bewkes responded by saying, \u201cThe world has changed,\u201d citing new competition from companies like Netflix, Google, Facebook and Amazon.Over the weekend, politicians from across the political spectrum came out against the deal. Both Democrats and Republicans argued that too much consolidation between telecommunications and media could only be bad for consumers.On the call, Mr. Bewkes argued that consumers would not feel the effect of this transaction, that the cost would be \u201cborne by advertisers and consumers get a break.\u201dWhen asked about what gave him comfort on the regulatory approval process, Mr. Stephenson joked, \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but once Time Warner closes, I\u2019ll play one on TV.\u201dHis non-lawyerly take, however, focused on the fact that the companies are proposing a vertical merger. Most of the pushback lately from the Justice Department has been on companies that were taking out competitors. Because Time Warner supplies programming for AT&T, their deal would not get that same type of scrutiny.\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not sure I know of a situation where vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our two sectors,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Vertical integration may help the two companies on the regulatory front, but it does not get them far from a cost-savings standpoint. The companies pegged so-called synergies at $1 billion in annual run rate, within three years of the deal closing.That figure is small for a deal this size because there is little duplication by which to cut costs. The customer service representatives at AT&T cannot also anchor the news on CNN, for example.Analysts have been dubious of AT&T\u2019s ability to integrate another huge acquisition after closing on a $48.5 billion takeover of DirecTV last year. Why do another large acquisition now, they asked? Mr. Stephenson said that AT&T was ahead of schedule in achieving cost synergies from the DirecTV deal and that \u201cthe convergence of media and distribution is moving fast.\u201d\u201cWe want to be at the front of it.

These defects, he and his colleagues felt, especially obscured the work of his lead actor, Suraj Sharma.\u201cThere\u2019s so much motion blur in his face that you start to lose his performance,\u201d said Tim Squyres, who has edited most of Mr. Lee\u2019s films, including \u201cLife of Pi.\u201d\u201cWe did a bunch of things to try to compensate for that,\u201d Mr. Squyres said, \u201cbut it was unpleasant to look at.\u201dMr. Lee hoped to fix this problem on future movies by shooting at a higher frame rate, a technique that eliminates strobe-like flicker. For a planned film about Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier\u2019s \u201cThrilla in Manila\u201d boxing match in 1975, he shot test footage at 48 and 60 frames per second that he felt was satisfactory.But when that project stalled \u2014 Mr. Lee vowed that he will still make it \u2014 he moved on to \u201cBilly Lynn,\u201d adopting an even higher frame rate. \u201cI want to be more daring,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to see what happens.\u201dMr. Lee said Mr. Jackson was \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d with those films. But rather than make \u201ca fairy tale,\u201d Mr. Lee said, it was more logical to him to apply this technology to \u201ca realistic drama \u2014 I think that\u2019s a more likely experiment, so to speak.\u201dIn particular, he said, the technology seemed well-suited to \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d because it is about the shifting perspective of its title character (played by the newcomer Joe Alwyn) in starkly different but intense situations: life-or-death combat in Iraq; an overwhelming Destiny\u2019s Child concert in a cavernous stadium; a face-to-face confrontation with a ruthless N.F.L. team owner (Steve Martin).Mr. Alwyn said that even though he\u2019d never made a feature film before, \u201cI could tell this was strange.\u201d\u201cThe cameras were absolutely huge,\u201d Mr. Alwyn said. \u201cBecause of how intimate Ang wanted the shots \u2014 so close to the faces \u2014 you would be performing to the black-matte box around the camera, rather than being able to see the other actors. Oftentimes, you\u2019d just be following bits and pieces of tape, moving around a black space, and delivering your lines to that.\u201d\u201cThat took some getting used to,\u201d he added.For Mr. Lee, the hardest part of the shoot was not a war sequence or the halftime show but the task of filming Mr. Martin in extreme close-up for his verbal face-off with Mr. Alwyn.\u201cI\u2019m pretty good with bigger sequences \u2014 it\u2019s just work, you knock off the shots,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cNo matter how complicated things are, nothing\u2019s more complicated than reading a human face, especially with this clarity.\u201dTom Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s motion picture group, said the studio\u2019s reasons for making this film were \u201cboth simple and complex.\u201d\u201cIn its simplest form, Ang is one of the great visionaries of our business,\u201d said Mr. Rothman, who, as chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, oversaw \u201cLife of Pi.\u201dIn the longer term, Mr. Rothman said that studios need to support filmmakers like Mr. Lee who will keep their business at the forefront of innovation at a time of overwhelming competition from other media.\u201cThey need to dream, and we need to dare,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause, hey, if we just sit here, it\u2019ll be Netflix and chill instead of dinner and a movie. We\u2019ll see what happens in the world, but I know Netflix can\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cBilly Lynn\u201d is being released in a variety of 2-D and 3-D formats, and Mr. Rothman declined to specify how many theaters would show it at its highest resolution and maximum frame rate. But he said that \u201calmost every proper upscale multiplex, worldwide, is fully capable of showing the film.\u201dMr. Squyres could not say for certain why Mr. Lee, of all filmmakers, would emerge as a leader in technological revolution in cinema. \u201cAng is one of the least technical people I know,\u201d he said. \u201cHe only got email a couple of years ago. What has pushed him is not his love of technology for technology\u2019s sake \u2014 it\u2019s his interest in what it can do.\u201dThe kinds of stories he wants to tell are about \u201cpeople taking responsibility, coming to accept who they are,\u201d Mr. Squyres said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of repressed emotions in his films.\u201dA few weeks earlier, Mr. Lee said, he and his wife had used some free time to go hiking in Maine, where he fell from some rocks and hurt himself.So, Mr. Lee said, \u201cwork is safer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.So why mascots?Well, I watch sporting events, and it occurred to me that it was an interesting idea that people are performing but they\u2019re hidden. In a normal scenario with actors, you might say there\u2019s some narcissism in terms of people being seen. But in this case, people are wearing a big bear head and working hard. But then they take that off, and no one knows who they are. So what\u2019s happening inside is a curious dynamic.Did you meet any real-life mascots during your research?Oh, yes. I knew Dave Raymond, who was the original Phillie Phanatic. The man who played the Oregon Duck was one of our expert helpers on the film. Some teams, like [the University of California] Santa Cruz Banana Slugs, have a sense of humor. But there are a lot of bears and lions and tigers because they\u2019re supposed to be ferocious. In England, they revere the hedgehog. It\u2019s not menacing in any way.Your films typically focus on unusual endeavors. Are you a member of any \u2014\u2014Secret societies? Of course, if I was, could I tell you? I\u2019m a fly fisherman. I make flies. They\u2019re imitations of insects at different stages in their development. And my character did that in \u201cBest in Show.\u201dYour films are improvised rather than scripted. How does that work?This is the hardest thing to describe. Jim Piddock and I wrote an outline, about 25 pages. There is a document that has the back histories of every single character, where they went to school, their upbringing, everything about them. What\u2019s not written is any dialogue. And there\u2019s no rehearsal. But the actors know what happens in every single scene. This is more rigid than you can imagine. It takes longer to lay this out than to write a conventional screenplay.Did the actors perform mascot routines?[Sid the Hedgehog on the] ladder was a clown, and I don\u2019t mean a clown that was scaring people in the woods or whatever the hell that is. The Fist was a stuntman rollerblading. And there was a dancer in the Armadillo.You resurrected Corky St. Clair from \u201cWaiting for Guffman.\u201dIt was a whim. I just thought, Wouldn\u2019t it be weird if he pops in, especially in the Parker Posey scene? Because obviously it\u2019s the same actress, but it\u2019s a different character. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.I know you detest the word \u201cmockumentary.\u201d I do, and you\u2019ve said it.An interview last Sunday with Christopher Guest about his new Netflix film, \u201cMascots,\u201d misidentified the character that appears on a ladder in a scene.

Titus is the roommate of the titular Kimmy, who recently escaped from a small-time cult leader who held her in an underground bunker.In real life, Mr. Burgess is still hilarious but more thoughtful, an actor, singer and Broadway star who recently became the first person to receive the Voice and Visibility Award from NewFest, an LGBT film festival in New York. In a recent interview, which has been condensed and edited, he talked about LGBT characters on television, his plans for the future and Donald Trump.Who are your biggest inspirations, onscreen and off?It\u2019s gonna sound so cliched, but Meryl Streep, she\u2019s just in a class all by herself. She disappears into roles and there\u2019s no trace of who she is as Meryl.Offscreen, I think I\u2019d probably say Tina Fey. I know that sounds calculated, but it\u2019s the truth. The last three years I\u2019ve had close-up seats to watch all the stuff that she juggles, and she does it with grace and poise and a heightened sensibility of what\u2019s going on at all times.It\u2019s inspiring. Females are strong as hell.Titus Andromedon has helped break some boundaries for LGBT characters on television \u2014 what boundaries still remain?One of the boundaries that needs to be broken is for us not to need a special award for these characters. The fact that we have to highlight them and to create a reason for them to be celebrated means that we have not been successful at explaining to the world that there\u2019s nothing abnormal about our community. I look forward to the day that we don\u2019t have to lift ourselves up in departure from what the rest of the world considers mainstream, but until then it takes organizations like these to make sure that the world sees us.Some of the boundaries I\u2019d like to see broken are more people like us behind the scenes, writing, more people like us heading networks, so that we don\u2019t have to petition and pitch to normalize our normal stories.Your character is in an interracial same-sex relationship, which is still rare for TV. Do you consider your acting political?It\u2019s tricky for me to answer that because a) I had nothing to do with the storyline, and b) it\u2019s my job to say what they tell me to say. However, it\u2019s exciting to be able to sort of be the forefront of information that we are trying to make \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say mainstream, but make common so that everyone sees it as, that\u2019s just the way it is.But also, who I am in the world right now is political by default, and I won\u2019t go into a long diatribe about that, but \u2014You can if you want.I think perhaps if I may be so bold your question should have been, is your presence political, and my answer would\u2019ve been yes, and because my presence is political, it further highlights what I do onscreen.What do you mean when you say your presence is political?Oh darling, we don\u2019t need to spell it out. Come on. I\u2019m black, I\u2019m gay, I\u2019m culturally Christian. I am a walking target on so many levels, and it is horrifying and a cross that very, very many of us who look like me have to bear. And unfortunately I don\u2019t think looking over our shoulders is going to slow down anytime soon.The show has gotten criticism for its handling of race, and it rolled that criticism into the story last season. Will the show keep addressing that issue this season?I\u2019m not a writer. I don\u2019t know.How do you think Kimmy Schmidt would react to this election? I think at first she might follow Donald Trump. I think his rhetoric would sound so familiar, that just by default based on familiarity she would follow suit. Then I think she would listen to the way he spoke about women, and I think that sort of subtext would not ring true with her. She\u2019d probably go and boycott and march and do all the things that Kimmy Schmidt would do to bring attention to why Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t be president\u2014 and he won\u2019t be, by the way.What about Titus Andromedon? I think Titus would see dollar signs, and would probably go and campaign for him, and Kimmy would probably stop him from doing so. I think Titus would sell out until Donald crossed a line and said the wrong thing, and then I think Titus would sort of pull up, but just shy of a payday.What about you? How are you reacting?If it wasn\u2019t so terrifying, it would be the most brilliant comedy of errors, ever.I think Donald Trump has put America in great danger, and I think he\u2019s done a disservice to us even if he doesn\u2019t win. I think his effect is going to be kind of lasting. I think people are going to walk away proud of being racists, proud of being bigots, proud of assaulting women, proud of shooting black people for no reason.But I believe that the people who put Obama in office twice, a man of color, aren\u2019t just going to stand by idly and let this narcissist, this egotistical bigot come into office.Would you ever consider creating your own show? If so, what would it be about?Titus belongs to \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d Titus Andromedon. Tituss Burgess couldn\u2019t be more different. I get how people think I\u2019m one and the same, but I just don\u2019t live there, I\u2019m nothing like that man, and whatever I would do wouldn\u2019t be in stark contrast just because, but because I\u2019m in stark contrast, it would be different. When it\u2019s time for Titus to end his delicious run, it\u2019ll be time for him to end it and that\u2019ll be that.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the character Tituss Burgess plays on \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d It is Titus Andromedon, not Tituss Andromedon.Anna North is a member of the editorial board.Advertisement"}

With \u201cChelsea,\u201d she has pivoted, in an effort to discuss politics at a time when people\u2019s attention spans are fractured, in part by this bruising election cycle and in part by social media.She is about halfway through making 90 more episodes ordered up by Netflix. She has used the show not only to explain modern politics to her viewers, but also to explain United States election history.\u201cI can talk about politics, science and health,\u201d Ms. Handler said at the bar. \u201cAbout things that actually matter and impact someone\u2019s information in a more palatable way.\u201d I think that\u2019s what I set out to do, and like this is what I\u2019ve wanted to be doing for a while.\u201dHe seems to enjoy these topics in person, too.\u201cHe always makes sure that I don\u2019t believe in God,\u201d Ms. Handler said of her brother.Mr. Handler said, \u201cWe\u2019re all a bunch of ants marching on this planet, and we\u2019re all about to kill each other.\u201d(To the suggestion that maybe the wrong Handler sibling got the talk show, Ms. Handler responded she was certain her brother would agree.)The bartender, also named Alicia, told Mr. Handler that Mr. Trump comes here often for interviews and does not drink.\u201cRed flag,\u201d Mr. Handler said.\u201cMajor red flag,\u201d Ms. Handler said.Anyone who has read her books or watched her TV shows will know that drinking is a major tenet of Ms. Handler\u2019s comedy.

Around her stood flocks of dark-suited dignitaries; below, in the wide avenue called the Mall, a massed crowd waited silently. She began a short speech in her distinctively high-pitched, clear voice, then tugged the string that would pull down the flag to reveal the statue. It began to slide, then stuck halfway. A team of helpers rushed in.It was a gray, damp day last December, perfectly suited to the otherwise solemn scene being filmed, in which Elizabeth was about to unveil a statue of her father, King George VI. His death three years earlier, at 56, had suddenly transformed her from a shy young wife and mother into a queen. And at this moment, it becomes clear that Elizabeth \u2014 unlike her tearful mother and sister nearby \u2014 is able to conquer her swirling emotions and fully inhabit her public persona.That conflict between private and public, between woman and queen, is the central subject of \u201cThe Crown,\u201d an ambitious, sumptuous television production about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II that will have its Season 1 debut on Friday, Nov. 4, in all of Netflix\u2019s 190 territories.As the success of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d displayed, there\u2019s a global fascination with the British royal family and aristocracy. But where \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d was fiction, \u201cThe Crown\u201d is based on fact, with a far weightier dose of history and politics, including nuanced issues of constitutional duty and complex political infighting. And that raises the stakes for both its creative team \u2014 headed by the writer Peter Morgan and the director Stephen Daldry \u2014 who must balance seriousness of intent against popular appeal, and for Netflix, which is hoping to attract a big enough global audience to justify one of its most expensive forays yet into original programming.Ms. Foy and Matt Smith in \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\u201cI was really struck by the relationship between Winston Churchill, this old, frightened fading lion, and this beautiful young girl who had become queen much earlier than she hoped,\u201d Mr. Morgan said in an interview on set last year. \u201cI thought, this could be a film, and I started writing it with that intention. Then I began to think, shouldn\u2019t the story start earlier, with her wedding to Philip, and then realized: There might be a TV show in this.\u201dMr. Daldry became involved in the project early on, together with the producer Andy Harries. Their pitch: Six 10-episode seasons that would each span roughly a decade of the queen\u2019s reign, covering both the personal events within the royal family circle and the political events of the time.\u201cWe wanted to do the first two seasons straight up, no pilot,\u201d said Mr. Daldry, whose other credits include \u201cThe Reader,\u201d \u201cThe Hours\u201d and \u201cBilly Elliot.\u201d \u201cIt was demanding from us, but we felt confident and excited about the material and we wanted a serious commitment.\u201dThe first season covers the years between the 21-year-old Elizabeth\u2019s marriage to Philip Mountbatten (Matt Smith), in 1947, and her later decision not to allow her sister, Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby), to marry a divorced man, in 1956. Each hourlong episode revolves around a central story line, even as longer-running themes \u2014 the tensions in Elizabeth and Philip\u2019s relationship after she becomes queen; Margaret\u2019s ill-fated affair with Group Captain Peter Townsend; Churchill\u2019s tenacious hold on power \u2014 are threaded throughout.As Mr. Morgan mapped out the season, he took into account changing viewing habits, understanding that the audience could binge all 10 episodes at once rather than wait a week for its appointed time. \u201cThe main thing to avoid is a rhythm of repeating the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to change who your protagonists are, what your focus is. I don\u2019t want anything to be predictable.\u201dHe also tried to avoid rehashing stereotypes about particular decades.Everything, he stressed, was based on fact. \u201cI really don\u2019t make much up,\u201d he said in horrified tones, after being asked whether the queen, who was educated at home, had really hired a tutor to help improve her general knowledge after her accession. \u201cThat stuff is all absolutely true.\u201dMr. Morgan added that the series employed seven full-time story editors to check everything he wrote. \u201cOf course I have to imagine the private conversations, and those are necessarily fiction, but I try to make everything truthful even if you can\u2019t know whether it\u2019s accurate,\u201d he said.When it came to imagining the relationships between members of the royal family, Mr. Morgan said that he wanted to emphasize \u201cthat these are complex adults with rich inner lives in the way that we all are.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be prurient, but I also don\u2019t want it to be too respectful,\u201d he added. \u201cThe tone is all-important.\u201dMr. Morgan and Mr. Daldry, who directed three of Season 1\u2019s episodes, and oversaw all of them, don\u2019t shy away from imagining the difficulties of the young, virile Prince Philip when his wife becomes queen and he must defer to her decisions. (In a notably dramatic moment in Episode 9, they are seen without sound, through the windows of a car, arguing violently.) Nor do Mr. Morgan and Mr. Daldry avoid portraying the tensions between the vivacious Princess Margaret and her serious older sister, which come to a head at the end of Season 1.\u201cThey are all struggling to come to terms with the conditions and context they find themselves in,\u201d Ms. Kirby said. \u201cShe and Peter Townsend were the big public story of that generation; it was so much in the collective consciousness. But she was trapped by what she was born into. After what had happened with her uncle\u2019s abdication for Wallis Simpson, she knew that she would have to face ostracism if she married him. She understood the stakes. Who you are in all this, public or private person, is the dilemma, and for Elizabeth, too.\u201dThe reverberations of the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII (known as David to his family) in order to marry the divorced Simpson \u2014 which sees the throne pass unexpectedly to Elizabeth\u2019s father, George VI, making her the heir \u2014 underpins all of Season 1, with frequent flashbacks to those events and to the young princess as a child.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t supposed to be queen, and the family suddenly had that thrust upon them,\u201d said Ms. Foy during a break in filming Season 2. \u201cParticularly someone like her, who never wanted to be the center of attention. And then her marriage with Philip had to change. I think they would have liked a conventional life where the man goes out to work and the woman stays home.\u201dIn a telephone conversation, Mr. Smith said that researching the role of Prince Philip had made him aware of what \u201can interesting, dramatic and painful life\u201d he had. \u201cHe has a great wit, was a wonderful naval man, a wonderful family man,\u201d Mr. Smith said. After his wife becomes queen, he added, \u201cHe is going to walk two steps behind her, wanting to feel the head of the family. It\u2019s an interesting conflict to explore.\u201dPart of the pleasures of \u201cThe Crown\u201d is its ability to offer voyeuristic glimpses of life at Buckingham Palace and other royal residences (The furniture! The objects! The clothes! The jewels! The footmen!). But it also offers a history lesson in world events, politics and the social manners and mores of postwar British society, seen through the prism of Elizabeth\u2019s reign.Asked how he had balanced these historical issues against a portrayal of the royals\u2019 family life, Mr. Morgan said, in a recent phone conversation, that the choices were often \u201cas random or as instinctive as guessing what will or won\u2019t make something taste good when you are cooking.\u201d He added, \u201cIn an odd way, the show determines what you need,\u201d explaining that if there had been several episodes dealing with constitutional issues, he might counterbalance that by focusing on a more emotional subject, like Margaret\u2019s relationship with Townsend.\u201cThe royal family were renegotiating their relationship with the world,\u201d said Philip Martin, who directed four episodes in Season 1. \u201cPeter has a real understanding of how they somehow need the media and somehow want to escape. How the royals survive, how they negotiate their relationship with the public, is in some ways the story.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the Netflix series \u201cThe Crown\u201d described a website incorrectly. The site, What\u2019s on Netflix, is an unofficial fan site for the streaming service; it is not affiliated with Netflix.Advertisement"}

I\u2019ve heard really well-meaning white people say, \u201cI would never have been one of them.\u201d And I hear a lot of black people, including myself, saying, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have been an enslaved person.\u201d But when you take apart some of the pieces of what slavery was, you see they are mirroring the current day. We are re-enslaved by the millions. We are turning our eyes away from the horrors of what\u2019s happening inside. We are participating as slave masters because we consume products and elect politicians and are complicit in enabling the system. So it\u2019s not a one-to-one comparison, it\u2019s an emotional comparison.One thing that was shocking was the number of companies that used prison labor.The one that was more disconcerting to me was Victoria\u2019s Secret. They did it until it was made public, and then changed their practices, and so did J. C. Penny. Weapons systems, pieces of missile defense, down to household goods are made by people who are forced to do it because they are imprisoned, and they get paid pennies. These are practices that we would not allow in sweatshops, yet [are] O.K. for folks serving time.It\u2019s a surprise to hear Newt Gingrich criticizing discrepancies between sentencing for crack and powder cocaine and saying a white person cannot ever understand what it\u2019s like to be a black person in this country.He\u2019s been talking about that for a little while, in smaller rooms. I wanted to make sure that whatever we think of him and folks who are conservatives \u2014 we think that there\u2019s no compassion for the plight of people of color \u2014 that there are other things there. Within that, I wanted to interrogate the why of it. Why are they trying to decarcerate? What is in it for them? And you know some of it, it\u2019s a real religious thing, a really kind of evangelical \u201cthis is not humane.\u201d But for many others, the switch of focus from traditional jails and prisons to community supervision, surveillance and GPS tracking is about new business opportunities.How do you get the money interests out of prisons?It\u2019s really going to take a revolution in thought from the majority of people in this country, to push politicians to really unlegalize a lot of these practices. I believe it can happen. If you know someone\u2019s making money off punishment \u2014 billions of dollars off that guy who got picked up for whatever and is sitting there for longer than he should \u2014 if more people knew it, I just have to believe that they\u2019d want to do something about it.There was outcry that your film \u201cSelma\u201d was not nominated for best director or best actor, and also loud criticism from people saying you mischaracterized L.B.J. But that obviously didn\u2019t slow you down.That wasn\u2019t a huge deal to me. Beyond the fact that it didn\u2019t have any teeth, I thought that it was an argument that came from a position of privilege, not placing value on the thoughts and perspectives of someone who was not like them. But it didn\u2019t stop me or slow me down. It actually gave me more fire.How so?I\u2019m glad I went through it because I don\u2019t have a fear about how [\u201c13th\u201d] is going to be received. I\u2019ve investigated, I asked the questions, I got the answers, and I put them together in the way that I wanted to present them. It\u2019s my perspective, my prerogative, my point of view, and that is as valid as theirs.No, I wanted to direct it all myself, and when I couldn\u2019t, the immediate first thought was, \u201cLet me get all the people who I think can do it.\u201d And all those people were women. Because I\u2019m thinking of it from my point of view, and I\u2019m a woman, and I\u2019m a woman of color. So the majority of our directors are women of color. It\u2019s the same as the two gentlemen who run \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d They want everything through their lens. Everyone can make their own choices. They make theirs. I make mine.I hadn\u2019t read it. I\u2019m not ashamed of that. I mean, I kind of am, because I was an avid reader growing up. That just missed me. But when I read it, I fell in love with it right away. With a girl at the center, being unsure, being awkward, being imperfect and yet still there being a beauty there, a wisdom that\u2019s untapped. It\u2019s like a quirky, cool, weird, awesome story that I everyday pinch myself that they\u2019re letting me do.You\u2019ve said before that you don\u2019t like the word diversity. Could you break that down?It\u2019s just unemotional, and inclusion is a much more emotional word. We\u2019ve all been excluded, so we know what inclusion means. We haven\u2019t been undiversed. It\u2019s an emotional issue that\u2019s been given a really unemotional word. It\u2019s like affirmative action; it means nothing anymore \u2014 the words become vanilla. And you [have to] keep re-examining and being vigorous about what is the idea here? If it\u2019s that important, then how do you keep it fresh?Was \u201c13th\u201d hard to do emotionally?Yeah, I cried a lot making it. It\u2019s really, really hard to look at that archival footage. Hours and hours and hours of watching traumatic images to try to figure out what\u2019s too much, what\u2019s not enough. It\u2019s tough business.An article on Thursday about Ava DuVernay\u2019s new documentary, \u201c13th,\u201d referred incorrectly to Academy Award nominations for her movie \u201cSelma.\u201d It was indeed nominated for best picture.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Requiring the Use of Condoms in Adult Films", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.If you work on a construction site, you\u2019re required to wear a helmet.Likewise, if you perform on an adult film set, shouldn\u2019t you have to wear a condom?That\u2019s the logic supporters hope will lead voters in November to approve Proposition 60, a statewide initiative that would require pornography producers to enforce condom use.\u201cIf these producers cared about our health and safety, this is a no-brainer,\u201d said Derrick Burts, a proponent and former adult film worker who contracted H.I.V.Those in the industry, however, are vehemently opposed. They have been joined by a number of organizations, including five of California\u2019s biggest newspapers and both major political parties, who have raised concerns that Proposition 60 is written in a way that could unleash a wave of costly litigation.Under the measure, any private party would be allowed to sue producers of pornography if the state\u2019s workplace safety agency failed to act on a reported violation.If such a lawsuit prevailed, the plaintiffs could get a cut of the judgment.What\u2019s more, opponents say, the litigation would force adult film performers, who often double as producers, to publicly disclose their real names and addresses.Mr. Leue said businesses that don\u2019t flee could also simply opt to go underground. There, he added, performers would face even greater risk.Mr. Gwynn will be honored during a ceremony on Nov. 30 in Sacramento along with the rest of the inductees: the actors Harrison Ford and George Takei, the novelist Isabel Allende, the artist Corita Kent, former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, the Tower Records founder Russ Solomon, and the journalist and former first lady of California Maria Shriver.\u201cThese individuals exemplify the unique and boundless creativity of California,\u201d Mr. Brown said in a statement.Each of the honorees has a life story that has in some way been influenced by California.The Hall of Fame, part of the California Museum in Sacramento, was established in 2006 by one of this year\u2019s honorees, Ms. Shriver, who at the time was the wife of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.Among the first inductees were a few of the state\u2019s most towering figures: Ronald Reagan, Cesar Chavez, John Muir, Elizabeth Taylor and John Steinbeck.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

Iger.As annual profit climbed from $3.4 billion in 2006 to an astounding $8.4 billion last year, Disney\u2019s share price shot up accordingly, from about $31 in 2006 to $122 in August 2015. But those high-flying days are starting to seem like a distant memory, at least on \u201cwhat have you done for me lately\u201d Wall Street.\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredibly frustrating stock,\u201d said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.So, where does this leave Mr. Iger? Awash in acquisition rumors.\u201cGiven Iger\u2019s interest in technology, Twitter\u2019s in-process repositioning as a mobile live video destination and Disney\u2019s need to shift its story away from the challenges facing ESPN, a Twitter acquisition has real strategic merits,\u201d Rich Greenfield, an analyst at the financial services firm BTIG, wrote in a blog post.Mr. Greenfield noted that Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, also sits on the Disney board: \u201cWe believe Dorsey wants to sell to a media company to power their over-the-top, mobile-video ambitions.\u201dAdding to the acquisition speculation is Mr. Iger\u2019s track record of going shopping about every three years \u2014 he\u2019s overdue by that measure \u2014 and his history of bold moves, Ms. Reif Cohen said.The problem: Unlike the reactions to deals with Pixar, Marvel or Lucasfilm \u2014 companies that were instantly lauded as perfect targets for Disney \u2014 any cheerleading for a Disney-Twitter tie-up was drowned out by sharply negative responses.\u201cTo buy Twitter would be the equivalent of throwing money out the door,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cThere\u2019s no penalty for taking a look, but I\u2019d be shocked if Disney actually buys it.\u201d\u201cDisney needs to buy nothing,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Disney is incomplete at all.\u201dMr. Iger, who declined to comment for this article, does seem to have an itch to buy something. But there are no clear moves. (Lego, long on Disney\u2019s wish list, is too expensive; the often-on-the-edge Vice brings potential image problems.)

{"Headline": "A Guide to Enjoying the Final Stretch of the New York Film Festival", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookIt can be tough for any festival to sustain its excitement and audience, and this one runs a whopping 17 days. The New York Film Festival tends to front-load its hottest titles, which helps grab attention early but also means interest may fade and shift elsewhere before the whole thing ends. This front-loading can also be frustrating for festivalgoers, especially as higher-profile titles sell out. Even so, the festival has grown large enough that a patient attendee can find plenty to watch. And while the main slate remains its headliner, it now functions more as a gateway than as the destination.Mr. Gray both wrote and directed \u201cThe Lost City of Z,\u201d and he has managed to pull off something exceedingly tricky here: a film that has the old-fashioned cinematic sweep (and sense of New World awe and discovery) of a picture like David Lean\u2019s \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d but without all the familiar colonialist stereotypes. Fawcett isn\u2019t any great white savior; sometimes he barely seems to know what he\u2019s doing or why. Nonetheless, he stumbles and paddles forward, even as he\u2019s pulled back home by his family, notably his wife, Nina (Sienna Miller), a thoughtfully realized character who insists, if vainly, on her rightful place as his equal.As of Sunday evening, tickets were available for some screenings of \u201cThe Lost City of Z.\u201d (Several of the other main selection titles are having encore screenings this week.) If you haven\u2019t already seen \u201cSieranevada,\u201d from the Romanian director Cristi Puiu (\u201cThe Death of Mr. Lazarescu\u201d), you can try for rush tickets. Mr. Puiu\u2019s compatriot, Cristian Mungiu (\u201c4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days\u201d), is also on the slate with \u201cGraduation,\u201d about a doctor who compromises his values to help his daughter. Less overtly dazzling in its form than \u201cSieranevada,\u201d \u201cGraduation\u201d sneaks up on you with its mixture of art and politics, its aesthetic rigor and its devastating, merciless view of post-Ceausescu Romania.If you\u2019re an Isabelle Huppert devotee, this week you can watch her affirm her status as one of the most talented, versatile actresses in contemporary cinema in two very different movies: Mia Hansen-Love\u2019s \u201cThings to Come\u201d and Paul Verhoeven\u2019s rather more rollicking \u201cElle.\u201d In \u201cThings to Come,\u201d Ms. Huppert plays a phlegmatic professor whose life of the mind slowly and coolly comes somewhat undone by a succession of personal catastrophes. In the more full-blooded (and bloody) \u201cElle,\u201d Ms. Huppert plays a hard-charging executive (she helps run a video game company) whose life turns upside down \u2014 then flips \u2014 after she\u2019s raped. By turns demented, off-putting and ugly-funny \u2014 a Verhoeven trademark \u2014 \u201cElle\u201d will be one of the more talked about movies of the year.Like department stores, festivals like to separate their offerings into friendly consumer categories and this year, the New York Film Festival put most of its nonfiction into a separate section, Spotlight on Documentary. Among its marquee attractions are Errol Morris\u2019s latest, the somewhat self-explanatory \u201cThe B-Side: Elsa Dorfman\u2019s Portrait Photography,\u201d and one of the best movies you are likely to see this year, Raoul Peck\u2019s \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d based on the work of James Baldwin. Also screening this week are two outwardly very different must-see movies about growing up strange: \u201cKarl Marx City\u201d and \u201cBright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.\u201d\u201cKarl Marx City\u201d was directed by Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker, whose earlier titles include \u201cGunner Palace.\u201d A biographical portrait and a work of sociopolitical archaeology, \u201cKarl Marx City\u201d is an essayistic, quietly moving look at another lost world, the former East Germany, where Ms. Epperlein grew up. The narration comes off as a needless, distracting device \u2014 an attempt at distancing. (It\u2019s narrated by a woman who refers to Ms. Epperlein in the third person.) But the movie draws you in quickly with its intelligence, its restrained emotions and its jaw-dropping period material, which includes some wildly creepy Stasi surveillance imagery.The subjects of \u201cBright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds\u201d don\u2019t pull you in; they yank. Directed by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens, this very funny, engrossing movie couldn\u2019t be more mainstream or more delectable. Intensely, at times squirmingly, intimate, it trots and sometimes meanders down twinned memory lanes as it revisits Ms. Reynolds\u2019s and Ms. Fisher\u2019s lives, their ups and downs, scandals and tchotchkes. The movie has too many dog reaction shots, but its glamour, drama, bedazzled soul and Hollywood history make objections irrelevant. It\u2019s headed for HBO, but try to see it on the big screen, where Ms. Reynolds and Ms. Fisher belong.The New York Film Festival runs through Sunday; filmlinc.org.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "House Hunting ... in Colombia", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate19 PhotosA MODERN FOUR-BEDROOM HOUSE OUTSIDE MEDELLIN$889,800 (2.6 BILLION COLOMBIAN PESOS)Medellin, about 260 miles from Bogot\u00e1, is the second largest city in Colombia, with more than three million people in the metropolitan area.Envigado is \u201cmore of a bedroom community, more family oriented\u201d than Medellin\u2019s urban neighborhoods, said Rich Holman, the sales director of First American Realty Medellin, the real estate company marketing the property.Built in 2013, this 4,900-square-foot house sits on a little more than a half-acre, with broad views of the surrounding mountains, the Central Cordillera section of the Andes. The exterior facade is a combination of stucco and carob wood. A small pond surrounds the base of the house, near the entrance. A bridge of wooden steps leads to the front door.The large open living room immediately off the entrance has Spanish marble floors and two-story windows. From the living room, glass doors open onto a teak deck. There is a separate TV room and office on the ground floor, as well as a space the current owner uses as a fitness room. The furniture is not included in the price, but is available to buy, Mr. Holman said.The living room connects directly to the kitchen, which has an island counter for casual dining. All the appliances are Italian, including a steam oven and a range on the island. The current owner uses the balcony off the living room for formal dining.A wood spiral staircase leads to the second floor, where there are three bedrooms and three bathrooms and the floors are made of carob wood.The master bedroom has a dome-shaped roof with indirect lighting and two balconies. The bathroom features natural stone walls, a double shower, two sinks and a Jacuzzi; circular windows offer views of the city. There is also a large walk-in closet. A guest bathroom is on the ground floor, along with another bedroom and bathroom.The backyard has a large lawn with banana, lemon and avocado trees. The current owners tend a small garden with cilantro, carrots, onions and tea plants. There is a carport-style garage with room for two cars.The house is about a five-minute drive to hiking and biking trails, as well as an off-road track for trucks, ATVs and dirt bikes. The stores, restaurants and nightlife of Envigado are less than a 10-minute drive, and local buses connect to the center of Medellin. The house is about 30 minutes from the Medellin international airport.MARKET OVERVIEWAs a result of that perception, Medellin homes sell at a steep discount compared to those in Bogot\u00e1 and Cartagena, Mr. Holman said. High-end properties in Medellin are priced at about $190 a square foot; those in Bogot\u00e1 are around $318 a square foot.But sales in Medellin have been steadily increasing in recent years, and prices have risen an average of 7 percent a year since 2003, Mr. Holman said.This year the local market is on pace to sell more than 74,000 homes, a record number, the Real Estate Association of Medellin reported a few weeks ago. Prices in the area rose 8 percent in 2015, according to the association\u2019s data.The market has been aided by an improving economy, a growing middle class and increasing tourism, agents said.The property market \u201cis booming,\u201d said Brad Hinkelman, the owner of Casacol Medellin, a real estate agency. \u201cColombia is a classic emerging market economy.\u201dThe affluent neighborhood of El Poblado, adjacent to Envigado, is the most popular area for foreign buyers, agents say. Prices in some areas of El Poblado have risen more than 15 percent in the last year, Mr. Hinkelman said. And \u201cthere is very little new construction coming on to the market in the most coveted area of the city,\u201d he added.The second most popular area in Medellin for sales and rentals by foreigners is Envigado, agents say. It is seen as an alternative to the higher-priced central neighborhoods, said Mr. Hinkelman, who lives in Envigado: \u201cIf you are trying to get more for your money, you go to Envigado.\u201dMedellin neighborhoods are rated by the government on a scale of one to six based on social and economic conditions, with six signifying the wealthiest neighborhoods and one the poorest. (The ratings are used to determine property taxes, utility fees and other charges.)Most parts of El Poblado are rated six, while Envigado ranks between two and five, depending on the area, Mr. Holman said. This house is in a neighborhood rated five.WHO BUYS IN MEDELLINThe domestic market is driving home sales in Medellin, which is a popular vacation and second-home destination. \u201cA lot of investors from Bogot\u00e1 are coming to Medellin,\u201d Mr. Hinkelman said. \u201cThere is huge rental demand.\u201dThe number of foreign buyers in Medellin is also growing, especially with the strength of the dollar against the Colombian peso, agents say. But international buyers still make up less than 5 percent of the market, Mr. Hinkelman said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Colombia. Agents recommend hiring a lawyer to handle the paperwork and research the title.And while regulations are strict and there is a lot of paperwork, \u201cColombia protects ownership,\u201d said Diana Pizano, a partner in the Medellin law firm of Colombia Legal Partners.Down payments are usually 10 percent to 20 percent of the purchase price. Colombia does not use escrow accounts, but the purchase agreement is \u201clegally binding to the parties and enforceable,\u201d Ms. Pizano said. If there are no problems with funding or the title deed, deals can close within 45 days of an accepted offer, she said.The majority of transactions are all-cash. Even for locals, mortgages are very expensive, with interest rates of around 12 percent, Mr. Holman said, and they usually require 30 to 40 percent down payments.WEBSITESLANGUAGE AND CURRENCYSpanish; Colombian peso ($1 = 2,922 pesos)TAXES AND FEESBuyers\u2019 closing costs are usually about 1.4 percent of the purchase price, Ms. Pizano said. Agent commissions are typically 3 to 4.5 percent of the price, and are paid by the seller, she said, and the legal fees are typically $1,000 to $2,000 on top of closing costs.Property taxes on this house are about $1,700 a year, Mr. Holman said.CONTACTAn article on Oct. 23 about a house for sale in Colombia described incorrectly the town of Envigado, near Medellin. It was the hometown of the drug lord Pablo Escobar, not his birthplace.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chilly Reaction to AT&T-Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byThe $85 billion AT&T deal for Time Warner won\u2019t win regulatory approval. We will continue our current course even if it does. Will a line of major media consolidation dominoes \u2014 involving titans like Disney, Fox and Comcast \u2014 begin to fall? Not likely.Such was the chilly reaction that senior entertainment executives had on Monday regarding AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner \u2014 even as many analysts speculated in the opposite direction, contending that the deal may force a vast reshaping of the media business as the big seek to compete by getting even bigger.\u201cWe think the likelihood of a Fox bid for Sky now rises,\u201d said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, referring to the pan-European satellite television and internet company. Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, pondered, \u201cCan Comcast really resist buying T-Mobile?\u201d Michael Morris, a Guggenheim Partners analyst, contended that Disney \u201cshould be strongly considering acquiring\u201d Netflix.The upshot: There was little agreement on Monday about what the aftershocks of AT&T\u2019s weekend acquisition of Time Warner, home to Harry Potter and \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d might look like.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know enough,\u201d Michael Nathanson, one of Wall Street\u2019s more circumspect media analysts, wrote in a research note, putting the odds of AT&T winning regulatory approval at 50-50 \u2014 essentially a coin flip.Maneuvering, however, was in full force.Some senior media executives, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions, said they were assessing what concessions they might be able to extract from AT&T in return for supporting its acquisition. At the same time, Hollywood\u2019s two biggest remaining content conglomerates, the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, indicated that they would fight the deal in Washington.\u201cA transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,\u201d Zenia Mucha, a Disney spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday.A Fox spokeswoman, Julie Henderson, released a similar statement on Monday: \u201cA deal of this size and scope, and the impact it will have on consumers, should receive the highest level of regulatory scrutiny.\u201dHere is a look at where the AT&T deal leaves other prominent media companies and what some analysts think they might consider in response:The Walt Disney Company, with a market capitalization of $150 billion, is too big to be bought by anyone other than a Google or an Apple. And Disney, which has a singular corporate culture in Hollywood, has made it clear that it sees itself as the predator and not the prey when it comes to technology related deal making.\u201cOne of the key capabilities that Disney lacks as of today is the ability to build a scaled, direct-to-consumer business for its television and studio properties with the associated back end technology expertise,\u201d Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a research note on Monday.The country\u2019s largest cable and broadband operator, Comcast also owns the NBC broadcast network, a bundle of cable television networks including Bravo, USA and MSNBC, film and TV studios and theme parks. What more could Comcast need?Acquiring a wireless company would be particularly pressing, the analysts said, if AT&T introduced a new streaming service bundled with wireless data.The Murdochs have ownership control, and nobody thinks they would be sellers \u2014 especially since Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan, were given the chance to run the family media company only last year.But the family may have already shown its hand, several analysts and bankers said. Over the long term, Fox thinks it needs to get bigger. That thinking comes from Fox\u2019s unsuccessful $80 billion takeover bid for Time Warner in 2014. If Fox offered that much before, could it make an even bigger offer for Time Warner now? (Ms. Henderson, the Fox spokeswoman, shot down that possibility on Monday.)On the company\u2019s last conference call, James Murdoch, Fox\u2019s chief executive, answered a question about potential acquisitions by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re quite happy with where we are today.\u201d He added that the company would be \u201cvery careful with our capital.\u201d Fox\u2019s recent strategy has involved eschewing trendy takeover targets like Vice Media in favor of reinvesting in channels like National Geographic.The question is whether the AT&T deal changes that stance. Fox could swing into buying mode, tucking in MSG Networks, with holdings in sports television, or even Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns rights to the James Bond franchise.On Monday, some analysts and media executives said that they expected the AT&T-Time Warner deal to accelerate those considerations. The AT&T-Time Warner deal underscores the old industry adage that content is king, they said. The agreement also highlighted the need for entertainment companies to band together so that they would have more heft in negotiations with the larger and larger cable, satellite and wireless companies.But while such a deal may be crucial for the survival of Viacom, which has struggled mightily, the same may not be true for CBS, which is in more of a position of strength. Any CBS-Viacom deal requires winning over Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, who has expressed doubt over the corporate marriage. The latest development may well give Mr. Moonves more bargaining power.Advertisement"}

And it\u2019s taking a toll on our mental health.\u201cI\u2019ve been in private practice for 30 years, and I have never seen patients have such strong reactions to an election,\u201d said Sue Elias, a licensed clinical social worker in Manhattan.Both poll data and anecdotal reports show that the high levels of election anxiety are affecting both Republicans and Democrats equally.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re registered as a Democrat or Republican \u2014 U.S. adults say they are experiencing significant stress from the current election,\u201d Lynn Bufka, the association\u2019s associate executive director for practice research and policy, said in a statement.According to the American Psychological Association, 55 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans \u2014 a statistical tie \u2014 say the election is a major source of stress. \u201cPeople seem to be getting more worried every day,\u201d said Elaine Ducharme, a licensed clinical psychologist in Glastonbury, Conn.While every election provokes some level of anxiety as we watch our preferred candidate move up or down in the polls, the battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump appears to be taking a greater toll. After speaking with mental health experts across the country about what they are hearing from their patients, a common theme has emerged: This election has made people feel less safe.Therapists say that some of the issues that have emerged in this election \u2014 national security, terrorism, hacking threats, gun rights and sexual assault \u2014 play into some of our deepest fears and anxieties. Issues of secrecy \u2014 Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails and Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns \u2014 and allegations of conspiracies and a rigged election, have compounded some patients\u2019 feelings of distrust.\u201cPeople are wondering, how can I feel safe? Who will take care of us?\u201d said Dr. Robert Bright, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. \u201cEveryone I talk to is very concerned about this election.\u201dWhat\u2019s striking, say therapists, is how deep the fears go on both sides.\u201cAbout one-third of my patients talk about the election \u2014 and both the conservatives and the progressives are affected,\u201d said David Rogers, a clinical psychologist in Hershey, Pa. \u201cThe campaign is arousing fears about the unknown. Both sides are aroused, because the results feel so consequential. It\u2019s like when Lincoln was running against Douglas and Jefferson was up against Adams.\u201dAnd the unusual nature of the election, with Mr. Trump pushing the limits of acceptable behavior in politics, is creating problems for people who struggle with mental health issues.\u201cBoundaries are an important part of mental health,\u201d said Dr. Ducharme. \u201cIn order to feel safe, people need to have a sense that there are rules and norms. In this election our leaders appear to be out of control.\u201dStrong feelings about the candidates are causing not only rifts between Democrats and Republicans, but also among families and friends. Ms. Elias has patients who are avoiding friends and family members with whom they disagree.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Civil War,\u201d said Ms. Elias. \u201cI have never seen an election cause this level of conflict.\u201d\u201cPeople are having a hard time seeing the perspectives of the opposite side,\u201d said David Palmiter, a clinical psychologist in Clarks Summit, Pa.For women, particularly those who have been victims of sexual assault, the election has triggered painful memories. Ms. Elias said that after the second debate, \u201cmany of my female patients came in and wanted to talk about Trump.\u201d She said patients felt that Mr. Trump seemed to stalk Mrs. Clinton and invade her space. Some patients needed to process incidents in which they had felt belittled or harassed by men in their lives.\u201cWomen said their hearts were racing during the debate, they were that triggered,\u201d Ms. Elias said. \u201cSome came in complaining of having had nightmares.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t help any of us that the news is relentless. According to the A.P.A. poll, stress was highest among those Americans who use social media.Therapists say they offer their patients coping techniques. Rather than tell yourself to stop worrying, which rarely works, Dr. Bright suggests setting aside time to worry, like when you get home from work or during your lunch break. \u201cThis is a behavioral technique called thought stopping, and it can be very effective,\u201d he said.The A.P.A. tells patients to \u201cread just enough to stay informed.\u201d Take breaks from social media to go for a walk, spend time with friends or do other things you enjoy.

Avoid politics altogether if a conversation is likely to escalate to conflict.Dr. Ducharme said she tells her patients to limit exposure to the news and to find distractions.\u201cI tell my patients to catch up on the news for 20 minutes, then turn to something more satisfying,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband and I have watched more comedies on Netflix than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Put More Students in the Seats, Colleges Cue the D.J.", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "Supported byWhen Clemson played Notre Dame at home during a downpour last season, the weather dampened the Death Valley turf but not the crowd\u2019s spirits. Part of the thanks for that went to Clemson football\u2019s house D.J.As the Tigers pulled out a 24-22 victory in a matchup of unbeatens, it was D.J. Sha (pronounced Shay) who provided the soundtrack. His image was broadcast on the stadium\u2019s giant video screen, and his music kept the students from fleeing for the exits as the Tigers opened a two-touchdown lead early in the second half.\u201cIt pretty much became a rain party with D.J. Sha and our student body,\u201d recalled Mike Money, an assistant athletic director at Clemson.Clemson, now ranked fifth, needed little effort to attract fans to Saturday night\u2019s matchup against No. 3 Louisville. But hiring D.J. Sha was nonetheless part of a concerted attempt by Clemson officials to play more to the crowd \u2014 specifically to the younger segment of it.More than ever, college football programs are finding it difficult to draw and retain the young fans who grow up to be lifelong season-ticket holders. In many athletic departments, the reasons can practically be cited as catechism: high-definition televisions, DVRs, diffuse fan bases and higher ticket and parking costs.In response, programs are going well beyond recorded drumbeats and free T-shirts to serve the customers who represent the future of their fan base. North Carolina, like Clemson, brought in a house D.J. Texas invited local restaurants, like Mighty Fine and Amy\u2019s Ice Creams, to expand its concession offerings. Arizona carved out prime seating for students, shifting them to the 40-yard line.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve tried to do,\u201d said Greg Byrne, Arizona\u2019s athletic director, \u201cis create a game-day experience that will make people say, \u2018All right, televisions are big and all that, but it\u2019s more fun being at the game.\u2019\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not going,\u201d Emily Golembiewski, who consults with colleges, said of young people. It helps if the team is winning, she added, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t change the meter enough.\u201dAthletic department officials worry that the 19-year-olds sketched in studies \u2014 who are subscribed to Netflix, hooked to Snapchat and, like ducks, averse to going out in groups of fewer than 20 \u2014 herald a dismal future for ticket sales and in-game enthusiasm.\u201cThe student population becomes your new general-public season-ticket holder,\u201d said James Francis, a senior associate athletic director at Arizona. \u201cYou want to address that trend early on, because you\u2019re going to deal with that same mind-set and issue as they graduate.\u201dThat could explain why athletic departments, realizing that ticket sales reliably make up about a quarter of overall revenue, perceive young fans as critical bellwethers. \u201cThe students make or break the energy in the stadium,\u201d said Rick Steinbacher, a senior associate athletic director at North Carolina.There is also a competitive angle: The more packed the stadium and the more engaged the crowd, the more difficult it may be for the opposing team to convert a third-and-9 in the fourth quarter. But preserving that edge takes planning; at Arizona, Francis organized iPad giveaways that could be collected only if the winner stayed for the whole game.At Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium at Arkansas, four large student skyboxes can be rented out, at rates well below market price, by groups like fraternities and interest organizations.\u201cIt\u2019s a guarantee that we\u2019re going to get another 1,000 students in the building who might make a game-day decision to leave the pregame tailgate or pregame party,\u201d said Chris Freet, a senior associate athletic director at Arkansas.Noting that the idea arose out of a conversation he had with a student government president, Freet added: \u201cIt\u2019s a good example of what the research tells you to do in engaging with them. They want a voice.\u201dAt Clemson, which Money said routinely fills its student section with about 12,000 fans, D.J. Sha\u2019s presence emerged more organically. D.J. Sha, whose real name is Donsha Butler, grew up in Ninety Six, S.C., and first came to the program\u2019s attention via recruiting events. From there, Tigers Coach Dabo Swinney began inviting him to spin tracks for players before games. Starting this year, D.J. Sha\u2019s position during games is in a booth built for him among fans near the western end zone.\u201cAnybody can D.J.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest thing is being able to read your crowd, being able to communicate with your crowd.\u201dHaving a professional seems to be working. While D.J. Sha reverts to well-known songs during games \u2014 Usher, Run-D.M.C., current hits \u2014 he uses pregame warm-ups to showcase rising Atlanta hip-hop artists and performers like Lil Uzi Vert and Kodak Black. \u201cIt\u2019s just real hype,\u201d said Joey Williams, Clemson\u2019s undergraduate student body president.But Golembiewski, the college consultant, said the best practices for appealing to a younger demographic evolved from common sense.\u201cThe myth about millennials \u2014 that they\u2019re really entitled and demanding, bratty customers \u2014 actually would not be my position,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re very savvy customers because they\u2019ve been marketed to their entire life. \u201dAdvertisement"}

Life is full of such choices, and as he described his decision to leave the Netflix drama \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d it became clear that the career move represented a similar choice, between one immediately satisfying option and another that would ultimately be more sustaining.\u201cI was coming to terms with the idea that there\u2019s a difference between gratitude and fulfillment,\u201d said Mr. Ali, who earned an Emmy nomination and raves for his bristling turn as Remy Danton, a sly political chess master. \u201cI felt grateful for the work I was getting, but I wasn\u2019t fulfilled.\u201dMr. Ali\u2019s rise has not been meteoric. It is the result of a hard-fought and patient two-decade campaign. He grew up in Oakland, Calif., and attended St. Mary\u2019s College nearby, where he was one of a few African-American students and the only varsity basketball player who also performed in poetry slams. He discovered a love of theater in two college plays, and after completing N.Y.U.\u2019s graduate acting program, he landed a 19-episode run on \u201cCrossing Jordan\u201d from 2001 to 2002 as the polished Dr. Trey Sanders.\u201cI was the black guy on the show, that was kind of it,\u201d Mr. Ali, 42, said bluntly, dapper in a crisp white cotton shirt. \u201cIt felt like there was a diversity box being checked, and if you\u2019re there to check a box, to some degree, then they\u2019re not really going to write for you.\u201d\u201cI thought: I\u2019ve been doing this for 16 years professionally,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a window where I want to play leading parts.\u201dAs soon as Mr. Ali made his bold move to leave, he booked so much work that his deliberate career plan began to look less like a calculated game of chess than a frenzied video game. \u201cSomehow, in the Tetris of it all, it fit together,\u201d he said.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t intend to ever do that again,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried that the characters would bleed together, or feel like different versions of the same character, and that terrified me.\u201dMr. Ali, who is upbeat and charming in person but also very professional and earnest, was keenly aware that this was his moment. His performances in \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d are so different, from physical presence to diction and demeanor, that it is hard to imagine he transitioned from one to the next, day after day.Cottonmouth is a vicious Harlem crime boss with a tragic past and a habit of throwing guys off rooftops. \u201cComing off \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 playing someone so strait-laced, I was getting offered a lot of F.B.I. agents,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cAnd to get the offer to play the antagonist? You can\u2019t watch \u2018Daredevil\u2019 or \u2018Jessica Jones\u2019 or the Marvel films and not be aware that the villain has to be awesome. I\u2019ve always wanted to have more space. And the scope, morally, is more broad for the villain than the hero.\u201dThe show also interested him as entertainment that would \u201cpotentially have some social and cultural impact, that\u2019s really trying to explore some topics like gentrification and toxic masculinity,\u201d he said.But his priority was clear. \u201c\u2018Moonlight\u2019 is a project that resonated with me more than anything else. I wouldn\u2019t have done \u2018Luke Cage\u2019 if they hadn\u2019t made time for \u2018Moonlight.\u2019\u201dThe empathetic, elegiac, low-budget film is a coming-of-age story about Chiron, a poor, gay, African-American boy from Miami, told in three segments. In the first, Mr. Ali plays Juan, a lumbering drug dealer who discovers the trembling boy hiding from bullies. At first glance, Juan\u2019s gold front teeth and slow-moving menace project a kind of intimidating power, but Mr. Ali imbues him with an uncommon tenderness, and he becomes an unlikely mentor whom Chiron later emulates.In \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Mr. Ali\u2019s slick \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d polish gives way to a simpler sincerity. He is often the only professional actor onscreen, yet his performance comes across as utterly natural, humanizing a role that is often reduced to stereotype.The film is based on an autobiographical play by Tarell Alvin McCraney. Mr. Jenkins, the director, said, \u201cA friend of mine always says a black drug dealer is always only a black drug dealer, but Juan is drawn from this lived experience.\u201d In the scenes between Juan and Chiron, he added, \u201cyou\u2019re just watching these two human beings.\u201dMr. Ali\u2019s preconception-shattering take invites audiences to reassess their assumptions. But he warned against interpreting either \u201cMoonlight\u201d or \u201cLuke Cage\u201d as a direct response to the current political climate that encompasses Black Lives Matter activism and Donald J. Trump\u2019s \u201cinner city\u201d fear-mongering.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, people being shot or killed or profiled, we grew up with that,\u201d Mr. Ali said, noting that a few years ago he had been stopped by the police. \u201cI was walking with a friend, and he thought I was pimping her. I\u2019m in Berkeley, arguably the most liberal city in the country! And I\u2019m on TV! Imagine if you\u2019re just some brother in the \u2019hood, walking to the corner store.\u201dHis point, he said, is not that he was stopped by the police but that the current news cycle is not the inspiration for his performances. \u201cWhen you see a project that has a black voice at the helm,\u201d he added, \u201cmaybe now you see other things layered in the stories that perhaps would have always been there in stories written from the perspective of an African-American person.\u201dStill, Mr. Ali said, he felt the absence of male role models keenly. \u201cI didn\u2019t have one black male professor or teacher my entire life,\u201d he said. \u201cFor myriad reasons, there\u2019s a lack of a strong presence of African-American men to help lead some of these young men and to be role models.

She is the one who gives daily news briefings about the latest earthquake or damage from an industrial fire. If a child has Zika, Ms. Murillo knows the boy\u2019s name and might just call the parents herself. She meets regularly with municipal leaders and makes it clear that decisions cannot be made without her approval.\u201cIt\u2019s not that she has as many followers as her husband \u2014 she has more,\u201d said Florencia del Carmen L\u00f3pez, 48, a street vendor. \u201cThe men are annoyed by it. The majority of her followers are women.\u201dNicaragua is a country where a revolution deposed one family dynasty, only to see it at risk of being replaced by another. Mr. Ortega, the president, is a 70-year-old former guerrilla who played a leading role in the Sandinista revolution that toppled Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the dictator whose family ruled here from the 1930s to 1979.\u201cThere were signals: Little by little, her face started showing up as the face on the political propaganda, at first with Daniel and then alone,\u201d said Sergio Ram\u00edrez, who was Mr. Ortega\u2019s vice president in the 1980s. \u201cNow it seems she is looking for political legitimacy. This is an extreme search for legitimacy.\u201dFemale heads of state or government are often members of political dynasties. Sometimes they follow their husbands into office, and occasionally their husbands follow them.Her relationship with Mr. Ortega began in the caldron of war. He spent part of the Sandinista revolution underground in Costa Rica, where he became romantically involved with Ms. Murillo. By then, she already had two children, and she was raising them in a clandestine safe house filled with copy machines, short wave radios and people who assumed false names. Mr. Ortega went by \u201cEnrique.\u201dZoilam\u00e9rica Ortega, Ms. Murillo\u2019s oldest child, was adopted by Mr. Ortega in her late teens. She recalled those early years as chaotic, describing a busy office with people traipsing in and out.\u201cNobody took care of us, literally nobody,\u201d she said in an interview.She went public with rape accusations in 1998. But her mother, who has had seven children with Mr. Ortega as well, stood by him.Joined by Mr. Ortega and their adult children, Ms. Murillo held a news conference calling her eldest daughter a liar who suffered from psychological problems.Although at least one witness backed up the abuse allegations, a legal case against Mr. Ortega collapsed in the courts, which are controlled by the Sandinista party.Ms. Ortega, the daughter, said she had suffered retribution for going public, contending that the nonprofit organization she ran was routinely cut off from funding sources that feared losing favor with the government. Three years ago, the government deported Ms. Ortega\u2019s Bolivian husband, so she was forced to leave Nicaragua. They now live in neighboring Costa Rica.\u201cI speak to her only to receive threats,\u201d Ms. Ortega said of her mother. \u201cShe opted for an alliance of power.\u201dSome critics of Ms. Murillo in politics and the news media also contend that her loyalty to Mr. Ortega and her public defense of him were rewarded in the influence she has gained across the country.Mr. Ortega himself used a Sandinista revolution anniversary speech in July to recount what he told his ally Fidel Castro about Ms. Murillo. Many Nicaraguans took it as a nod to her decision to side with Mr. Ortega over her daughter.\u201cI was telling Fidel how Rosario\u2019s loyalty dates back to our time in clandestinity,\u201d Mr. Ortega said.The president said her interest and involvement in politics had been evident early on, when she was arrested for attending a protest and refused to cooperate with the police. After the revolution ended in 1979, the family moved back to Nicaragua, where Mr. Ortega and a committee of eight other men ran the nation.\u201cThe other commanders looked at Rosario as some bothersome person who wanted to get involved,\u201d said Sof\u00eda Montenegro, a leading feminist intellectual at the Center for Communication Research, a research group in Managua. \u201cThere were nine men, and she did not fit. They had wives who were not interested, and it would not have occurred to them to do so. The men tolerated her.\u201dBut Ms. Murillo, a poet who had attended a British convent school and a Swiss finishing school and was fluent in English and French, wanted a bigger role. Former government officials say she jockeyed to control the Ministry of Culture, where she clashed with high-level administrators and got people fired when they shut her out of decision-making.Meanwhile, a war raged in Nicaragua as the victorious Sandinista revolutionaries fought insurgents known as the contras, who were backed by the administration of President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Ortega officially became president in 1984 and left office in 1990, when Nicaragua took steps toward peace.Despite having many children together, the couple did not marry until 2005, just as they prepared to take another shot at the presidency. Mr. Ortega had lost three consecutive elections. Then, with Ms. Murillo\u2019s help, he won in 2006, and her influence was notable right away. She is credited for the government\u2019s bold efforts to help the poor by doling out new houses, pigs and tin roofs.Now some Nicaraguans are worried that even more power will be consolidated in the Ortega family.\u201cShe wants to continue having power \u2014 that\u2019s a sickness,\u201d said Sergio Gonz\u00e1lez Guti\u00e9rrez, 42, a taxi driver, who gathered with his family at a corner store in San Jos\u00e9 Oriental, Ms. Murillo\u2019s old neighborhood. \u201cIf a private company does not allow a married couple to work together, how is that allowed for a nation?\u201dThe government contends that the Nicaraguan Constitution prohibits only blood relatives \u2014 like two siblings, or a parent and a child \u2014 from being on the same ticket. But many political analysts say the couple is violating the part that also excludes people who are related \u201cby affinity.\u201dDozens of people interviewed for this article, from former government officials to people on the street, said they believed that the plan to put Ms. Murillo in office was intended to guarantee the family succession.\u201cI met her when she was 17 years old and the secretary for the publisher of the newspaper, and I was always impressed with her ability to work, which people still notice,\u201d said \u00c1ngela Saballos, the spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Embassy in Washington during Mr. Ortega\u2019s first term in office. \u201cShe must sleep three hours.\u201dHer pursuit of the vice presidency, Ms. Saballos said, appears to be an attempt to \u201clegalize all the work she has been doing.\u201dMs. Murillo is already the official government spokeswoman, so no other bureaucrat is authorized to speak to the news media except her. In an email, she declined to be interviewed. (She speaks mostly to news organizations that are controlled by the government, several of them by her children.)\u201cThis is a movie we already saw, and we know how it ends,\u201d said Mr. Ram\u00edrez, the former vice president. \u201cIt ends badly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Max Landis Is a Hollywood Disrupter With an Attitude", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. \u2014 Last year, when the prolific screenwriter Max Landis was spending long days in script development on \u201cDirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency,\u201d the BBC America TV series he created, he decided to blow off a little steam \u2014 by writing another screenplay.In just seven hours, Mr. Landis bashed out a spec script (as unsolicited, over-the-transom screenplays are known) for a psychological horror-thriller called \u201cDeeper,\u201d about a disgraced astronaut. Almost as quickly, a bidding war broke out, and in April, \u201cDeeper\u201d sold to MGM for $2 million \u2014 a breathtaking sum in an era when most speculative screenplays sell in the low six figures.To hear Mr. Landis tell it, however, the payday pales in importance to a more existential imperative. \u201cI write scripts the way a lot of people play \u2018Angry Birds,\u2019\u201d he said, sipping a mojito poolside here at the Chateau Marmont. \u201cIn my head, I see a movie. If I don\u2019t write the script, there\u2019s no chance that movie will exist. If it doesn\u2019t exist, I feel like I\u2019m failing. I feel like this pit inside of me is rapidly growing and expanding. And I\u2019ll disappear and be nothing. So clearly I have to write something. Otherwise I\u2019ll die.\u201dSpend 90 minutes with this polarizing son of the director John Landis (\u201cAnimal House,\u201d Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d video), and you\u2019ll come to understand that a mixture of sensitivity and hyperbole is his default setting as well as a strangely beguiling asset.\u201cMax has a unique ability to open up his heart and spill it on the page,\u201d the screenwriter Drew Goddard, a friend and consigliere to Mr. Landis, said in an email. \u201cAnd Max has a tremendous amount of pathos hidden under all that rainbow hair.\u201dMr. Landis claims to have written an astonishing 98 screenplays (nearly all still unproduced) with 20 or 30 more in the \u201cthings I might finish soon\u201d category and some 200 others in various stages of completion. \u201cWithout exaggeration or braggadocio, I write more and faster than any writer I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Mr. Landis said.All the while, Mr. Landis has maintained a vibrant social media presence across Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube (111,000 subscribers) and Twitter (81,000 followers). Posting numerous times daily, he shares homemade parody videos and offers pop cultural ruminations (\u201cMacklemore Is the White Eminem\u201d). But more often, he roils his constituency with Kanye West-like pronouncements like his dismissal of the latest best picture Oscar front-runner, \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d as \u201ccinematic overkill\u201d or his description of Rey in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d as a \u201cMary Sue\u201d (genre slang for an idealized female character who triumphs only through authorial wish fulfillment).\u201cI got this fire lit in me a couple of years ago to make understanding the job of a screenwriter as visible as possible,\u201d Mr. Landis said. \u201cNot because I think screenwriters are underappreciated \u2014 even though they are. But because the way people think about this job is fundamentally wrong.\u201dTo his haters, however, Mr. Landis is a relentless self-promoter (\u201ca self-styled brat screenwriter,\u201d according The A.V. Club) offering whiny justifications for the critical drubbing and lackluster box-office returns of \u201cVictor Frankenstein\u201d and \u201cAmerican Ultra.\u201d More pointedly, some attribute his career to nepotism. He shared his first writing credit with his father, on a 2005 episode of the Showtime series \u201cMasters of Horror.\u201d\u201cI would never deny that being John Landis\u2019s son had some role in my start,\u201d Mr. Landis said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve worked in this industry, you know how many checks and balances there are. I\u2019ve had so many meetings with people who don\u2019t like John Landis \u2014 which is an even more awkward experience.\u201dWhile acknowledging Max Landis\u2019s ability to ruffle feathers, his friend and Hollywood peer Shane Black \u2014 a former wunderkind screenwriter himself (the \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d franchise) who sold several megabuck spec scripts in the \u201990s \u2014 said Mr. Landis was not driven by the pursuit of money, fame or even sympathy.\u201cIf I had an image of Max in my head,\u201d Mr. Black said, \u201cit\u2019s a guy with a stick constantly poking a hornet\u2019s nest \u2014 and just delighting to see what comes out of it. He delights in being a weirdo. He delights in curiosity and defying expectations. And he\u2019s a social success by not caring if he looks like a social misfit.\u201dAt a time when studios are reluctant to green-light movies that aren\u2019t franchises, Mr. Landis has also become something of a disrupter. Since the critical and commercial misfire of \u201cVictor Frankenstein\u201d (he said his script was significantly changed on its way to the screen), Mr. Landis has refused to sell his screenplays to the major movie distributors unless they come \u201ccompletely packaged\u201d with deals for actors, directors and budgets, effectively preventing studio executives from \u201cdisfiguring\u201d his writing.Mr. Landis had a busy afternoon ahead. He would go on to give production notes on \u201cChannel Zero,\u201d oversee dialogue replacement on \u201cDirk Gently\u201d and help make a casting decision for \u201cBright.\u201d\u201cIf people hate some of my movies, so be it,\u201d he said as he was leaving. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make things that are in and of themselves different from what you usually get. Does that come from me having a chip on my shoulder? Probably. But it also comes from frustration with the system that is feeding us sequels no one wants to see and tentpoles no one wants.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the screenwriter Max Landis misstated the Oscar status of the film \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d It was nominated for best picture of 2015, but did not win.

In a statement, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee said they planned to hold a hearing on the deal.And even competitors like Disney quickly chimed in, urging regulators to pay close attention in their review.At issue is whether AT&T, with over 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and DirecTV offerings, will somehow favor its own customers when it comes to HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. properties like the Batman and Harry Potter franchises.Some consumer rights advocates also questioned how AT&T will use the viewership data that it gathers from its subscribers, particularly if the Time Warner acquisition drives more consumers to AT&T\u2019s services.In an interview on Sunday, the chief executives of both AT&T and Time Warner stressed that they had no intention of limiting Time Warner\u2019s content solely to the combined company\u2019s offerings.\u201cWe\u2019re buying what I think is the premium content creator, developer and aggregator on the planet,\u201d said Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTo buy that and then constrict how that content is distributed doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. It\u2019s almost illogical.\u201dSome consumer advocates have questioned how effectively regulators have enforced the conditions of the NBCUniversal deal. Still, Mr. Schwantes of Consumers Union said that the programming limitations were the most crucial aspect of the F.C.C.\u2019s ruling and regulators should keep them in mind as they decide whether to allow the Time Warner takeover.Of special interest is that, unlike Comcast, AT&T is a truly national service provider, as well as an international one, given its growing presence in Mexico and Latin America thanks to previous acquisitions.\u201cProgramming is what worried people the most,\u201d Mr. Schwantes said. Referring to the F.C.C.\u2019s limitations on the NBCUniversal deal, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s lowered prices, but thanks to those conditions, we still have an online video distribution marketplace.\u201dPoliticians from both parties stressed that they were concerned about any limitation of consumer choice.\u201cThis oligopolistic realignment of the American media along ideological and corporate lines is destroying an American democracy that depends on a free flow of information and freedom of thought,\u201d Peter Navarro, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump, said in a statement on Sunday.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.And Mike Lee, the Republican chairman of the Senate\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, and Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democratic member of the subcommittee, said in a joint statement that the transaction \u201cwould potentially raise significant antitrust issues.\u201dBoth AT&T and Time Warner professed little worry that their deal would fail because of regulatory interference. The transaction provides for a $500 million breakup fee payable to Time Warner if the takeover is blocked on antitrust grounds, a relative pittance for a merger of this size.Both Mr. Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey L. Bewkes of Time Warner stressed that during nearly three months of deal negotiations, the idea driving the talks was that Time Warner could help AT&T build out its own video streaming service. That service, called DirecTV Now, is Mr. Stephenson\u2019s response to the migration of consumers toward mobile and online video watching and away from traditional cable packages.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing ever-faster innovation,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in the interview, adding that the rise of competing services, to which his company would continue selling its offerings, would maintain choice for consumers.In particular, mobile video watched on smartphones or tablets will be crucial for future viewers, according to Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Group. Even as Netflix, Amazon, AT&T, Verizon and others seek to figure out broadband-based video, mobile stands as the next hurdle to surmount.\u201cI think it all comes down to mobile video,\u201d she said, adding that no one has truly figured it out yet. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the type of content, but also where consumers watch it.\u201dBut Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes also stressed that the additional data that they could collect from video subscribers could bolster their businesses\u2019 advertising initiatives. Viewership information would allow for better targeting of ads while also shaping the kinds of content that Time Warner produces.The executives said better advertising could yield more money that would then go to further pay for additional content.\u201cIt allows us to recoup the cost of content through both subscription revenue and also through advertising,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Ms. Yong said that in markets served by Comcast, NBC shows tend to enjoy higher ratings, thanks to both the better viewership data available and more robust promotion.\u201cFor consumers, it means these megacompanies are going to track them across their offline and online daily experiences,\u201d Jeffrey Chester, the center\u2019s executive director, said. \u201cOn one hand, they\u2019re going to be able to access a wide variety of Time Warner-branded content on any device, but they should expect that they\u2019re going to be losing a lot of personal privacy as a result.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hating Hillary Clinton: Female Comics Skewer the Sexism of the Likability Trap", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byThe stand-up comic Jena Friedman has suggested a new campaign slogan for Hillary Clinton: \u201cGive uninspiring a chance: Settle for Hillary.\u201dMichelle Wolf, another acid-tongued stand-up in her early 30s, has also been telling jokes about the lack of excitement about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHer name would be a good safe word,\u201d she said in a set last month at the Village Underground.Remarkably, it\u2019s been a better election for comedy about Hillary Clinton than Donald J. Trump, an unexpected development considering that when Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, it became clich\u00e9 for comedians to declare their good fortunes. But while Trump jokes on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d have been outmatched by the flamboyance of their subject, Kate McKinnon\u2019s caricature of Mrs. Clinton found a pleasingly goofy physical language to reveal the rusted gears of political calculation churning inside her head.Along with impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, which include stops at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and multiple jobs at late-night shows (Ms. Friedman worked at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d where Ms. Wolf is now a correspondent), these comics both seem most comfortable when veering into areas that are decidedly uncomfortable. Their acts do not preach to the converted (they barely touch on Mr. Trump) or traffic in the kind of jokes likely to earn applause.Ms. Wolf, whose first solo show is \u201cSo Brave,\u201d criticizes political correctness as often as Mr. Trump does. \u201cI\u2019m not a pay-for-my-own-drink feminist,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone has their own line, and mine is at the bar.\u201dAnd the title of Ms. Friedman\u2019s show, which has its premiere on Seeso and Amazon on Oct. 20, includes a highly inflammatory gendered obscenity. When telling jokes about abortion and Ebola (an obsession of hers), Ms. Friedman often slowly leans forward, flashing a just-us-friends-here smile, to test how far the audience will tolerate her pitch-black sense of humor. But when she turns to Mrs. Clinton, she adopts a more prosecutorial stance, asking why Americans don\u2019t like this trailblazing politician. After offering suggestions \u2014 too insincere, inauthentic \u2014 she asks her listeners, who shout out insults like \u201csellout\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d\u201cAmericans have more words for why we hate Hillary than Inuits have for snow,\u201d Ms. Friedman says, adding with a deadpan expression that it couldn\u2019t possibly have anything to do with gender. \u201cIf only we could gauge American misogyny,\u201d she mock-mused, sarcastically imagining the perfect social experiment that would reveal \u201cwhat percentage of American democracy would rather have a tweeting asteroid crash into American democracy than a woman leading.\u201dWhat Ms. Friedman is arguing, of course, is that Mrs. Clinton is widely disliked because we live in a sexist society, end of story. Even among Democrats, this is the kind of blunt point you often hear in private, but rarely on Sunday-morning television shows. Loudly asserting what most pundits whisper about is one of the finest traditions of political stand-up. And yet, many of Ms. Friedman\u2019s jokes support the idea that Mrs. Clinton is hard to like. \u201cI love her like I love Lady Macbeth,\u201d she says. \u201cI love her like I love any unlikable female protagonist Netflix throws my way.\u201dWith a floppy mop of red curls and a nasally voice that trails off at the end of sentences, Ms. Wolf projects an almost cartoonishly distinctive persona, perfectly suited for commanding attention. When she brings up the persistent critique of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s voice as shrill, she shifts the register of her voice even higher, moving from the realm of Jennifer Tilly to something closer to a car alarm. \u201cSometimes that\u2019s just the voice you have,\u201d she shouts, exasperated.What\u2019s bold about the political comedy of Ms. Wolf and Ms. Friedman is that they appear to mock the metric of likability itself, pointing out how laden it is with double standards. What\u2019s most prescriptive about their material is that they treat the idea that it matters as utterly ridiculous.\u201cPeople always complain that Hillary doesn\u2019t seem like a candidate you can get a beer with,\u201d Ms. Wolf said on \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d an edge creeping into her deepening voice. \u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t want to get a beer with you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Created with the agency Droga5, the campaign includes three videos featuring Mr. Corden interviewing innovators in the restaurant, transportation and lodging fields. The series is called \u201cReserve What\u2019s Next.\u201dJPMorgan Chase introduced the credit card in August. Demand for the card \u2014 which has a $450 annual fee and offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus, as well as triple points for dining and travel purchases worldwide \u2014 was so great that Chase received tens of thousands of applications within the first few days.

They clearly like experiences more than stuff. They clearly want to make their own decisions about everything, including travel. It\u2019s more fun to post a picture of a fish taco or of a sunset over a beach than of a new couch.\u201dDroga5 enlisted David Gelb, director of the documentary \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi\u201d and the Netflix series \u201cChef\u2019s Table,\u201d to film three videos, each three to five minutes long and featuring a different innovator.

The second video, shot in Knoxville, Tenn., features the team at Local Motors, an open-source community of car designers and fabricators. The third video will feature someone from the lodging industry.Ms. Lemkau said Mr. Corden was given \u201cgeneral guidelines\u201d for his conversations with the innovators. \u201cThe whole reason we chose him was because he would be hilariously entertaining unscripted,\u201d she said.All videos will carry the card\u2019s tagline: \u201cTravel\u2019s changing. Carry the only card designed to stay ahead.\u201dDan Coates, president of YPulse, a youth marketing research firm, said Chase was \u201cgetting a lot of things really right\u201d with the campaign.\u201cThe focus on experience is really important for millennials, post the Great Recession,\u201d Mr. Coates said. \u201cIn the \u201990s, conspicuous consumption via luxury products was acceptable, but with the rise of the Great Recession, millennials developed a case of affluence guilt. Showing off what you own has been replaced by sharing what you do, since sharing experiences is much more egalitarian.\u201dTravel in particular \u201cis the most attainable experience for millennials,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we ask them what they\u2019re saving money for, travel is at the top of their list every time.\u201dMr. Coates praised the documentary style of the new Chase campaign, noting that its behind-the-scenes approach appeals to millennials, who \u201clove to geek out over things, digging into the process behind the product.\u201dHe warned, however, that the card might encourage users to accelerate spending to earn more rewards, thus potentially increasing the debt load of a generation already struggling with student debt.For his part, Mr. Corden said he was thrilled to use the card.\u201cObviously, travel has just always been a huge part of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t come as a shock to tell you that eating has been a huge part of my life.

{"Headline": "Hackers Used New Weapons to Disrupt Major Websites Across U.S.", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Major websites were inaccessible to people across wide swaths of the United States on Friday after a company that manages crucial parts of the internet\u2019s infrastructure said it was under attack.Users reported sporadic problems reaching several websites, including Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, Reddit, Etsy, SoundCloud and The New York Times.The company, Dyn, whose servers monitor and reroute internet traffic, said it began experiencing what security experts called a distributed denial-of-service attack just after 7 a.m. Reports that many sites were inaccessible started on the East Coast, but spread westward in three waves as the day wore on and into the evening.And in a troubling development, the attack appears to have relied on hundreds of thousands of internet-connected devices like cameras, baby monitors and home routers that have been infected \u2014 without their owners\u2019 knowledge \u2014 with software that allows hackers to command them to flood a target with overwhelming traffic.A spokeswoman said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security were looking into the incident and all potential causes, including criminal activity and a nation-state attack.Kyle York, Dyn\u2019s chief strategist, said his company and others that host the core parts of the internet\u2019s infrastructure were targets for a growing number of more powerful attacks.\u201cThe number and types of attacks, the duration of attacks and the complexity of these attacks are all on the rise,\u201d Mr. York said.Security researchers have long warned that the increasing number of devices being hooked up to the internet, the so-called Internet of Things, would present an enormous security issue. And the assault on Friday, security researchers say, is only a glimpse of how those devices can be used for online attacks.A distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, occurs when hackers flood the servers that run a target\u2019s site with internet traffic until it stumbles or collapses under the load. Such attacks are common, but there is evidence that they are becoming more powerful, more sophisticated and increasingly aimed at core internet infrastructure providers.Going after companies like Dyn can cause far more damage than aiming at a single website.In this case, the attack was aimed at the Dyn infrastructure that supports internet connections. While the attack did not affect the websites themselves, it blocked or slowed users trying to gain access to those sites.Mr. York, the Dyn strategist, said in an interview during a lull in the attacks that the assaults on its servers were complex.\u201cThis was not your everyday DDoS attack,\u201d Mr. York said. \u201cThe nature and source of the attack is still under investigation.\u201dLater in the day, Dave Allen, the general counsel at Dyn, said tens of millions of internet addresses, or so-called I.P. addresses, were being used to send a fire hose of internet traffic at the company\u2019s servers. He confirmed that a large portion of that traffic was coming from internet-connected devices that had been co-opted by type of malware, called Mirai.Dale Drew, chief security officer at Level 3, an internet service provider, found evidence that roughly 10 percent of all devices co-opted by Mirai were being used to attack Dyn\u2019s servers. Just one week ago, Level 3 found that 493,000 devices had been infected with Mirai malware, nearly double the number infected last month.Mr. Allen added that Dyn was collaborating with law enforcement and other internet service providers to deal with the attacks.In a recent report, Verisign, a registry for many domain names that has a unique perspective into this type of attack activity, reported a 75 percent increase in such attacks from April through June of this year, compared with the same period last year.The attacks were not only more frequent, they were bigger and more sophisticated. The typical attack more than doubled in size. What is more, the attackers were simultaneously using different methods to attack the company\u2019s servers, making them harder to stop.The most frequent targets were businesses that provide internet infrastructure services like Dyn.\u201cDNS has often been neglected in terms of its security and availability,\u201d Richard Meeus, vice president for technology at Nsfocus, a network security firm, wrote in an email. \u201cIt is treated as if it will always be there in the same way that water comes out of the tap.\u201d\u201cThese probes take the form of precisely calibrated attacks designed to determine exactly how well the companies can defend themselves, and what would be required to take them down,\u201d Mr. Schneier wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who is doing this, but it feels like a large nation-state. China and Russia would be my first guesses.\u201dIt is too early to determine who was behind Friday\u2019s attacks, but it is this type of attack that has election officials concerned. They are worried that an attack could keep citizens from submitting votes.Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia allow internet voting for overseas military and civilians. Alaska allows any Alaskan citizen to do so. Barbara Simons, the co-author of the book \u201cBroken Ballots: Will Your Vote Count?\u201d and a member of the board of advisers to the Election Assistance Commission, the federal body that oversees voting technology standards, said she had been losing sleep over just this prospect.\u201cA DDoS attack could certainly impact these votes and make a big difference in swing states,\u201d Dr. Simons said on Friday. \u201cThis is a strong argument for why we should not allow voters to send their voted ballots over the internet.\u201dGillian M. Christensen, deputy press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agency was investigating \u201call potential causes\u201d of the attack.But technology providers in the United States could suffer blowback. As Dyn fell under recurring attacks on Friday, Mr. York, the chief strategist, said such assaults were the reason so many companies are pushing at least parts of their infrastructure to cloud computing networks, to decentralize their systems and make them harder to attack.\u201cIt\u2019s a total wild, wild west out there,\u201d Mr. York said.An article on Oct. 22 about a hacking attack on Dyn, a company that manages part of the internet\u2019s infrastructure, misstated the business of Verisign, a company that monitors such attacks. It is a registry of domain names, not a registrar of internet sites.Erin McCann contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

McAtee II, said in an interview. \u201cOur job is informing consumers what a good development this is for them.\u201dBut navigating this transaction will be a test of just how much influence AT&T has in Washington these days, especially as it tries to persuade antitrust officials at the United States Department of Justice, who will be crucial in approving the deal. The task may be particularly tricky as AT&T\u2019s lobbying team undergoes a transition after losing its longtime leader, James W. Cicconi, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush.Issues that led to the collapse of those deals seem even more prevalent now, as the nation closes out a presidential campaign that has featured candidates from both parties \u2014 most notably Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders \u2014 promising to challenge corporate power.The alarms over AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner stem from mounting frustration over high prices and the lack of competition in the telecom industry, with most Americans limited to one or two providers of broadband services. Regulators are set to focus on AT&T\u2019s powerful control over broadband and television customers since it is the nation\u2019s second-largest wireless company, after Verizon, and biggest paid television provider since its recent acquisition of DirecTV.Time Warner\u2019s marquee content from its HBO and CNN channels and movies from Warner Bros. will lead regulators to also scrutinize whether the creation of a multi-tentacled juggernaut could suppress competition in the technology, media and telecommunications industries. One way the combined company might do that, for example, is by offering unlimited streaming of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to its wireless customers or making it harder for competing streaming video services and television programs to reach AT&T subscribers.Lawmakers have already vowed a tough review of the deal, regardless of the lobbying full-court press they know will be playing out on Capitol Hill.\u201cWe are seeing increasing consolidation, especially scary consolidation, between the content side of the media and the internet provider side,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.The panel could hold a hearing on the proposal \u2014 with sworn testimony from AT&T executives \u2014 as soon as next month. \u201cWe have a duty to examine this deal,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.The merger sets up a monthslong battle in Washington with consumer advocates, smaller telecom and cable companies, and some tech companies preparing their own assault against the deal.\u201cThe American people want more competition, not less,\u201d said Chip Pickering, chief executive of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents internet companies including Netflix and Google. \u201cMegamergers are leaving them with higher prices and less choice.\u201dInstead, Mr. Ben-Zvi said, AT&T needs to be more specific and authentic to be more effective. The company must confront head-on any questions about the impact its deal would have on its competitors, for example, and make sure regulators and lawmakers understand that, with such rapid change in the tech sector, it has no choice but to pursue a deal like this.\u201cIncumbent telecommunications companies like AT&T are deeply threatened by the emergence of Silicon Valley giants that are poised to take over this space,\u201d said Mr. Ben-Zvi, who is not working on the AT&T-Time Warner deal. \u201cCompanies like Amazon, Google, Netflix \u2014 those are now some of AT&T\u2019s rivals, not just companies like Verizon.\u201dAT&T would not discuss details of its lobbying strategy, including whether it would employ tactics similar to those in previous mergers. \u201cWe are early in the process,\u201d Mr. McAtee, the AT&T general counsel, said.Mr. McAtee will help lead AT&T\u2019s merger efforts in Washington, along with Robert W. Quinn Jr., a policy insider in charge of lobbying who has been at the company for three decades.Both are new to being in charge. AT&T\u2019s storied lobbying operations were long led by Mr. Cicconi, who retired last month. Mr. Cicconi in the past worked closely with Wayne Watts, who served for decades at AT&T, including as general counsel, and retired last year.Together, Mr. Cicconi and Mr. Watts shepherded more than a half-dozen blockbuster mergers in the last two decades.The company is offering some clues about how it will position the deal. Unlike a \u201chorizontal\u201d merger, which unites competing companies in the same line of business, this transaction would not reduce the number of options for consumers, AT&T executives have said.AT&T also said it would not withhold Time Warner shows from competitors. It plans to create an advertising-based video business for mobile devices, similar to the ad business of the web giants Google and Facebook.The biggest advantage AT&T may have is the likelihood that the deal may face little scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory agency that typically gets involved if there are transfers of telecom or broadcast licenses. If Time Warner divests the one Atlanta broadcast station it owns, that would make the F.C.C.\u2019s jurisdiction moot. The merger would be reviewed under a new administration, potentially with new antitrust officials picked by the next president.Even so, it will not be easy. Michael J. Copps, a Democrat and former commissioner for the F.C.C., said that he was preparing, with consumer groups, to battle an AT&T lobbying surge.AT&T \u201chas a huge lobbying budget and the sharpest lawyers money can buy to get this deal approved,\u201d Mr. Copps said.Advertisement"}

Let\u2019s take a minute.It\u2019s about a chubby man-dweeb named Big Brayden (Sky Elobar), who suspects that his elderly, irascible father, Big Ronnie (Michael St. Michaels), moonlights as the Greasy Strangler, a creature who covers himself (and his mega-penis) in oozing layers of grease and fat before he sets out to slaughter. By day, the two men lead tours of supposed disco landmarks. They dress in gender-warping outfits that a generous fashion critic might call the Willy Wonka collection for Chico\u2019s. When they fall in love with the same bodacious woman, Janet (Elizabeth De Razzo), it sparks a Jerry Springer-meets-Arthur Miller war of sexual and emotional duplicity.So, yeah, it\u2019s that weird.But it\u2019s also a contender for the title of Weirdest Movie Ever by tinkering in freshly disorienting ways with gender, language and design. It was shot in Los Angeles, so the locations feel familiar. But the landscape unsettles the eye, as if \u201cMultiple Maniacs\u201d had left Baltimore for Pluto. Christina Blackaller\u2019s costume design, for example, is monochromatic and textural, like furniture. The silhouettes are deliberately ill-fitting, and the feminine tailoring \u2014 even for the men \u2014 lands somewhere between Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Scooby-Doo.\u201cWe did a lot of mixing of eras and periods and having modern things to try to make it kind of indecipherable what year it is,\u201d Ms. Blackaller said. \u201cMaking things a little off is what you do for a film that may become a cult film. It\u2019s like a weirdly innocent childlike vision, although it\u2019s not a childlike subject matter.\u201dThe movie sounds strange, too. In several scenes, characters comically repeat words \u2014 in one scene it\u2019s \u201cpotato\u201d \u2014 as if stranded inside a Beckett wasteland. Just as demented is Andrew Hung\u2019s score, which features bouncy, bass-heavy electronic blips and singsong manipulated voices that Mr. Hosking said sounded \u201clike the music was made for a Japanese video game.\u201d\u201cIf the characters in the film had decided to make music for the film,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is the music that they would want.\u201dOddly, finding actors willing to get naked and do unspeakable acts with their body parts wasn\u2019t as much of a challenge as Mr. Hosking expected. \u201cPeople probably did feel exposed and challenged, but they found the material funny and unique,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to be gentle and sensitive while making something that was asking a lot. We were all feeling discomfort at times.\u201d\u201cBy the time the thing was over, I was thinking, this is kind of very Fellini-ish, with the themes and characters,\u201d said Mr. St. Michaels, who has both \u201cDiff\u2019rent Strokes\u201d and Brecht on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite understand them, but they were weird and different and wonderful. This film is different and wonderful.\u201dThat\u2019s why \u201cThe Greasy Strangler\u201d has the potential to lead a new generation of weird-movie lovers as the king of midnight. Mr. Hosking, who wrote the film with Toby Harvard, said he returned to his \u201cpreoccupations with people feeling lost or out of step with the world,\u201d a feeling he experienced as a child in his native England watching British TV comedies that were \u201cvery absurd or anarchic.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Election a Morality Play or Just Reality TV?", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byThe ConversationFor example, the recent dump of hacked emails revealed Jennifer Palmieri (communications director for the Clinton campaign!) writing to John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, with this little masterpiece of contempt: \u201cI imagine [conservatives] think [Catholicism] is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion. Their rich friends wouldn\u2019t understand if they became evangelicals.\u201dAnyway, Danny\u2019s research suggests an explanation to me for the moral double standard the public seems to hold. It appears people are especially hard on politicians who betray the traits they\u2019ve already ascribed to them. People would probably be more outraged if a liberal politician were a jerk to his interns than if a conservative politician did the same thing. And they get madder at conservatives than liberals when they are sexually immoral.So it might be unfair, but as a self-declared conservative, Trump might actually be held to a higher moral standard on matters of sex than ol\u2019 Bill.Tough on the right-wing pols, but that\u2019s life.In other words, I think one important 2016 takeaway is a harsh lesson for commentators on both sides: If we go to Defcon-5 on every candidate we disagree with, criticisms will start falling on deaf ears.On the Clinton side, I\u2019ve admitted that I\u2019m uncomfortable with Bill\u2019s role in the campaign. But I don\u2019t think Hillary can be held accountable for his bad behavior \u2014 which seems to me to include at minimum both adultery and sexual harassment in the workplace. The four women who Trump dragged into the last debate were a mixed bag of cases, some tragic. But none of them involved actual wrongdoing on Hillary\u2019s part. It\u2019s true she blasted the Lewinsky accusers as part of a right-wing conspiracy, but that was at a time when both Bill and Monica were denying the affair took place.Under normal circumstances we could have great arguments about Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life, Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, the Clinton Foundation donors, and so on. Then we\u2019d get to veer into a rewarding discussion of who has the best tax policy. But this year, it\u2019s all beside the point.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Fall\u2019 Returns, but Will the Deadly Hunt Continue?", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byMr. Cubitt\u2019s unconventional methods mix standard police thriller elements of detection and chase with long, quiet scenes of conversation, interrogation and surveillance. In the Season 3 premiere (the only new episode available for review), much of the hour is taken up with curiously detailed scenes of a gunshot victim\u2019s being prepped for surgery and then operated on. You get the larger point \u2014 how the entire resources of a hospital, and the concerns of the police, are focused on saving the life of a patient who\u2019s a confessed serial killer \u2014 but it\u2019s still an odd choice.Mr. Cubitt\u2019s most unusual decision, however, is to still follow the same case three seasons into his show. (Admittedly, the first two seasons totaled only 11 episodes.) The brilliant British detective Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) remains locked in combat with the handsome Belfast psychopath Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan). Spector has been pursued and caught, and has confessed to four murders, but Mr. Cubitt finds ways to keep the story alive.The twist that got him to Season 3 \u2014 big spoiler alert here, if you aren\u2019t caught up \u2014 was a particularly egregious departure from the meticulous naturalism and psychological realism he mostly employs. (Mr. Cubitt writes the show and has directed most episodes.) Allowing a psycho killer out of prison to lead the way to a victim\u2019s body is a naked contrivance in even the most formulaic crime shows, and when Gibson took Spector out of lockup in the closing minutes of Season 2, it reeked of series-extending desperation.Things predictably went bad, and the new season picks up at the moment Season 2 ended, with Spector gravely wounded. Also shot, though less seriously, is Detective Sgt. Anderson (Colin Morgan), Gibson\u2019s latest sexual conquest. Having Gibson pick up young, good-looking subordinates is another example of Mr. Cubitt\u2019s willingness to stretch credibility. In this case, it\u2019s to make a point \u2014 she\u2019s just doing what men in her position routinely do.There\u2019s a likely explanation: Mr. Cubitt has set up a parallel between Gibson and Spector and wants to suggest that she, too, isn\u2019t in full control of her sexual impulses. But he hasn\u2019t made the parallel interesting, and it makes Gibson a less believable character, despite Ms. Anderson\u2019s fine performance.Now Mr. Cubitt needs to move the story forward another six hours with his killer caught and clinging to life. My advice: Keep an eye on the nurse who fits Spector\u2019s victim profile, and remember that Mr. Cubitt will do whatever is needed.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Young, Transgender and Acting on TV", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byIn a recent episode of \u201cModern Family,\u201d two children, a boy and a girl, play a round of broom hockey in a living room. In those 12 seconds, the first openly transgender child appeared as a transgender character in a mainstream sitcom.\u201cIt\u2019s the story of Maura when she was sort of having to hide away,\u201d Sophia, the 12-year-old actress who plays young Maura, said of her performance. \u201cThat was kind of a metaphor for trans people having always been there, but hidden.\u201d\u201cMainstream culture is catching up,\u201d she said. \u201cAt its best, that\u2019s what entertainment can do: present a world that glimpses into the future.\u201dThe \u201cTransparent\u201d crew is looking ahead by hiring transgender writers, producers and actors, even as the show is led by Jeffrey Tambor. During his Emmy acceptance speech for his portrayal of Maura, Mr. Tambor said he would not be unhappy if he were the last cisgender man to play a transgender woman on TV. (A cisgender person is someone whose gender identity reflects the sex he or she is assigned at birth.)Introducing young talent to large audiences may be a way forward. Sophia and Jackson\u2019s performances are used as different storytelling devices, and one portrayal is glossier than the other: On \u201cModern Family,\u201d Jackson\u2019s character, Tom, shows that a happy, well-adjusted transgender child interacts with the world in a way that is indistinguishable from cisgender children, while at the same time exposing any preconceived notions held by the adults in the room.On \u201cTransparent,\u201d Sophia\u2019s young Maura, told through a flashback episode set in 1958, offers a more nuanced look at how public frustration and private freedom can be dueling realities for young transgender people.The shows are operating on two different scales. \u201cModern Family,\u201d an ABC show that averages eight million viewers an episode, can be a blunt instrument that has been used to introduce sensitive topics to a wide swath of Americans.Jeff Greenberg, the show\u2019s casting director, said Jackson\u2019s appearance would be a \u201cbellwether\u201d to gauge the mainstream audience\u2019s acceptance of a transgender character.\u201cThere\u2019s a gay married couple at the center of the show, and the show has been a hit from Day 1,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s just sort of a new category and new awareness for writers and showrunners to start to include those characters in story lines, and it happened to this show.\u201dBut for a young actor, there is freedom in acting on a show dedicated to explaining the nuances of transgender lives across age, race and class. Sophia described her personal transition as a yearslong \u201cmetamorphosis,\u201d and said that she had overcome bullying. She said the experience of playing Maura among other transgender people on the \u201cTransparent\u201d set was healing.\u201cI think it\u2019s really going to help a child or people who have a child,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not confused; we\u2019re not ill. We\u2019re people, and we just want to be normal kids.\u201dJackson, who is several years younger, had different artistic challenges on \u201cModern Family.\u201d For instance, he focused on staying patient while filming a scene in a car. His acting advice for other children was simple: \u201cBe yourself, and have fun.\u201dHis mother, Jen Millarker, said that Jackson had been comfortable with appearing as a transgender character.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from him and what he\u2019s told other people is it\u2019s just a big part of his identity,\u201d Ms. Millarker said. \u201cHe\u2019s a kid who happens to be trans.\u201dWhen it comes to the ethics of casting a young transgender actor, Rhys Ernst, another producer on \u201cTransparent\u201d who is also transgender, said the crew had taken pains to be careful about finding someone who was not only ready to play the part, but also ready to have that part of their identity recorded and archived.\u201cYoung people in general are figuring out who they are,\u201d Mr. Ernst said. \u201cNot that they aren\u2019t certain, but being trans is complicated, and it might look different for somebody when they\u2019re 14 than when they\u2019re 25.\u201dMs. Drucker added that cultural and economic barriers kept all transgender children from having equal access to therapy and other tools \u2014 including activities as simple as gender play and dress up \u2014 that help them transition over time.\u201cIt was perfect in Sophie\u2019s case because of the support of her family,\u201d Ms. Drucker said.\u201cI had to educate myself,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cI\u2019d been doing this for 30 years, but had never come up with anything like this.\u201dIn postproduction, life for Sophia and Jackson has returned to normal. Jackson will play an impostor Santa in a community theater production of \u201cElf,\u201d and Sophia is playing volleyball. But she\u2019s keeping her options open, and is ready for roles that expand beyond transgender characters.\u201cBeing trans is only one aspect of me,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cI can play a trans person; I can play a leaf blower. I see any role ahead, and my future could be anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They are renting computers in remote data centers over the internet and using the tremendous amounts of data we are now collecting from computers, phones and sensors to analyze and predict how to make and sell more stuff.The best part of these talks isn\u2019t viewing the technology; it\u2019s listening to each sponsoring company brag about how much better it is than its competitors. Each presents number-rich charts to prove it.Who a company names as its enemy and how it measures its relative greatness says a lot about how the company sees its own strengths and the overall stakes in the competition for the world\u2019s computing.For Oracle\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, who used to slam Microsoft or Salesforce at these events, the main antagonist is now Amazon, which has led the migration of business technology to internet-based cloud computing.\u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is over,\u201d Mr. Ellison told his audience in September. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively moving.\u201d Using select data, he described Oracle as better in speed, security and, most important, price. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to pay less, you can\u2019t place the order,\u201d he said.For Microsoft, which has spent tens of billions of dollars building its global cloud computing system, the most important factor is not money; rather, the company is focused on size, resources and its track record.\u201cThe only comparison to our depth and breadth is Google,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview after his Atlanta keynote.Also on Thursday, Google held a coming-out event for its corporate computing effort, called Google Cloud, with a Google-level array of dizzying statistics about its scale and size. The company has had 339 product releases since January, and it has 10,000 engineers working on corporate computing.The company even showed a photograph of its undersea cable to Japan, which is 9,000 kilometers long and capable of sending 60 terabytes of information a second (one terabyte is roughly the size of 500 hours of video).Alphabet, the parent company of Google Cloud, has a capital expenditure of $9.9 billion a year, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google Cloud\u2019s senior vice president. Almost all of that consists of various forms of computing infrastructure. \u201cThat is just shy of Amazon and Microsoft put together,\u201d he said.Mr. H\u00f6lzle said data that would take Amazon eight hours to sift could take six minutes on Google. In one case, analysis on Google was 29 times as fast as on Amazon Web Services, he said.The velocity itself is the crucial metric, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said in a separate interview, and he said it would decimate most of today\u2019s contenders.\u201cThis is like Android versus the iPhone in 2008,\u201d he said, evoking a comparison with Apple. \u201cThere were older phones, the BlackBerry. Android managed to be relevant even though the first versions weren\u2019t great. It wasn\u2019t that it was free, or it had maps \u2014 it was the velocity that it changed.\u201dThe sole exception to industry enemy-naming is Amazon. At last year\u2019s meeting it cited a couple of specific products from IBM and Oracle. But with revenue expected to hit $11 billion this year, it is the undisputed cloud leader. For Amazon, naming anyone else would be like anointing them.But what fun is competition when you have nothing to beat? Amazon\u2019s designated foe is all of the past, and the 95 percent of old-style corporate computing it still has to take to the cloud. The IBM and Oracle products it named were from that old world.\u201cIn the next five years, we\u2019ll see the vast majority of enterprises doing what our forward-looking enterprise customers are doing now,\u201d said Ariel Kelman, the vice president of worldwide marketing at Amazon Web Services. He named Intuit and Netflix among these pioneers.Since Amazon owns the transformation, it figures, the enemy is a failure to transform.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Is a Shot in the Dark", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAT&T is a telecom company that offers wireless service in a saturated market, while Time Warner is a content company whose primary assets, networks like CNN and HBO, face tougher times in a cord-cutting world. This merger is presented as a solution \u2014 a bigger company with more options will inherently be better suited to weather the enormous changes now shattering the TV business. Together, they\u2019ll have more leverage and can build new stuff faster.If all this sounds a bit speculative, that\u2019s because it is. What this deal actually symbolizes is that the future of television is increasingly going to be built on lots of bold, possibly speculative experiments.For instance, it does not make sense for Time Warner to offer most of its content exclusively to AT&T\u2019s customers. Not only would that destroy its profitability (Comcast\u2019s customers pay a lot for CNN and HBO, so why would Time Warner want to kill that business?), but it would also be out of step with the future. The notion of content tied to specific distribution lines is exactly what consumers are moving away from when they choose services like Netflix over cable bundles.We are witnessing the emergence of a new order in the TV business. In five or 10 years\u2019 time, that order may become clear. There\u2019s a good chance it will involve some current players \u2014 Comcast, Disney and a merged AT&T and Time Warner will all play a role in the entertainment business of tomorrow. But these behemoths\u2019 size and influence will almost certainly be diminished by new tech-powered players, whose pocketbooks and ambitions seem limitless \u2014 companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and possibly Twitter and Snap.So among the questions now plaguing the industry: Do people still want to pay for TV, and if so, how much? Do people want to watch live stuff, or scripted stuff, or do they instead want to watch whatever is on their Facebook feed? Which kind of company is the most valuable player in the future of the entertainment business?That is where all the experimenting comes in. William Goldman, the screenwriter, once said that in Hollywood, \u201cnobody knows anything.\u201d This applies well to the entertainment business of today, and the AT&T and Time Warner deal is perhaps the watershed example: Every move is a guess, and if you are lucky, an educated one.\u201cI think we\u2019re all trying to figure this out \u2014 how technology and the consumer is going to change, and who are the winners and losers in this future,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, who studies the telecommunications industry at the research firm BTIG.The best argument for the deal, Mr. Piecyk said, is that it diversifies AT&T\u2019s offerings \u2014 now a single company combines content and distribution, rather than just one or the other. When you face an uncertain future, diversity isn\u2019t a bad weapon. If it turns out that in the future, content becomes more valuable than distribution, the new AT&T will have that; if the opposite happens, it\u2019s covered there, too.In conference calls with reporters and investors over the weekend, Randall Stephenson and Jeffrey Bewkes, the chairmen and chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner, added another dimension to this argument: Bigger, they said, is faster.The future of TV, they argued, will depend on a lot of new ideas that are tested and deployed very quickly. These might include new business models for paying for shows, new ways to distribute and market that content, and new technologies and industrywide standards to make sure it all works.Fragmentation led to delays, and delays contribute to consumer dissatisfaction \u2014 but in a world in which Time Warner and AT&T worked together, new products would come along faster, which would in turn push new ideas from competitors, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cThis appears to be about empire sustenance rather than economic efficiency,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group.Craig Moffett, of MoffettNathanson, was blunter: \u201cAT&T faces the twin pressures of a huge debt load and huge dividend that consumes the vast majority of their cash,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIt is clear that they had to do SOMETHING.\u201dBig media mergers are always risky. They rarely work out. But it\u2019s striking how much more things are uncertain today than in the past. So even if AT&T and Time Warner together do not make much obvious sense, well, it\u2019s something.Advertisement"}

She\u2019s there on behalf of a nonprofit that focuses on reaching out to the city\u2019s struggling youth, and she\u2019s failing terribly at connecting with them. They\u2019re more interested in dissecting her hairstyle, dating status, and why she \u201ctalks white.\u201d It\u2019s the sort of razor-sharp cruelty that teenagers are exceedingly good at.The nervous look on Issa\u2019s face suggests this line of questioning isn\u2019t out of the ordinary. Among adults it\u2019s just usually couched in softer language. Eventually fed up, she counters, \u201cBlack women aren\u2019t bitter, they\u2019re just tired of being expected to settle for less.\u201dA lot of pop culture aimed at black women seeks to explore the cultural, psychological and personal underpinnings of Issa\u2019s statement. This spans a variety of different media \u2014 blistering pop albums (Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d), dramatic film ensembles (\u201cWaiting to Exhale\u201d), hopeful romantic comedies (\u201cSomething New\u201d) and occasionally poignant melodramas (\u201cBeing Mary Jane\u201d). \u201cInsecure\u201d understands that the idea that black women are romantic failures who have to settle is a paranoid lie that feels like the truth because it gets repeated so often. Despite what the opening scene suggests, \u201cInsecure\u201d is interested in much more than the fraught love lives of black women. In fact, the show is at its best when delving into the tangled notions of identity faced by people in their late twenties.We learn quickly that Issa\u2019s main problem isn\u2019t that her boyfriend of five years, Lawrence (Jay Ellis), no longer inspires passion in her and seems to be going nowhere in life. It\u2019s that she neither knows who she is nor what kind of life she wants. It certainly isn\u2019t the life she\u2019s currently living, with her listless relationship and a job in which she\u2019s forced to fit the token black person role. (As if one black person could speak for the entire diaspora. Or one TV show, for that matter.)There\u2019s such a paucity of meaningful black representation on television that any time a series appears with black leads there is undue pressure for it to acknowledge the entire black experience. The sly jokes about Issa\u2019s being forced to speak for all black people at work come across as almost meta-commentary on the show itself. One of the greatest strengths of \u201cInsecure\u201d is its specificity. It exists in the growing trend of indie-tinged cable comedies who find humor not in traditional punch lines but in the absurd, mordant flow of everyday life.The first episode feels like a night over drinks with a good friend you haven\u2019t seen in a while. The mood it evokes is conversational, vulgar and heartfelt. Much of this is thanks to the dynamic between Issa and her best friend, Molly (Yvonne Orji), a lawyer who wrestles with the exhaustion that comes with trying to find a loving relationship. The energy between the two friends makes it clear their friendship will be the show\u2019s lifeline.But the premiere ultimately revolves around Issa\u2019s story. It\u2019s her voice-over that drives certain scenes. It\u2019s her daydreams we\u2019re privy to. It\u2019s her identity the series seeks answers for. Rae\u2019s artistry has grown since her creation of the YouTube series \u201cThe Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl.\u201d That series covered similar ground, as it followed a lead character who works at a call center, is torn between the love of two men, and continually finds herself in complicated and uncomfortable situations. I appreciated it, but I often found the humor forced, as in an early exchange with Cece (Sujata Day) in which Cece says that Halloween is her second-favorite holiday after International Fetish Day. The goals of the series were admirable, but the humor and performances were far too overwrought to hit the mark. With \u201cInsecure,\u201d she manages to be bawdy and poignant at the same time.Take for example a scene near this episode\u2019s midpoint. Issa is giddy to go to an open mike to see her ex Daniel (Y\u2019lan Noel), under the pretext that this night out is to assuage Molly\u2019s recent heartbreak. Each lipstick she tries on in front of the mirror corresponds to a dramatically different personality. With brick-red she plays a sultry femme fatale. Black invokes the kind of aggressive sexuality that feels like a Lil\u2019 Kim song come to life. With bright pink, she\u2019s fun and approachable.None of the identities fit. And underneath the sharply constructed scene lurks an uncomfortable question: If your twenties are often defined by learning who you are, what happens when you\u2019re almost thirty and aren\u2019t any closer to figuring things out?People, of course, can be mirrors too. Lawrence reflects Issa\u2019s complacency in life. Molly forces Issa to consider the idea that she\u2019s capable of being both selfish and caring in equal measure. And Daniel acts as a potent \u201cwhat if?\u201d We all have exes that nag at our minds late at night. When the rest of life is unfulfilling, it\u2019s easy to wonder how things could be different with former lovers whose faults have become hazy with time. Issa\u2019s voice-over at the beginning of the episode signals that her true problems are internal. \u201cHow different would my life be if I actually went after what I wanted?\u201d she asks. It\u2019s this uncomfortable question that makes the humor of \u201cInsecure\u201d cut deep.Other Gossip:\u2022 Director Melina Matsoukas (one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s longtime collaborators, who directed the \u201cFormation\u201d music video) wonderfully sets the look and tone of the show in the pilot.\u2022 It surprised me to learn that the cinematographer for \u201cInsecure,\u201d Matthew J. Lloyd, was also the director of photography for the first season of \u201cDaredevil.\u201d The muddy, underlighted aesthetic of Marvel\u2019s Netflix shows tends to be harsh toward actors of color, losing the complexity and beauty of various skin tones.\u2022 \u201cInsecure\u201d lays it on thick with regard to how obtuse well-meaning white people can be. Issa\u2019s co-workers think of themselves as liberal, but they\u2019re quite ignorant and condescending. The fact that Issa\u2019s boss, Joanne (Catherine Curtin) asks her, \u201cWhat would James Baldwin say is the most beneficial for people of color?\u201d gives the premiere its most cringe-worthy moment of hilarity.\u2022 A scene in which Molly is mildly heartbroken after receiving a text that reads \u201cSorry I\u2019m not looking for a relationship\u201d is perhaps too neatly paralleled when Daniel says the same thing to Issa after they kiss.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Agrees to Buy Time Warner for $85.4 Billion", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byIn the world of media, bigger remains better.So in the wake of Comcast\u2019s $30 billion takeover of NBCUniversal and Verizon Communications\u2019 serial acquisitions of the Huffington Post and Yahoo, AT&T has bought one of the remaining crown jewels of the entertainment industry.The telecommunications giant agreed on Saturday to buy Time Warner, the home of HBO and CNN, for about $85.4 billion, creating a new colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions with wireless phones, broadband subscriptions and satellite TV connections.AT&T and Time Warner said both of their boards unanimously approved the deal.\u201cWhen Jeff and I started talking, it became clear to us very quickly that we shared a very similar vision,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, told reporters on a conference call on Saturday, referring to Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTime Warner, we believe, is the clear leader in premium content.\u201dMost analysts and investors have noted that Time Warner was part of one of the biggest merger follies of all time, when it sold itself to AOL at the height of the dot-com boom. That combination \u2014 also pitched on the idea of uniting content and the internet \u2014 proved unwieldy and was later stripped apart to a few core businesses.This time, however, the rise of online outlets like Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube and the shift of younger customers from traditional media have pressured media companies to seek out consolidation partners. These media companies are anticipating drops in fees from cable service providers and declining revenue from advertisers. Getting bigger would give them more negotiating leverage with both service providers and with advertisers.Among their top priorities is finding new ways of reaching consumers. HBO, for example, offers its HBO Now service to deliver shows like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d to consumers who do not have cable subscriptions.Even Disney, widely seen as the strongest content company, with brands like Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, has been grappling with how to overcome challenges facing its network channels. ESPN, which long served as a growth engine, is now facing declining ratings and subscriber erosion, putting advertising sales into question.\u201cThe biggest thing that we\u2019re trying to do now is figure out what technology\u2019s role is in distributing the great content that we have,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, said at a presentation at Boston College on Oct. 5.Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBC has proved a model for this new world of media deal-making. While the cable giant has occasionally been scrutinized for possible regulatory violations, NBCUniversal has generally thrived under its current ownership, with NBC enjoying a ratings comeback and Universal delivering a wide range of hit films, from blockbusters like \u201cJurassic World\u201d to dramas like \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201dStill, Time Warner\u2019s deal with AT&T is likely to face tough scrutiny from government regulators increasingly skeptical of power being consolidated among a few titans. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, indicated on Saturday that he would seek to block the merger if elected \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dOver the last decade, Time Warner has spent significant time selling or spinning off AOL, many of the Time Inc. stable of publications, and Time Warner Cable, which was sold to another cable operator. The remaining businesses are HBO, one of the most-admired pay-TV channels; Warner Bros. movie studios; and cable channels that include CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Now, Mr. Bewkes has found a suitor willing to offer significantly more \u2014 $107.50 a share in cash and stock \u2014 and done so at a time when media companies are under pressure to strike their own deals. AT&T\u2019s offer represents a roughly 35 percent premium to where Time Warner\u2019s stock was trading before news reports of the merger talks emerged.\u201cTime Warner chairman and C.E.O. Jeff Bewkes and his senior management team can see where the entire legacy media world is headed: secular decline,\u201d Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, wrote in a research note on Saturday.Mr. Greenfield added, \u201cWe believe Bewkes will end up being remembered as the smartest C.E.O. in sector \u2014 knowing when to sell and not overstaying his welcome to maximize value for shareholders.\u201dThe announcement on Saturday also affirms the ambitious deal-making of AT&T. One of the former so-called Baby Bells that arose from the 1982 breakup of the original AT&T, the company has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on acquisitions to reconstitute some of its parent\u2019s empire.That has included buying DirecTV for $48.5 billion, adding satellite TV subscriptions as an additional source of negotiating leverage with content providers, along with the satellite company\u2019s steady stream of cash.The telecom company has also been working on its own online video service, for which Time Warner\u2019s trove of media could prove enormously helpful. Combining with AT&T is meant to accelerate those efforts, Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cWe think this is great for continued innovation in content,\u201d he said during Saturday\u2019s conference call.Still, AT&T\u2019s biggest rivals have not stood still. Comcast struck an agreement this spring to buy DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion, adding the \u201cShrek\u201d and \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d franchises to its media holdings.Verizon has charted a different course, focusing more on internet-based properties and advertising technology players rather than traditional media companies. Its $4.8 billion deal to buy Yahoo, rooted in the aging tech company\u2019s hundreds of millions of users, follows previous takeovers of the Huffington Post and AOL.Not everyone seems persuaded by the latest flurry of deal-making. Disney commented on the deal in a statement late Saturday, saying, \u201cA transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, also put out a statement cautioning approval. \u201cI will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks, and whether it stands up to stands up to the rigorous review standards set by the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division in the last few years,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about AT&T\u2019s bid to acquire Time Warner misattributed a statement in some editions that expressed caution about the merger. The statement was from Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut \u2014 not Senator Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts.Cecilia Kang, Brooks Barnes and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making Sense of AT&T\u2019s Bid for Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cYou had a lot of people saying you should\u2019ve combined a donkey with a rabbit and gotten a flying unicorn.\u201dThat was how Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, once described his company\u2019s colossal failure of a merger with AOL. He spent the last decade dismantling much of his company in the name of \u201cfocus,\u201d spinning off his cable business and magazine empire.And yet over the weekend Mr. Bewkes agreed to sell Time Warner to AT&T for $85 billion in a deal that, if approved by regulators, will vastly reshape the media and telecommunications world \u2014 and ultimately the way Americans will consume and pay for their favorite television shows.There was a good reason that Mr. Bewkes had been skeptical of big mergers that combined distribution and content: They are complex and hard to make successful, and they invariably face enormous headwinds from regulators, who will undoubtedly tie their hands in an effort to protect consumers from anti-competitive behavior.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, prices aren\u2019t going to go down because of this,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. \u201cI don\u2019t think vertical integration lends itself to consumer benefits.\u201dAlready, Donald J. Trump has denounced the acquisition and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll look at breaking this deal up\u201d if he were president. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential nominee, said he was concerned about the transaction. \u201cLess concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201dA raft of consumer-protection groups are already girding for a fight. And media and telecommunication rivals are hinting that they are prepared to battle the deal in Washington. \u201cA transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,\u201d a spokesman for Disney said.The worry among consumer groups and rivals, of course, is that for AT&T to make the deal work strategically and financially \u2014 the company is paying a 35 percent premium to Time Warner\u2019s stock price before news of the deal broke last week \u2014 it is going to use Time Warner\u2019s content as a weapon against its rivals by raising the price that they pay for carriage of channels such as HBO and CNN, while integrating those same channels into new AT&T offerings at lower prices.Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, dismissed that notion in an interview on Sunday, calling it \u201cillogical\u201d and saying he wants to \u201cdispel\u201d such an idea. He insisted he has no intention to limit Time Warner\u2019s content on rival systems and that \u201cit doesn\u2019t make business sense\u201d to restrict the distribution of Time Warner programming.Instead, he said, he sees the benefits of the merger coming from the additional data AT&T will be able to provide to Time Warner \u2014 and advertisers \u2014 about what consumers are watching, as well the ability to create specialized, interactive programming for AT&T\u2019s mobile customers that he expects other distributors will copy.Still, he suggested that his ultimate goal is to create a wireless network using next-generation technology known as 5G that competes not just with wireless providers, but with cable companies, by providing high-speed broadband and television service. \u201cI will be sorely disappointed if we are not going head-to-head\u201d with cable providers by 2021, he said.That notion may be both attractive and unattractive to regulators. On one hand, AT&T would be able to finally create real competition for cable companies, which have long held monopoly or duopoly positions in most markets. Owning Time Warner, Mr. Stephenson said, would \u201cdrive our incentive\u201d to build out its next- generation network even faster.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.On the other hand, regulators have been reticent to let cable companies merge to create a truly national footprint out of fear that it would put too much power into the hands of distributors; the government blocked Comcast\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Cable, for example.But Craig Moffett, another veteran media research analyst, said he gave the deal only a 50-50 chance of being approved.\u201cYou can imagine lots of strategies that would involve withholding content from distributors or not counting downloads of Time Warner content against data caps,\u201d Mr. Moffett said. \u201cBut those things are either already expressly prohibited or will be\u201d as part of any arrangement AT&T and Time Warner make with regulators.It is a question that Mr. Greenfield raised too. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be able to withhold HBO from Verizon, what exactly are you getting?\u201d he asked.Which raises the question: Why pursue the deal at all?Well, there are some potential benefits. While AT&T probably won\u2019t be able to use Time Warner\u2019s current crop of channels to bludgeon its competitors, it will be able to use Time Warner\u2019s creative team to devise all sorts of new programming options, many of which could become exclusive to AT&T.What\u2019s to stop AT&T, for instance, from creating a better version of Verizon\u2019s Go90, a specialized original channel. Go90 hasn\u2019t caught on, but AT&T could leverage Time Warner\u2019s team to create the next-generation HBO \u2014 and that channel could likely be exclusive to AT&T\u2019s service.Still, upstart companies like Netflix and Amazon Prime have proven that it is possible to create great original content without owning a legacy media company. Hire a couple of great creative executives and wave around a big checkbook, and you can attract high-quality scripts and headline-grabbing stars.In the chess game that is the media industry \u2014 a tens-of-billions-of-dollars version of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 perhaps owning Time Warner will give AT&T a jump-start into a world that many couldn\u2019t even imagine a decade ago. \u201cIt\u2019s empire building,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said.Whether it proves to be a success or the \u201cflying unicorn\u201d that AOL merger turned out to be remains the question.So as they say in the television business: Stay tuned.Advertisement"}

AT&T executives say the deal would benefit its customers by leading to new innovations. But it would only be logical for the company to use Time Warner\u2019s trove of movies and TV programming to keep and attract subscribers to AT&T while making it harder or more expensive for competing telecom and streaming companies to get access to that content.Or, if the Justice Department felt that imposing conditions would not work, it could seek to block the deal in federal court. That approach could backfire if courts decide that the merger doesn\u2019t violate antitrust law.Regulators need to keep in mind that the AT&T-Time Warner deal could spur even more consolidation in a very concentrated media and telecommunications industry. In most parts of the country, just one or two companies offer high-speed internet service. Four providers effectively control the wireless business, and six media giants dominate the TV and movie business.

It flopped, despite its spirited rock \u2019n\u2019 roll score and early memorable performances from Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Meat Loaf and especially Tim Curry, who originated and defined the role of the lascivious, irresistible Frank.Forty-one years later, the Fox network has prepared a \u201cRocky Horror\u201d remake that it will show on Oct. 20, directed by Kenny Ortega (\u201cHigh School Musical\u201d) and led by Ms. Cox, a prominent transgender actor and activist, as Frank.Other members of its cast, which draws from TV, music and theater, include Victoria Justice (\u201cVictorious\u201d) and Ryan McCartan (\u201cLiv and Maddie\u201d) as the inexperienced visitors Janet Weiss and Brad Majors; Reeve Carney (\u201cPenny Dreadful\u201d), Annaleigh Ashford (\u201cMasters of Sex\u201d and Broadway\u2019s \u201cSylvia\u201d) and the pop singer Christina Milian as Frank\u2019s attendants Riff Raff, Columbia and Magenta; and Ben Vereen, the acclaimed song-and-dance man, as the rival scientist Dr. Scott.Simply by sticking to its original text, the remake may still have the power to provoke. It is arriving at a time when viewers are increasingly aware of transgender people and the issues they face, and legislatures around the country are moving in opposite directions on whether to support or deny them rights and protections.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re a bunch of outsiders,\u201d Mr. Ortega said in an interview a few days after the \u201cSweet Transvestite\u201d shoot. \u201cIt\u2019s people who have a great love affair with this project, and we\u2019re coming at it with great sensitivity, care and appreciation for all that it\u2019s meant.\u201dComing on the heels of the successful and squeaky-clean live broadcasts of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d and \u201cThe Wiz\u201d (on NBC) and \u201cGrease\u201d (on Fox), this redo of \u201cRocky Horror\u201d \u2014 a beloved if quirky musical that is not held in quite the same regard as those other enduring stage works \u2014 is its own strange experiment. It will test whether a decades-old musical about science-fiction B-movies and all kinds of sexual awakenings is still relevant or has grown quaint, and whether a \u201cRocky Horror\u201d movie made with some polish and preparation is still \u201cRocky Horror\u201d at all.\u201c\u2018Rocky Horror\u2019 really has a mind of its own, and that mind is the fan base,\u201d said Lou Adler, a producer of the original film and the remake.\u201cThey would like me to do nothing \u2014 they want it to be theirs, and in a way, they have every right to,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to, in the right way, expose it to as many people as possible.\u201dWhile Ms. Cox continued to strut her stuff for her ballroom guests, Mr. Adler, a longtime music producer for Carole King and the Mamas & the Papas, sat in one of the castle\u2019s vast hallways, recalling how he first saw \u201cRocky Horror\u201d in the early 1970s as a London stage musical (featuring Mr. Curry as Frank and Mr. O\u2019Brien as Riff Raff).In recent years, and over several administrations at Fox, Mr. Adler had discussed the possibility of a film or TV remake, with some wariness about whether \u201cRocky Horror\u201d still had something to say to a contemporary audience.\u201cIn 1975, it broke through to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had real effects, socially and culturally. I don\u2019t know if that movie would have the same effect on 18-, 19-, 20-year-olds now.\u201dMr. Ortega, who has directed and choreographed concert tours for Michael Jackson and Gloria Estefan, was introduced to \u201cRocky Horror\u201d when the stage musical came to the Roxy Theater in Los Angeles in 1974. To make the film again with the same script, same characters and same music, Mr. Ortega said, \u201cThere has to be a reason\u201d \u2014 one that he said would have to originate with whoever was chosen to play Frank.\u201cWe put a list together of awesome, triple-threat people that we thought would have the spunk and good humor to inhabit the character,\u201d Mr. Ortega said, that included Jonathan Groff, Matt Bomer and Lady Gaga.\u201cWhen the idea for Laverne came up, that took that away,\u201d Mr. Adler said. \u201cWin or lose, she was not going to be compared to Tim.\u201dMs. Cox, a star of Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d said that seeing the original movie and Mr. Curry\u2019s give-it-all performance had been important personal milestones for her when she was an undergraduate at Indiana University in Bloomington.\u201cI was gender nonconforming,\u201d she said. \u201cI was wearing dresses in college and had a shaved head, and there was this character who was this wonderful validation of who I was.\u201dStill, the initial announcement of Ms. Cox\u2019s casting in \u201cRocky Horror\u201d elicited some wary responses from potential viewers who worried the project might be mocking transgender people.Amid a broader conversation about identity, Mr. O\u2019Brien, who considers himself gender fluid, said in a March interview with British media: \u201cYou can be an idea of a woman. You\u2019re in the middle, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201dMs. Cox said that when she was approached about \u201cRocky Horror,\u201d she had some apprehension about playing a character who identifies as a transvestite, a term sometimes used as a slur against transgender people. (In the remake, Dr. Frank-N-Furter is, like Ms. Cox, a trans woman, and uses the pronoun she.)But after Ms. Cox researched earlier transgender activists like Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson, who, in the \u201970s era of \u201cRocky Horror\u201d founded the Street Transgender Action Revolutionaries and referred to themselves as transvestites, she became more comfortable with the idea.\u201cI certainly don\u2019t identify as a transvestite, and that word should never be used to describe me,\u201d Ms. Cox said. \u201cBut as an actress, I play a lot of things that I don\u2019t necessarily identify as.\u201dShe added, \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten to play the role of a scientist who creates life, who\u2019s sexy and sensual, and who murders someone in front of everyone and goes on later to eat them for dinner.\u201d\u201cThis is a fantasy,\u201d she said.Ms. Cox spent several weeks training privately with dance, acting and voice coaches to prepare for her screen test last fall, and most of her co-stars were auditioned several times before they joined the project, starting with the cast recording session at Mr. Adler\u2019s home studio in Malibu, Calif., this past winter.Compared with its low-budget predecessor, for which friends and family members were recruited to fill out the ensemble of Transylvanian partygoers, the new \u201cRocky Horror\u201d is much more meticulously choreographed by Mr. Ortega and Tony Testa. If their results lack the endearing sloppiness of the original, that\u2019s the point.As Mr. McCartan said of the first \u201cRocky Horror\u201d: \u201cThey didn\u2019t make that movie thinking, this is going to last for 40 years. It was brilliant because it was rough around the edges. The hope is that our movie is going to be great because it\u2019s precise. We already have a little bit of contrast there.\u201dStill, no one is sure how this remake will play in the current cultural environment.\u201cWe all got home, and there was this Twitter firestorm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shocking, what some people\u2019s response was to seeing these beautiful men in drag as beautiful women. It was a great reminder in that moment, how powerful our art is in opening people\u2019s eyes.\u201dBut if this \u201cRocky Horror\u201d works, Ms. Ashford suggested, then the floodgates could be open to all kinds of other TV musicals.\u201cPart of me is like, \u2018Great, can we do \u201cSweet Charity\u201d in two years?\u201d she said, citing the risqu\u00e9 1960s musical full of swiveling Bob Fosse choreography. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready. I\u2019m stretching right now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There would have been a gazebo in the center of town, something Washington Depot, one of the villages within the town, conspicuously lacks. But faced with these and other realities, the attendees cheerily persevered.They queued up in droves on the plaza to get a selfie with the beanie-wearing character Jackson (Jackson Douglas).Brittany White, 31, a schoolteacher, drove two hours from Rhode Island with her mother, Nancy. She was carrying a coffee mug she made that read \u201cLuke\u2019s,\u201d a reference to the greasy spoon diner run by the show\u2019s resident heartthrob, Luke Danes. Both women were on a high from having just met Kirk, another Stars Hollow resident.The town of Lorelai Gilmore, a single mom, and her daughter, Rory, has a walkable main street lined with family-owned businesses, a manicured village square, an old-fashioned soda shop, a cozy inn, a decent public high school, a \u201cChurchogogue\u201d for both Christian and Jewish worshipers, and a citizenry of quirky, literate, engaged residents who participate in local government. It is a civic formula that has proved elusive for fans who have sought a real-life version to move to.\u201cI noticed these main streets had a couple of boutiques here and there, but there wasn\u2019t a diner where you could get a burger,\u201d she said. \u201cOr there weren\u2019t people walking around. In Stars Hollow, you always see people walking around.\u201d (Indeed, they\u2019re called extras.)Vanessa Marano, another former cast member who was at the fan fest, is aware of the illusory quality of Stars Hollow whenever she auditions on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif., where the set remains more or less intact. \u201cIt does look like a small town,\u201d Ms. Marano said, \u201cbut you know you\u2019re on a set because there\u2019s equipment everywhere.\u201dWashington Depot does not have a strollable main street or a diner either, but since it is where Ms. Sherman-Palladino stayed, it was the natural setting for a gathering of the Gilmores. The festival was dreamed up by Jennie Whitaker and her husband, Marcus, fans of the series who run a public relations firm based in Austin, Tex. As frequently happens in Connecticut, they were stuck in traffic near Hartford during a road trip this past summer and got to wondering about Washington Depot and why it had never honored its claim to pop-culture fame.Back home, Ms. Whitaker contacted the town\u2019s board of selectmen and soon found herself sitting in Washington Depot\u2019s town hall and meeting with its community leaders, many of whom were men over 65 who had never watched the show.\u201cThere are many cults to which I have been drawn, but this was not one,\u201d said Dan Sherr, 75, a resident who met with the Whitakers and supported their idea.While the head selectman, Mark Lyon, eventually gave the Whitakers approval for the festival, he and the others were doubtful that anyone would show up. There were also some residents opposed to the festival altogether. But \u201cwe sold out the event in 10\u00bd hours,\u201d Ms. Whitaker said. \u201cPeople have wanted something like this for so long.\u201dAs if aware they were suddenly extras in a large production, many of the town\u2019s residents, particularly its savvier business owners, threw themselves into the festival.Jim Kelly turned over his law firm office to serve as a media hub and cast green room, while Liz Page offered free homemade chili and cornbread outside her gift shop, Newbury Place. Thanks to his squint-and-you-can-see-it resemblance to Luke, Ms. Page\u2019s brawny husband, Alan, found himself wildly popular as he manned the slow cooker.Jay Combs, an owner of the Washington Supply Company, set up a Formica table with place settings and transformed a corner of the hardware store into Luke\u2019s Diner. All day, the white-haired shop owner greeted would-be Lorelais and Rorys, borrowing their smartphones and trudging outside in the rain to snap souvenir pictures of them through the plate-glass window.\u201cThe fans are nuts, but not in a crazy way,\u201d Mr. Combs said.He added that \u201cbecause I\u2019m under siege, so to speak,\u201d he and his wife, like many town residents, have been watching \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and are on Season 3 (the year Rory graduates from high school).Throughout the day, Mr. Combs did hear rumblings from some fans who were disappointed that Washington Depot did not look more like Stars Hollow. A theory circulated that Ms. Sherman-Palladino had taken aspects of several nearby towns (the gazebo in New Milford, the main street of Kent) and Frankensteined the mythic community.It\u2019s a likely truth that Ms. Do, who did not attend the festival, had already discovered during her road trip. As in a wholesome TV show, though, in the end she learned a lesson.\u201cIt told me the only way to visit Stars Hollow,\u201d Ms. Do said, \u201cis to play an episode of \u2018Gilmore Girls.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of a caption with this article misspelled the surname of one of the \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d cast members.

{"Headline": "Time Warner\u2019s Non-Mogul Mogul Who Foretold Its Worth", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byJeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, made a big bet in the summer of 2014 when he rejected an $80 billion takeover bid by 21st Century Fox, controlled by Rupert Murdoch.Mr. Bewkes had promised shareholders that Time Warner would create more value on its own than any proposal Fox was positioned to offer. Privately, Mr. Bewkes was telling colleagues and investors that Time Warner was likely to land a much more lucrative deal if it were put on the market a couple of years later. Among the potential bidders, Time Warner reasoned, were deep-pocketed technology companies like Apple and Google \u2014 and even, possibly, AT&T, which was tied up with a different deal at the time.Over the next two years, it was not clear that Mr. Bewkes had played his cards right. Fears of cord-cutting, ratings declines and a weak advertising market stoked panic across the industry over the future of traditional media in a digital world. And while Time Warner introduced several efforts to transform the company, such as a stand-alone streaming service for HBO, questions persisted about whether the company would have the resources to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon.As it turns out, Mr. Bewkes\u2019s bet paid off. In a big way.On Saturday night, AT&T announced that it had agreed to buy Time Warner for about $85.4 billion, or $107.50 a share in cash and stock \u2014 about a 35 percent premium to where Time Warner\u2019s stock was trading before reports of the merger talks, and well above the $85 a share Fox was offering.AT&T and Time Warner promised to \u201clead the next wave of innovation\u201d as the worlds of media, communications and technology collide.\u201cFor Time Warner shareholders, the price is exceptional,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.And for Mr. Bewkes, the deal has sealed his legacy as a behind-the-scenes non-mogul media mogul.In an industry populated by larger-than-life executives like Mr. Murdoch and Sumner Redstone, whose activities have sometimes provided fodder for the gossip pages, Mr. Bewkes carved out a reputation as a personable numbers guy with a sense of humor and a low public profile. Mr. Bewkes lifted the company\u2019s stock price, slowly but surely, by disposing of assets, eventually making his company the most attractive takeover target in the media market.\u201cHe is not an executive that is cut from the old-school media mogul cloth,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura. \u201cHis legacy is very much that he did so well for shareholders, whereas another type of media executive, a personality like a Sumner Redstone, would want to continue to preside and reign over this powerful media empire.\u201dIn an interview on Sunday, Mr. Bewkes deferred a question on how he thought about the AT&T-Time Warner deal in the context of his own legacy as a media executive.\u201cI don\u2019t think of it as my legacy,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cI think of it as the great institution of Time Warner, which has had a mission in this world since Henry Luce invented the magazine in 1923 and actually invented talking pictures in the years since.\u201dMr. Bewkes, 64, has worked at Time Warner for more than three decades. He became the chief executive of the premium TV network HBO in 1995, where he helped raise the network\u2019s profile by pushing for more original programming. His purview expanded in 2002, when he was named chairman of the company\u2019s networks and entertainment division. And in 2008, Mr. Bewkes succeeded Richard Parsons in the chief executive\u2019s suite.At the time, the company was still reeling from its disastrous dot-com merger with AOL. Time Warner shares traded as low as $14. Mr. Bewkes whittled the company down, unloading Time Warner Cable, then AOL, then its Time Inc. magazine division. What remained was a focused and well-respected television and film company that owned HBO; Warner Bros. film and television studios; and cable networks including CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS.\u201cThat gave us the best choice of whether we wanted to consolidate another company into ours, or it made us the most valuable company if we wanted to consolidate with someone else, which is what we have now come to,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.But Mr. Bewkes was not ready to exercise those options in the summer of 2014, when Fox appeared with its takeover offer. He said that he had never doubted the decision, in large part because Time Warner management considered the deal to be worth much less than it initially seemed.On the day that the Fox deal was announced, the transaction was worth about $80 billion. But that deal was heavily tilted toward Fox stock, which has lost about a third of its value since then. In addition, the transaction required taking out a substantial loan to cover the cash portion, and Time Warner would have assumed part of that debt.As a result, Time Warner estimates that the Fox deal would be valued at about $70 per share today. The AT&T bid represents about a 60 percent premium over the Fox offer.\u201cWe knew all that,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cThat is why we didn\u2019t consider it.\u201dIt was a different story in August, when Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, visited Mr. Bewkes at Time Warner\u2019s headquarters in New York. The two executives discussed their views for the future of content and distribution amid the rise of streaming services that are blurring lines among the media, communication and technology industries. Their visions aligned, and a deal quickly fell into place.\u201cWe see a convergence,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cIt is not just creating content but introducing it to you as a viewer, wherever you go.\u201dAs an example, Mr. Bewkes pointed to more vigorous CNN offerings on mobile and better search and recommendation tools to discover HBO programming, whether a person is watching on a mobile phone, tablet or television set.Mr. Bewkes acknowledged that on its own, the media industry has been slow to put in effect new technologies that allow people to watch the programming they want to watch \u2014 when and how they want to watch it.\u201cLook at how slow some of these companies have been to put these innovations in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do things like that if we are together.\u201dOn Sunday, AT&T insisted that it would not try to influence its new assets in either the entertainment or news segments.\u201cOur intent is to operate Time Warner as it operates today, with autonomy in its divisions, including the world-class creative talent and journalists that make Time Warner a leader in entertainment and news,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said in a statement.\u201cCNN is an American symbol of independent journalism and First Amendment free speech,\u201d he added. \u201cMy board and I are clear \u2014 CNN will remain completely independent from an editorial perspective.\u201dAT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner is expected to face intense regulatory pressure, and if it is approved, the companies do not expect it to close until late 2017. Mr. Bewkes, whose contract with Time Warner runs through 2020, is planning to stay with the company through a yet-to-be-determined transition period.Analysts said that they expected many other Time Warner executives to continue in their roles, because AT&T is a telecom company with little experience in programming. That was yet another contrast to the Murdoch offer.\u201cAny offer that was made to Time Warner was prefaced with the notion that the key up-and-coming leadership within Time Warner would not be jettisoned,\u201d Mr. DiClemente said. \u201cThat tone, in general, is a little different than the Murdoch tone, which was perceived as the expectation that they would be working for Rupert, James and Lachlan Murdoch.\u201d\u201cCulturally, this is more of a reason why this fits,\u201d he added.Mr. Bewkes put it more bluntly. \u201cThis fell into place,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it is kind of obvious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A YouTube Star Is All In, Professionally and Personally", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byReleased on a weekend when the divorce battle between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt was playing out in classic Hollywood fashion, with the stars out of sight while proxies leaked competing stories, Ms. Ballinger\u2019s intensely personal video was a vivid demonstration of how a performer handles setbacks in an age when fans demand intimate access to her life. And while the celebrity-fan relationship is radically different in the online world, some aspects of it haven\u2019t changed all that much.When performers with that kind of reach hit rocky patches in their lives, we\u2019re accustomed to hearing complaints about intrusiveness and requests for privacy. In \u201cLife Update\u201d what we hear is anguish \u2014 and apology. Ms. Ballinger says four times that she\u2019s sorry, and she says it not in a general sense, or to Mr. Evans, but directly to her fans. \u201cYou\u2019ve lived with us at our house, it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re our kids and we have to tell you that we\u2019re divorcing,\u201d she said.The notion of the YouTube audience as the children of divorce \u2014 a dependent, personally involved group whose feelings must be taken into account \u2014 may exasperate some people, but Ms. Ballinger doesn\u2019t see it that way. Or at least she doesn\u2019t say so. She takes her responsibility to her viewers seriously \u2014 her divorce is \u201csomething I need to share with you, obviously,\u201d emphasis on the last word. She presents herself in time-honored guilty-parent fashion: \u201cI\u2019ve disappointed myself. I totally failed.\u201dAt the same time \u2014 and this is the most interesting thing about \u201cLife Update\u201d \u2014 she acknowledges that while she and Mr. Evans shared generously, there were limits: \u201cBut you know, we chose to not share with you the bad parts of our relationship.\u201dThis admission might sound like simple reticence or common sense, but it\u2019s in conflict with a central tenet of YouTube celebrity. What she\u2019s done is a modern take on traditional celebrity image management, presenting an airbrushed version of a turbulent life. (\u201cWe\u2019ve always butted heads and we\u2019ve always fought.\u201d) The difference is that she has acted as her own press agent.Ms. Ballinger may seem to contradict herself, but the contradictions are built into the YouTube model, in which revealing yourself attracts a larger audience and an ever-greater demand for revelation. That was true, on a less intense and personal level, for pre-internet celebrities. What\u2019s new is how upfront Ms. Ballinger is about her mixed feelings. \u201cI hate that I can\u2019t control\u201d the reaction, she says, even as she invites it. The imperative to share doesn\u2019t take away the need for privacy, and she sums up her dilemma nicely when she wishes for the impossible \u2014 that she could send \u201cLife Update\u201d individually to her true fans, \u201cso no one else would see it.\u201dIt\u2019s fair to wonder whether, or to what extent, \u201cLife Update\u201d is another performance for Ms. Ballinger, and how authentic the choked sobs and determined nods are, just as we wondered in the past when stars in sunglasses held emotional news conferences. (She looks to her left throughout the video, as if a script might be positioned there.) Perhaps it\u2019s an irrelevant distinction for the YouTube performer who thoroughly integrates life and work. One thing is clear: If it\u2019s a performance, it\u2019s a good one.Toward the end of the video, Ms. Ballinger says she\u2019s executing the modern equivalent of the old-time star\u2019s retreat into seclusion. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a break from the internet for a little bit,\u201d she says. But it\u2019s hard to break up with YouTube, even when you\u2019ve moved up to a full-fledged Netflix series that fleshes out your online character\u2019s back story.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jared Kushner Talks of a Trump TV Network With a Media Deal Maker", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump\u2019s son-in-law has discussed the possibility of a Trump-branded television network with a friend who has helped guide such deals.Jared Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s older daughter, Ivanka, had conversations about the idea with Aryeh B. Bourkoff, the chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment bank that has helped advise media deals.But such an effort, reported earlier on Monday by The Financial Times, would face enormous obstacles: Creating a television network would require a major cash investment, as well as a willingness by cable providers to carry the network. Without both, discussions of a television network would remain in the realm of fantasy.About a month ago, Mr. Kushner informally reached out to Mr. Bourkoff, a veteran media investment banker, about setting up a Trump television channel, according to a person briefed on the matter. But the conversation with Mr. Bourkoff was brief and has not progressed since, and the banker is unlikely to work on such a network, this person added. Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bourkoff are friends and speak frequently.A spokesman for LionTree declined to comment. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.Within Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, top aides over the summer made reference to the possibility of running a media holding after the election, guided by the belief that the Republican nominee would win and such a property could help bolster his agenda, according to a person with direct knowledge of those discussions, who also asked for anonymity.People close to the Trump campaign have noted the emphasis that Mr. Kushner has placed on digital advertising, as Mr. Parscale has amassed data that has limited applicable use in a political race.But Mr. Trump himself is said to have expressed limited enthusiasm for the idea of \u201cTrump TV.\u201dMr. Trump, who historically gets investors for his major projects, seems unlikely to put in large amounts of his own cash into a potentially risky venture.What\u2019s more, major cable providers like Charter, Time Warner Cable and Comcast might be reluctant to give Mr. Trump visibility by putting a Trump channel in their lineup.When Rupert Murdoch created Fox News two decades ago, he faced hurdles in getting a channel from Time Warner Cable. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, helped broker a deal by which Fox would be aired broadly. Mr. Giuliani is now an adviser to Mr. Trump.Starting a TV network is no easy feat, as Oprah Winfrey, the popular daytime host turned media mogul, learned.In January 2008, Ms. Winfrey announced with much fanfare that she was teaming up with the media group Discovery Communications to start OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network. Ms. Winfrey would take on responsibility for the programming, while Discovery planned to convert its Discovery Health network to the new venture and help with distribution and other operations. OWN was expected to make its debut the next year.But Ms. Winfrey struggled out of the gate. The start was delayed until January 2011, in part because of issues with programming the round-the-clock network. Discovery invested more than $500 million. It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the network broke even.That was all during an easier time for television networks, before they faced such competition from streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.The experience is a lesson for anyone in just how arduous and costly it is to start a television network, land distribution, attract viewers and, ultimately, make money.Michael de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Haters Back Off!\u2019 a Cringe-Worthy Star Is Born", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byNetflix helped popularize the binge-watch. With \u201cHaters Back Off!,\u201d which begins streaming on Friday, it introduces the cringe-watch.In this eight-episode first season, Colleen Ballinger plays Miranda Sings, an aspiring YouTube singing personality, whose singing and personality are both grating. Armored with an unfounded sense of self-esteem, a buttoned-to-the-neck striped shirt and about five pounds of lipstick, she strikes out to claim the fame she believes is her destiny.If talent without persistence is a tragedy, \u201cHaters\u201d believes that persistence without talent is a comedy. And, boy, is it a painful one \u2014 sometimes hilariously, sometimes just uncomfortably.\u201cHaters\u201d is following the web-to-mainstream path of HBO\u2019s \u201cHigh Maintenance\u201d and \u201cInsecure\u201d (which follows in the spirit of \u201cThe Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl\u201d web series, created in part by Issa Rae).Adapting \u201cHaters\u201d is a bigger leap. Miranda\u2019s deluded caterwauling is one thing in short videos. Extended to half-hour episodes, it makes for a lot of concentrated sourness.\u201cHaters\u201d builds Miranda\u2019s story out, drawing on the web videos, giving her a family, friends \u2014 well, people she knows \u2014 and an arc. Her creepily doting Uncle Jim (Steve Little, \u201cEastbound & Down\u201d) has an equally deluded dream of managing Miranda through a \u201cfive-phase plan for fame.\u201dHer hypochondriac mother, Bethany (Angela Kinsey, \u201cThe Office\u201d), indulges her, to the consternation of Miranda\u2019s levelheaded sister, Emily (Francesca Reale), while her smitten, sweetly dim neighbor Patrick (Erik Stocklin) lets her use him as a servant. Miranda hasn\u2019t achieved fame, but it has already ruined her.Making Miranda the despot of her tiny kingdom keeps \u201cHaters\u201d from feeling downright cruel to her, but it\u2019s still harsh. There are reminders here of other comedies of the grotesque: \u201cStrangers With Candy,\u201d \u201cNapoleon Dynamite,\u201d the character spoofs of Chris Lilley, the more vicious bits of \u201cGlee.\u201d (Miranda is a little like a twisted voodoo-doll version of Rachel Berry.)The season is scattered with inspiredly weird set pieces, like a fan-fic production of \u201cAnnie\u201d in which Daddy Warbucks and his orphan adoptee are romantically involved. Like Miranda\u2019s performances, \u201cHaters\u201d can be terrible and transfixing at the same time.Some viewers who are not already committed Mirandites may not stick around for more than a few minutes. The beginning episode opens with Miranda mewling out a cover of \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d which she immediately uploads to YouTube, mistitled \u201cMy Fist Video.\u201d The performance is an off-key warning siren: This series is not for everyone.But it\u2019s striking how Ms. Ballinger commits to Miranda\u2019s hunger and histrionics. (\u201cLike the Lord said to Noah after he built the ark,\u201d she screams during one tantrum, \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this!\u201d) She contorts her face silent-movie-style, drooping her mouth into a clown\u2019s grimace, arching her eyebrows with cunning.The episodes sometimes veer into contempt for the characters. There\u2019s a deeper pathos to Miranda\u2019s situation, but the season doesn\u2019t delve deeply into that until late, by which time haters will have long since backed off.There\u2019s a lot in \u201cHaters Back Off!\u201d to gratify Ms. Ballinger\u2019s YouTube fan base. For anyone willing to acquire the taste, I might suggest the opposite of a binge \u2014 an episode at a time, with frequent breaks. Beyond the winces, there\u2019s something human in its comedy of internet thirst: the insatiable drive to put a piece of oneself out into the world and hit refresh, refresh, refresh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Iran, Exerting Force While Making Nice Is Part of the Plan", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byWhat would seem to be a puzzling contradiction is in fact a carefully thought-out, two-track policy being pursued by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the circle of leaders around him.In addition to sanctioning the country\u2019s more aggressive military footprint in the region, Ayatollah Khamenei regularly issues broadsides against the United States, promising there will be no softening of Tehran\u2019s stance against the Great Satan, while quietly opening the door to Western capital and expertise.And yet, when President Hassan Rouhani faces attacks from hard-liners, Ayatollah Khamenei almost always has his back, at least in private.With the region in such turmoil, this might seem like an inopportune time to soften restrictions on business dealings with the West and personal freedoms at home. But that seems to be exactly what is happening. The changes are incremental and can be turned back at any moment, but they are unmistakable, analysts say.The most obvious change is in politics. After dominating for 15 years, Iran\u2019s hard-line faction \u2014 a conservative elite of clerics, military leaders and politicians \u2014 has suffered a string of defeats.Their figurehead, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former president, became the symbol of a nation refusing any form of compromise. \u201cNever, ever will Iran compromise on its nuclear program,\u201d Mr. Ahmadinejad often promised.But in 2012, a year before Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s term ended, Ayatollah Khamenei allowed his representatives to contact the United States to discuss exactly such a compromise.Since then, the hard-liners have lost battle after battle to a group of technocrats and moderates who were the only ones in the country\u2019s small establishment able to talk to the West.For two years during the nuclear talks with the United States and other world powers, the hard-liners spoke out against any compromise. They lost. Parliamentary elections? Lost.The hard-liners spoke out against foreign investment, internet freedoms, more visits by foreigners, concerts and fewer morality police on the streets. On all those issues, they lost or were largely ignored.And that is no accident, analysts say.It stems from Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s decision to ease Iran away \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 from a rigid interpretation of its revolutionary ideology and end the isolation that has hampered the economy and frustrated young Iranians yearning to live in a \u201cnormal\u201d country.At 77, and with at least one hospitalization in recent years for prostate cancer, Ayatollah Khamenei appears determined, while he still has full power, to make the changes essential for Iran to realign relations with the world, analysts say.\u201cIn Mr. Khamenei\u2019s view, we should be like China,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst with close ties to the hard-liners. \u201cHave economic relations with the West, but without their political influence and neo-colonization.\u201dThus, visa restrictions have been eased and foreign investment policies relaxed, while Iranian diplomats are spreading a message of Iran as the last major untapped market in the world.\u201cWe need Western know-how and Western investments,\u201d said Mr. Laylaz, the economist. \u201cNow that the sanctions no longer stand in our way, we are reaching out to the West for their money and knowledge. But, of course, we do not want their politics.\u201dRene Harun, a German expatriate and the managing director of the German-Iranian Chamber of Industry and Commerce, speaks of \u201ca new era\u201d in the Islamic republic. \u201cThe government is taking big steps in order to improve business,\u201d he said.In recent months, average Iranians have noticed some welcome changes, too. The internet, long kept at a snail\u2019s pace by the authorities, is noticeably faster \u2014 enough to watch videos online, something that never had been possible. State television has created new digital channels, introducing more comedies and even a Persian version of Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201dParliament, free of domination by hard-liners for the first time in over a decade, has asked for restrictions on capital punishment, more press freedoms and the reinstatement of a reformist female politician who was barred after appearing in pictures without the obligatory Islamic head scarf.\u201cOver all there is hope, and while we should see how that plays out and how much time it will take, people are looking towards the future more than before,\u201d said Nazanin Daneshvar, the female chief executive of Takhfifan, a discount shopping website.At the same time, Ayatollah Khamenei goes out of his way in public pronouncements to reassure his hard-line supporters that their vision of a conservative Islamic theocracy in opposition to America and the West still holds sway. In a speech last week, for example, he said that \u201cproblems between Iran and the United States will never be resolved.\u201dAyatollah Khamenei also issues frequent warnings about the Islamic State, at its core a violent Sunni insurgency that poses a threat to Shiite Iran. Either fight the militants in Syria, he says, or fight them in the western Iranian cities of Kermanshah and Hamadan.While the country\u2019s military adventures seem far removed from daily life for many Iranians, they do align with the public\u2019s often nationalistic views. \u201cIran should be strong and influential,\u201d said Mohammad Heydari, a former journalist. \u201cJust look at the map, see where we are located and how large our country is, and you\u2019ll understand.\u201dPublicly, Ayatollah Khamenei often criticizes the nuclear agreement, but the most influential hard-liners understand that he was the architect of the pact. He also did not stop discussions between Boeing and the national carrier, Iran Air, even though the deal that is emerging will mean large-scale business relations with the United States.\u201cA lot of things in Iran are said for domestic consumption,\u201d said Amir Kavian, a political analyst close to Iran\u2019s reform movement. \u201cWe should not take everything seriously. Actions speak louder than words.\u201dBoth Iran\u2019s partial opening up to the West and its involvement in Middle East conflicts are directed by Ayatollah Khamenei, analysts say.\u201cAll top foreign and domestic policies are commanded by the leader,\u201d said Mr. Taraghi, the hard-line political analyst. Still, he said, Westerners should not hold out hope of deep and significant changes in Iran.Advertisement"}

When I visited him at the hospital, days later, he was still sedated and hooked up to a number of machines. (His prognosis is good.) The night before the accident, he got his first D.U.I. Clearly, he is an alcoholic. His parents are dead, and his sister lives several states away. May I tell her that he has a drinking problem? I don\u2019t want to tattle, but I\u2019m not sure if she even knows about the accident. I don\u2019t want him to keep drinking and driving, possibly killing himself and others.ADAM, WYOMINGYes, but with a small attitude adjustment. No one should ever get behind the wheel drunk. But let\u2019s acknowledge we have all been (or will be) your friend at some point. Maybe not with drugs or alcohol, but with something: food, sex, binge-watching Netflix. Every life comes with brutal passages. Who wouldn\u2019t reach for some kind of anesthesia? And at some point, we all need help.So, get on the horn with the sister, but not with a label or a diagnosis. Tell her that her brother is hurting and needs help. Don\u2019t just hand the problem off. You are clearly a menschy guy. Help assemble a support team: friends, hospital resources, the 12-step community. Of course, he must decide for himself that he wants help. Let\u2019s hope he will. Let\u2019s also hope there will be an Adam in our lives when we need him.My husband and I live in Europe. We were invited to my nephew\u2019s wedding in Miami, and we calculate that it will cost us $3,000 to attend (with air fare, hotels, etc.) Would it be tacky to offer my nephew the choice of a $3,000 check (in which case we would not travel to the wedding) or our attendance (with a token gift)? We would rather not go.C.K., COPENHAGENTacky-with-a-capital-T! Why make a disingenuous offer and your poor nephew feel like a money-grubber for choosing your preferred outcome? Simply send your regrets and a generous gift. Invitations are not subpoenas.ANONYMOUSYou got it! It\u2019s a theme column (with a brief wedding interlude). Please see Question 1. But let\u2019s add: Teachers at boarding schools often assume quasi-parental responsibilities: driving students to athletic matches or debates at other campuses, supervising dormitories. And like their public-school peers, boarding students are entitled to learn geometry from teachers who are sober.Other than that one early-morning swig (which is incriminating), there isn\u2019t a mountain of evidence here. Don\u2019t dog your colleague with more invitations to 12-step meetings. It was kind of you, but he didn\u2019t take you up on it.Still, for the safety of the community, and probably the teacher himself, make a confidential report to the head of the employee-assistance program, which helps employees with personal problems that affect their work. When employers go to the trouble of instituting benefit programs, the least we can do is use them.I recently self-published a memoir.

Don\u2019t let anyone stop you.\u2018Jane the Virgin,\u2019 9 p.m., The CWOh, thank God, \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d is finally back. The show\u2019s third season picks up right where Season 2 left off and will be tough for new viewers to fully grasp. Given that \u201cJane\u201d is one of the best shows on TV, though, I heartily encourage you to get on board. And to bring tissues when you do. This is a crying show.\u201830 for 30: Phi Slama Jama,\u2019 8 p.m., ESPNThe latest \u201c30 for 30\u201d documentary covers the University of Houston\u2019s hot streak in the early \u201980s, but unlike lots of other installments in the anthology series, or sports documentaries in general, \u201cPhi Slama Jama\u201d is about losing the big game.There\u2019s a poignant sequence where we see several players in the present day rewatch game footage of their young selves in what, for some, remains the highest-profile game of their basketball careers. The doc also tries to track down Benny Anders, a star from the team who has basically vanished from public life.As always, the vintage b-roll and jazzy montages fit right into the pleasure receptors in one\u2019s brain, but the real intrigue in \u201cSlama\u201d is its approach to the flip side of all the excitement and enthusiasm.\u2018Chance,\u2019 Hulu (New Series, Two-Episode Premiere)If there\u2019s a more instantly depressing opening sequence in recent TV history than that of \u201cChance,\u201d I can\u2019t think of it.

Gretchen Mol plays his new patient, who presents with possible dissociative identity disorder. So many sad glances, so many sad establishing shots. Look at the sad, sad Golden Gate Sad. Laurie\u2019s character is named Dr. Eldon Chance, which made me roll my eyes so hard I died.

This shouldn\u2019t be a contest at all, and the show needs to move past it, ASAP.

I have no idea who possibly could be. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t make a better version of \u201cRocky Horror\u201d \u2014 one certainly could. But what would a \u201cgood\u201d remake of \u201cR.H.P.S.\u201d even mean? Part of the point of \u201cRocky Horror\u201d is its production, values the lack of polish. The charisma bursts out of the shabbiness.Unlike several other recent TV musicals, this glossy revival is not live, which adds another layer of prim detachment. This is exacerbated by a framing mechanism where we occasionally see a movie theater crowd doing the classic audience participation gags (like pulling out newspapers during the rainstorm). The vocal performances are fine, although some of the arrangements feel a little sterile, especially \u201cEddie.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t dream it; be it,\u201d \u201cRocky Horror\u201d tells us. In this case, maybe leaving things in the dream realm would have been acceptable.Is \u201cShows You Should Watch While Working Out\u201d an established genre? If so, what are some good shows in this category?I need something to watch to take my mind off the inherent boredom of being on a treadmill, elliptical, etc. Preferably something that has an action-oriented plot, attractive people and high emotion, all of which are good motivators to keep the endorphins going.\u201cQuantico\u201d and \u201cBlindspot\u201d were my go-tos for this until I realized they were both dumber than my treadmill. \u2014 ScottDear Scott,I\u2019m pretty sure this is what superhero TV shows are designed for \u2014 and both Netflix and The CW have more than a few. If watching a few episodes of \u201cArrow\u201d doesn\u2019t make you want to work out harder, perhaps nothing will. Those arms! Those abs! Those arrows! \u201cArrow\u201d starts a little slow but picks up eventually, and Season 2 in particular is big and exciting. The show runs out of juice around Season 4, but there\u2019s plenty more superhero fare to choose from.If you want more punching and misery, there\u2019s \u201cDaredevil,\u201d whose story is not great, but whose fight sequences are wonderful. If you want more verve and unintentional goofiness, try \u201cThe Flash.\u201dIf you want to see a woman achieve things, try \u201cSupergirl.\u201d If you want an ensemble of heroes, try \u201cLegends of Tomorrow.\u201d If you want no actual superheroes but just a bunch of sad cops, try \u201cGotham.\u201d (Just kidding! Don\u2019t bother with \u201cGotham.\u201d) \u201cJessica Jones\u201d and \u201cLuke Cage\u201d are a significantly more serious and don\u2019t strike me as gym shows, but your treadmill mileage might vary from mine.If you work out at home, perhaps \u201cSpartacus\u201d will fit the bill. It\u2019s a swords-and-sandals show with a brain, but also a ton of nudity, so it\u2019s not appropriate to watch in public.Much safer for public consumption are \u201cAlias\u201d and \u201cChuck,\u201d two similar action shows about regular-seeming white people (Jennifer Garner and Zachary Levi) who are actually secret agents involved in dangerous espionage. They both experience substantial heartache, both in and out of their spying organizations. \u201cAlias\u201d has more explosions, and \u201cChuck\u201d has more jokes.I think you might actually do best with something completely different, though. If you were drawn to shows like \u201cQuantico\u201d and \u201cBlindspot,\u201d I think you\u2019re mistaking an appetite for action with an appetite for splashiness. Consider a soap. If you want something violent and plot-driven, \u201cRevenge\u201d is a rich-people saga about an assassin. So many tuxedos gave their lives for this show. R.I.P., all those tuxedos.Less violent but more enraging? Try \u201cThe Affair.\u201d There\u2019s no action, really, in the sense of chases or gunplay or anything. But everyone is a frustrating combination of attractive, lousy-as-a-human and stupid. My god, are they stupid. That sensation of \u201cget a grip, you vile ding-dongs who don\u2019t deserve wealth\u201d almost feels like running.Advertisement"}
