{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Is Being Hypocritical", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThe Supreme Court\u2019s motto may be \u201cequal justice under law.\u201d But sometimes it seems more like \u201cdo as we say, not as we do.\u201dConsider Williams v. Pennsylvania, a case the court heard in February concerning whether a state judge should have recused himself from a capital case in which he had an earlier involvement. At one point during the hearing, Justice Elena Kagan, who participated in both Supreme Court lawsuits concerning the Affordable Care Act despite having served as solicitor general in the Obama administration, asked what would constitute \u201csignificant involvement\u201d in a case \u2014 i.e., enough to require a recusal.The answer to that question may not be obvious. But surely Justice Kagan\u2019s experience in the Obama administration constituted \u201csignificant involvement\u201d in the Affordable Care Act cases. In the end, a majority of justices, including Justice Kagan, ruled in Williams v. Pennsylvania that the judge who refused to recuse himself should have stepped aside.So went another case in what I call the court\u2019s self-referential docket. Each year, the justices hear a handful of suits that have parallels with how they act as stewards of their institution. But instead of changing their own practices in light of their holdings in these cases, the justices too often carry on as before, as if they can play by their own rules when it comes to transparency and accountability.In recent years there have been a number of such cases concerning money and the potential for judicial corruption. In 2015, for example, the court ruled that the Florida Bar was within its rights to discipline a judge for personally soliciting campaign contributions. The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., held that there was a \u201cvital state interest in safeguarding public confidence in the fairness and integrity\u201d of the nation\u2019s judges.But if there is a vital interest in the integrity of the court, why was Justice Stephen G. Breyer allowed to rule on a case last fall in which his wife held about $33,000 worth of stock in a company whose subsidiary was one of the litigants? Or how about the $400,000 worth of shares that Chief Justice Roberts owned in Intel, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which all signed amicus briefs supporting Walmart in a 2011 class-action lawsuit before the court? (Chief Justice Roberts voted in favor of Walmart in that case.)Other cases have concerned the First Amendment\u2019s protection of speech. In May, the Supreme Court considered whether to review a circuit court\u2019s decision that upheld the conviction of a Maryland man for carrying a placard in protest in the middle of the Supreme Court\u2019s plaza. A lower court had deemed unconstitutional part of the 1949 law under which the man was prosecuted, which had banned protests in that plaza, but the circuit court overruled the decision. The justices decided not to hear the case, effectively condoning an anti-protest buffer zone in front of their courthouse \u2014 even though the Supreme Court has deemed anti-protest buffer zones around abortion clinics unconstitutional.Another ruling, from 1991, still looms over the court. In that case, Gregory v. Ashcroft, the court upheld a provision of Missouri\u2019s Constitution requiring state judges to retire at 70. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, writing for a majority that included Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, offered the following observation: \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact of life that physical and mental capacity sometimes diminish with age.\u201d Of course, Justice Scalia remained on the bench nearly a decade past his 70th birthday, and Justice Kennedy, who began his 30th term on the court this month, turned 80 over the summer.Just a week into the current term, there has already been a self-referential case. In Salman v. United States, argued on Oct. 5, the justices looked to reconcile two appeals courts\u2019 differing standards for what constitutes insider trading. Though the justices presumably don\u2019t give any thought to their investment portfolios when hearing cases, ample research has shown that their decisions do affect financial markets. Yet three justices \u2014 Justices Roberts, Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr. \u2014 maintain holdings in individual stocks and apparently do not place them in the types of investment accounts or blended funds that would shield them from any appearance of benefiting financially from their legal decisions.If the court wants to regain some of the respect it has lost in recent years, the justices should consider how, by acting more consistently with their own rulings, they could help build a more open and accountable institution.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "TD Ameritrade to Buy Scottrade in $4 Billion Deal", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byTD Ameritrade announced on Monday that it would acquire Scottrade Financial Services, a rival discount brokerage, for $4 billion, in a bid for scale at a time when small investors are losing their taste for stock trading.The deal reflects the ongoing evolution of the investment business.Both companies trace the roots of their business model to a regulatory move in 1975 that banned fixed brokerage commissions, giving rise to a clutch of firms, including Charles Schwab & Company, that offered stock trades with discounted commissions. Discount brokers continued to flourish in the dot-com era, when individual investors, day traders and smaller advisers helped drive a boom in online trading.But in the current market uncertainty, mom-and-pop investors are more reticent to buy and sell stocks. Index funds and other so-called passive investments have also gained favor, limiting interest in owning individual stocks.The industry is feeling the pressure. TD Ameritrade, for example, said on Monday that its average client trades per day declined 7 percent in the three months through September.The weak environment is driving a broad industry consolidation.The deal with Scottrade would give TD Ameritrade, which is based in Omaha, $944 billion in client assets and 10 million accounts. TD Ameritrade would also more than quadruple the size of its branch network.After the merger, Rodger Riney, the Scottrade founder and chief executive, would join TD Ameritrade\u2019s board.\u201cJoining forces will enable us to offer clients an expanded array of trading tools, enhanced education resources and advanced option capabilities with broader geographic reach,\u201d Mr. Riney said. \u201cTogether, we will be well-positioned to compete in today\u2019s rapidly evolving financial services industry.\u201dThe deal is expected to take place in two parts, with Toronto-Dominion Bank, one of TD Ameritrade\u2019s largest shareholders, first acquiring Scottrade\u2019s banking business for $1.3 billion in cash. Then, TD Ameritrade would acquire the privately held Scottrade for $2.7 billion in cash and stock.The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by the end of September 2017.Barclays and the law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz advised TD Ameritrade.

{"Headline": "Trump, the Next Big Short", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byA Republican billionaire entrepreneur runs for president on a platform of huge tax cuts for the rich and for business and yet, when his candidacy appears ascendant, the markets swoon.When the prospects brighten for his Democratic challenger \u2014 who has not held a private sector job in more than two decades and who is proposing tax increases for the wealthy \u2014 stocks climb.This is yet another paradox of the tumultuous candidacy of Donald J. Trump: He has spent his entire career among business executives, and yet that constituency is voting with hard cash that he should not be president.I understand that Mr. Trump has pitched his campaign more to white working-class Americans. But no Republican presidential hopeful in memory has been so unpopular in the business community, as one of the prime thermometers of the private sector \u2014 the stock market \u2014 indicates.At a board meeting two weeks ago, I chatted separately with two prominent Republican businessmen. One, the chief executive of a Fortune 100 company, said that he had never voted for a Democrat but couldn\u2019t support Mr. Trump.The other, a private equity investor who had voted Republican only once, said that he was so scared of a Trump presidency that he has donated \u201cevery cent possible\u201d under the campaign finance rules to Hillary Clinton.Even before the tape of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 comments about women became public, many executives were appalled by his temperament and judgment. They also find his economic policy positions \u2013 from his trade-bashing to his budget-busting tax cuts \u2013 terrifying.According to a recent compilation by The Wall Street Journal, not a single chief executive of a Fortune 100 company has donated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign or endorsed him. In contrast, Hillary Clinton has received contributions from 11 of these corporate chieftains. In 2012, nearly a third of this group supported Mitt Romney, while just five donated to President Obama.As Mrs. Clinton\u2019s dominance of the first presidential debate became apparent, investors cheered; markets around the world rose and the dollar strengthened. A report from Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis forecasting firm, estimated that a Trump victory would cause stocks to lose 7 percent, while a Clinton victory would lead to a 4 percent increase.In a poll by Bloomberg Politics (conducted in August, before Mr. Trump\u2019s recent rocky spell), 46 percent of those with more than $50,000 invested in the market preferred Mrs. Clinton, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Trump.They are not alone. The National Association for Business Economics surveyed 414 members, and Mr. Trump didn\u2019t even come in second. Mrs. Clinton was supported by 55 percent, while the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, received 15 percent, and the Republican hopeful trailed at 14 percent.Another group of economists is similarly unenthusiastic. A Wall Street Journal survey of 45 former members of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers found not one who would endorse Mr. Trump. (Some did not respond or wouldn\u2019t say.)At the top of business\u2019 fears is Mr. Trump\u2019s stance on trade. While Mrs. Clinton has also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Trump has taken trade-bashing to a new level, threatening retaliatory moves like putting 35 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and 45 percent on those from China.A recent study by the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated that, rather than bringing jobs back to the United States, the tariffs would result in trade wars that could cost our economy five million jobs and possibly lead to a recession.His other economic policies also often cause alarm. In repeatedly attacking the Federal Reserve as being \u201cpolitical,\u201d Mr. Trump has ignored decades of almost entirely consensus decision making by the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The committee is a model of rational, nonpartisan judgment compared with the Supreme Court, which often breaks along political lines.And while businessmen surely like tax cuts \u2014 especially for themselves \u2014 they worry over the magnitude of Mr. Trump\u2019s reductions and the lack of any specificity about how he would pay for them. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Trump tax policies would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.Lastly, people in business are repelled on both moral and economic grounds by Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to deport more than 11 million illegal immigrants, which the conservative American Action Forum calculated would cost $400 billion to $600 billion, reduce gross domestic product by $1.6 trillion and take 20 years.All told, Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that under Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, unemployment would rise to nearly 7 percent, and about three million jobs would be lost.With metronomic regularity in his stump appearances, Mr. Trump promotes his qualifications as a billionaire businessman to fix what ails our economy. But his peers in the business world don\u2019t agree.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T Aims for an Empire in Merger Talks With Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byFor companies that sell consumers cable and internet service, merely distributing entertainment and programs is not enough. They want to own them.The media conglomerate Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN and the movie studio Warner Bros., has long been among the most prized takeover targets.It is being courted by AT&T, a telecommunications giant that lacks ownership of any of the shows and videos it delivers through its various businesses. The two are in advanced talks for AT&T to acquire Time Warner, and a deal may be announced as early as Monday, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.A merger would come at a pivotal time in the communications industry, where the giants are scrambling to create entertainment empires to maintain competitiveness as consumers increasingly embrace cheaper, digital alternatives.Regulators have been wary of allowing combinations of businesses that could create less competition and thwart innovation by start-ups, and a tie-up of AT&T and Time Warner could raise concerns. It is a bold move in an election year that will usher in a new administration and a fresh set of regulators.Time Warner is asking AT&T to pay more than $90 a share in the deal, said the people who asked not to be named because the details are still private.The transaction is not yet final and may fall apart or get delayed, said the people with knowledge of the discussions. Representatives from Time Warner and AT&T declined to comment.A combination with AT&T would be an about-face from Time Warner\u2019s strategy just seven years ago. The company divested Time Warner Cable in 2009, and Time Inc. in 2014, in order to focus on developing programs and entertainment.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Still, AT&T has historically been less aggressive than its peers in building a content empire. It was a losing bidder for Yahoo, for example.AT&T has a tendency to acquire industry leaders. In the media world that would be Time Warner and Disney, and Disney\u2019s $150 billion market valuation makes it a much larger takeover to swallow. Two other companies, Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family, have been exploring a reunification.The biggest question posed by analysts after Bloomberg News first reported the talks on Thursday is whether or not this transaction would pass regulatory muster. Regulators including the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department have historically been skeptical of similar combinations.\u201cAt best, we believe a lengthy antitrust review of T/TWX with an uncertain outcome may give both sides pause on considering a combination,\u201d Credit Suisse research analysts wrote in a note on Thursday using the ticker symbols for AT&T and Time Warner. \u201cAt worst, it may act as a barrier to a deal being proposed, in our view.\u201dAdditionally, it is an audacious move with the presidential election just around the corner, which will most likely yield a reshaping of the top regulators that will study this deal. Hillary Clinton has promised to be tough on corporate mega-powers and consolidation within industries. Most analysts have surmised that a deal between AT&T and Time Warner would carry a significant amount of regulatory scrutiny.For Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, signing a deal may be worth the risk, if AT&T is willing to pay both a high enough price and a generous breakup fee in the event that the combination is blocked, said Richard S. Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.In addition to the potential regulatory challenges, an acquisition of Time Warner would be a large one for AT&T to digest. The combined company would have about $150 billion worth of debt, with around $175 billion in annual revenue. In a low-interest rate environment, financing of such large deals has been more prudent.Some analysts are skeptical that AT&T could handle the deal. AT&T has said its \u201cplate is full\u201d in absorbing DirecTV, Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said in a note.Time Warner itself is no stranger to slicing and merging. The company is a byproduct of a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1989, which created the largest media conglomerate in the world at the time, with cable, publishing and movie assets. Seven years later, the company acquired Turner Broadcasting, bringing the cable network CNN under its wing.In 2000, Time Warner merged with AOL, a combination that has since been seen as one of the largest mistakes ever in deal making. Nine years later, Time Warner said it would spin off AOL at a fraction of its valuation after the dot-com bubble burst.These days, Time Warner\u2019s units comprise premium channels such as HBO and Cinemax, as well as Turner, which operates TBS, Turner Sports and others, in addition to CNN. Time Warner also runs Warner Bros. Entertainment, which released movies including \u201cSully,\u201d \u201cStorks\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d this year.If the deal between AT&T and Time Warner succeeds, other media and entertainment companies could become takeover targets. Many stocks in that industry gained on Friday as more reports surfaced about the deal.Time Warner\u2019s shares gained 7.8 percent on Friday to $89.48, while AT&T\u2019s declined 3 percent to $37.49.Michael J. de la Merced and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

If there\u2019s a match with a plane linked to an authoritarian government, it posts a tweet.\u201cSwitzerland is still one of the best places for corrupt dictators to hide their money,\u201d Mr. Pilet said. \u201cEvery time we see dictators arrive in Geneva, we should ask ourselves, Why is this guy coming?\u201dPatrick Boehler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Climb Under Heavy Clouds", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Despite the prospect of higher interest rates, the imminent presidential election and heightened uncertainty in Europe, shares have for the most part risen.Supported byThe Federal Reserve still hasn\u2019t raised interest rates, though it insists that an increase is just around the corner. An even bigger decision that cannot be put off \u2014 it will be made by American voters on Nov. 8 \u2014 is stirring concern all over the world.Stock prices have for the most part risen, all the same. Even with the prospect of higher interest rates, the imminent presidential election and heightened uncertainty in Europe, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 3.3 percent in the third quarter, to 2,168.27.How much longer the Fed\u2019s easy monetary policy will continue to placate Wall Street is anyone\u2019s guess. But with little evidence that keeping interest rates just above zero at this stage appreciably bolsters the economy and businesses \u2014 and with stocks and bonds already expensive \u2014 the best guess of some advisers is that the strategy may not help investors much longer.The Fed may be at risk of inflating a bubble, but portfolio managers have preferred, though reluctantly in some cases, to be inside it rather than outside. But with returns from loose monetary policy diminishing in the economy and in stocks \u2014 the market isn\u2019t much higher now than it was in the spring of 2015 \u2014 some investors are becoming concerned.\u201cI think we are reaching the limits of how much central banks can stimulate the market,\u201d said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consulting firm. \u201cThe equity market has kept going on liquidity, not fundamentals. Now we\u2019re reaching the stage where liquidity is not helping as much anymore.\u201dKrishna Memani, chief investment officer of OppenheimerFunds, agreed that the days of maintaining faith in the Fed were numbered, although he offered a wide range for what that number is.\u201cOver the next three to six to 12 months, I\u2019m pretty confident that this game of central bank support will continue\u201d to prop up stocks, he said. \u201cOver the longer term, things are far more uncertain and highly dependent on how things play out in the real economy.\u201dOthers contend that there is plenty of uncertainty for stocks in the short term, too, as the political outlook makes the course of the economy harder to gauge.\u201cNobody has a really good sense, fundamentally, where this market should be going over the next couple of quarters,\u201d said Scott Klimo, co-manager of the Sextant International Fund. Beyond the question of whether the Fed will raise rates in December, he said, \u201cthere is the possibility of right-wing nativist governments taking over in Europe, and who knows what\u2019s going to happen in the United States.\u201dThe reality of how different this presidential election is from the typical one is finally setting in, Mr. Klimo said.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a sense that, \u2018I want this guy to win, but if the other guy wins, it won\u2019t be a disaster,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true now.\u201dThe prospect of \u201cnationalism and protectionism\u201d should Donald J. Trump win the presidency is a concern for Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust.The outlook for trade is already fragile without any change in American policy. In late September, the World Trade Organization lowered its forecast for 2016 global trade growth to 1.7 percent from 2.8 percent in April. The body attributed the revised forecast to a \u201cdramatic slowing of trade growth\u201d early this year.The presidential election and the Fed meeting the next month are reasons Ms. Nixon is \u201cnot going to be interested in making bold moves\u201d in the markets now, she said, even as she acknowledged that the Fed was also unlikely to make any bold moves.\u201cThe Fed delivered exactly what we thought they would \u2014 nothing much,\u201d she said about the September meeting. \u201cOur base case is they won\u2019t move in December, either.\u201cThere\u2019s always a reason\u201d for the inaction, she added. \u201cEvery time the Fed seems ready to do something, there\u2019s some sort of macro surprise; the economy has not cooperated.\u201dDespite her misgivings, Ms. Nixon continues to favor stocks over traditionally safer instruments like Treasury bonds.\u201cWe are still very positively inclined toward risk assets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think rates are going to stay low, and the calendar is very much our friend now.\u201dShe was referring to the trough in corporate profits that occurred late last year; once a year has passed, comparisons will become more favorable.Yet Mr. Sri-Kumar warned that the outlook may not be so rosy after more pages are turned on the calendar. The markets may breathe a sigh of relief if Hillary Clinton is elected next month, he said, but they may hold their breath again next summer when it comes time for the president, whoever it is, to decide whether to renominate Janet L. Yellen to continue running the Fed when her term as chairwoman expires in early 2018.Another matter for investors to confront is how, and how easily, Britain will extricate itself from the European Union, he added.The mechanism for carrying out \u201cBrexit\u201d is for Britain to invoke Article 50 of the union\u2019s Lisbon Treaty. That begins the negotiation of the terms of separation and the relationship between the country and the union afterward. That must be completed within two years after Article 50 is invoked, which Prime Minister Theresa May said this month would occur in March.As worrisome as these issues are, many investors heavily exposed to stocks rationalize the high valuations by pointing out that other investments are even more expensive.\u201cThe challenge with all of this is the value of financial assets is not absolute,\u201d Mr. Memani said. With bond yields so low, he said, \u201cequities are going up because they offer more value.\u201dBut it would be imprudent, in his opinion, to avoid Treasuries and other historically safer bonds altogether, no matter how low interest rates are and how much the Fed supports stock prices.\u201cNormally, at these rate levels, you wouldn\u2019t make any fixed-income allocations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with so much uncertainty, high-grade bonds have a significant place in a portfolio as ballast against a potential downturn\u201d in stocks.Funds that own both major asset classes did well in the third quarter. The average domestic equity fund tracked by Morningstar gained 4.6 percent. International stock funds did better, up 5.7 percent, led by a 7.8 percent rise in portfolios that focus on emerging markets, which had underperformed for years.The average taxable bond fund was up 2 percent in the third quarter. Specialists in high-yield instruments did especially well, rising 4.7 percent, as did emerging markets, up 4.2 percent.Funds of all sorts did well in the quarter, but actively managed stock mutual funds remained a tough sell. Investors sold a net $112.8 billion of them in the period, according to Morningstar, and put a net $61.2 billion into the market through exchange-traded funds. SPDR S.&P. 500, a large, actively traded E.T.F. that tracks the benchmark index, returned 3.8 percent during the quarter, trailing the 4.4 percent return of the average mutual fund that specializes in large domestic stocks.Bond investors poured $52.2 billion into actively managed mutual funds and $28.9 billion into E.T.F.s, which are mostly passively managed vehicles that try to match the returns of an index.Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed income at BlackRock, expects rates to rise modestly.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to move up that much,\u201d Mr. Rieder predicted, \u201cbecause so many people in an aging population need income.\u201d Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions; high demand for bonds would tend to keep yields relatively low.But with monetary policy likely to remain looser for longer, he anticipates inflation picking up. Based on that forecast, he recommends Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which offer the creditworthiness of other Treasury bonds but feature rates that move in line with inflation.TIPS are \u201cone of the most mispriced assets in the market today,\u201d Mr. Rieder said. \u201cMore and more people are going to buy inflation.\u201dOther instruments he favors, with prices that are relatively immune to rising interest rates, include short- to medium-term emerging market debt and mortgage securities from nongovernmental issuers.Mr. Sri-Kumar does not view rising rates as a threat. His advice is to \u201cstay very defensive\u201d by making a liberal allocation to Treasury bonds and keeping as much as 30 percent of a portfolio in cash.As for stocks, he encouraged investors to stick with areas like health care and utilities and to emphasize the United States over foreign markets.Staying close to home is a common theme, especially when contemplating the near future.\u201cFrom a short-term horizon, we\u2019re very overweight U.S. assets,\u201d Ms. Nixon said, because what economic growth there is in the world seems to be concentrated in the United States.Looking further ahead, Ms. Nixon recommends more diversification abroad, particularly in emerging markets.Mr. Memani combined those ideas.\u201cThe best stocks to own for a five-year run are U.S. domestic stocks and emerging markets,\u201d he said. Referring to the sluggish economic conditions, he added: \u201cIf we come out of this mess, emerging markets will have to take more of a role in global growth. Valuations there are not cheap, but they\u2019re better than in developed markets.\u201dHe warned investors who need income that \u201cyou\u2019ll have to take risks\u201d because interest rates are so low. Among the more prudent risks, in his view, are dividend-paying stocks, municipal bonds and master limited partnerships, which are exchange-traded vehicles that typically invest in energy infrastructure like pipelines.Mr. Klimo, like Mr. Sri-Kumar, favors health care stocks. \u201cFor pure demographic reasons, I think they will remain attractive for a long time,\u201d he said.Funds that concentrate on health care stocks rose 5.5 percent in the third quarter, the best sector performance after the gains of 12.9 percent for technology and 7.1 percent for financial services.Among foreign stock markets, Mr. Klimo prefers those in Southeast Asia.One area in which he said he was \u201cfar, far underweight\u201d is financial services. Alluding to serious difficulties at big banks like Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, he said, \u201cWe have no idea what\u2019s going on inside these companies.\u201dThe end of exceedingly loose Fed policy has been coming for so long that it should be no surprise when it arrives. Even so, it could shock investors when it happens, and even if it doesn\u2019t for the foreseeable future.\u201cWe\u2019ve just kept the drug going,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite comforting; we don\u2019t want to wean ourselves off it. But eventually we\u2019ll have an overdose that no one can do anything about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nutanix I.P.O. Creates Opening for Others", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNutanix, the cloud data-storage firm that made its market debut last week, has jammed open the window for initial public offerings.The firm\u2019s stock popped a whopping 131 percent on its debut on Friday, for a market capitalization above $5 billion. The warm welcome that was extended to new companies in September, combined with decreased venture-capital funding, may lead others to pull the trigger. The coming presidential election means they had better hurry.Nutanix got lucky. A general market rally on its first day of trading \u2013 partly on the back of reduced concern about the stability of Deutsche Bank as the German lender negotiates a big settlement with American prosecutors \u2013 put the wind behind stocks. But Nutanix\u2019s business, selling cheap and easy ways to expand data centers, is also at the center of the latest tech wave.Over all, it has proved a tricky year so far for new and risky companies to sell shares to the public. Only about half as many businesses have floated as in the same period last year, according to Renaissance Capital. To attract investors, solid firms have been priced attractively. The valuations of the networking firm Acacia Communications and the cloud voice and messaging firm Twilio both trade at more than four times where their I.P.O.s priced earlier this year. And Nutanix can claim the best first-day gain of all.Performances such as these have helped bring on a thaw. Sixteen companies floated last month. That is more than twice as many as in September 2015, and it is the first month this year with more I.P.O.s than last year.Another incentive to go public now is a tightening of purse strings at private investment firms. The amount of venture capital invested in the second quarter was down 11 percent from the same period in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. And it was the third-straight quarter showing a double-digit decline.Firms may, however, have little time to take advantage. Later in October, investors will be preoccupied with the election, which takes place on Nov. 8, and thereafter they will be trying to figure out what the new president and congressional makeup mean. Nutanix has created the opening, but it may be brief.Advertisement"}

They\u2019re sometimes eaten or used on masks and dolls to represent the sweetness of life.People honoring Day of the Dead also visit the graves of their relatives and build ofrendas, or small altars with flowers and gifts, inside their homes.On Saturday, Mexico City hosted its first official Dia de los Muertos parade.

But something different happened in September, and it could render bonds a weaker tool for portfolio diversification.On Sept. 9, when the stock market fell 2.45 percent in a single day, the bond market did not follow its traditional script. Instead of rallying, the average core bond portfolio tracked by Morningstar dipped 0.34 percent that day. The one-day loss for many funds, including Vanguard Total Bond Market, iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond, Pimco Total Return and Metropolitan West Total Return, while less than a half a percentage point, still amounted to more than 10 percent of their current yield.In itself, a loss like that isn\u2019t going to upend anyone\u2019s retirement plan, but it doesn\u2019t merely portend declining long-term returns for bonds: It could also reduce the buffering effect of bonds in a portfolio that contains stocks.Jeffrey Knight, co-head of Global Asset Allocation at Columbia Threadneedle, says that problem is likely to continue in the future. In his view, what happened on Sept. 9 is \u201cexhibit A\u201d for what he expects to play out when central banks start to tap the brakes on their aggressive policies to stimulate economic growth.\u201cBoth stock and bond values have been driven up by monetary policy, and as we approach an inflection point where that policy changes, they both have the same reason to sell off,\u201d Mr. Knight said.We may indeed be closer to that inflection point. While the Federal Reserve chose to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at its September meeting, the latest odds put a very high probability on a December increase. In the meantime, the yield of the 10-year Treasury rate has quietly inched up from below 1.4 percent in early July to 1.7 percent. That is still well below the 2.25 percent at the beginning of the year, but it signals that a shift may be underway.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, is mindful that previous rate increases in the bond market have quickly reversed themselves, but he says that this time may really be different. Without the Federal Reserve\u2019s intervention, Mr. Paulsen says, the 10-year Treasury yield would be in the vicinity of 4 percent based on current levels of economic growth, core inflation and wage growth. \u201cI am not suggesting we are headed there this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if this recovery persists, and the Fed takes its peg off, I would not be at all surprised to see us around 4 percent before the next recession.\u201dIf that were to play out, rising yields would mean bond prices would fall. Total return is the sum of yield and changes in bond prices. Today\u2019s razor-thin yields of around 2 percent for quality bond funds suggest that initial total returns will probably be negative, though over time patient investors will benefit from the reinvestment of higher yields.The challenge is to anticipate today how you might react to a less rosy performance for bonds \u2014 which have returned 4 percent annualized over the last 15 years \u2014 and make any necessary portfolio tweaks. \u201cDiversification still works, but the way to think about it is that the cost of diversification has gone up,\u201d says Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock. Because bonds don\u2019t have much room to rally at current price and yield levels, they may merely hold steady, or potentially lose a little when stocks falter.The implications are worth considering. It could mean slightly larger bear market losses for diversified stock and bond portfolios. In 2008, for example, when United States stocks fell 37 percent, high-quality core bonds rallied more than 5 percent. An investor with a standard, index-based portfolio containing 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds lost about 20 percent that year. But bonds rallied while stocks fell. If bonds hadn\u2019t risen in value but instead had lost 2 percent, the portfolio would have lost 23 percent.While not cheery news, that\u2019s not an end-of-days prospect. Core bond funds that invest in high-quality United States securities may not produce world-beating returns, but they are not likely to lose much, either. One important aspect of core bond funds \u2014 their relatively short 5.5-year average duration \u2014 should prevent big losses. Duration is a measure of a bond portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to changing interest rates. A one percentage point rise in a portfolio\u2019s yield typically causes the price to fall in line with its duration. That translates to a 5.5 percent price decline for a core bond fund with a 5.5-year duration if rates were to rise one percentage point.In the spirit of hypothetical stress testing, Vanguard crunched the numbers for what would be a highly unlikely event: an abrupt three percentage point increase in the yield of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate index from its current very low 1.95 percent. The index has a current duration of 5.5 years. That increase would produce a return of negative 13.1 percent in the first year. If rates stabilized after that move, the cumulative loss by the end of the second year would be 8.75 percent. Returns would be back above break even in Year 4 thanks to the reinvestment of the much higher yield.How bad would that be? It depends on your perspective. \u201cIn a horrible, truly worst-case scenario, a high-quality bond index fund is still less risky over the course of a year than stocks are in one day,\u201d says the investment adviser Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic in Colorado Springs, alluding to the 20 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index on Oct. 19, 1987.A well-honed actively managed bond fund might mitigate a portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to rising rates.For example, right now bond index funds that closely mirror the Barclays U.S. Aggregate index are loaded with Treasury and government agency bonds. Those are what you want when markets falter, but they have extremely low yields today and typically are very sensitive to rising rates. By comparison, the Baird Core Plus Bond has the freedom to decide on its bond mix.\u201cTrying to hit a lot of singles, and not swing for home runs\u201d as the fund\u2019s co-manager, Mary Ellen Stanek, describes the strategy, has delivered index-beating performance since the fund\u2019s 2000 inception. The fund also ranks in the top quartile of its peers over the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods. Currently, the fund\u2019s Treasury stake is much lower than what is stuffed in its benchmark index, and it owns a lot more American corporate bonds. On average, high-quality corporate bonds currently have yields that are at least one percentage point higher than Treasury bonds. \u201cWe think we\u2019re in the seventh inning for corporate bonds. The fundamentals look pretty good,\u201d says Warren Pierson, also a co-manager.Another option, and a conservative one, is to move some of your money out of bonds and into cash. Even investment strategists \u2014 a tribe always at the ready with the best relative values in stocks and bonds \u2014 acknowledge the \u201coptionality\u201d value of cash these days, which is an obtuse way of saying it makes sense to have some money on the sidelines ready to get back in the game after sell-offs. \u201cThe opportunity cost in the short run is low,\u201d says Mr. Turnill, the BlackRock strategist.Mr. Roth, the Wealth Logic founder, has made five-year certificates of deposit the centerpiece of his clients\u2019 fixed-income portfolios. For example, the current 1.75 percent yield offered on deposits of at least $25,000 by Ally Bank is nearly on par with the 1.95 percent yield of the Barclays Aggregate bond index. Even in the event of paying the penalty for an early withdrawal, the effective yield would be more than 1 percent. \u201cWe have no principal risk, and our money is 100 percent government guaranteed,\u201d says Mr. Roth. (If you\u2019re looking to remove some rate risk from your 401(k) portfolio, check if there is a so-called stable value fund in your plan; the average current yield is 1.8 percent, according to Hueler Analytics.)Of course, cash is a market timing call, and market timing is not easy to do properly. What\u2019s more, cash or liquid investments like money market funds or short-term CDs aren\u2019t likely to keep pace with inflation in the long run. But if you become deeply worried about bonds and stocks, cash is not the worst place to wait out a shifting market.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Math Teachers Are at a Loss to Understand Annuities", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byPublic SacrificeEven a well-caffeinated person with an advanced degree in math would have a hard time deciphering a 53-page contract called \u201cYour Flexible Premium Indexed and Declared Interest Deferred Annuity Policy.\u201dMelanie Panush Lindert, a 66-year-old elementary school dance teacher in Los Angeles, was sold one of these mind-numbingly complex products last year through her workplace retirement account. The same agent had sold her three other annuity contracts over the previous eight years, including another within her retirement savings plan \u2014 a so-called 403(b) \u2014 which is offered to employees of public schools, colleges, religious groups and nonprofits.Annuities can be hard to fully grasp even in their simplest configuration, where you hand a pile of money to an insurance company, then receive a guaranteed stream of annual income for life. But schoolteachers and other people doing good works are often left to trudge through a morass of contracts tied to some of the most arcane investments, sold by representatives who may not fully understand the inner workings themselves.It \u201cseemed like a good way to make more money,\u201d said Ms. Lindert, who started teaching when she was 53 and said she hoped to retire next year. For now, she teaches five classes a day, three days a week, to elementary schoolchildren at three schools. She brings her own speakers, drums, scarves and an iPod with 400 hours of music, along with a light lunch.Certain types of annuities can serve as a useful retirement tool for some savers seeking a stream of guaranteed income. But many teachers already receive pensions providing a steady income base.The type of annuity in Ms. Lindert\u2019s account, a so-called fixed index annuity, is particularly complex. In theory, these are appealing: They provide a guaranteed minimum interest rate; they let investors participate in the market\u2019s gains up to a certain ceiling; and they promise that buyers will not lose money when the market dives.Still, how do investors know whether the product is appropriate for them?\u201cNo agent selling these or investors buying these has the foggiest idea of how these work,\u201d said Mr. McCann, who reviewed Ms. Lindert\u2019s contracts.But indexed annuities have to make sense for at least some investors, right? Perhaps for the incredibly risk averse? \u201cNo,\u201d he said, without hesitation. \u201cNever.\u201dThough it appears that investors have some exposure to the stock market, he says many are left with a return they could have achieved with a supersafe bond portfolio, without paying an obscured 2.5 to 3 percent annual fee charged by the annuity provider. \u201cThey are all Rube Goldberg machines,\u201d he said.In her case, Ms. Lindert was advised to annuitize her first contract \u2014 which paid a minimum interest rate of 3 percent \u2014 and direct the stream of income into the new annuity, which paid a minimum of 1 percent. The other investment options provided were also far less generous \u2014 shockingly so, Mr. McCann added. \u201cThis switch is really awful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good for the insurance company. But it\u2019s really bad for the investor.\u201dThe new policy did include a so-called guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit \u2014 for an additional fee of 0.7 percent annually \u2014 which promises a certain level of lifetime income. But Mr. McCann said his analysis found that the new policy was still less valuable than the first.Then, there\u2019s the matter of surrender charges. Ms. Lindert would have owed a penalty for 15 years after signing her original contract \u2014 set on a sliding scale starting at 14 percent \u2014 if she wanted to withdraw more than 10 percent of her account\u2019s \u201caccumulation\u201d value. The policy she bought last year, also issued by Life Insurance Company of the Southwest, has a nine-year surrender period, with a penalty fee starting at 8.25 percent.The American Council of Life Insurers, a trade group that represents annuity issuers and life insurers, echoed that point, noting that guarantees come at a cost so insurers can make good on their promises.\u201cAnnuities are among the most highly regulated products,\u201d Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the group, said, \u201cwith disclosure being a key consumer protection.\u201dSlightly more than half of all 403(b) assets, approaching $900 billion, have been invested in fixed annuities \u2014 which promise either a minimum rate of annual growth or interest based on changes in a market index. Another 25 percent were in variable annuities that invest in mutual funds, according to Investment Company Institute data as of March. The remaining 23 percent were invested in traditional mutual funds.In contrast, about 60 percent of 401(k) assets, which totaled $4.75 trillion, were invested in mutual funds, with only a small share in variable annuities. Despite the risks from short-term market declines, a diversified mix of stock and bond funds is generally less costly and provides a significantly greater return over time.Under that plan, run by TIAA, she has access to low-cost Vanguard funds. She chose to redirect her new contributions into one that invests up to 65 percent in bonds, with the remainder in stocks.But most of her money is still tied up in four annuities that she does not understand.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Three Excellent Books on Long-Term Investing", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byOff the ShelfIt is easy to forget personal investing fundamentals when stock prices hit new highs one week, fall sharply the next and then rise again in no reliable pattern, as they have been doing this year. So now is an ideal time to reread \u2014 or perhaps pick up for the first time \u2014 three excellent books by people who are particularly good at explaining the building blocks of a solid portfolio.In the first of these, Andrew Tobias promises in his title that he is offering \u201cThe Only Investment Guide You\u2019ll Ever Need\u201d ($15.95, Mariner Books). And in the book, which has been continually updated since it was published in 1978, he covers a great deal of important territory, although some of the advice by now may sound familiar. He includes nostrums like this: Buy only investments you understand. If the projected return sounds too good to be true, stay away. You\u2019re going to have to take some risk and buy stocks to stay ahead of inflation. Never forget the impact taxes can have on returns.Solid counsel, but it is not why the book is worth reading. Mr. Tobias\u2019s ideas about saving money \u2014 you can\u2019t build a portfolio without savings \u2014 are his real gems. And the reason for that is his approach. He combines humor \u2014 it starts with the dedication, \u201cto my broker \u2014 even if he has, from time to time, made me just that\u201d \u2014 with common sense presented in an uncommon way.For example, you may already know that you shouldn\u2019t carry credit card debt, because the interest rates can drain what you are able to sock away; you can lower your insurance premiums by increasing deductibles (allowing you to save more) and buy in bulk when items you consume frequently are on sale.But when Mr. Tobias explains it, doing things like this seem as if they would be financial brilliance on your part instead of drudgery.\u201cWhy put $1,000 into the stock of some utility and earn $40 in annual taxable dividends if you can put the same money into insulation and save $350 \u2014 tax-free \u2014 on your utility bill?\u201d he asks.But what should you do if you actually save money by following Mr. Tobias\u2019s suggestions? John C. Bogle has some good ideas in \u201cThe Little Book of Common Sense Investing\u201d (Wiley, $24.95).Let\u2019s get the negatives out of the way first. Mr. Bogle can be hectoring. (\u201cYou ignore these rules at your peril.\u201d) And, perhaps because it was published a decade ago, the idea of owning international stocks or bonds gets little attention.That said, in clear, convincing fashion he lays out a solid strategy for getting \u201cyour fair share of stock market returns.\u201d That isn\u2019t difficult, he writes. \u201cSuccessful investing is all about common sense.\u201dAmong his common-sense ideas:\u25a0 Since timing the market is virtually impossible, you should buy and hold stocks.\u25a0 Being diversified minimizes risk.\u25a0 Because transaction costs and brokerage fees can eat up a significant portion of your returns, invest heavily through low-cost index funds.That last isn\u2019t surprising since Mr. Bogle is founder and former chief executive of Vanguard, the mutual fund company known for its index funds. But he argues everyone should be a fan of the funds.\u201cSimple arithmetic suggests, and history confirms, the winning strategy is to own all the nation\u2019s publicly held businesses at very low cost,\u201d he writes. \u201cBy doing so you are guaranteed to capture almost the entire return they generate in the form of dividends and earnings growth. The best way to implement this strategy is indeed simple: buying a fund that holds this market portfolio. Such a fund is called an index fund.\u201dOf course, one reason most of us try to create a solid portfolio is so we can live the kind of life we want when we get older. The final book grabs me partly because of my age. And as I wrote two years ago, I found two things appealing about \u201cThe Charles Schwab Guide to Finances After Fifty\u201d(Crown Business, $26), written by Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz.First, Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz thoroughly answers her target market\u2019s most common questions. For example, if you are 50 and older, don\u2019t have much money stashed for retirement and wonder what you should do, she says start saving at least 40 percent of your income immediately.Conversely, if you are in good financial shape as retirement looms, you may wonder whether you should pay off your mortgage. Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz, a certified financial planner, shows you how to do the arithmetic to decide. You multiply your current mortgage interest rate \u2014 say 4 percent \u2014 by your tax bracket. Let\u2019s assume 30 percent. That means your mortgage is only costing you 2.8 percent (since you get to deduct the interest you pay).So, paying it off is equivalent to a 2.8 percent risk-free return. If you are pleased with that, especially since you know you will own your house free and clear, pay off your mortgage. If you think you can earn more elsewhere, keep paying the loan and invest the money you would have used to pay off the mortgage.The other nice thing is that Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz \u2014 the daughter of Charles Schwab, the founder of the mutual fund company that bears his name \u2014 treats her readers like adults who know the personal finance basics.For example, she says, when it comes to retirement planning, you need to answer only three questions: What do you expect to spend each year in retirement? How much money will you need in savings/investments to support that spending? And how much more do you need to save to get from here (where you are now) to there (the point where you can fund the retirement you want)?If your projections show you coming up short, she says, you should postpone retirement. That \u201cwould allow you to build a bigger retirement portfolio and shorten the time you\u2019ll rely on savings,\u201d she says, and it could also increase your Social Security benefits.These three books are at the top of my list. If I expanded it, I would include \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d by Benjamin Graham (Collins Business Essentials, $8); \u201cStocks for the Long Run\u201d by Jeremy J. Siegel (McGraw-Hill, $40) and \u201cMaking the Most of Your Money Now\u201d by Jane Bryant Quinn (Simon & Schuster, $35).They, too, are worth a second read, or a first if you haven\u2019t had the pleasure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Up Taking Aim at Bloomberg Terminals Hires Former Bloomberg Head", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byA start-up looking to take on the financial information behemoth Bloomberg L.P. is hiring a former Bloomberg executive to begin a new financial news service.Norman Pearlstine, a former top editor at Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Time, is joining Money.net, which has been building a low-cost alternative to the data terminals that sit at the core of Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s business empire.Mr. Pearlstine is tasked with building a news feed for Money.net that will be based on machine-generated news bulletins and stories. He will be hiring journalists to help guide the computers and potentially supplement them with reporting \u2014 part of a broader move toward the automation of journalism.\u201cI think I know what the customer is looking for, and I think I know where smart developers and journalists working together can add value,\u201d Mr. Pearlstine said in an interview. \u201cMy bias is toward not spending a lot of time duplicating things that everybody else is doing \u2014 trying to think about what timely, usable information is for a professional investor.\u201dMr. Pearlstine was the chief content officer at Bloomberg until 2013, shortly before Mr. Bloomberg ended his final term as New York City\u2019s mayor and rejoined the company he founded in the 1980s. Mr. Pearlstine is currently the vice chairman of Time Inc. and will remain in that role.Money.net was founded by another former top executive at Bloomberg, Morgan Downey, who got to know Mr. Pearlstine when they were both at the company.Mr. Downey has been outspoken about his belief that Money.net can win over Bloomberg customers who are unhappy with the high price of the terminals, which generally cost around $21,000 a year. A Money.net subscription costs about $1,500 annually.Mr. Downey said that Money.net now had about 50,000 paying subscribers, up from fewer than 10,000 a year ago. Over the same time period, the number of Bloomberg subscribers has remained steady at around 325,000.Mr. Downey has been trying to capitalize on the fact that revenue is down in the financial industry, leading many banks and asset managers to look for lower-cost service providers.\u201cThe industry is at this inflection point,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that the ecosystem of Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters can\u2019t continue.\u201dA Bloomberg spokesman said the company had no comment on Mr. Pearlstine\u2019s hiring.Money.net began as a platform for basic financial data, but Mr. Downey has been trying to add tools that can compete with other parts of the Bloomberg terminal.Recently, Money.net announced a partnership with the Wall Street messaging service Symphony, which is mostly owned by a consortium of banks. Symphony has been described as an effort by the banks to create an alternative to Bloomberg\u2019s messaging system, which is often cited as a main reason to have the terminals.Professional investors also choose Bloomberg because of the huge journalistic operation it has built, focusing in particular on market-moving news.But Mr. Downey sees another opportunity to take on Bloomberg at a lower cost.He contends that much of the information that investors need is freely available in news releases, government statements and social media.Mr. Downey already has a team of developers working on software that can scan the web for news releases and stories from other publications to generate headlines for Money.net customers.Last week, for instance, Money.net generated a headline from a Department of Transportation release. It read: \u201cD.O.T. issues emergency order banning all Samsung Galaxy 7 phones from air transportation in the U.S.\u201dHigh-powered computers are crucial to processing more news and doing so faster than Bloomberg\u2019s human-based system, Mr. Downey said.Several other technology companies are already working to automate journalism, using software that can take raw data and turn it into proper sentences. But this strategy has run into obstacles. When Facebook recently moved to make its trending stories feature more automated, fake news stories crept in unnoticed.Mr. Downey is hoping that Mr. Pearlstine can bring in a team of journalists to help guide the machines toward accuracy. Mr. Downey says that he wants Mr. Pearlstine to hire about 25 journalists to work with around 75 programmers.Mr. Pearlstine is more measured than Mr. Downey in his ambitions to immediately take on Bloomberg. He says that for now the data giant still has a big lead in many areas.But Mr. Pearlstine says there is an opportunity to do things in a smarter way given the current state of technology. He said that Bloomberg News began more than three decades ago as a small team of people aggregating news from other publications.\u201cTechnology has given you the opportunity to revisit that model in ways that could be better, faster and smarter,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Economy Was Resilient After \u2018Brexit.\u2019 Its Leaders Learned the Wrong Lesson.", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byPound Foolish?The British pound fell to about $1.24 on Friday from $1.30 a week earlier and continued edging down Monday. Even if you treat a \u201cflash crash\u201d in the pound on Asian markets Thursday night as an aberration \u2014 it fell 6 percent, then recovered in a short span \u2014 these types of aberrations seem to happen only when a market is already under severe stress. (See, for example, the May 2010 flash crash of American stocks, during a flare-up of the eurozone crisis).Sterling, as traders refer to the currency, is acting as the global market\u2019s minute-to-minute referendum on how significant the economic disruption from Brexit will end up being. So what does the latest downswing represent? It\u2019s worth understanding why British financial markets and the country\u2019s economy stabilized quickly after the Brexit vote to begin with.The vote set off a chaotic time of political disruption, especially the resignation of the prime minister, David Cameron, who had advocated for the country\u2019s remaining part of the E.U. Theresa May won the internal battle to become the next prime minister, which was to markets and business decision makers a relatively benign result.Ms. May, the former home secretary, is temperamentally pragmatic. She reluctantly supported remaining in the union. And while she pledged to follow through on leaving it (\u201cBrexit means Brexit,\u201d she said), she seemed like the kind of leader who would ensure that some of the worst-case possibilities of how Brexit might go wouldn\u2019t materialize. Exporters would retain access to European markets. London could remain the de facto banking capital of Europe. All would be well.Meanwhile, the Bank of England sprang into action to cushion the economic blow of Brexit-related uncertainty. Despite the inflationary pressures created by a falling pound, the bank, projecting loss of jobs and economic output, cut interest rates and started a new program of quantitative easing to try to soften the blow.All of that \u2014 the prospect of \u201csoft Brexit\u201d and easier monetary policy \u2014 helped financial markets stabilize and then rally, and kept the economic damage mild, as the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys show.But in the last couple of weeks, the tenor has shifted.That sets up confrontational negotiations between the British government and its E.U. counterparts. European leaders will be reluctant to allow Britain continued free access to its markets, which the May government wants, without similarly free movement of people across borders.And beyond the substance of the negotiations, the British government has signaled in recent days that it is looking inward, and will be hostile to those who are not British citizens.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.In essence, the confidence that Brexit will not mean Britain is shutting itself off from Europe and the world is starting to dissipate.Then there\u2019s monetary policy. At the same party conference, Ms. May indicated skepticism of the role the Bank of England and other central banks have played in the economy in recent years, saying that while low interest rates and quantitative easing provided necessary help after the financial crisis, \u201cwe have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects.\u201dIn short, after Mr. Carney helped foam the economic runway after the Brexit vote, Ms. May\u2019s comments were the equivalent of complaining about the mess created by all that foam.There\u2019s always going to be some jockeying on both sides in advance of a difficult negotiation, and the sympathetic view to the British government is that it is merely trying to maximize its advantage in hammering out a deal to execute its Brexit.The problem is that staking out that ground means risking the very economic damage that a conciliatory tone and easy money helped avoid over the summer.Advertisement"}

But there are no clear moves. (Lego, long on Disney\u2019s wish list, is too expensive; the often-on-the-edge Vice brings potential image problems.) And, as the Twitter reaction shows, there are no obvious technology moves.Uncharted territory for Mr. Iger and the company he has steered to overwhelming success.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T\u2019s Bid for Time Warner Could Bolster Boutique Advisers", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsAT&T\u2019s audacious $85 billion bid for Time Warner may help more independent advisory companies handle mergers and acquisitions.The year\u2019s biggest merger enlisted the services of two boutique firms, Perella Weinberg and Allen & Company, alongside their bigger Wall Street brethren. If it emboldens other chief executives, the likes of Lazard and Moelis should benefit. They could use the help as the advice market goes through a rough patch.Third-quarter results released this week by independent advisory companies have held up well despite a 22 percent decline in annual global deal volume, according to Thomson Reuters data. Only Greenhill reported a drop in revenue related to mergers and acquisitions from the end of June. It was nevertheless the boutique\u2019s best showing in a while, and revenue growth was 52 percent higher than a year ago. Lazard and Moelis, however, experienced little or no growth in merger fees from 2015.The falloff from a record year of wheeling and dealing has taken its toll. Market values for Lazard, Greenhill and Moelis are each down at least 10 percent this year. In contrast, shares of two of the top three deal advisers \u2014 Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase \u2014 are up around 5 percent, while those of the third, Goldman Sachs, are down only slightly. Evercore stock, thanks in part to an industry-beating one-third increase in advisory revenue so far this year, is flat.An increase in new deals would help reverse this decline. The contribution of merger advice fees to earnings is, after all, easier to divine than the ups and downs of trading stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.This week\u2019s slew of announced transactions, including Qualcomm\u2019s $47 billion agreed takeover of the rival chip maker NXP Semiconductors \u2014 which included Evercore, Centerview and Frank Quattrone\u2019s Qatalyst among the list of advisers \u2014 is already having an effect. Lazard\u2019s stock, for example, has jumped almost 10 percent since last Thursday\u2019s market close. For investors, a few more megamergers could be enough to seal the deal.Advertisement"}

The fact that money can be deducted directly from your paycheck seems to help spur contributions, as 27 percent of those with a workplace account contribute between 6 percent and 10 percent of each paycheck toward their retirement.But even those who are actively investing may not have a clear idea of how to balance their funds to target the returns they need at an acceptable level of risk. While 80 percent of those who have a retirement account say that they either fully or somewhat understand diversification, many experts feel investors are often unsure of what diversification really looks like in a portfolio. Brett Mossman, who heads up BlackRock Portfolio Solutions group, explains that diversification is not just about owning a certain percentage of stocks and bonds or even how many different funds you own. \u201cIt's actually more about the type of risk that you consume in the portfolio,\u201d he says. This is often the part that eludes people.\u2014BRETT MOSSMAN, BLACKROCK PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS\u2014BRETT MOSSMAN, BLACKROCK\u00a0PORTFOLIO SOLUTIONS\u201cFor example, certain types of bonds have similar risks to stocks, which means that a portfolio that appears balanced may actually be riskier than you realize.

This may be in part because men and women are motivated differently, including how they get their financial information and attitudes about risk. \u201cBy not watching and reacting to the markets, like their male counterparts, women investors are often far better off long term,\u201d says Hollie Fagan, head of the registered investment advisor business and retail direct platform at BlackRock. \u201cHistory bears that out. What's more important to these women is whether they're able to achieve the goals they've set out for themselves.\u201dThere are also more beneficial forces that drive people to engage, notably positive changes in their work circumstances. A third of respondents who ever make changes to their portfolios (33 percent) said they do so when they get a raise, while 21 percent would do so if they got a new job. Other key triggers include getting married (7 percent) or making a large purchase (12 percent), with the numbers about evenly split between men and women in both cases.It's important for people to be aware of what kinds of changes these events bring about. \u201cChanges in life circumstances are either going to create more assets to invest or create more liabilities,\u201d Small says. \u201cIndividuals need to be able to manage both.\u201dOver the past few years, exchange traded funds have quickly grown into a popular way to diversify long-term portfolios.

Only 40 percent of those with a retirement account felt they either somewhat or fully understood ETFs.OF RESPONDENTS SAYTHEY SOMEWHAT OR\u00a0FULLY UNDERSTAND\u00a0DIVERSIFICATION.\u00a0Over the past few years, exchange traded funds have quickly grown into a popular way to diversify long-term portfolios. Although ETFs debuted in the '90s, and today hold more than $3 trillion globally, according to BlackRock, many admit they still don\u2019t know much about them. Only 40 percent of those with a retirement account felt they either somewhat or fully understood ETFs.\u201cAn ETF is like a mutual fund that an investor can buy or sell just like a stock in a brokerage account,\u201d Small says. Similar to a mutual fund, an ETF is a bundled group of assets such as stocks and bonds that are divided into shares. Most ETFs are designed to track an index and can be traded in the market throughout the day, while mutual funds can only be bought and sold with the fund company at the end of the trading day.\u201cTheir versatility gives individuals and advisors the choice to build any portfolio they want in a low-cost, tax efficient way,\u201d Small says. These advantages can make them good vehicles for core, long-term holdings where global diversification and value really matter.ETFs are also popular because they can be acutely targeted.\u201cIn addition to rounding out the core of a portfolio, ETFs give people the ability to express a really precise view on the exposures they want,\u201d Mossman says. \u201cFor example, if an individual wanted to invest solely in Asian technology stocks, or in small-cap value stocks or emerging markets bonds, there is an ETF for each one of those things.\u201dOF MILLENNIALS GET\u00a0THEIR FINANCIAL\u00a0INFORMATION FROM\u00a0THEIR FAMILY.\u00a0Transparency is just one piece of the puzzle for millennials and ETFs. Another is the growth of online platforms such as self-directed brokerages, which make access to ETFs even easier. \u201cThese platforms are particularly attractive to millennials, who are quicker to embrace technology and who tend to be more concerned about the impact of cost and taxes on the long-term growth of their money,\u201d Small says. And with less money to invest, they may not meet required minimums for traditional advisory accounts.Of course, these reasons make ETFs appealing for all generations, not just millennials. \u201cToday, as the challenges of investing have gotten more complex, we are seeing the creation of smarter and more innovative solutions to help people manage that complexity,\u201d Small says. \u201cIn this world, more and more investors are turning to low cost, tax-efficient ETFs to build diversified, quality market exposures at a competitive price.\u201dIllustration by Tamer Koseli.*Methodology: All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc.

{"Headline": "How Three Strong-Performing Funds Pick Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMany stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares.\u201cOur typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a \u201cresearch gap\u201d that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps.The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Ore. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland.As stock pickers, they\u2019re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers.\u201cFor a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,\u201d as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming.In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers. They estimate they make about 1,000 calls a year. Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies.The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 percent, returned 14.95 percent in the third quarter.An article in the special Mutual Fund Quarterly section last Sunday about the strongest-performing mutual funds misstated the expense ratio for the institutional shares of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund. It was 1.09 percent, a net figure that accounts for fee waivers and expense reimbursements by the fund company, not 1.49 percent, which is the gross expense ratio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Snap Is Said to Pick Bankers for an I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The newest generation of technology darlings has signaled that it is about to come of age: Snapchat, the messaging service beloved by teenagers, is preparing to step out into the public markets.The company \u2014 born only five years ago \u2014 may end up ushering in a wave of huge tech initial public offerings at a time when Wall Street has seen few such big deals.Snapchat\u2019s parent, recently renamed Snap Inc., has hired the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, essentially firing a starting gun for a potential stock sale as soon as the first quarter of next year, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.Should Snap follow through on its plans, it would be the most prominent debut by the latest batch of \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 those private companies valued at more than $1 billion. Its class also includes Uber, the enormous ride-hailing service, and Airbnb, the home-rental start-up.Many of those companies are already awash in cash they have raised privately from mutual funds, venture capital firms and hedge funds, money that once needed to be raised on the public stock markets. But an initial offering would represent a new level of status and legitimacy, placing them on the same level as Google and Facebook.A wave of unicorns hitting the public markets would help end what has been one of the bleakest times for tech initial offerings \u2014 and I.P.O.s in general \u2014 in some time. No tech companies went public in the first three months of this year, a drought that had happened only three times since the early 1990s.Over all, just 84 companies have gone public so far this year in the United States, according to data from Renaissance Capital, down nearly 42 percent from last year.Among the problems that had bedeviled the market for new stocks was the ease with which tech companies like Uber have found cash from private investors, removing the need to go public anytime soon. The venture-backed companies that have gone public over the last 12 months have largely been smaller, lesser-known names like the communications service Twilio or the business software maker Atlassian.And public market investors like mutual funds have pushed back against the prices that start-ups have demanded, often leading to fewer of the sky-high stock debuts that Twitter and others enjoyed.But as the markets have stabilized, start-ups and their backers have again resumed discussions about splashy market debuts.\u201cIn the last three months, a number of companies have started saying that it\u2019s not all bad to be public,\u201d Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a mature company with more than $50 million in revenue, an I.P.O. is very much on your mind now.\u201dThe prospect of a huge offering has had banks racing to seize a piece of it for some time. Beyond Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, Snap has also engaged a bevy of other banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Company, Barclays and Credit Suisse \u2014 to help manage its stock sale, one of the people briefed on the matter added.At the heart of the frenzy is Snap, born in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011. The company is known for its mobile storytelling and messaging app, which lets users watch videos and send photos and messages to friends. The company also makes sunglasses called Spectacles that are equipped with a video camera.Currently, Snap would be able to file its public offering documents confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission because the company now generates less than $1 billion in annual revenue.The company may ultimately decide not to file for an offering. Yet Snap may be in a better position to go public before some other highly valued private companies because it has comparatively few regulatory concerns that would be listed as risk factors in a prospectus.Uber and Airbnb, for example, are fighting legal battles in numerous cities around the country and the world. Even though all of these battles will most likely be resolved, a long list of outstanding litigation and regulatory uncertainties could create an additional hurdle for investors.And unlike those two companies, Snap isn\u2019t based in Silicon Valley itself but in Venice, Calif., spearheading a nascent tech community in the Los Angeles area.Snap\u2019s app Snapchat was an early hit with young users who liked the fact that their messages and photos disappeared. The company was criticized for making it easier to send inappropriate photos with fewer consequences. Yet the ephemeral nature of the platform also made it seem like a more authentic way of communicating. Snapchat was an online facsimile of a casual conversation while platforms like Facebook and Instagram were the equivalent of a permanent record.Snap eventually added in tools that let users tell stories about their days and augment their selfies with stickers and masks, which the company calls filters and lenses. It also introduced channels for professionally created content from media companies like CNN and Cosmopolitan magazine.As users continued to flock to the app, a year ago Snap began to monetize its growing audience by allowing advertisers to sponsor filters and lenses and run video ads between stories produced by media companies or made up of user photos and videos.Advertisers have been keen to reach the Snapchat app\u2019s audience, which now includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 and 150 million daily users. At the moment, Snapchat is the trendiest, newest thing and advertisers want to be associated with it, Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands, said in an earlier interview.Snap has continued to build out content on Snapchat, the app has increasingly drawn comparisons to traditional television and is seen as an internet company that could someday draw ad dollars away from TV.This year, Snapchat is expected to generate nearly $367 million in ad revenue worldwide, according to data from the research firm eMarketer; and that figure is expected to rise to nearly $1 billion next year.For now, nearly all of Snapchat\u2019s revenue comes from the United States, according to eMarketer, but other markets should account for about a quarter of Snap\u2019s revenue by 2018.Yet for all of the service\u2019s phenomenal growth, Snapchat\u2019s parent must still demonstrate to potentially skittish stock market investors that it has a path to profitability if its offering is to soar, analysts say.\u201cInvestors aren\u2019t willing to buy growth at all costs,\u201d Kathleen Smith, a co-founder of Renaissance Capital, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Picking a Portfolio With Pok\u00e9balls", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byEssayIt has sent me wandering through Times Square on my lunch break on a quest to capture imaginary monsters. These odd creatures have gotten me looking at the screen of my phone even more than usual. A lot of people stopped playing over the summer, but I haven\u2019t given up: As they say, Gotta Catch \u2019Em All.The game, like so many other things, has me thinking about money: If you can use augmented reality to find monsters, why not use it to capture weirdly enticing investments?\u201cAugmented reality?\u201d Maybe you\u2019re not pleased by the thought of yet another new technology, and techie buzz phrase, coming your way. A.R., as it\u2019s called, brings the physical world into a cartoon-inspired game. If you haven\u2019t played, it looks like this: Your phone shows a map of your surroundings, and the camera shows the Pok\u00e9mon characters popping up around you.I find it addictive. As I walk toward the office elevator on my way to lunch, a Mankey, a furry, ball-shaped dude with monkey arms and tail but a piggy snout, pops up on my screen. It has found a perch by a bookshelf, and is bobbing saucily at me. Lunch can wait; I want to catch that ugly little sucker. These creatures show up everywhere \u2014 on the street, in the park, even sitting on my wife\u2019s lap.The notion of applying A.R. to investing could be a million-dollar idea. I used to have billion-dollar ideas, but since nobody liked them much, I started discounting. For all I know, they might only be $10 ideas. But they are precious to me, and in my heart they shine like gold.This one seems especially brilliant: Instead of running all over town finding imaginary creatures, why not locate investments? You\u2019re a new parent, buying diapers in the store. You grab that box of Huggies, and scan the bar code: On the phone\u2019s screen, up pops a little creature that identifies the parent company, Kimberly-Clark. The company trades under the ticker KMB so let\u2019s call the creature a KMBino. Along with the waggling diaper creature, you\u2019d see the ticker symbol, stock price, one-year return \u2014 heck, maybe even the price-earnings ratio.Grab it!After all, you\u2019re giving the company thousands of dollars, you think, so why not get something back by buying the stock and watching it rise? This also could work for older investors buying Depends \u2014 it\u2019s the same company! And the same KMBino. Now there\u2019s a cradle-to-grave investing strategy.Buying beer? Get some BUD \u2014 the ticker symbol for its maker, Anheuser-Busch InBev, at least until the merger with SABMiller goes through. Throw your colorful Pok\u00e9ball at that BUDrosaur and put the stock into your portfolio \u2014 the investor\u2019s term for what Pok\u00e9mon players call their Pok\u00e9dex.My A.R. investing game is complicated, but no more so than evolving a Bulbasaur into an Ivysaur. The game could even go from augmented reality to the real thing: Just as the Pok\u00e9mon game lets you spend money to buy things like extra balls, incense and potions, my game would let you use actual dollars to buy shares. Players learn about the stock market, and inject a little fun into their lives and portfolios.You can firm up your calves while firming up your investments.You might not see the point of tying the market to a game that has you wandering around all the time. But consider that the phrase \u201crandom walk\u201d describes a theory that basically says prices move randomly, and so trying to beat the market is a sucker\u2019s game. Burton G. Malkiel popularized the idea in his 1973 investing classic \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street.\u201dWhat\u2019s more random than a walk to find and catch Pok\u00e9mon?I asked Mr. Malkiel what he thought of my game. \u201cI think that\u2019s actually fun,\u201d he said, astonishingly. \u201cI was the one who said, sort of jokingly, you might as well throw darts at the stock page, because you\u2019ll pick your stocks as well that way as any other way.\u201dSo why not modernize the dart-throwing with virtual Pok\u00e9mon? It\u2019s the most random walk out there \u2014 I almost fell into Verona Lake, in what is known in the real world as New Jersey, while pursuing yet another Magikarp.I did not tell Mr. Malkiel about the Magikarp or the lake; the conversation had been going well, and I didn\u2019t want him thinking I am not a serious journalist. Anyway, he was off and running with the idea, thinking about using the game to mimic other forms of investing.Many people, for example, think that rather than buying individual stocks, you should follow the buys of professional stock pickers, like mutual fund managers. He summed up this idea as \u201cInstead of picking the horse, pick the jockey, pick the trainer \u2014 whatever analogy you want to use.\u201dThe problem with that approach, of course, is that picking actively traded funds hasn\u2019t really turned out any better than picking individual stocks when it comes to beating the market. As he likes to put it, at least two-thirds of those trying to beat simple market indexes fail. About a third do beat the market, but it\u2019s not the same third from year to year.That\u2019s when I realized that Mr. Malkiel\u2019s approach to investing provides a road map to the perfect A.R. investing game. A little oversimplified, it comes to this: Don\u2019t pick and choose. Buy the whole market.Low-cost index funds would go up and down with the market index that they reflect, like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. The game could distribute the component stocks around the landscape like so many Jigglypuffs and Clefairies. Catch the stock, and it goes into your portfolio.Get the millennials I see playing out in the park to switch to Ind\u00e9xmon, and we might even be able to solve the national retirement savings crisis.Ah! I hear you saying (and not for the first time), \u201cSchwartz, you idiot! The point of an index fund is to have the whole basket of stocks from the start.\u201dI see your point. To use a Pok\u00e9mon analogy, if all you\u2019re capturing are Caterpies or Rattatas, it will take years to build a well-rounded portfolio.Of course, I\u2019ve thought of an answer for that: Every dollar would be invested in an index fund from the start, and your game is about filling in the virtual scorecard for the fun of it. Play and profit; it\u2019s beautiful.And that\u2019s a game anybody should want to win.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sticking With Stocks, Especially in Market Downturns", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byCall it confidence, or an unwillingness to try to time the market, or even complacency. But whatever the reason, some mutual fund managers with the best performances over the last five to 10 years say they are disinclined to sell their stock holdings \u2014 even if the overall market turns down.Mr. Dodson said he did not know when the next market peak would arrive, and so would not try to sell stock in anticipation of it. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may come soon. But I can\u2019t predict it.\u201dThis stick-with-stocks approach, which is embraced by many managers of funds that have prospered in the long bull market, may be a stabilizing force these days, offsetting some of the downward pressures that come when stock prices fall.That doesn\u2019t mean that all of these bullish stock fund managers are pouring fresh money into the market, however.Even if Mr. Dodson isn\u2019t selling stock, his fund\u2019s cash levels have risen from just over 4 percent in September 2015 to 14 percent in August. That\u2019s mainly because the fund\u2019s strong performance has attracted investors, and Mr. Dodson said he could not immediately put all of their money to productive use.\u201cBecause the market is near a high, I can\u2019t really find good stocks to invest in,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t find companies, so I stay in cash.\u201dOther funds maintain their stock holdings because they know that their shareholders expect them to maintain full exposure to, say, small-cap growth or large-cap value stocks. And many others maintain their overall asset allocations, but buy and sell specific securities depending on market conditions, including downturns.\u201cWe are not going to raise cash,\u201d said Chip Reed, who manages the Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap fund, which has returned nearly 12 percent annualized over the last decade, according to Morningstar.Mr. Reed said he would not sell heavily even if he were to come to believe that a bear market was underway. Money can be made in bear markets, he said: \u201cYou just don\u2019t realize it at the time.\u201dIs there good reason to fear a bear market? Some managers are still weighing what they see as conflicting signals.On the negative side, Mr. Adams said, the valuations of many stock indexes have reached 10-year highs. But on the positive side, the dividend yield on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index is above 2 percent, while the 10-year average is 1.71.\u201cCompanies have been increasing dividends faster than stocks have been rising,\u201d he said. Mr. Adams said he could still find attractive growth stocks, sometimes in unexpected places. One example he cites is the Oshkosh Corporation, which this year won a United States Army contract to upgrade heavy tactical vehicles.\u201cWe don\u2019t use cash as an asset allocation tool,\u201d Mr. Ognar said. Instead, even if the market were to appear to be overpriced, he would search for stocks that had relatively good prospects, which he defined as having the ability to sustain growth at twice the pace of gross domestic product growth for three to five years.But Mr. Ognar said he saw no \u201cmajor warning signs\u201d that the market was near a top.He said he did become nervous in January, though even then he did not stay out of the stock market. Instead, he wanted to see whether companies \u201cwere overextended on the debt side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were doing more trading between positions.\u201dLarge fund families often offer asset allocation guidance to their individual portfolio managers, but T. Rowe Price hasn\u2019t recommended an \u201cunderweight\u201d position in stock holdings since 2001, said Sebastien Page, co-head of asset allocation at the company. These days, Mr. Page said, neither stocks nor bonds are particularly appealing. \u201cBoth appear expensive right now,\u201d he said.\u201cFor us the rally seems a bit artificial \u2014 like a sugar high,\u201d Mr. Page said. The Fed\u2019s sustained low interest rate policies have spurred stock advances, he said. But because \u201cbonds are expensive, too,\u201d Mr. Page has not called for a reduction in equities.What would induce Mr. Page to recommend a cutback in stock holdings now? \u201cIf bonds were more attractively valued, maybe we would reconsider our neutral on stocks,\u201d he said. Asked to put a percentage probability on a renewed \u201cunderweight\u201d call, Mr. Page estimated a zero to 15 percent chance.On the other hand, Bruce Picard, MassMutual\u2019s chief investment officer for asset allocation, reported that MassMutual had \u201cslightly\u201d lightened its equity holdings. Still, he said the company was unlikely to make a major shift unless three factors aligned: \u201ca faltering in the employment situation, a loss of momentum in consumer spending and a faster pace of Fed tightening.\u201dOf course, one fund manager\u2019s reason for selling stocks may be another\u2019s reason for buying.Mr. Adams of Mairs & Power said a downturn might well be a buying opportunity. \u201cWhen prices on good stocks go down,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m like a kid in a candy store.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Higher Prices Dim the Appeal of Dividend-Paying Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byFundamentallyDividend-paying stocks have had a terrific run for the last five years and already have double-digit gains in the first three quarters of 2016.But as money has been moving out of bonds and into these equities in search of income \u2014 dividend stocks are yielding 2.5 percent, nearly a point higher than 10-year Treasury notes \u2014 investors find themselves in a quandary.For one thing, traditional high-yielding areas of the market are trading at frothier levels than in recent memory.The price-to-earnings ratio for utility shares in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, for example, is now 17, based on projected profits over the next 12 months. That represents a 20 percent premium to the sector\u2019s historical average.\u201cThe parts of the dividend market that feel most at risk are stocks that are perceived to be more stable and bondlike, like regulated utilities and consumer staples stocks,\u201d said Ben Kirby, a manager of the Thornburg Investment Income Builder Fund.Mr. Kirby said his fund, which beat more than 70 percent of its peers in the third quarter and more than 90 percent in the last decade, has been reducing its exposure to these areas this year.At the same time, an alternative approach known as dividend growth \u2014 which focuses not on high yielders, but on modest payers that are likely to increase their dividends consistently over time \u2014 is also running into problems.The earnings growth rate among companies in the S.&P. 500 has been declining for five consecutive quarters, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Market Intelligence, and dividends represent that portion of profits that is returned to shareholders.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that there\u2019s a lot of room for dividends to grow in the absence of earnings growth,\u201d said Floyd Tyler, president and chief investment officer at the asset management firm Preserver Partners. \u201cThat\u2019s a real headwind.\u201dMoreover, corporations have just been through an extended stretch in which dividends have grown much faster than their historical average.Josh Peters, senior portfolio manager for Morningstar Investment Management, pointed out that over the last 12 years, the growth rate for dividends on an inflation-adjusted basis has been 5.9 percent. That is significantly faster than the historical real dividend growth rate of about 2 percent for stocks in the S.&P. 500.Payout ratios \u2014 which measure the percentage of a company\u2019s earnings being used for dividends \u2014 have been rising. This combination of slowing earnings growth and rising payout ratios is why Mr. Peters said \u201cthe golden age of dividend growth is over.\u201dThis leaves investors with few options.Melda Mergen, head of North American equities for Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said it makes sense to \u201cbe as diversified as possible.\u201d She added, \u201cYou have to try to balance the growers with the current payers.\u201dThat involves embracing economic sectors that have not historically been associated with dividends.Take technology. Though the sector has a below-average current yield of 1.6 percent, tech companies are now the second-largest contributor to S.&P. 500 dividends, behind the financial sector, based on total dollars returned to shareholders.\u201cThere are pockets of tech with good cash flow and strong balance sheets,\u201d Ms. Mergen said. \u201cAnd companies are starting to hear more shareholder demand to have more profits returned through dividends.\u201dThe key, she said, is to look at high-quality companies with strong balance sheets and reliable earnings that \u2014 in the event of an economic downturn \u2014 will be likely to maintain payouts.Mr. Kirby also prefers high-quality companies, but he notes that these stocks have been in big demand in recent years. So to find quality businesses that trade at decent prices, investors must be willing to consider economically cyclical companies, which may not be popular with dividend investors this late in the economic recovery.Take the CME Group, which runs several financial exchanges in the United States, including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.\u201cThis is a high-quality business with high market share in each of the contracts it trades, so there\u2019s pricing power,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s interesting about the stock is that it\u2019s a bit countercyclical.\u201d He pointed out that volatility and fear were usually detrimental to financial businesses. But \u201cwhenever investor concerns rise, they hedge that risk with futures and options contracts, so CME\u2019s trading volume can increase in those times,\u201d he said.In addition to the stock\u2019s 2.2 percent dividend yield, the company often issues a special dividend at year-end, which sometimes can effectively double the yield, he said.John D. Linehan, manager of the T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund, said, \u201cIn order to be a value-conscious dividend investor, you have to make some sacrifice today, whether that means compromising on valuations, stability of earnings, or the regions where you invest.\u201dWhen Mr. Linehan took over management of the fund nearly a year ago, he began broadening the universe of potential holdings. \u201cThere can be more attractive opportunities outside the United States without sacrificing on quality,\u201d he said, noting that foreign stocks now make up about 7 percent of the fund\u2019s assets.As an example, \u201cwe were having problems finding opportunities in consumer staples companies in the U.S. where valuations look stretched,\u201d he said. Yet overseas, he found cheaper stocks like Diageo, the London-based multinational maker of spirits such as Guinness and Johnnie Walker.Robert Hordon, a manager of the First Eagle Global Income Builder Fund, said he had similar experiences with real estate stocks. In the United States, real estate stocks have shot up since March 2009, raising questions about the sector\u2019s valuations.\u201cThat being said, we are owners of real estate securities outside the U.S., in Asia, where high-quality real estate stocks are trading at more reasonable valuations,\u201d he said. One example, he said, is Mandarin Oriental International, which is based in Hong Kong and owns and operates hotels and residences there, elsewhere in Asia and in other parts of the world.Mr. Hordon added that the United States market \u201cis a relatively low-yielding stock market anyway.\u201dWhat is more, American stocks have outperformed foreign shares for several years, a traditional sign to value-minded investors that better opportunities may exist elsewhere.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hedge Fund Targets Companies\u2019 Weakness: The Gender Gap", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byThe chief executive at a plastics company was playing golf. A lot of golf.The activist hedge fund the Barington Capital Group, through a website that tracked golfers\u2019 handicaps, found that the chief executive was routinely playing 18 holes or more on weekdays, even as the company\u2019s stock price was lagging.It was that finding a decade ago that helped shape the career of Dianne McKeever, then a partner at Barington.Lack of oversight by the company\u2019s board enabled the incessant golf games, and the chief executive\u2019s time on the green was keeping him away from trying to fix the stock price, Ms. McKeever argued.\u201cThis was a perfect example of why diversity of all types \u2014 not only gender and multicultural diversity, but also operational and skill-set diversity \u2014 is needed in the boardroom,\u201d Ms. McKeever said.Her idea: Bring in new blood, get rid of the frequent golf games and focus management\u2019s attention on the company.Ms. McKeever declined to name the company, but filings indicated that it was A. Schulman, a Midwestern plastics supplier. A. Schulman did not respond to four requests seeking comment. The company\u2019s management team was all men, and while it did have one woman on the board, the directors were close friends, she recalled.\u201cThe board\u2019s chumminess and insularity were impediments to making those difficult, but necessary, decisions,\u201d Ms. McKeever said recently.To her, the episode amply illustrated how a lack of gender diversity could contribute to deficient corporate governance, like a distracted chief executive, and board entrenchment.Ms. McKeever, 38, and her partner and co-founder of Ides Capital in Manhattan, Robert Longnecker, 42, saw diversification as a missing part of the typical activist strategy.Ides, which was started about a year ago, has a short track record, with only one public battle \u2014 and the fund is small. But it appears to be the first activist hedge fund in the United States fronted by a woman, according to data compiled by Josh Black of Activist Insight, a research firm that tracks the subject.Like any other hedge fund, Ides seeks to generate returns from its investments and sees diversifying small and midsize corporate boardrooms as a way to help improve stock prices.\u201cWeak governance practices, including a lack of diversity, coincides frequently with poor valuations,\u201d Ms. McKeever said in an interview. \u201cThose improvements, in our minds, are no-brainers.\u201dIn starting Ides, Ms. McKeever is charging through the notoriously male-dominated world of activist investing, known for the famous personality-driven investors like Carl C. Icahn, William A. Ackman, Daniel Loeb and Nelson Peltz.Traditional activist investors also rail against the chumminess of corporate boards but do so by incorporating their own associates, who, more often than not, are male and white.Ms. McKeever grew up in Indianapolis. Her father was a small-business owner who taught her about companies by letting her buy and sell stocks at a young age. She moved to the New York area for college, majoring in chemistry at New York University and chemical engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology, and later attended law school at Fordham.She got into activist investing after meeting James A. Mitarotonda, the founder of Barington, at an event at N.Y.U., which he had also attended. She began working at the firm in 2001.\u201cHaving worked with Dianne for almost seven years, it is not surprising to me that she would start an activist hedge fund focused on improving gender diversity,\u201d said Mr. Mitarotonda, the chief executive of Barington. \u201cShe feels strongly about fairness and equality.\u201dShortly after starting Ides, Ms. McKeever wasted little time with her first public fight: Boingo Wireless, a company known for providing Wi-Fi, for a fee, at airports.In a letter to Boingo in April, she listed various corporate governance mishaps, including \u201cthe board\u2019s failure to diversify the boardroom.\u201d She later filed proxy materials, nominating two directors to Boingo\u2019s board: one woman and one man.Ultimately, Boingo agreed to settle with Ides, expanding the board from six to nine members. Ms. McKeever agreed to withdraw her two nominees in exchange for the three that Boingo brought in. One of the three was a woman, the first since the company went public.\u201cWe believe diversity at every level of the company is critical to Boingo\u2019s success,\u201d said Lauren de la Fuente, a spokeswoman at Boingo. \u201cIt\u2019s why we were already actively engaged in recruiting women onto the Boingo board when Ides Capital approached us, and had been in discussions with Kathy Misunas, whom we subsequently added to the Boingo board.\u201dSince Boingo and Ides reached their settlement on June 1, shares of Boingo have gained more than 30 percent.Some countries, like Norway and Germany, have passed laws that require a minimum percentage of women on each corporate board. In the United States, where there are no such requirements, shareholders have taken it upon themselves to change board composition. More than 250 proposals have been made since 1997, according to data compiled by Carol Marquardt, a professor at Baruch College, and Christine Wiedman, a professor at the University of Waterloo.But the growing class of shareholder activists, many of whom promote themselves as the stalwarts of corporate governance, have a paltry record when it comes to women.In addition to nominating fewer women as directors, they appear to disproportionately target female chief executives. The Fortune 500 executives Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, Irene Rosenfeld of Mondelez International, Ursula Burns of Xerox Corporation and Sheri McCoy of Avon Products have all encountered activist investors.A potential reason for this is that upon announcing female leadership at a company, the market tends to react negatively, sending its stock price lower, according to Christine Shropshire, who wrote the study for A.S.U. There can also be spillover effects, where the stocks of other female-led companies fall on the appointment of another woman chief executive, she said. Activists focus on companies that they perceive to be undervalued, which may explain some of why they have targeted women-run companies more frequently.There is also an implicit bias to nominate someone who is demographically similar, said Ms. Shropshire, who has been interviewing female directors at publicly traded firms.\u201cTheir anecdotes about determining the slate of potential board candidates reflect a hesitation among men to change the status quo of boardroom dynamics by bringing in female members, especially more than one,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen may be more likely to pose tough questions or engage in more intensive monitoring efforts, though interestingly, I would expect those behaviors could also make them more valued and potential allies for activists themselves.\u201dThat is the bet that Ides is making.An article on Wednesday about activist hedge funds and the gender gap on company boards referred incorrectly in some copies to efforts at the hedge fund Barington Capital Group more than a decade ago to change the practices of a company where a chief executive was deemed to be spending too much time on golf. Dianne McKeever, then a Barington partner \u2014 not the hedge fund itself \u2014 argued that the golf games were hurting the company\u2019s stock price and that management changes were needed.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When Mr. Cervony heard about Desert Trip from his mother, \u201cI almost died,\u201d he said, shaking his \u201970s teen-idol hair. Although he had already seen the Stones, Mr. McCartney (twice) and the Who (the day after senior prom), \u201cTo see them all together is beyond anything I could\u2019ve ever expected or hoped for.\u201dRight away, he and the equally excitable, always grinning Mr. Kray began preparations to meet up in California. While most millennial Desert Trip attendees were with at least one older relative \u2014 with many saying they were there at their parents\u2019 insistence and on their dime \u2014 Mr. Cervony and Mr. Kray were among the youngest to go it alone.\u201cI sold some stocks I got when I was a kid,\u201d Mr. Cervony said, in addition to using some of his college financial aid refund.

On Saturday afternoon, after Mr. Cervony splurged on records by Mr. Dylan and Mr. Young at the festival\u2019s vinyl shop, the duo struck up a conversation with a graying couple about Bernie Sanders, the blues and whether Mr. McCartney is a corporate sellout.\u201cGood luck with the future \u2014 it\u2019s in your hands,\u201d the man, 70, told them in parting.Even among themselves, Mr. Cervony and Mr. Kray remained devotedly on topic, musing on Dylan mythology, comparing obscure solo Keith Richards songs and anticipating a potential Desert Trip concert film. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to buy the DVD,\u201d Mr. Kray said.Having claimed their spot against the general admission barricade more than four hours before showtime, Mr. Cervony Snapchatted in anticipation, for once showing his \u201990s-baby bona fides.

{"Headline": "\u2018Brexit\u2019 Blurs the European Investment Outlook", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byWhen the British voted in a referendum to leave the European Union, it clouded the political outlook across the region, and that made the economic and investment outlook far murkier, too.It\u2019s still too early to tell, even three months after the vote, how much of an impact the so-called Brexit is likely to have on economic and business conditions, investment advisers say. Calm has been restored, they acknowledge, but they warn that long-term risks remain in Europe, Britain most of all, for businesses and therefore for investors, too.The investment outlook is \u201ca lot less favorable\u201d in Britain, said Alan Mudie, head of investment strategy at Societe Generale Private Banking Hambros. Until companies have clarity about their longer-term relationship with the European Union, they will delay investments, he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense not to, until they know what sort of marketplace they\u2019re going to be operating in.\u201dSarah Ketterer, manager of the Causeway International Value fund, agreed that \u201cfrom an investment perspective, everything is delayed.\u201d As a result, she said she was \u201cmaking very conservative assumptions\u201d about conditions in Britain, and she predicted a mild recession in 2017.She is not alone, and Britain may not be, either, when it comes to the consequences of Brexit. The British bank Barclays warned that Brexit is likely to create substantial headwinds for economies in Britain and on the Continent in coming months.Highlighting surveys showing that corporations\u2019 plans to invest declined markedly and that consumer confidence had eroded, Barclays forecast that the British economy would be pushed into a recession imminently.As for Europe over all, \u201cwe expect growth to slow further towards year-end, as Brexit weighs on confidence, private consumption and investment,\u201d the bank said in an economics report in August. Reaction to the vote in regional economic and confidence data had been muted, the report said. But: \u201cMost forward-looking components showed that expectations had resumed their downward trend, and we expect confidence to be further affected in the months to come. Uncertainty is likely to weigh on investment, with a negative feedback loop on the labor market and private consumption.\u201dThe initial reaction to the Brexit vote was much starker. Many people assumed that Brexit would be awful for the country, the region and beyond. The result was plunging stock markets and currencies almost everywhere.The MSCI Europe index fell 13 percent in the two trading days after the June 23 referendum, and the MSCI index of British stocks fell 15.7 percent. The indexes are calculated in dollars, so those figures incorporate the declines in stocks and also in the euro and the pound against the dollar.Within a week, both indexes had recovered more than half of the losses, although it is unclear why. A new British prime minister had taken over and pledged to honor the decision to leave the 28-nation bloc, but everything else related to Britain\u2019s departure was still up in the air. The outlook had not changed, only the public\u2019s feelings about it.Markets in the region have stabilized, helping investors who hung on for the wild ride. Funds that specialize in European stocks rose 5.3 percent in the third quarter, according to Morningstar.But where investors, and businesses, go from here is much less certain.What makes the post-referendum outlook especially hard to gauge for businesses is that Britain has yet to make clear how it intends to honor the result. A report by Brewin Dolphin, a British wealth management firm, suggested that the new government of Prime Minister Theresa May would have to thread a very slender needle as it tries to keep the country in the single European market for goods and services while imposing limits on immigration.How it will go about accomplishing that could become clearer next spring. Mrs. May said earlier this month that Britain would invoke Article 50 in March. That is a European Union treaty provision that governs the process for a country to leave the union.Evidence of the concern among businesses can be found in a Bank of England survey taken just after the vote. It reported that \u201ccompanies indicated the result of the E.U. referendum would have a negative effect, overall, on capital spending, hiring and turnover over the coming year.\u201d It added that \u201cemployment and investment intentions had weakened in absolute terms, pointing to expectations of little change in staff numbers and capital spending over the coming six to 12 months.\u201dJames Hunt, manager of the Tocqueville International Value fund, is willing to give the economy and stocks in Britain and the rest of Europe some benefit of doubt when it comes to Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, if and when it occurs.\u201cThe market reaction is overdone,\u201d Mr. Hunt said. \u201cBrexit may not happen. There are plenty of ways the U.K. government can cause it not to happen\u201d through what it asks for, and when, in its negotiations with the union.If Brexit goes ahead, \u201cthere will be a moderate impact on the U.K. initially and then I think they could end up in a better place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a smaller impact on the European economy, and what I hope is that it\u2019s another incentive for Europe to accelerate whatever structural reforms they have going.\u201dSome businesses and investors in Europe have waited \u2014 and hoped \u2014 for many years for government initiatives to reduce regulatory hurdles and to make labor cheaper and employment more flexible, which would improve competitiveness and economic growth.The prospect of Britain leaving the European Union could concentrate the minds of political leaders, but Ms. Ketterer said many large companies are tired of hanging around and are undertaking changes of their own. That fact tends to get lost amid the apprehension over factors such as Brexit, creating what she sees as solid investment opportunities, particularly in large, European, multinational companies in economically fragile sectors.\u201cWe might have to wait awhile for governments to restructure, but these companies aren\u2019t waiting,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really like these globally competitive, cyclical companies. They are really well managed and cheaper\u201d than shares of equivalent American companies.Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how \u201cBrexit\u201d has affected business so far.The preference for large British companies that make money abroad is widespread. Mr. Hunt likes the beverage purveyor Diageo, for instance. Its \u201ccash flows are global, and the perceived connection to the U.K. is greater than it really is,\u201d he said.A globally diversified revenue stream should inoculate such companies against weakness in the pound, a development that provides British exporters with a substantial competitive advantage over their peers elsewhere by making British goods and services cheaper to foreign customers, Mr. Mudie of Societe Generale pointed out. That is a prime reason that he also favors large British companies.Within the eurozone, he recommends health care and consumer sectors. Consumer stocks should benefit from a continuing decline in unemployment and improved access to bank credit, he said. Considering the markets more broadly, he anticipates American stocks outperforming their European peers, with British stocks doing better than ones on the Continent.Ms. Ketterer said she is taking a chance on British financial companies. A post-Brexit reduction in interest rates by the Bank of England hit their stocks especially hard; banks\u2019 profits depend on the spread between rates at which they borrow and lend, which is squeezed when rates fall, and insurance companies\u2019 profits depend on the income paid on the bonds in which they invest their policyholders\u2019 premiums. But the decline in bank and insurance stocks has been so severe, in her view, that they warrant a bet.Ms. Ketterer likes the British insurance companies Prudential and Aviva. Among British multinationals, she said the energy company Shell is appealing for its high yet secure dividend yield of close to 7 percent.But how big a bargain any European stock is may not become clear until the uncertainty surrounding Brexit abates. As Ms. Ketterer reminds investors, that could take awhile.\u201cThe initial shock has worn off\u201d since the referendum, she said. But \u201cin the U.K. nothing has been settled. There\u2019s a very long road ahead.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Congressional Grilling, Wells Fargo Is Berated in Newspaper Ads", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byFormer bank tellers and angry customers. Democrats and Republicans in Congress. State treasurers in California and Illinois. Even Hillary Clinton. They have all lambasted Wells Fargo in recent weeks over the phony accounts scandal.Now, a wealthy 80-year-old businessman and philanthropist from Texas is taking aim at the besieged bank.Lacy Harber, who owns real estate in Las Vegas and numerous small banks and marinas, took out advertisements in four large newspapers on Thursday \u2014 including The New York Times \u2014 denouncing Wells Fargo.Mr. Harber\u2019s ad describes itself as an \u201copen letter to the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee, Wells Fargo board of directors and the American public.\u201dIt goes on to assert: \u201cThe recent disclosures about Wells Fargo are only the tip of the iceberg.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Harber said his complaint with Wells Fargo centers on its investment brokers. He said that on Aug. 24, 2015, as the stock market dropped precipitously, he placed orders for about $34.8 million worth of stocks through his brokers at Wells Fargo Advisors.Working from his kitchen counter at home in North Texas, Mr. Harber said he went on the buying spree to take advantage of the dropping prices, snapping up shares of blue chip companies like Apple and Exxon Mobil.Like many active investors, Mr. Harber bought the stocks \u201con margin\u201d which typically means putting down some money and borrowing the rest from the broker. But given the extreme volatility in the market that morning, Wells Fargo, he said, demanded that he pay for the stocks in full.Mr. Harber said that even though he told Wells he could wire $19 million that day and deliver the balance the next day, the bank said it needed the total amount.At the end of that day, he said, Wells sold all of the shares he had bought that day, resulting in a $5 million loss. Adding insult to injury, he said, he was charged about $480,000 in broker fees.In a statement, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Advisors said: \u201cMr. Harber is a highly sophisticated, experienced investor who routinely made his own investing decisions. We executed his transactions on a day of extraordinary market volatility that included a 1,000-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. Mr. Harber\u2019s trades were done on margin. Unfortunately, his trading was affected by adverse market conditions.

A Hindu, he secured the help from India \u2014 at the cost of independence for his predominantly Muslim people.The post-independence war between India and Pakistan left Pakistan in control of the northern and western parts of Kashmir, and China won control over areas in the east during the Sino-Indian War of 1962.Even so, some Kashmiris still hope the maharajah\u2019s quest for independence will one day succeed.Sho Spaeth contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Hong Kong Tribunal Suspends Investor Who Criticized Chinese Firm", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 In a case that has raised concerns over freedom of speech in Hong Kong\u2019s financial markets, a securities tribunal has issued a trading ban against an American investor who criticized the accounts of a Chinese property developer.The investor, Andrew Left, the founder of the California-based firm Citron Research, was barred on Wednesday from trading in Hong Kong for five years. He was also ordered to surrender more than $200,000 in profit from trading shares of Evergrande Real Estate Group Limited, a developer in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou.The case, filed in 2014 by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, has heightened fears that regulators in one of Asia\u2019s biggest financial centers are seeking to suppress critical commentary and the free flow of financial information.It was the second time in recent years that the commission has taken aim at a foreign financial company for criticizing the accounting, governance or other performance aspects of Chinese businesses.In April, an appellate board in Hong Kong upheld a $1.4 million fine that the regulator won against the ratings agency Moody\u2019s Investors Services related to a 2011 report that outlined \u201cred flags\u201d at several Chinese companies.Short-selling involves investors borrowing stock and selling it, betting that the price will fall and that the shares can be bought back at a lower price before being returned.The securities appeals tribunal, in its ruling on the Moody\u2019s case, acknowledged the right of financial market participants to freedom of expression.Those allegations, denied repeatedly by Evergrande, included claims that the developer was \u201cinsolvent and had consistently presented fraudulent information to the investing public.\u201dChina\u2019s property market has recently rebounded from a slump, and prices have soared to the point that analysts have warned of a bubble.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Janus to Merge With Henderson, Forming Asset Management Giant", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byThe Janus Capital Group and the Henderson Group, a large London-based investment manager, said on Monday that they would merge in an all-stock deal that would create an asset manager with greater global scale and about $320 billion of assets under management.The deal \u2014 creating a company to be called Janus Henderson Global Investors \u2014 highlights the extent to which smaller mutual fund companies that focus on actively managed investment offerings are feeling the pressure from the explosive growth of lower cost, passive strategies like exchange traded funds.The companies said on Monday that combined they would be more stable through market cycles and would have greater geographic reach. They said the merger would also result in annual cost savings of $110 million.Andrew Formica, the Henderson chief executive, told analysts on a conference call Monday that the merger talks grew out of conversations beginning in February with Richard M. Weil, the chief executive of Janus, about issues affecting the industry.\u201cAt some point, it was clear to both of us to achieve our own ambitions we would have to do a transformational deal or a larger transaction to give us greater scale in the market we\u2019re operating in,\u201d Mr. Formica said. \u201cIt just merged into a point of saying: \u2018Well, hang on a minute. Let\u2019s explore if it works for both of us.\u2019 \u201dJanus, based in Denver, was one of the industry\u2019s most dynamic outfits in the 1990s, with an expertise in investing in fast-growing companies. The firm was hit hard following the financial crisis. It has lost $30 billion from its mutual funds since 2008, according to Morningstar, as investors have piled into better performing E.T.F.s that track a variety of stock and bond indexes.Although Janus has begun to introduce a suite of E.T.F.s, they have not yet been able to attract significant assets.Janus has also not had a huge inflow of cash after its decision to offer Mr. Gross a home following his departure from its rival Pimco.The size of Mr. Gross\u2019s benchmark unconstrained fund is $1.5 billion and has not budged much from this level in the last year.In an emailed statement, Mr. Gross expressed his support for the merger and went out of his way to remark that his fund was beating a similarly themed fund at Pimco.\u201cHenderson obviously bought a great performing fund with Janus Global Unconstrained,\u201d Mr. Gross said. He pointed out that his fund\u2019s performance, in absolute and relative terms, was \u201ctypical of my historical standards, at 400 basis points above the benchmark for the year, far better than Pimco.\u201dAccording to data from Morningstar, Mr. Gross\u2019s fund has gained 4.9 percent through this year to date, compared with 3.8 percent for Pimco\u2019s unconstrained bond fund.Under the terms of the deal announced on Monday, each share in Janus, which has a market capitalization of about $2.61 billion, would be exchanged for 4.719 new Henderson shares, giving Henderson shareholders about 57 percent of the new company.The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of next year and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.The combined company would be based in London and would have had revenue of more than $2.2 billion in 2015. It will have about 2,300 employees at 29 locations worldwide.Mr. Weil and Mr. Formica would serve as joint chief executives of the combined company.Mr. Formica said that keeping the combined company\u2019s headquarters in London made sense given its expanded global footprint.\u201cFor a global business, London still acts as the best global financial center, or pivot, for a business that spans everything from Asia, Europe to the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon sort of sits in the middle of that.\u201dMr. Formica said that Britain\u2019s referendum in June to leave the European Union, known as Brexit, did not drive the discussions.\u201cAt the end of the day, whenever the Brexit discussions conclude, the U.K. is going to remain a core and big financial market for our products, as will Europe,\u201d he said. Over a 10- or 15-year time frame, he added, \u201cthe Brexit debate is just a drop in the ocean.\u201dOn a pro forma basis, about 54 percent of the company\u2019s assets under management would come from the United States; about 31 percent would come from Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and 15 percent would come from Asia.Michael Werner, a UBS analyst, said that the merger appeared to be complementary \u201cin many respects,\u201d given Janus\u2019s position in the Americas and Henderson\u2019s scale. The two companies also had differing asset portfolios, with Janus more heavily invested in American equities and Henderson having more in global and European stocks.Dai-ichi Life, the Japanese insurer that is Janus\u2019s largest shareholder, has agreed to vote in favor of the merger and would hold about 9 percent of the combined company, according to the news release. Dai-ichi Life intends to invest further in the combined company, aiming to increase its ownership interest to at least 15 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aligning Your Investments With What Motivates You", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersAlpha. Beta. Gamma. Phi.The letters could be the name of a college honor society or maybe a fraternity or sorority. But in finance, they represent the progression of thinking about investments and how to judge them. Phi is the newest one.Alpha measures an investment\u2019s performance against a market index. If the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up 10 percent and a mutual fund is up 15 percent, for example, that 5 percentage point difference is alpha.Beta is the return of any given market. And charting beta is what a passive index fund does. Comparing different indexes\u2019 beta \u2014 say domestic equities and international bonds \u2014 helps investors in deciding how to allocate their investments.For individuals, high gamma is generally achieved by seeking advice from a qualified investment professional. But not always. The original Morningstar paper on gamma discussed the need for intelligent decisions across five areas, including tax management and withdrawal strategies.What phi aims to add is a way for investors to quantify how their motivations \u2014 or those of the people managing their money \u2014 will affect long-term investment returns.Suzanne Duncan, global head of State Street\u2019s Center for Applied Research, who led the team that surveyed and studied about 7,000 individuals and investments professionals over 18 months, said their research began by looking at the role incentives play in making investment decisions. But, she said, it quickly shifted to examining what motivated a person to invest \u2014 or not \u2014 in the first place.\u201cWe understood quite quickly and clearly that most individuals and professionals are working with a market-based motive,\u201d said Ms. Duncan, who conducted the study in conjunction with the CFA Institute, which administers the chartered financial analyst designation. \u201cIt can manifest itself in a passion for markets with individual investors. But for most, it\u2019s a fear of markets.\u201dAnd both of these motivations, the study found, can negatively affect long-term returns.To score high on phi, Ms. Duncan said, people need to have a deeper sense of purpose in what they are doing, whatever the job. \u201cIt\u2019s not about outperforming markets or peers, and it\u2019s not an asset-gathering measure of performance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe performance has to be defined as sustainable and with a deeper sense of purpose.\u201dShe noted that in the research, financial services professionals had low phi scores, ranking 12th out of 14 industries. Phi is \u201ca unicorn in our industry,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not a unicorn in other industries.\u201dMs. Duncan cited companies like Whole Foods Market, Southwest Airlines and Disney for instilling a high sense of passion, or phi, in their employees.Qualities that you might think are desirable are not, when it comes to phi. For example, answering that you have a passion for the markets or that you like your job because you work with smart people will not raise your phi score. Both responses seem good at first, but there is the risk that there is no greater purpose in what you are doing.\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting because it talks to a very needed culture shift to our industry,\u201d said Rebecca Fender, head of the future of finance initiative at the CFA Institute. \u201cPhi takes this heretofore very unquantifiable subject and puts some numbers around it so we can have a more meaningful conversation with the industry.\u201dWhile the study found that wealth was not a differentiator for phi scores, there were generational differences. Millennials scored high on the test and, more generally, as people got older, their phi scores increased.When it came to the types of investors who score high on the phi test, Ms. Duncan was careful not to overgeneralize. But she said the research found that people who invested with a socially responsible mind-set scored better. Their dual goal of seeking profit but doing so to achieve some social benefit naturally gives them a purpose beyond returns.But what about those who invest more broadly or do so to maximize their gains? It\u2019s not easy to change them.Individuals seeking to improve their phi have to move their focus beyond competing with their neighbors and looking toward a specific goal. Ms. Duncan said there were three areas where they should focus \u2014 their purpose, habits and incentives.In terms of purpose, individuals need to ask soul-searching questions about what they want their life to be. With investing, the investment goal ranks below the purpose of those investments \u2014 what they might use the money for in the future and not the sheer amount in the portfolio.To stay on the path to that purpose, investors need to change habits that distract from it.\u201cIn the case of individual investors, the cue is this market motive,\u201d Ms. Duncan said. \u201cThey need to replace the market motive with the purpose motive, which is phi.\u201d\u201cThose with high phi will have sustainable performance to a much greater degree,\u201d she added. \u201cThe purpose motive breaks the bad habit\u201d of following the markets.The incentives to get people to shift their purpose and break bad habits, she said, are taken from nudge theory, a term coined by the economist Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, a legal scholar. The idea is to persuade someone to adopt better behavior, like automatically signing people up for retirement plans or getting them to agree to increase their contribution rate to the plans when they get a raise.For investment professionals, Ms. Duncan said, the way to increase phi is to change motivation that is often tied to compensation. The study discusses four ways of doing this, including laying out a compelling vision for the future, challenging investment professionals\u2019 assumptions and discussing their values and beliefs.At its simplest, this could mean changing annual bonuses so they are paid out over several years, with a greater reward if the performance is sustainable.The study showed that changes that increased phi had a meaningful impact on a person\u2019s investment strategy.Every one-point increase in people\u2019s orientation toward investment goals with a purpose \u2014 and the scale is 0 to 3 \u2014 equated to 42 percent greater odds that the investors know what they are paying in fees, 37 percent greater odds that investors are not rejecting their financial adviser, 38 percent greater odds that the people consider investing in socially responsible investments and 79 percent greater odds that investors will trade less frequently, the research found.For investment professionals, that same one-point increase resulted in a 21 percent greater likelihood of excelling at long-term goals and 37 percent greater chance of scoring higher on client satisfaction.\u201cThis is intended to start a thought process of leaders in the industry,\u201d Ms. Fender said. \u201cCulture can\u2019t be changed overnight. It\u2019s essential to reconnect the investment profession with its stated purpose of improving society.\u201dAnd for those seeking an adviser, administering a phi test would surely help. As a group, wealth managers have higher phi than others in financial services. One reason is they are more connected with the people they serve.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byIn the 1990s, art found a new medium. Anarchic and unconstrained, the World Wide Web attracted an oddball collection of people ready to do almost anything and call it art. Often their work looked weird and amateurish, with pixelated graphics, tinny chiptune music and garish colors. But what it lacked aesthetically it made up for in conviction.In Australia, four women who styled themselves VNS Matrix posted a \u201cCyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century,\u201d followed by a vagina-framed poster in which they joyously proclaimed themselves \u201csaboteurs of big daddy mainframe.\u201d In Moscow, a young woman named Olia Lialina created \u201cMy Boyfriend Came Back From the War,\u201d a forking narrative, poignant and oblique, that combined text with grainy black-and-white imagery. An anonymous woman in Amsterdam, eventually identified as Martine Neddam, built a brightly colored site that purported to be the home page of a 13-year-old named Mouchette, after the girl in the 1967 Robert Bresson film who finds a life of torment and abuse too much to bear.In addition to salvaging the past, the aim is to tell the story of Internet-based art in an online gallery that serves much the same narrative function as the galleries in the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of amnesia about the history these things have,\u201d Michael Connor, Rhizome\u2019s artistic director, said as he sat in the New Museum\u2019s ground-floor cafe. \u201cThis is an opportunity to really be rigorous.\u201dBroadly speaking, the story Rhizome is telling can be divided into two parts, with the dot-com collapse of 2000-1 as the inflection point. The post-bubble side looks relatively familiar, facilitated as it is by high-speed, always-on connections and characterized by rapid commercialization and the emergence of social media and streaming video platforms like Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005) and Tumblr (2007).But before the bubble in internet stocks burst, before Google took over and Netscape collapsed and Apple was resurrected from near-death, the web was \u201can entirely new world,\u201d as Mr. Arcangel, 38, put it in a telephone interview from his home in Norway. \u201cSometimes it was not even clear what you were looking at \u2014 was it an artwork or a web server that was broken?\u201d Even so, he knew something exciting was happening.Net Art\u2019s political posture was characteristic of the feverish, techno-utopian excitement shared by netheads in general. \u201cThere was this radical idea that the internet was going to change the way art is made and shared,\u201d said Lauren Cornell, who was Rhizome\u2019s executive director from 2005 to 2012 and who has since moved to the New Museum as a curator and associate director of technology initiatives. \u201cThat it might even do away with traditional institutions and gatekeepers\u201d \u2014 that is, museums and curators.Preserving this work is not just a matter of uploading old computer files. \u201cThe files don\u2019t mean anything without the browser,\u201d Mr. Connor, 38, said. \u201cAnd the browser doesn\u2019t mean anything without the computer\u201d it runs on. Yet browsers from 15 or 20 years ago won\u2019t work on today\u2019s computers, and computers from that era are hard to come by and even harder to keep working.Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome\u2019s preservation director, has been working with the University of Freiburg in Germany to develop a sophisticated software framework that emulates outdated computing environments on current machines.\u201cVVEBCAM\u201d was provocative, and it got a strong response. \u201cPeople were really nasty,\u201d she said, \u201cand my policy was always to respond in a way that was equal to or greater than the comments they made.\u201d Rhizome intends to embed the video in a reconstructed YouTube player, but there\u2019s no way to recreate the reaction the video provoked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were taking screen shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWhich could be said for Net Art itself. \u201cNet Art is not over,\u201d Mr. Tribe said, \u201cbut it is over as an avant-garde art movement.\u201d In its place is art posted to the internet not by art world renegades but by professionals for whom the internet is one medium among many \u2014 people like Ms. Cortright or Mr. Trecartin, whose deliriously disjointed videos are equally at home on YouTube and at the Saatchi Gallery in London.The term that\u2019s being used is Post-Internet Art \u2014 not \u201cpost\u201d in the sense that the internet is over, but that it\u2019s ubiquitous. In the post-internet era, the internet is simply assumed.\u201cIt\u2019s different, now that everybody\u2019s online,\u201d said Ms. Cortright, 30. \u201cEven 10 years ago, it was not as much a part of people\u2019s lives as it is today.\u201d She considers it \u201cadmirable\u201d that Rhizome has committed itself to preserving artifacts from a past that\u2019s so recent and yet so distant, \u201cOtherwise, they really would be lost.\u201dAnd yet, she added, \u201cyou can\u2019t be too attached to something that\u2019s completely fleeting.

{"Headline": "How Regular Investing Smooths the Market\u2019s Ups and Downs", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byYou may not realize you are doing it, but if you are salting away money every month in a workplace retirement plan, there is a good chance that you are practicing one of the most time-honored methods for long-term investors: dollar-cost averaging.If you are not doing it, dollar-cost averaging is worth considering, because it will keep you invested in markets all of the time. That way you avoid the risky business of guessing when the top or bottom is and save gradually, at a reasonable price.The idea is to keep buying at varying prices. Your average price, using this method, is neither at the highest- nor lowest-possible market price. While dollar-cost averaging is not a perfect strategy, it is a good way to blunt the emotional distress of market volatility and reduce the risk of making bad decisions.When share prices drop, you can buy more of a fund or stock, and vice versa when prices rise. It is a durable middle-of-the-road method to stay invested over the long term.Dollar-cost averaging is compelling because most investors are not good at timing markets to their advantage. In its most recent survey of long-term investor behavior, Dalbar, a financial research company, found that the average stock mutual fund investor trailed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index by almost 4 percent over the last two decades through 2015.That means despite the market downturn after the British vote to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), the 2013 federal debt ceiling scare and the 2008 meltdown, you still would have been better off just sitting in a stock index fund after the market\u2019s most volatile periods and continuing to buy shares even as stocks plunged.Regular contributors to retirement plans who do not jump in and out of the market are adept, if often unknowing, practitioners of the technique.\u201cMost do dollar-cost averaging throughout their careers,\u201d said Rob Cheney, a certified financial planner in Palo Alto, Calif. \u201cPeople are hesitant to put lump sums to work.\u201dMost people who invest in their 401(k) accounts not only employ dollar-cost averaging but also trade infrequently, avoiding money-losing market-timing moves.In the \u201cBrexit\u201d-related sell-off in July, for example, only 0.4 percent of 401(k) accounts tracked by Aon Hewitt, the human resources consulting firm, shifted money from stock funds to cash or bond funds. That compares with an average of 0.2 percent during nonvolatile periods, according to Rob Austin, Aon Hewitt\u2019s director of retirement research, whose company has been tracking retirement trading for 20 years and monitors more than 1.3 million 401(k) accounts.While trading within a 401(k) is generally a bad idea because traders tend to lose money over time, steady contributions add up.\u201cMost people in 401(k)\u2019s are also making contributions along the way,\u201d Mr. Austin said, and that increases their balances. \u201cWe see a lot less trading over all.\u201dAdvice on dollar-cost averaging becomes complicated when a lump sum, like an inheritance, big bonus or other large cash payment, is being invested.Mr. Cheney, whose clients include Silicon Valley employees who receive stock awards or large bonuses, says dollar-cost averaging a lump sum may not work for everyone.In such a situation, you could benefit from buying shares in one or more timed purchases when the market offers bargain prices. But you must gauge your risk tolerance on making such moves. You could easily guess wrong on the market\u2019s direction, and it is hard to tell if you are getting the best price.That adds another wrinkle, which is why it is important to consider risk tolerance. How much of a loss can you stomach? What is your investment time horizon?\u201cI don\u2019t advise dollar-cost averaging for lump-sum investing such as inheritances,\u201d said Simon Brady, a certified financial planner based in Manhattan.\u201cTaking a significant lump sum and breaking it up into, say, 24 equal chunks and contributing one chunk a month for two years would mean that for much of that time, the majority of the funds would be sitting in some useless savings account, where the temptation will exist to go in and spend it. In any case, you would be holding money that would not be working for you,\u201d Mr. Brady said.\u201cDollar-cost averaging works best for money that comes to you over a period of time. It\u2019s based on the assumption that markets go up over time,\u201d he added.Then there is the potential continuing cost of dollar-cost averaging. If you are buying individual shares of stock or exchange-traded funds, you might be paying a commission on every purchase, which can add up. But most large mutual-fund companies do not charge commissions for direct purchases, particularly for shares of their largest index mutual or exchange-traded funds. This is not a problem in most 401(k) accounts, either.Of course, if shares really are cheap, a big purchase may make sense. Making that decision can be risky, though, and before doing so, you might want some sound advice, perhaps from a chartered financial analyst or certified financial planner.Yet even market professionals are often wrong about the timing of stock market cycles. For most people, dollar-cost averaging is a reliable fallback.Sticking with the strategy may take discipline if stocks start to veer up and down, especially down. If you have sufficient risk tolerance and do not need cash immediately, regular, steady, long-term investing may be just the thing. Patience and consistency reduce the opportunity to make bad decisions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marmite Survives After \u2018Brexit\u2019 Spurs Tesco-Unilever Price Dispute", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Months after Britain voted to leave the European Union, the first tangible victim of that decision has emerged and, like the 28-nation bloc itself, it is something that has divided the country for years: Marmite, a sludgy and odd-tasting breakfast spread.But they probably never thought it would come to this.Fears that Marmite and other British classics, like the PG Tips brand of tea, might disappear from store shelves had gripped Britons after reports that the supermarket chain Tesco and the owner of those brands, the British-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever, were locked in a price dispute over who should bear the cost of the weakening pound. Marmite was briefly unavailable in Tesco\u2019s online market, and store supplies dwindled.The pound has fallen drastically against other major currencies since the vote to leave the bloc, and as worries have increased that Britain would opt for a \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2014 shorthand for a strict break with the European Union \u2014 which could limit its tariff-free access to the region\u2019s single market for goods and services.But after the markets closed on Thursday, Tesco reassured the public that the crisis had been averted. In a statement, Tesco said, \u201cWe\u2019re pleased this situation has been resolved to our satisfaction.\u201dIn reality, consumers will most likely have to dig deeper into their pocketbooks. Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever\u2019s chief financial officer, said during an earnings call on Thursday that \u201cprices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling.\u201dStill, the concerns over the beloved consumer goods led to a political uproar.\u201cWho would have thought that the first casualty of a hard Brexit would be the nation\u2019s supplies of Marmite?\u201d asked Pete Wishart, a member of Parliament for the Scottish National Party, which campaigned to remain in the European Union.On Twitter, Britons wryly noted that store shelves were emptied of Marmite jars, and one used jar was put up for sale on eBay for 100,000 pounds, or about $122,000. News bulletins on the BBC led with the possible Marmite shortage.\u201cThis is a concrete case of Brexit affecting people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Pinar Hosafci, a senior food analyst at Euromonitor International. \u201cTalk of Brexit had been more political, financial and a bit abstract\u201d before, she added. \u201cThis touches their lives.\u201dAmong the affected brands is Colman\u2019s Mustard, which, like Marmite, is produced in Britain.Analysts noted that although Marmite and some of the other affected brands were made in Britain, Unilever published its company results in euros, meaning that those products were still affected by a weaker pound. Imported household goods like Dove soap and Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream are also under the Unilever umbrella.In 2011, Tesco refused to stock Branston Pickle after another supplier, Premier Foods, tried to pass on cost increases.Analysts have predicted that food prices will start to rise across the board in the coming months as supermarkets struggle to absorb the extra cost of imported goods, which are more expensive when a currency weakens.Stores have already stopped promotions and discounts on their products, Ms. Hosafci said. But \u201cprice increases will start happening in the next four to five months, when they will need to renew their stocks.\u201d\u201cEventually, they\u2019ll need to increase prices,\u201d she added. \u201cOtherwise, their businesses will no longer be profitable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is a \u2018Personal Benefit\u2019 From Insider Trading? Justices Hear Arguments", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Supreme Court justices offered hope to both prosecutors and traders on Wednesday during arguments in the first insider trading case to come before the nation\u2019s high court in two decades.A ruling by the court could clarify one of the most hotly debated issues on Wall Street: what prosecutors must prove to secure insider trading convictions based on confidential tips.In their questioning, the justices grappled with where to draw the line. Even as they appeared sympathetic to the government\u2019s interpretation of the high court\u2019s past insider trading decisions, the justices were wary of radically expanding the government\u2019s power and affording prosecutors too much of a free hand in these cases.The case now before the court, Salman v. United States, No. 15-628, comes from California and centers on the insider trading conviction of Bassam Salman in 2013. According to prosecutors, Mr. Salman placed profitable stock trades based on confidential information leaked by his future brother-in-law, Maher Kara, who had advance knowledge of corporate mergers because of his job in Citigroup\u2019s health care investment banking group.For decades, courts have held that it is not inherently illegal to trade stocks based on material, nonpublic information like a merger or acquisition. For an insider to be guilty of sharing inside information, his leak must breach a duty to keep the information confidential and he must receive a personal benefit in exchange for the leak. By extension, the person who receives the information must generally know of that breach and benefit.The Salman case presents a question that has vexed federal appeals courts and left prosecutors and traders alike seeking clarity: What exactly amounts to a \u201cpersonal benefit\u201d?Prosecutors hope the court will afford them leeway in defining the benefit, arguing that if an insider provides a gift of information, that should count as a benefit. In the Salman case, Maher Kara did not receive any financial benefit, but arguably leaked the information as a gift.Mr. Salman\u2019s lawyer, Alexandra Shapiro, argued on Wednesday that the benefit must be more \u201ctangible\u201d \u2014 like cash or something that eventually can be monetized.Several of the justices, citing one of the court\u2019s seminal insider trading decisions from three decades ago, seemed skeptical of her argument and poised to uphold Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction.After all, as Justice Stephen Breyer noted, \u201cto help a close family member is like helping yourself.\u201dYet the court, often skeptical of prosecutors in white-collar crime cases, also questioned the government\u2019s lawyer, Michael Dreeben, about where to draw the line. The justices seemed hesitant to afford prosecutors broad authority to apply the so-called gift test to situations in which the insider and recipient are not family or close friends.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office secured insider trading convictions against dozens of people in the nearly $3 trillion hedge fund industry, has been an outspoken critic of the Second Circuit ruling. Mr. Bharara, who attended Wednesday\u2019s argument, has argued that the Second Circuit\u2019s decision could create \u201ca potential bonanza for friends and family of rich people with material nonpublic information.\u201dThe Supreme Court denied the Justice Department\u2019s request that it review that ruling, though the justices could indirectly rebuke it in deciding Mr. Salman\u2019s case.In Mr. Salman\u2019s case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco took a different approach. The Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction and adopted the view that giving inside information to a family member qualified as a benefit, creating what some legal observers saw as a split that only the Supreme Court could reconcile.That decision directed courts to focus on \u201cwhether the insider receives a direct or indirect personal benefit from the disclosure, such as a pecuniary gain or a reputational benefit that will translate into future earnings.\u201dIn overturning Mr. Newman\u2019s conviction, the Second Circuit seized on that financial element.But when the Ninth Circuit upheld Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction, it focused on another passage in the Dirks decision that allowed liability \u201cwhen an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend.\u201dThat excerpt strikes at the heart of Mr. Salman\u2019s case. Maher Kara passed the inside information, arguably as a gift, to his brother, Michael Kara, who in turn shared it with Mr. Salman. The two families were close; Maher Kara was engaged to Mr. Salman\u2019s sister. (While Maher Kara struck a plea deal and was sentenced to three months of home confinement, Mr. Salman was sentenced to three years in prison.)Some of the justices, appearing skeptical of Mr. Salman\u2019s argument, highlighted the passage within the Dirks ruling that references gifts to family members.\u201cYou\u2019re asking us to cut back significantly from something that we said several decades ago,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan told Ms. Shapiro, adding that \u201cthe integrity of the markets are a very important thing for this country. And you\u2019re asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that threatens that integrity.\u201dBut a decision that just upholds Mr. Salman\u2019s conviction \u2014 and reaffirms the Dirks decision with some clarity \u2014 would disappoint some prosecutors who argue that the current unsettled nature of the law has had a chilling effect on cases. The Justice Department\u2019s ideal ruling would uphold the conviction of Mr. Salman and then take the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling further so that the gift rule would not be limited to just family and close friends.Mr. Dreeben mentioned the case of a barber who could slip through the cracks.He also proposed an even looser standard that would allow charges whenever information is shared for a noncorporate purpose and the insider knows that the recipient will place trades based on the leak.The justices appeared to balk at that extension of prosecutorial power.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me that your argument is much more consistent with Dirks than Ms. Shapiro\u2019s,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito told Mr. Dreeben.Justice Alito then proposed a hypothetical: \u201cNow suppose someone, the insider is walking down the street and sees someone who has a really unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do something to make this person\u2019s day. And so he provides the inside information\u201d and allows the recipient to trade.Mr. Dreeben replied that such a case was indeed a violation. Later in the argument, however, as other justices expressed skepticism about the Justice Department\u2019s position, Mr. Dreeben conceded that \u201cif the court feels more comfortable given the facts of this case of reaffirming Dirks and saying that was the law in 1983, it remains the law today, that is completely fine with the government.\u201dDaniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at Columbia Law School, predicted that because insider trading law was almost entirely judge-made, rather than set by Congress, the Supreme Court might be reluctant to radically revisit its Dirks ruling from three decades ago. It would be simpler to draw distinctions between cases involving family members and business associates.\u201cIf you were going to be a minimalist, this little bit of family relationship could be elaborated on without wholesale redevelopment,\u201d he said.Although Ms. Shapiro made a similar argument, the remaining eight justices seemed to be unswayed. They also seemed skeptical of her argument that Maher Kara turned over the information to Michael Kara for \u201cthe scant benefit of getting his brother off his back.\u201dJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom Ms. Shapiro was once a law clerk, remarked: \u201cHe\u2019s no longer being pestered. Isn\u2019t that a benefit?\u201dBen Protess reported from Washington, and Matthew Goldstein from New York. Peter J. Henning and Adam Liptak contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That figure would be more than what the agency could expect to win at trial if he were found liable, the people briefed on the matter said.Mr. Corzine would also accept a lifetime ban from personally trading other people\u2019s money in the futures industry.A settlement, which has not yet been completed, would avert a trial for Mr. Corzine, a former Democratic senator and New Jersey governor. Had it gone ahead, it was originally scheduled to begin this month.Wells Fargo has heard from disgruntled customers, fired employees and angry lawmakers over the fake accounts scandal.In an interview, Mr. Harber said that on Aug. 24, 2015 he placed orders for about $34.8 million worth of stocks \u201con margin\u201d (which usually requires putting down some money and borrowing the rest from the broker).But given the extreme volatility in the market at the time, Wells Fargo demanded that he pay for the stocks in full, he said.At the end of the day, Mr. Harber said, Wells sold all the shares he had bought that day, resulting in a $5 million loss. He was also charged about $480,000 in broker fees. The bank said in a statement that it was \u201cstrongly defending\u201d against his complaints.Though his case is different from that of the thousands of Wells customers who had illegal bank accounts and unauthorized credit cards issued in their name, it has one crucial similarity.Mr. Harber\u2019s lawsuit is being heard in private arbitration \u2014 Wells forces many of its customers to agree to settle any dispute in arbitration as a condition of doing business with it.The pound is dropping. Fast.A sudden drop like the one it suffered \u2014 down as much as 6 percent at one point \u2014 is often called a flash crash, and is sometimes caused by computer-driven automated trades or a simple misplaced keystroke (a fat-finger error, as it is known on trading floors). In the case of the drop in Asia for the pound, experts said they were hard-pressed to identify a single cause.But over all, they pointed to a general area of unease: Britain\u2019s vote in a referendum in June to leave the European Union, or \u201cBrexit.\u201dThe pound dropped as low as $1.1841 before recovering.Advertisement"}
