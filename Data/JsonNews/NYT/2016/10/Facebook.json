{"Headline": "Whoever Wins the White House, This Year\u2019s Big Loser Is Email", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtInstead, let\u2019s examine a more basic mystery buried in the emails: Why were all these people discussing so much over email in the first place? Haven\u2019t they heard of phone calls? Face-to-face meetings in dimly lit Washington parking garage? Anyplace else where their conversations weren\u2019t constantly being recorded, archived and rendered searchable for decades to come?But everything must meet its maker, and for email, that time is nigh.The sudden exposure of the Clinton campaign email cache is perhaps the ultimate evidence that we\u2019ve all overcommitted to email \u2014 we\u2019ve put too much in it, expected too much from it, and now, finally, we\u2019re seeing the spectacular signs of its impending destruction.Email is simply not up to the rigors of modern political and business life. It lulls us into a sense of unguarded security that it never delivers. It entices us to spill our darkest secrets, and then makes those secrets available to any halfway decent hacker. There are several alternatives that could take its place, without the same pitfalls, and the Clinton cache shows why we would be wise to adopt one of them.Let\u2019s pour one out for email, which has had quite a run. Then let\u2019s move on to something else, and dance on email\u2019s grave.The latest Clinton emails come from the hacked Gmail account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. I emailed the campaign to ask about the breach and email security practices, but I got no response. (Maybe they\u2019ve shied away from email?) The campaign has refused to confirm the authenticity of the messages, which speaks to one of the shortcomings of email: It can easily be forged, so there\u2019s no good way for anyone reading those messages to confirm that they really are the Clinton campaign\u2019s.But if you assume the messages are authentic, you quickly discover even more shortcomings of email. What\u2019s most striking about the Podesta cache is how central email has been to the campaign\u2019s operations. In 2016, presidential campaigns, like all large enterprises, are far-flung operations. Lots of people in lots of different places are trying to plan things together. To the extent there\u2019s any centrality to the organization, it\u2019s in email communication.You can see why this can be handy. Having a single place to discuss everything makes teams more efficient. In the Clinton campaign, email is used as a way to convey news, to set out tactics and strategy, to theorize, to push back, to gossip. It\u2019s used in place of phone calls and face-to-face meetings; it\u2019s used as an instant messenger, a daily calendar and a collaborative whiteboard.By the second day of discussions, the thread was getting long and going nowhere, so Robby Mook, the campaign manager, proposed a quick phone call to hash out the idea. He almost apologized for suggesting a call, which he worried was too grown-up, \u201ctoo processy.\u201dThe phone call apparently happened. But in the Clinton campaign, even a phone call needed to be documented in email. So after the call, another staff member reported on the decision made during the call: to bar any donations from foreign agents.But it didn\u2019t end there. Marc E. Elias, the campaign\u2019s general counsel, then chimed in to say that he hadn\u2019t been on the call but that he opposed the ban on foreign donations, which he said would feel arbitrary.That set off another round of discussions, sparking annoyance among some people on the thread. Finally, Mr. Mook wrote in to say that thanks to Mr. Elias, he had changed his mind, and was now leaning toward taking money from foreign agents. \u201cAre you guys O.K. with that?\u201d he asked.That prompted the kicker from Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s communications director: \u201cTake the money!!\u201d she wrote from her iPhone.In the days following WikiLeaks\u2019 publication, this thread became a campaign issue. Donald J. Trump even drew attention to Ms. Palmieri\u2019s line at a rally this week.But it didn\u2019t have to be so. If they had been using some other system to communicate, they would most likely have avoided this trouble.A more modern communication system, something like Slack or HipChat, could still be hacked, but would have allowed for a central administrator to set an archiving policy. After a few days or weeks, this sort of conversation would have been erased. That\u2019s less practical for email, which by its very nature is decentralized. Once you send an email, your thread resides on every device that every recipient ever downloaded it on.But there\u2019s something even more pernicious than weak security here. The deeper problem with email is that it has never quite settled on a social mode. An email can be as formal as a legal letter or as tossed off as drive-by insult. This invites confusion. For instance, in context, Ms. Palmieri\u2019s \u201cTake the money!!\u201d doesn\u2019t sound so bad \u2014 it looks like a quick, half-cheeky way to end an overlong discussion. If it were said on a phone call or an instant message, \u201cTake the money\u201d would have sounded like an entirely normal way to end the conversation.But email comes with no expectations. Because everything else in the thread sounds serious, Ms. Palmieri\u2019s ending line can easily be colored as more sinister.In other words, limits often help. Get on the phone, make a decision, ditch your inbox. The world will be better off for it.Advertisement"}

What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes.com.When it comes to planning and navigating your trip, guidebooks have started to give way to social media. For searching and crowdsourcing tips, it\u2019s tough to beat the old-guard apps, led by Twitter, Facebook and Instagram \u2014 all established networks that are easy to use and have a broad reach.Don\u2019t discount travel-focused accounts on Snapchat or niche-focused social apps, though. No matter your preferred network, here are five ways to use social media to get the most out of your next trip.1. Go online for advance scoutingAmong the networks that use geo-targeting, Instagram is particularly suited to checking out locations, in real-time, with a simple search or by clicking on hashtags.Pinterest, another photo-driven app, is great for those seeking inspiration about where to go and what to see.2. Move past the friend zoneAsking your Facebook friends for travel suggestions can lead to some useful information, but if you don\u2019t mind talking to strangers, you may find a wider array of options.Of course, not all of us have Mr. Andrews\u2019s reach on Twitter (182,000 followers at the moment). For us mere mortals, hashtags can again come to the rescue: Seek out users that specialize in the places you are researching, using search and hashtags.\u201cI\u2019ll usually get a few great recommendations either from locals that are excited to highlight something they love about their city or a traveler that had a great experience and wants to share it,\u201d Ms. Lucas said.And if you are willing to expand your Facebook circle, that can come in handy, too, especially if you ask friends who might have connections overseas.\u201cThere may not be anyone within our Facebook circles traveling to Madrid on our given dates, but one of our friends tags their friends, their friends share the post with theirs, and the world becomes a lot smaller quite quickly,\u201d Ms. Jerrard said.3. Trust the localsNeed dinner plans? If you\u2019re willing to take some risks in the form of advice from strangers, you could end up with a memorable experience. Just make sure to be specific in your requests.4. Service with an emoji \u201cSomeone from the KLM Twitter team rebooked a flight for me that was delayed while I was still onboard the plane,\u201d Mr. Andrews said. Not all stories will have endings that happy, of course, but it can\u2019t hurt to try.5.

{"Headline": "What Do Trump and Marx Have in Common?", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byHAMBURG, Germany \u2014 We have a word in German, \u201cWutb\u00fcrger,\u201d which means \u201cangry citizen\u201d \u2014 though like many German compound words, its meaning can never quite be captured in a pithy English translation. And yet nothing in either language quite frames this current political moment.It is a relatively new expression, with a derogatory connotation. A Wutb\u00fcrger rages against a new train station and tilts against wind turbines. Wutb\u00fcrgers came out in protest after the Berlin government decided to bail out Greece and to accept roughly one million refugees and migrants into Germany.Wutb\u00fcrgers lie at both ends of the political spectrum; they flock to the right-wing Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (A.F.D.) and the socialist Linke (Left) Party. The left wing has long had a place in German politics, and the Linke has deep roots in the former East Germany\u2019s ruling party. And we\u2019ve had a fringe right wing since the postwar period began. But the populist anger of the A.F.D. is something new: Anti-establishment, anti-European Union and anti-globalization, the A.F.D. didn\u2019t exist four years ago. Today, 18 percent of Germans would consider voting for it.The same thing is happening elsewhere in Europe: Many British Wutb\u00fcrgers voted for Brexit. French Wutb\u00fcrgers will vote for Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Front. Perhaps the most powerful Wutb\u00fcrger of them all is Donald J. Trump.Which raises the question: How was anger hijacked?In its pure form, anger is a wonderful force of change. Just imagine a world without anger. In Germany, without the anger of the labor movement, we would still have a class-based voting system that privileged the wealthy, and workers would still toil 16 hours a day without pension rights. Britain and France would still be ruled by absolute monarchs. The Iron Curtain would still divide Europe, the United States would still be a British colony and its slaves could only dream of casting a vote this Nov. 8.Karl Marx was a Wutb\u00fcrger. So were Montesquieu, William Wilberforce, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the tens of thousands of Eastern German protesters who brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989.Now: Compare these spirits to the current parties claiming to stand for necessary change. Mr. Trump vs. Dr. King. Sadly, the leaders of today\u2019s Wutb\u00fcrger movements never grasped the difference between anger driven by righteousness and anger driven by hate.Anger works like gasoline. If you use it intelligently and in a controlled manner, you can move the world. That\u2019s called progress. Or you just spill it about and ignite it, creating spectacular explosions. That\u2019s called arson.Unfortunately, a lack of maturity and prudence today exists among not just the new populist class, but parts of the political establishment. The governing class needs to understand that just because people are embittered and paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have a case. A growing number of voters are going into meltdown because they believe that politicians \u2014 and journalists \u2014 don\u2019t see what they see.Sure, the injustices they see are, in historical perspective, less stark and obvious than in the days of Marx or King. The injustices of today are smaller, but they are more complex. And this is what makes them all the more terrifying.If John Steinbeck could travel the West today as he traveled America three generations ago, leaving the highways to visit forgotten towns, documenting people\u2019s struggles as he did in \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u2019\u2019 he would find much the same to write about. Globalization and its masters have capitalized on enormous pay gaps between West and East, at a huge profit for them, and huge cost to others.The upper class has gained much more from the internationalization of trade and finances than the working class has, often in obscene ways. Bankers get bonuses despite making idiotic decisions that trigger staggering losses. Giant enterprises like Facebook or Apple pay minimal taxes, while blue-collar workers have to labor harder \u2014 even taking a second or third job \u2014 to maintain their standard of living. And this is as true in Germany, France or Austria as it is in Ohio or Florida.In Germany, some 60 percent of A.F.D. supporters say globalization has \u201cmainly negative\u201d effects. We live in a world, the liberal British historian Timothy Garton Ash noted lately, \u201cwhich would have Marx rubbing his hands with Schadenfreude.\u201dThe grievances of white, often less-educated voters on both sides of the Atlantic are often dismissed as xenophobic, simplistic hillbillyism. But doing so comes at a cost. Europe\u2019s traditional force of social change, its social democrats, appear to just not get it. When Hillary Clinton calls half of Mr. Trump\u2019s voters a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d she sounds as aloof as Marie Antoinette, telling French subjects who had no bread to \u201ceat cake.\u201d In Germany, a deputy Social Democrat leader, Ralf Stegner, displays a similar arrogance when he calls A.F.D. supporters \u201cracists\u201d and \u201cskunks.\u201d Media reports often convey the same degree of contempt.In Germany a recent poll showed that only 14 percent of the citizens trusted the politicians. This is an alarming figure, in a country where faith in a progressive, democratic government has been a cornerstone of our postwar peace. But this presumes that legitimate anger will be acknowledged as such. If this faith is rattled, democracy loses its basic promise.Amid their mutual finger-pointing, neither populist nor established parties acknowledge that both are squandering people\u2019s anger, either by turning this anger into counterproductive hatred or by denouncing and dismissing it. Mrs. Clinton has the chance to change, by leading a political establishment that examines and processes anger instead of merely producing and dismissing it. If she does, let\u2019s hope Europe once again looks to America as a model for democracy.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matthew Segal Wants Your Attn:", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Segal, who is 31 and looks like a cross between a young John F. Kennedy Jr. and John Kerry, seemed uninterested in the news. That\u2019s not to say he doesn\u2019t care about politics. Mr. Segal testified to Congress about voting rights as a 19-year-old and founded two voter-empowerment organizations before starting Attn: (pronounced \u201cattention\u201d) in 2014.But if those experiences taught him anything, it\u2019s that young people \u201ccare less about candidates than they do about issues,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s going insanely viral,\u201d Mr. Segal said a few hours after the video went live. He was at dinner with his co-founder, Jarrett Moreno, who helped raise nearly $25 million in funding from big-name investors like Bill Maher and Ryan Seacrest.By the time dinner ended, the video had spiked to 21 million views, from 15 million. \u201cFeel free to write down that this happens every day,\u201d Mr. Segal said jokingly.\u201cPerfect!\u201d Mr. Segal said, interrupting in a way he often does when he gets excited about an idea. He combines intellectual curiosity with a short attention span, which means he rarely lets people finish their thoughts but often has a compelling reason for butting in.To get people to share the abortion video, Mr. Segal urged the staff member to open with a focus on advocacy. \u201cThat way people are applauding women speaking out,\u201d he said.A few minutes later, an earnest 20-something pitched an idea about the disappearing bumblebee. \u201cBees aren\u2019t kittens \u2014 they don\u2019t engender a lot of sympathy,\u201d Mr. Segal interjected. \u201cWhy should I care?\u201d\u201cBecause bees pollinate a third of U.S. crops,\u201d the staff member said. \u201cBlueberries, cranberries, tomatoes.\u201dThis led to a brief discussion about the cause of the bee carnage, which was apparently due in part to a pesticide (neonicotinoid) that no one in the room could pronounce. \u201cI would open with, \u2018You\u2019re literally going to run out of blueberries, cranberries and tomatoes,\u2019\u201d Mr. Segal concluded. \u201cScare people. Then you can talk about \u2026 bees.\u201d\u201cIf you want the dog to eat the pill,\u201d Mr. Maher added, \u201cyou have to wrap it in a piece of bologna.\u201dMr. Segal probably wouldn\u2019t put it that way, but he relishes the challenge of taking seemingly wonky issues and making them \u201cshareable\u201d (a word he uses practically every few seconds). He\u2019s especially proud of Attn:\u2019s video about the less-than-thrilling topic of gerrymandering.\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that eventually goes on the Attn: tombstone,\u201d Mr. Segal said, \u201cit should probably be, \u2018Makers of the Most Viral Video Ever About Gerrymandering.\u2019\u201d\u201cI wish it were as simple as people wanting to hear John Kerry talk about how messed up our oceans are, but you have to work a little harder if you want people to care,\u201d he said.\u201cPolitics are confusing,\u201d he continued. \u201cFewer and fewer states are teaching anything about civics. But when you turn on cable news, there\u2019s very little discussion about issues, or why they matter.\u201dAs a freshman at Kenyon College in Ohio, Mr. Segal didn\u2019t know much about issues either. Nor did he understand the difference \u201cbetween a state senator or a U.S. senator,\u201d he said. Still, he was excited to vote in his first presidential election. Mr. Segal cast his ballot early that morning in 2004, but he watched friends stand in line all day; some were still waiting to vote when the networks called the election for George W. Bush.\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, every vote apparently doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019\u201d Mr. Segal said. \u201cAnd we were lucky, because we could skip class and our professors would cheer us on. But what about the single mother working two jobs? It really pissed me off.\u201dMr. Segal spoke out publicly, and before he knew it, he was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, which was investigating voting irregularities. \u201cIt seems almost hypocritical that a society so focused on the importance of the vote did not concern itself more heavily with the actual process of voting,\u201d he told Congress.Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois, met Mr. Segal soon after and remembers being impressed by his dedication and moxie. That was echoed by Mr. Seacrest, who said he invested in Attn: partly because he found Mr. Segal \u201cso engaging, intense and ferocious.\u201dDespite concerns that millennials won\u2019t vote in this election, Mr. Segal said he expects them to turn out. \u201cThat\u2019s my hot take,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about voting against Trump or electing Hillary. People are getting fed up with police brutality, the war on drugs, the minimum wage, three-strikes laws, the transgender bathroom controversy.\u201d\u201cA lot of employers won\u2019t hire people with visible tattoos,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not as serious or seemingly existential as a video about how our oceans are going to kill us, but it\u2019s still a serious economic issue with generational implications.\u201dThe more one talks to Mr. Segal, the more convincing he is as the ideal personality for an issue-driven media company aimed at young Americans. He clearly cares about a lot of things, but he also \u201cgets bored really easily,\u201d he confessed.Might his short attention span be similar to Mr. Trump\u2019s?

{"Headline": "Writer, Writer, Pants on Fire", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byAuthor\u2019s NoteWhen I was a kid, I didn\u2019t know about such nuances. I told flat-out lies, and I told them with some frequency, as I was reminded a few years ago when a beloved babysitter from my childhood got in touch with me on Facebook. She\u2019d found a letter I sent her when I was in second grade, after she\u2019d moved away. She scanned and emailed it to me.\u201cI just had my accident,\u201d I write, about midway through my epistolary effort, in rainbow-colored pencil. \u201cI stepped on a shovel and the handle popped up in my face like in cartoons.\u201d A P.S. follows: \u201cI got my ears pearsed.\u201dThe part about the ear piercing is true. But the shovel? Bunk. In fact, I had been playing \u201cOlympics\u201d in our yard, a game which involved throwing a shovel \u2014 my \u201cjavelin\u201d \u2014 as far as I could, then running after it while shouting, \u201cAnd Anna Solomon-Greenbaum wins the gold!\u201d The shovel was taller than I was, and eventually, on one of my cyclonesque lead-up spins, I let the handle go prematurely and got whacked in the face by the metal blade. Even before I made it into the house to inspect my quickly blackening eye, I was coming up with the Three Stooges-inspired scenario.It was a good story.But I knew I was lying. And I seemed to be getting better at it. The year before, my jealousy at my classmates\u2019 vacations had driven me to tell them about a trip my family had (not) taken to Maine. I must have gone on too long, because at pickup time, my teacher leaned into our car and chirped to my mother, \u201cWe heard all about your wonderful trip to Maine!\u201dIn the back, sitting on a jump seat I was barely heavy enough to weigh down, I started to weep. I wept because I\u2019d lied, of course, and been found out. But I wept, too, because I could hear in my teacher\u2019s overbright tone that she\u2019d known it to be a lie from the start. I wept because I had failed, as a storyteller, to convince.Did you notice that the jump seat and the word \u201ccar\u201d don\u2019t quite match up? That\u2019s because in fact my family drove a Toyota Land Cruiser, one of the 1980s models that had little if any interior padding. I thought to name the accurate make, but then it seemed too clunky, and beside the point. I fudged a little: car. But then I kept in \u201cjump seat,\u201d because the feeling of being so small on one of those flip-up seats seemed critical to capturing the emotional truth of that particular moment.So now I have a problem. And now you know: I\u2019ve still got the instincts of a liar.The difference, I like to think, is that I\u2019m in control of those instincts now. I\u2019ve become a novelist, which is to say I make up people and worlds and describe them in such detail that my bunk and fudges become believable. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ve failed, much as I failed in first grade. Last year, revising my second novel about two women in 1920s New England \u2014 one who abandoned her baby 10 years earlier, the other who has been raising the girl since \u2014 I came up against a plot problem. I needed one of their husbands to disappear on a fishing trip for 10 weeks so a certain adulterous affair could take place, but I had found out that fishing boats would never have stayed out for that long. I went to talk with a fishing historian in my hometown, Gloucester, Mass., to see if he could help me. At first, he pessimistically confirmed; it simply didn\u2019t take 10 weeks to fill a boat with cod. O.K., I said, trying not to lose hope. I told him more about the character. I asked him to imagine: Could there be a scenario in which this man might be gone for an unusually long time? The historian looked at me skeptically. He was quiet for a while. Then he began: \u201cWhat if. .\u2008.\u2008.\u201d He went on to tell me about night fishermen, and their dealings with rumrunners. He explicated common modes of bribery. He offered up one fact, then another, until his facts and my fiction collided and we arrived, giddy as conspirators, at a solution.If I\u2019m generous toward my child-self, I like to think I was lying in order to figure all this out. To become a writer. It\u2019s striking, for instance, that my more elaborate tale of Maine failed, while my simpler, one-sentence lie about the slapstick accident succeeded. Perhaps it was an early lesson in how less can sometimes be more? In any case: Today, I\u2019m coming clean. I\u2019m sorry, babysitter. In fact I got a black eye because I was playing a reckless game that was, fundamentally, about bolstering my own ego.Which also sounds a little like writing, come to think of it. But that\u2019s another story.Anna Solomon is the author of \u201cLeaving Lucy Pear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peter Thiel Defends His Most Contrarian Move Yet: Supporting Trump", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Peter Thiel likes to take the path not taken. He has paid students to drop out of college, thinks Silicon Valley is overrated, backed a plan to build cities on the high seas and helped propel an electronic form of money into general use. His contrarian approach to investing and to life has made him rich and celebrated.It took something truly conventional \u2014 donating money to a presidential candidate \u2014 to incite demands for his banishment.\u201cI was surprised by the intensity,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cThis is one of the few times I was involved in something that was not a fringe effort but was mainstream. Millions of people are backing Trump. I did not appreciate quite how polarizing the election would be in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.\u201dIn an interview on Friday, he outlined his thinking. \u201cIdeally, this will have the give-and-take of debate,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, I\u2019ll get some very tough questions about Trump. But I thought the best way to advance the discussion was not to have some completely contrived format. The future of this country depends on us engaging with the tough questions.\u201dOne of the things he will try to do is underline his support for Trump the candidate while distancing himself from the behavior of Trump the man. He believes it is possible to separate the two.\u201cThe millions of people who vote for Trump are not doing it because of the worst things he said or did,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. The Americans who are voting for Trump are doing it because they judge the situation of the country to be urgent. We\u2019re at such a crucial point that you have to overlook personal characteristics.\u201dMr. Thiel has been an important player in Silicon Valley since the first dot-com boom, but he has recently taken on a much more public role. He was born in Germany and came to the United States as an infant when his father, a chemical engineer, found work here. He was raised in Silicon Valley and went to Stanford, where he developed the views in his first book, \u201cThe Diversity Myth,\u201d about the multiculturalism debate on campuses, written with the entrepreneur David O. Sacks.In 1998, Mr. Thiel helped found the online payments company PayPal, an immediate success. He was the first outside investor in Facebook. Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.7 billion. Last year, he became a part-time partner at Y Combinator, a loosely defined advisory position.A handful of others in Silicon Valley have similar investing track records. Where Mr. Thiel really separates himself from his peers is his skepticism that Silicon Valley is building a better world for all. His investment firm, Founders Fund, used to begin its online manifesto with the complaint, \u201cWe wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters,\u201d a reference to Twitter. Now it says simply, \u201cWhat happened to the future?\u201dSan Francisco, Manhattan and Washington, D.C., are doing well, but the presidential campaign has laid bare the angst of many other places. Feelings of decline are rampant. \u201cMost of the millennials have lower expectations than their baby boomer parents,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cWhere I differ from others in Silicon Valley is in thinking that you can\u2019t fence yourself off. If it continues, it will ultimately be bad for everybody.\u201dThe polls have been saying Mrs. Clinton is likely to win. If that happens, \u201cthere will be a very big need to push back on the sort of happy but misleading consensus about things,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cThere will be an important role for me and others to somehow play in speaking truth to power.\u201dTo an extent, that is. \u201cIt would be a mistake and inappropriate to instantly demonize Hillary and to try and sabotage her presidency,\u201d he said. That would be repeating what happened in 2008, when the Republican Party did exactly that to President Obama.She said she turned down an investment of $500,000 \u2014 a huge sum for a small firm like Backstage \u2014 because of the investor\u2019s ties to Mr. Thiel. Ms. Hamilton did not identify the investor or respond to an email.Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, defended the company\u2019s association with Mr. Thiel, emphasizing that it did not endorse his views \u2014 and much less Mr. Trump\u2019s \u2014 but was striving to be inclusive toward those whose values differed from its own. Critics noted that if diversity was such a cherished value in Silicon Valley, why wasn\u2019t there more of it?Mr. Thiel said he agreed that there was a point where views became unacceptable, but argued that he was on the right side of the line.\u201cThe line cannot or should not be at a point where you\u2019re excommunicating half the country,\u201d he said. \u201cSome fringe views I hope we can tolerate. Some fringe views are beyond the pale.\u201d He said no one at Facebook or Y Combinator had asked him to censor himself, and he did not consider stepping down from either post.The donation to the Trump campaign proved much more contentious in Silicon Valley than the revelation in May that Mr. Thiel had secretly funded a lawsuit to kill Gawker, which revealed in 2007 that he was gay. Many in Silicon Valley were sympathetic to Mr. Thiel\u2019s actions.When Gawker.com was shut down in August, Mr. Thiel said he had one final thought: \u201cGood riddance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If you are a man and believe in red-blooded American things, then you vote for Trump. It seems like there is a real firm dividing line between one and the other.\u201dAnother white male Clinton supporter, Piet Jones, 51, said, \u201cIt can get lonely sometimes.\u201dMr. Jones, a food writer and stay-at-home father in Richmond, Va., who supported Mrs. Clinton during her 2008 primary campaign, said his support of Barack Obama during the 2008 and 2012 general elections was not nearly so problematic.\u201cIt was easier to be an Obama supporter than a Hillary supporter,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cI used to work in banking, and when a man was a vice president of a large group, he\u2019d be called tough. The women who\u2019d act in the same ways would be referred to as shrill or a bitch. Men in that position are viewed as strong, powerful. Women who are strong are seen as usurpers. Hopefully, as a country, we can change. And maybe if Hillary has two good terms, I think it would go a long way to change that.\u201dBill Woods, a friend of Mr. Jones who lives outside Salem, Ore., is skeptical that sexism has a role in the lack of enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton among white men. Mr. Woods, 51, who now lives off disability payments, was a Bernie Sanders supporter during primary season.\u201cThere\u2019s trepidation on my part,\u201d said Mr. Woods, who does not have a college degree. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so dumb as to want Trump in the White House to prove my point.\u201cWhen you see a lot of progressives accused of being sexist with their vote and not liking the idea of a woman president, I think you\u2019re missing the point that a lot of these men would have voted for Elizabeth Warren, if she had thrown her hat into the ring. If it was Elizabeth Warren, we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201dRich Norton, 36, who owns a small property management firm with his wife, Nissa, in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., has a background in line with many Trump supporters. The youngest of five brothers and sisters, he couldn\u2019t afford to go to college. He has worked many jobs throughout his life: managing movie theaters, delivering furniture and appliances.\u201cI just think it\u2019s the people who didn\u2019t go to college and didn\u2019t experience a few things just get so jaded because they think nothing\u2019s going to change for them,\u201d Mr. Norton said of himself and his family members, who tend to vote Republican. \u201cWe\u2019re all working-class stiffs, chasing paycheck to paycheck, and the process has worn them down.\u201dAfter saying that he \u201cwasted\u201d his first presidential vote by supporting Ralph Nader in 2000, he has voted Democratic since, supporting Barack Obama enthusiastically in 2008 and 2012. While demographics would suggest that he would be a likely supporter of the anti-establishment message of either Bernie Sanders or Mr. Trump, Mr. Norton said he liked the fact that Mrs. Clinton was a \u201ccareer politician.\u201d\u201cIn my mind that\u2019s a positive,\u201d Mr. Norton said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t quit when she lost the nomination the last time. She just went to work.\u201dMr. Norton\u2019s stance has not gone over well with some of his family members.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten into it with my brothers over it,\u201d he said, noting that they support Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of anger from the other side, because they don\u2019t know the facts to back up their argument. I get frustrated, but it\u2019s been years of this.\u201dThe caustic, offensive comments made by Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters at his often-rowdy rallies have done little to counter the notion that those who do not care for Mrs. Clinton are hung up on her gender.\u201cI think being a Clinton raises a lot of baggage in this election,\u201d Dr. Deckman said. \u201cA lot of people think that she and her husband play by their own rules. And she\u2019s not a good campaigner. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s merely because she\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s not Barack Obama, and that translates on the stage.\u201dIn the 1990s, Wade Overstreet, 42, would have recoiled at the prospect of Mrs. Clinton taking the oath of office. He was raised Republican in Jackson, Miss. Two decades ago, he believed in the promise of the Newt Gingrich revolution. Later, he voted for George W. Bush. Twice.He traveled widely, and lived away from his home state for a number of years before moving back. In 2008 he voted Democratic for the first time in his life. Now, in one of the reddest states, he finds himself an outlier, part of one of the least likely demographics to support the Democratic nominee.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t register that a Southern white male would vote for Hillary,\u201d Mr. Overstreet said. \u201cAnd I think it speaks to the idea that she is not tough enough. But I think she is the tougher of the two candidates.\u201dFaith plays a role in his view of Mrs. Clinton, he said. Having grown up Southern Baptist, Mr. Overstreet remains a regular churchgoer, and he is put off by what he sees as the embrace of Mr. Trump by the evangelical right.\u201cShe identifies herself as a Methodist, and I think it\u2019s admirable that she does not blow a trumpet about her Christianity,\u201d Mr. Overstreet said. \u201cI\u2019ll say this: Jesus instructed in the Bible that we not bring attention to ourselves when we pray, but instead we actually feed the hungry and help the poor and medicate the sick, and so Hillary\u2019s vision for America is much more in line with my faith.\u201dSuch sentiments have not gone over well with a majority of the people he knows, he said, most of whom back Mr. Trump. He has gotten negative reactions on Facebook for his posts in support of Mrs. Clinton, which he writes not because he believes he can change minds, but because he views the 2016 election as historic and he feels the need to be upfront with his opinions.\u201cI\u2019ve caught flak for it, and I\u2019ve been surprised by the vitriol,\u201d Mr. Overstreet said. \u201cWhen they try to make an argument, it\u2019s enough for people to just say, \u2018Benghazi,\u2019 and that\u2019s the end of it. It\u2019s so visceral. It\u2019s not based on fact.\u201dA man with a background much different from that of Mr. Overstreet is Steve Manning, a 51-year-old marketing and public relations consultant who has served as the public relations director for Sub Pop Records, working with bands like Mudhoney, Sleater-Kinney, the Shins and Band of Horses. Although he travels in liberal circles, he has faced criticism for being a strong \u201cI\u2019m With Her\u201d guy.The people he knows have a habit of casting Mrs. Clinton as the \u201clesser of two evils,\u201d and Mr. Manning, who lives in Seattle, does not like that line. Not one bit.\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because even my wife sometimes will say things like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d Mr. Manning said. \u201cAnd I say, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 Everyone says it\u2019s the best of bad choices. But she\u2019s the best choice of anyone. I believe that this notion that people have when they say, \u2018She\u2019s better than Trump,\u2019 is a joke.\u201dMany conversations he has had during the 2016 campaign have tested his patience.Mr. Methe, the Cincinnati artist, has also found himself in heated conversations lately, even among friends. He said he bristles at those who say that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ambition is a negative. After all, he said, shouldn\u2019t you want a president who actually wants to be president?\u201cYou can make arguments about what her motivations are,\u201d Mr. Methe said. \u201cBut this is a goal of hers, and she is not going to let other people deter her, and I think that motivation and that work ethic is highly motivating and highly desirable. Being a father of a preteen daughter, that is what I want her to see.\u201d\u201cI want her to see a woman who is not going to get pushed around by a bunch of guys or is not going to take people bad-mouthing her and just take it lying down,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf she gets knocked down, she is going to get back up and keep on fighting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The commission hoped that a larger structure might withstand the periodic acts of vandalism against sites that honor the boy\u2019s life.\u201cHow do we replace it in a way where this doesn\u2019t happen?\u201d Mr. Weems said of the sign. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot less likely for someone to go out of their way to vandalize a gazebo.\u201dMr. Weems said the group has raised the idea of asking the National Park Service to designate the land a historic site, where any case of vandalism would prompt a federal investigation.Vandals have hit several Till memorials in the area over the past decade, according to Dave Tell, an associate professor at the University of Kansas, who is working on a book about the effort to commemorate the teenager\u2019s death.\u201cFor 49 years and 11 months there was not a single marker in the entire state of Mississippi to the memory of Emmett Till\u201d after Till was murdered, Professor Tell said in an interview on Monday. That changed in 2005, when two memorial signs were placed along a 30-mile stretch of highway.Professor Tell said the signs were vandalized within months with black spray paint, and the letters \u201cKKK\u201d were scrawled on them.Three years later, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission installed eight signs about the murder, including the one on the riverbank. Two were stolen, including one in Sumner, Miss., where the trial was held. The sign sat on land owned by the son of John W. Whitten Jr., one of several lawyers who defended Mr. Bryant and Mr. Milam.\u201cThe local community is very suspicious that the sign was removed from the property,\u201d Mr. Tell said.Mr. Weems said the commission was looking at options to replace that sign.The vandalism has divided residents in a part of the country where \u201cit doesn\u2019t take too much scratching beneath the surface to see that race is still an issue,\u201d Mr. Weems said.\u201cI think there was some people who said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s another sign that got shot; this happens all the time,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cAnd others said, \u2018No, this is absolutely what it looks like: This is a racist act and we need to stand together.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

A lot of times the robots would rebel. In the \u00e2\u0080\u009cStar Trek\u00e2\u0080\u009d movie #1 this robot explorer comes back and tries to destroy the world. It was a little bit of an ambiguous relationship to computers.Beyond privacy concerns, are there other problems that a really good digital assistant would pose? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hacking problem, if somebody gets unauthorized access to it. We have the Internet of Things appearing now, and a lot of the things are not very secure. People are saying, put a piece of tape over your camera on your computer or someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to spy on you. Things like that are already present dangers.There are the chess-playing computers which don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work like the human mind but they can still beat a chess player, so it may be that the mind problem will not be solved in same way that biology did it with humans. It may be that other sorts of programming devices will work in a different way, and have different powers than we have.Everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always worried that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll construct something superior to us that acquires its own motives. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the ways we are sort of safe now: We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come up with a way to give a computer motives that are somehow its self-interest. But some technologists are working on computers that can spontaneously put together programs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to say how much success\u00c2\u00a0that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to have, but it might be more successful than we anticipate.Should we worry about creating an artificial intelligence that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more powerful than we are?It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not out of the bounds of possibility that we would create something that could overpower us, but I think at this point the route to get there is pretty obscure. We barely can get computers to do valuable things now.However, if you go into a big factory and you see a lot of robots moving around, it can be fearsome. You can think, what if they went into business for themselves?And the Pentagon is working on weapons systems that have an automated feature. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an aircraft that comes within range of a battleship, some of these systems are prepared to take action themselves.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 Finds Terror, and Soul, in the Machine", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byThis prescient and mordantly funny science-fiction anthology is smart enough to be just barely ahead of its time. It doesn\u2019t imagine interstellar civilizations or postapocalyptic scenarios. Instead, it depicts variations on a near future transformed by information technology \u2014 our world, just a little worse.In one episode from an earlier season, characters carry an implant that records their every experience \u2014 a kind of cranial Google Glass that ends up torturing a man who learns his wife has cheated on him. Another imagines a society in which citizens can block people who displease them, rendering them as mute blobs of static \u2014 a whole-body version of Facebook unfriending.In still another, a foul-mouthed cartoon TV star runs a political campaign that begins as a lark and spirals out of control \u2014 abetted by a jaded public and cynical media \u2014 into vicious demagogy. (No further comment.)Pace yourself, though: This is very much the same disorienting, relentless series, touching on techno-cultural themes \u2014 hacking, social-media mobs, drones, the narcotic allure of nostalgia \u2014 in stories that are both dreamily speculative and of-the-moment.As before, there\u2019s no theme music, no narrator to escort you into its clean dystopias. (Each episode imagines a different alternative reality, but they share a minimalist high-design aesthetic \u2014 what your nightmares would look like if they were art-directed by Apple\u2019s Jonathan Ive.) \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d buzzes onto your screen like a malware attack, dropping you in media res and leaving you, blinking, to figure out the rules. You don\u2019t watch an episode so much as get abducted into it.But the bigger canvas and larger episode order give Mr. Brooker more room to play with genre and tone. The feature-length crime procedural episode \u201cHated in the Nation,\u201d in which a London detective (Kelly Macdonald, \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d) investigates a deadly online-outrage campaign, uncomfortably compares crowd-sourced justice with state surveillance. (\u201cHated\u201d is the season finale, though you can watch the self-contained episodes in any order.)\u201cNosedive\u201d \u2014 by Rashida Jones and Michael Schur from a story by Mr. Brooker \u2014 is a tart satire set in a society where social-media ratings hold totalitarian sway. It stars Bryce Dallas Howard, whose neurotic monitoring of her personal ranking will ring familiar to anyone who can\u2019t stop checking their Instagram feed for hearts. \u201cPlaytest,\u201d about an immersive augmented-reality game, feels like a digital-culture version of an \u201cX-Files\u201d horror lark.The best of the new batch, \u201cSan Junipero,\u201d is also the biggest departure. First, because it deposits its lead characters, played by Mackenzie Davis and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, in the past, 1987 to be precise. (I\u2019ll say no more, except that, per usual, the story takes more than one unexpected turn.) Second, because it\u2019s bittersweet and moving \u2014 even hopeful \u2014 rather than horrific.When the season goes dark, however, it goes very dark, as in \u201cMen Against Fire,\u201d a Rod Serling-esque parable about war and dehumanization, and \u201cShut Up and Dance,\u201d about a man who falls prey to online blackmail.That latter, while suitably ghastly, touches on themes of cruelty and vigilantism that earlier episodes, like \u201cWhite Bear,\u201d have treated better. More episodes, it seems, means a little more chaff. Typical of the Netflix large-portions ethos, a few new episodes are too long, and feel diluted compared with the lapidary early seasons.Still, \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d hasn\u2019t lost its currency. Its title refers to the glass screens of computers, tablets and phones, but the machines are not the danger here: it\u2019s the anonymous, antiseptic monstrousness they can empower. The brilliance of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d is that it\u2019s not about how technology imperils our humanity. It\u2019s about the all-too-human faces reflected in our own black mirrors, staring back at us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Children Don\u2019t Always Live", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byOpinionMy daughter, Greta, was 2 years old when she died \u2014 or rather, when she was killed. A piece of masonry fell eight stories from an improperly maintained building and struck her in the head while she sat on a bench on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with her grandmother. No single agent set it on its path: It wasn\u2019t knocked off scaffolding by the poorly placed heel of a construction worker, or fumbled from careless hands. Negligence, coupled with a series of bureaucratic failures, led it to simply sigh loose, a piece of impersonal calamity sent to rearrange the structure and meaning of our universe.She was rushed to the hospital, where she underwent emergency brain surgery, but she never regained consciousness. She was declared brain-dead, and my wife and I donated her organs. She was our only child.The incident was freakish enough to be newsworthy. Requests for interviews flooded our email while we still were at our daughter\u2019s bedside; television trucks trawled Manhattan looking for us. When we left the hospital, I caught my daughter waving at me from the corner of my eye. A picture of her from my wife\u2019s Facebook page was on the cover of The Daily News.Seven weeks ago, our second child was born; a son, Greta\u2019s younger brother. They would have been exactly three and a half years apart. With his birth, I have become a father to a living child and a spirit \u2014 one child on this side of the curtain, and another whispering from beneath it. The confusion is constant, and in my moments of strength I succumb to it. I had a child die, and I chose to become a father again. There can be no greater definition of stupidity or bravery; insanity or clarity; hubris or grace.Becoming a parent is already a terrifying process. After a child\u2019s violent death, the calculations are murkier. What does my trauma mean for this happy, uncomplicated being in my care? Will it affect the choices I make on his behalf? Am I going to give a smaller, more fearful world to him than I gave to Greta? Is he doomed to live under the shadow of what happened to his sister?After Greta was born, my wife, Stacy, and I had a habit of checking to make sure she was still breathing. During that time, we ran into a fellow parent, a mother of two children, and Stacy made a nervous joke about it. The woman smiled. \u201cThey\u2019re always breathing,\u201d she said.At 2, your child is a person \u2014 she has opinions and fixed beliefs, preferences and tendencies, a group of friends and favorite foods.What happens when that child is swiftly killed by a runaway piece of everyday environment, at the exact moment you had given up thinking that something could take all of this away from you?When I realized Greta would not live, I wanted to die so purely, and so simply. I could feel my heart gazing up at me quizzically, asking me in between beats: \u201cAre you sure you want me to keep doing this?\u201d But I found I could not give the order.Since my son was born, I\u2019ve caught myself making concrete plans for my suicide if he were to die. I will draft a letter to my parents, or even tell them face-to-face. \u201cI\u2019m going to meet my children,\u201d I will say. If the world takes this one, I am not meant to be here. It is a frightening thought because it is so logical. How would anyone argue me out of it? Who would even try?I do not believe anything bad will happen to him in his infancy. It makes a sort of sense: Nothing bad happened to Greta as an infant. I do not wake up in the middle of the night to check on him. I do not even flinch when I hand him to others and watch them grapple awkwardly with his floppy neck.However, some part of me is grimly certain he will die at 2. The evidence is all on my side: 100 percent of my children have suffered this fate. Even as I carry my baby into the world \u2014 this crowded, clamorous, septic world \u2014 I am holding a breath that I will not release until he turns precisely one day older than Greta.During my son\u2019s birth, I leaned into the crook of my wife\u2019s neck while she pushed, just as I did when Greta was born. I closed my eyes and smelled the gauze from her deathbed. My boy came out sickly white, with the umbilical cord knotted around his neck, and he was silent for an eternal second before his gurgling cry bubbled through his lungs and my wife clutched him and wept. \u201cThis is a miracle baby, I hope you understand that,\u201d said our midwife. She was the same woman who had caught Greta and handed her to her mother; Greta had promptly let loose a tarry slick of meconium all over Stacy\u2019s belly and wailed, her feet swiping feebly in it like a bird in an oil spill.Children, hospitals, blood: It\u2019s all a confused swirl of joy and agony. Somewhere in my subconscious, my daughter is on a scale, her birth weight being calculated; in the same moment, she is blue and cold and being carted away. All I am is a spectator: Her body is not mine to protect, not mine to save.My wife and I are young still. With our son\u2019s birth, we have committed to another round here on earth. My son will always have a dead sister; when I am 50, my heart will ache in this exact same way it does today. Children remain dead in ways adults do not, and on bad mornings, in the wrong light, everything from here on out feels like ashes.Thankfully, I see it that way only in the margins. A breezy day, a good drink, my wife laughing, holding my son\u2019s head to my chest \u2014 these things help dispel it. I look at my boy, a beautiful already-fattening baby, and this world, the one that senselessly killed my daughter, is benevolent once more.I talk to him about his sister, whom I think he met before arriving. \u201cYour daddy will always be sad your sister\u2019s not here,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut you fill Daddy\u2019s heart up with joy and he loves you more than everything.\u201d I also want to say, but do not: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ll never be the same father I was before. I\u2019m sorry that you will live with me, to some degree, in grief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Donald Trump Is Right About", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byAstonishingly, Donald Trump is right about something!The pageant theme that year? Empowering women.So I\u2019m delighted that at least one person, Billy Bush, is paying in a concrete way for the words in the Trump tape. Maybe this can be a wake-up call for us men to appreciate that sexist epithets are no more acceptable than racist epithets.All that said, Trump is right to emphasize the importance of actions more than words: If we\u2019re outraged by vulgar words, shouldn\u2019t we be even more appalled by predatory actions? And policies? Here the truth is that a Trump administration\u2019s policies might be less titillating than his words, but they would be far more dangerous.Every year, 550,000 women in America require medical attention after an assault by a boyfriend or husband. That\u2019s an issue that is belatedly being addressed through screenings under Obamacare, which Trump wants to repeal, and by the Violence Against Women Act, which a large bloc of Republicans opposed in Congress. Trump\u2019s concern about such assaults seems dubious, and in fact both he and his campaign C.E.O., Steve Bannon, have been accused of domestic violence themselves.Since he never held public office, Trump lacks a voting record. But his running mate has tended to look at what might help women and do the opposite, including voting against equal-pay legislation.New York magazine once quoted Trump as telling a friend about women, \u201cyou have to treat \u2018em like\u2014\u2014\u201d well, manure. But to me, his language pales beside his behavior and likely policies. So let\u2019s try to pivot from outrage at gross words to condemnation of unconscionable behavior and policies. On that sole point, that actions matter more than words, Trump is exactly, frighteningly right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byThe most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes.Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax.Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It\u2019s called cash taxes paid \u2014 the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes.I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country\u2019s 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be.A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes.Remember: That\u2019s not just federal taxes. It\u2019s federal, state, local and foreign taxes.How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices.Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent.\u201cThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. \u201cAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.\u201dThere is another victim, too \u2014 one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can\u2019t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren\u2019t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven\u2019t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can\u2019t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon\u2019s rate.This system is cumbersome \u2014 causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance \u2014 and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors\u2019 money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they\u2019re just looking out for the rest of us.Don\u2019t be fooled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Democrats Resurrect the Middle Class?", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byWith the likelihood of major gains for their party on Election Day rising, the most important task facing Democrats is the development of a coherent economic agenda that addresses issues that were central in both the Republican and Democratic primaries.There are preliminary signs that Democrats and their allies are willing to put together just such an agenda.The two authors outline numerous proposals, including some that would be risky for Democrats, particularly those that call for the redistribution of resources from the party\u2019s upscale wing to downscale voters.These proposals include changes in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to benefit families with incomes of less than $100,000 (while reducing the benefits of the tax credit to the affluent) as well as the reduction or elimination of tax breaks in education savings plans for the affluent to generate revenues to boost Pell grants for poorer students.Sawhill and Rodrigue don\u2019t shy away from what they see as a necessary step in combating economic inequality:If we could empower young adults to only have children when they themselves feel ready to become parents, we could reduce unplanned pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births. That alone would reduce poverty and lack of mobility. The solutions here are often nongovernmental and involve changing social norms around the importance of responsible, two-person parenthood.They go on:Some have called for a new generation of government-sponsored marriage or relationship programs and for reducing marriage penalties in tax and benefit programs. But with some exceptions, these do not appear to be a cost-effective way to bring back the two-parent family. More promising are efforts to make the most effective forms of birth control (IUDs and implants) more widely available at no cost to women.the specter of secular stagnation and inadequate economic growth on the one hand, and ascendant populism and global disintegration on the other, has caused widespread apprehensionamid fears that \u201cthe global economy is entering unexplored and dangerous territory.\u201d And when economies worldwide stagnate, the result, Summers writes, is that \u201celectorates turn surly.\u201d The way to counter these negative trends, in his view, is to abandon \u201causterity economics in favor of investment economics.\u201dFurman focuses on a pair of crucial factors underlying slow growth: a lack of corporate dynamism and the weakening of competitive forces in the marketplace. Diminishing vitality in the marketplace has become a mounting concern among economists and policy makers.One advantage of Furman\u2019s approach is that it cuts across ideological boundaries.To support his case, Furman cites a wide range of data and reports. These include the finding that \u201cin 42 percent of the roughly 900 industries examined, the top four firms controlled more than a third of the market in 2012, up from 28 percent of industries in 1997\u201d and that in financial services, \u201cthe loan market share of the top ten banks increased from about 30 percent in 1980 to about 50 percent in 2010.\u201dIf the creation of new firms is a marker of a thriving competitive economy, Furman argues that the trends are not favorable. The accompanying chart shows a sharp decline over the past 30-plus years in the percentage of companies that are five years old or less, from just over 50 percent in 1982 to roughly 33 percent now, and a decline in the share of total employment provided by these young firms, from roughly 21 percent in 1982 to about 11 percent now.The decline in corporate dynamism has been accompanied by a decline in labor dynamism, with \u201cworkers less likely to move between jobs, industries, occupations, and locations,\u201d Furman writes.What Furman describes is a nation suffering from what amounts to economic arteriosclerosis. This has not hurt corporate management and the owners of capital \u2014 stockholders \u2014 but it has been disastrous for workers.Furman argues that \u201cboth market concentration and frictions that reduce worker mobility can lead to greater monopsony power for employers\" (monopsony is a buyer\u2019s monopoly). \u201cWith fewer firms competing for a given type of worker,\u201d Furman contends,each firm is more likely to exercise local monopsony, and their smaller numbers may also facilitate tacit or explicit collusion. If, on top of that, employees face greater search frictions or costs of moving, then this reduces their ability to raise their wages by changing jobs and thus also reduces their bargaining power with their current employer.The growing strength of businesses to bargain for low wages, bolstered by the decline in unionized employment and the falling value of the minimum wage, has contributed to the declining share of total income going to workers. Furman describes the trend as follows:Starting around 2000, the distribution of income between labor and capital shifted noticeably away from the former and towards the latter. Today, the labor share of income is in the mid-50s, compared to the mid-60s two decades ago.Despite rising returns to capital, there has not been a parallel increase in business investment. \u201cOne explanation,\u201d Furman argues, \u201cis that monopoly power has increased \u2014 which is consistent with higher returns and lower output.\u201dTogether, \u201cdeclining firm dynamism, high returns and low output, and disparities in the rate of return on investment are all potential consequences of increasing barriers to entry\u201d and restraining the operation of a free and open market.With these findings in place, Furman has laid out the groundwork for a liberal Democratic agenda:To the extent that these macroeconomic trends are related to decreased competition, then procompetitive policies have potential to not only benefit consumers but also improve the state of the macroeconomy by, for example, increasing productivity and ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely shared.Furman describes four areas where pro-competitive reforms are possible \u2014 and in some cases have already been initiated.The first is intellectual property and patent reform, areas where there is growing bipartisan agreement that excessive and often frivolous patent claims and the emergence of a new breed of patent tort litigators have held back innovation, especially technological innovation.The second is the need to increase the bargaining power of workers, whose leverage has steadily declined. More stringent antitrust enforcement could break up some business consolidation, giving workers access to job mobility; the practice of requiring employees to sign noncompete agreements should also be restrained.The third area is reform of state laws requiring occupational licensing, which Furman describes as an \u201cexample of policies that create inefficient and inequitable rents,\u201d and which have grown fivefold in the second half of the 20th century, from less than 5 percent of the work force in the early 1950s to 25 percent by 2008.While such licensing is needed in the case of health and safety occupations, in otherslicensing requirements create economic rents for licensed practitioners at the expense of excluded workers and consumers \u2014 increasing inefficiency and potentially also increasing inequality.Insofar as the licensing serves a legitimate need, the federal government can press for cross-border portability, giving licensees more opportunity to cross state lines for better jobs.The fourth is reform of land use regulation.\u201cOverly burdensome land-use restrictions \u2014 like minimum lot sizes, off-street parking requirements, height limits, prohibitions on multifamily housing, or lengthy permitting processes \u2014 can instead artificially reduce competition by acting as supply constraints,\u201d Furman contends. \u201cIn doing so, such policies both allow a small number of landowners to capture economic rents and reduce the stock of available affordable housing.\u201dFurman notes that land use constraints limit productivity growth and labor mobility by making it more difficult for workers to move to higher-productivity cities.One of the most vexing problems facing those seeking to develop a liberal, pro-competition agenda is the emergence of the digital marketplace.The complexity of the economics of the internet is, according to Furman, reflected in the following contradiction. On one hand, internet markets \u201chave tended to favor digital giants that hold high market shares\u201d and digitalization also poses an increased danger of opaque price fixing through the \u201cuse of advanced machine learning algorithms to set prices and adapt product functionality.\u201d On the other hand, the digital marketplace has encouraged competition by lowering \u201cmany costs for small businesses, increasing their ability to rapidly and inexpensively scale up, collect information on potential consumers, and create new products and ideas.\u201dThere is disagreement among economists concerning Furman\u2019s work.Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, wrote me by email: \u201cI am a big fan of Jason Furman and think the directions he has been sketching on technology, competition, and globalization make a lot of sense.\u201dDavid Card, an economist at Berkeley, conversely, wrote that he does not think Furman\u2019s proposals \u201cwill amount to more than a couple of percentage points higher wages (or a few percent lower prices) for low to middle income folks.\u201d Overall, Card said, \u201cI am deeply skeptical, to say the least.\u201dI would argue that even if Card is right, wages that are a couple of percentage points higher are nothing to sneeze at.Furman\u2019s proposals should not be viewed in isolation, but as one piece of a broader liberal agenda \u2014 an agenda that could include some or all of what Larry Summers, Isabel Sawhill, and others, have proposed.The economy has added nearly 10.7 million jobs; median household income has gone up $1,140, or 2 percent; the buying power of the average worker\u2019s weekly paycheck is up 4.2 percent; the median sales prices of existing single-family homes are up 23 percent; the unemployment rate has dropped well below the historical norm; job openings are at a 15-year high; corporate profits and stock prices have both soared to record highs; the number of people lacking health insurance has gone down by 16.5 million; the murder rate is down nearly 5 percent, despite an increase in 2015; and the number of unauthorized immigrants estimated to be living in the U.S. is down, according to demographers.There have also been a number of failures, as Factcheck.org also pointed out, perhaps most notably a 36 percent rise in the number of Americans on food stamps and a 0.3 increase in the poverty rate.Assuming for the moment that Clinton is Obama\u2019s successor, it will fall to her to build on his record and to address the yearning of those hard-pressed voters who have felt for far too long like beggars at the banquet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Mother Is Shot Dead on a Playground, and a Sea of Witnesses Goes Silent", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Murder in the 4-0Jessica White died shielding her children from gunfire on a Bronx playground in June. Few witnesses have emerged, frustrating overworked detectives, and her killer eluded the police.Supported byTo the right of where the hooded gunman paused and lifted his revolver, Jessica White\u2019s three young children were twirling down a pockmarked metal slide.They paid no mind to the swirl of life in the housing project playground around them: men rolling blunts at a graffitied concrete table, tenants playing bingo, rap and R&B blaring from a boombox. Their mother, buoyant after a long day behind the counter at a Shake Shack, was sitting nearby on a paint-chipped bench, unspooling her dream of getting her first apartment.It was just after 10 on June 11, a busy Saturday night. The rain had stopped and the air was swampy. Ms. White\u2019s children savored being outside their grandmother\u2019s stuffy first-floor apartment, above the building\u2019s boiler room.\u201cFive minutes, five minutes, five minutes!\u201d the children kept calling. Again and again Ms. White and her mother, Gola White, caved: \u201cO.K., five more minutes and we\u2019re going inside the house.\u201dThe first gunshot exploded from the walkway, between two London plane trees.\u201cMommy, the kids!\u201d Ms. White screamed.\u201cThe kids!\u201d her mother yelled back.Ms. White bolted from the bench, her body low to the hopscotch court as she reached for Damian Jr., Jessiah and Danielle \u2014 3, 5 and 9 \u2014 who were already scurrying toward her.A bullet whistled past the play set, passed through her left breast and pierced her heart. Ms. White\u2019s brothers ran out of their apartment and cradled her as she took her last breaths.She joined the ranks of the unintended, as detectives call those who bleed over someone else\u2019s beef.In the days that followed, at marches and speeches and basketball games in Ms. White\u2019s memory, everyone promised that the outcome would be different \u2014 that in 2016, with a plunge in crime freeing up police resources, a man could not shoot a young mother dead on a crowded playground and walk free.But tenants of the project, the John Adams Houses, say they got what they have come to expect in one of the poorest communities in the country: public safety on a budget.A $2,500 reward for tips, the bare minimum. Detectives shouldering caseloads that, by July, already exceeded what the department\u2019s chiefs considered manageable over an entire year. Promises by a local police commander to look into adding tower lights at the playground, made more difficult by the fact that those he had \u2014 just two \u2014 were being used in other high-risk spots.Detectives, in turn, were frustrated that even the killing of an innocent woman did not get the tip line ringing. Wanted posters with pictures of the gunman and his getaway car were torn off lampposts and trees. The young men at the playground claimed not to know a thing. \u201cY\u2019all far from the hunch,\u201d one said in an interview, and left it at that, a line detectives heard again and again.The playground is deserted now. Tenants organized a nighttime check-in system in one of the high-rises to keep out strangers with guns.And Gola White, who raised eight children in the Adams Houses, all of them homebodies with big, brown eyes, is trying in vain to move out before she loses another.With weariness more than anger, she said that the government skimps on public safety for black families like hers. She said she had asked the police about the $2,500 reward, which was not one-tenth the reward offered this summer after a young white woman was killed while jogging in Queens, generating weeks of intense news coverage.\u201cI think it\u2019s a racist thing \u2014 I can\u2019t beat around it,\u201d Gola White said. \u201cIf you look at things on TV and somebody says, \u2018I need this donated,\u2019 if they\u2019re white, they\u2019ll get it faster than a black person.\u201dHer daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Damian Bell, was stung by an encounter about three weeks after her killing when he asked two patrol officers just outside the Adams Houses for an update. He said they did not recognize Ms. White\u2019s name.\u201cThey feel like we don\u2019t care, so they don\u2019t care,\u201d Diana Void, Mr. Bell\u2019s mother, said of city officials. \u201cBut it\u2019s not everybody that doesn\u2019t care. There\u2019s a lot of us who do care.\u201dThe crimes, the rivalries and, often enough, the gang or drug ties in a murder victim\u2019s past usually fill the first pages of the manila homicide file. Before forensic evidence is back from the lab, that history acts as a road map for detectives.Ms. White was a blank page.The crime scene did not reveal any better clues.Witnesses heard anywhere from three to six shots, but detectives found only a single bullet: the one in Ms. White\u2019s chest. They thought it was a .38 caliber, but the bullet was so deformed that they could not say for sure. There were no fresh nicks on the trees, the jungle gyms or the church wall behind the playground that detectives noticed. No guns in the garbage chutes. And no bullet casings on the pavement or in the grass, which indicated that the weapon was a revolver.Virtually the only sign detectives found of anyone having been killed there was Ms. White\u2019s black sneaker lying near the bench.Detective John Caruso and a team of 40th Precinct investigators set out to find surveillance video of the gunman fleeing. Some witnesses said he had made a sharp left onto East 152nd Street. Others were sure it was a sharp right. Detective Caruso pulled video from areas in both directions but found no trace of the black-hooded gunman or his pearly white sneakers.Their search was delayed by a problem technology could not solve. Many of the bodegas and barbershops in the neighborhood were closed the day after the murder, for the Puerto Rican Day Parade, so the police could not immediately access their cameras.Two days after the killing, Detective Caruso found crucial video of the gunman darting across East 152nd onto a side street. As he sprinted toward a getaway car, a silvery-blue Volkswagen Jetta, the killer made a mistake: He rested his hand on the hood of an S.U.V. for balance, most likely leaving fingerprints. But by the time the detectives got the video and found the S.U.V., the prints were smudged and a dozen other hands could have left theirs.Likewise, images of the getaway car\u2019s license plate were too blurry for the Police Department\u2019s standard video software to enhance. Detective Caruso played the video again and again on his computer at home, looking in vain for any extra clues.The clock was ticking. Detectives in the 40th Precinct get four days to work a homicide before they start picking up other cases again \u2014 the robberies, the assaults and the grand larcenies that are the public\u2019s barometer of street crime and that can attract outsize attention from One Police Plaza. Every day without an arrest, the embers of the White case grew colder.It was the ninth murder logged this year by the precinct. With three more murders since, the precinct is the second deadliest in the city, behind the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn.\u201cSomeone like that, with her kids, you take it personal and you take it home with you,\u201d Detective Caruso said. \u201cWhat else can I do? What angle can I go?\u201dMoney and muscle have a way of making witnesses and crime victims around the Adams Houses forget a lot. Gola White worries that the $2,500 offered by the city is no match for those forces, especially when drugs are involved, as detectives believe they may be in Ms. White\u2019s killing.One of the men at the playground that night was a dealer who had recently gotten out of prison, said Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad. Witnesses said he had been rolling blunts at a concrete table where the White family usually sat, just a few paces in front of the bench they took that night instead. The dealer had once worked for a well-known drug boss and now wanted the crown for himself, residents said. So he recruited a few teenagers to sell for him around the Adams Houses, boys who used to go to school and were now causing headaches for their parents. Their wares were crack, powder cocaine and marijuana.The Adams Houses had been open territory since 2013, when the police and federal prosecutors stitched together wiretaps, surveillance and tips from street informants into a takedown of the drug ring that had controlled the development for more than a decade and killed Ms. White\u2019s brother.Recently, a new dealer had looked to claim the project. The dealer with deeper roots told the interloper he had to leave. Detectives believe, in what they say is the most solid of many competing theories in Ms. White\u2019s case, that the new dealer may have taken offense. \u201cHe comes back there, fires some shots, just to show, \u2018You can\u2019t push me off this easy,\u2019\u201d Sergeant LoPuzzo said. \u201cAnd now a woman is dead.\u201dThe ebb and flow of drug violence never ends, residents say. The takedown of the drug ring gave way to a peaceful spell, but last year the tide started to turn again.\u201cEvery time they shut down one, another one comes about,\u201d Gola White said of the drug crews. \u201cYou want to take over the world.\u201dIn a community like the Adams Houses, densely packed and secluded, the crews exert insidious influence. Prosecutors said Gola White\u2019s son Doneil White, who was killed in 2012, had been a nickel- and dime-bag drug dealer. No one cared much about his sales except for Jamal Smalls, a leader of the Bloods gang who was nicknamed Poo Black (a spin on Winnie the Pooh) and Mack (for Machiavelli).Hundreds of pages of court transcripts detail how petty drug feuds, undetected in their early stages by the police, spawned fear that touched everyday citizens \u2014 as well as the long-term investment required of the authorities to snare a two-time killer who kept moving drugs, even from a Rikers Island jail cell.The first time Mr. Smalls tried to shoot Mr. White, on July 18, 2012, he wounded a bystander in the Adams Houses, who identified Mr. Smalls as the gunman to a state grand jury. Soon, prosecutors said, Mr. Smalls paid or tried to pay the victim to forget; the man, confronted with his grand jury statements at a recent trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said he could not identify the shooter.The second time Mr. Smalls tried to shoot Mr. White, on July 25, he missed again, but a 16-year-old girl was in the lobby and witnessed part of the setup. When she was called to testify, Mr. Smalls\u2019s associates filled the court benches in front of her, causing her to break down in tears on the stand and equivocate for nearly half an hour before pointing him out.Mr. Smalls finally paid $10,000 to a friend, nicknamed Boo Banger, to lure Mr. White into a project stairwell and kill him. During Mr. White\u2019s autopsy, pathologists found an old bullet lodged in his pelvic bone from an earlier shooting in the same housing project.Ms. White and her mother attended Mr. Smalls\u2019s trial dressed in memorial T-shirts emblazoned with Mr. White\u2019s picture \u2014 a courageous statement, given that Mr. White\u2019s daughter was wearing it on the day of her father\u2019s funeral when Mr. Smalls pointed at it and taunted that he had \u201cgot slaughtered.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can understand this pain unless they have been through it themselves,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI hope that no mother would have to go through the pain of losing not one but two children to gun violence.\u201dThe blacktop playground in the Adams Houses looked different when Ms. White was a little girl. There were concrete turtles to sit on and a net to climb where there are now plastic yellow cylinders to spin and a play set with a sailor\u2019s wheel. Ms. White, ebullient and curious, used to run through the canyonlike corridors of the Adams Houses before heading to sleepovers in friends\u2019 apartments.The police said they had been paying attention to a robbery crew there called Jack Boyz, and had arrested young men on theft and gun charges nearby in the days before Ms. White\u2019s killing. But residents said they rarely saw officers patrolling for very long on foot.\u201cAt night, the project takes on a whole \u2019nother life,\u201d said Gloria, 41, a family friend of the Whites, who like many people interviewed for this article declined to give her full name for fear of the killer. Officers make their rounds and check the roofs around 7 or 8 p.m., Gloria said, and \u201cthen you see the drug addicts come out, you see the drug dealers come out, you see the riffraff.\u201dAfter Ms. White was killed, almost no one played there; tenants said ghosts had moved in. Most days, around the time school lets out and young men start flashing wads of cash and getting antsy, patrol officers pull a car onto the walkway and stand outside the playground. Young men have complained about police harassment, but many tenants are thankful for the heavier presence.As a patrol officer in the 40th Precinct in the mid-2000s, Detective Caruso had played stickball with boys in the neighborhood, among them the dealer who was rolling blunts in the park that night.That camaraderie opened doors when he got the White case. The dealer even invited Detective Caruso inside to speak with him and his mother. But he denied being the target.Another clue kept tugging at Detective Caruso. Surveillance footage at 745 East 152nd Street, one of the seven towers in the complex, had caught the gunman stepping onto the elevator from the 12th floor before he rode down, paced in the lobby, put a bandanna over his face and, after a minute of peering out the back door, strode toward the playground.An anonymous 911 caller identified a young man who lived in that building, whose apartment had been robbed several months earlier in what appeared to be either a search for drugs or an attempt to terrorize the man\u2019s family.But that lead took a puzzling turn when Detective Caruso, on a visit to the apartment of the drug dealer who the police were told was the target, discovered the young man who the 911 caller said was the gunman hanging out there, too.In the second-floor squad room of the 40th Precinct\u2019s station house, the air stagnant and the shades drawn, detectives debriefed people arrested in other crimes to see if they had heard anything about the White killing. But tips were sparse and hard to corroborate.Soon Detective Caruso was forced to divide his attention with other cases. By September, most of the squad\u2019s detectives were handling more than 200 cases. Police officials said the department advises that 180 cases is manageable for the entire year.Two residents of the Adams Houses said in interviews that they recognized the gunman from a surveillance image posted by the Police Department \u2014 the same man who was identified by the anonymous 911 caller. They said he was in a gang and sold drugs around the playground.But they said that day-to-day life in the project came with enough threats, including sexual assaults in the stairwells, and that they feared cooperating with the police could get them killed. One of them also said that when he once reported being threatened elsewhere in the city, officers said they did not believe him. He acknowledged he may not have truly been in danger, but said that encounter with the police made him feel that \u201cmy dignity is lost.\u201dThey were unaware there was any reward at all for tips. Other residents, and some retired detectives, were skeptical that raising it would make a difference.\u201cI don\u2019t need 22 bands\u201d \u2014 $22,000 \u2014 \u201cto give closure to the family,\u201d said one project resident, though, he added, \u201cit would be a bonus.\u201dSome retired police officials said the White case looked especially neglected next to the investigation into the murder of Karina Vetrano later in the summer. The daughter of a retired city firefighter and neighbor of a police commander, Ms. Vetrano was raped and beaten during a jog through a park in Howard Beach, Queens.Her case was in the headlines almost every day for weeks, whereas Ms. White\u2019s killing drew a few newspaper and television reports, laying bare the different treatment the news media often gives murder victims depending on their race and where they live.Before long, the city had installed eight surveillance cameras around the Queens park at a cost of $280,000, using money from the borough president\u2019s office. And Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office had put up a $10,000 reward for tips on top of an additional $25,000 from the Police Department and city-affiliated foundations, funds that were not made available in Ms. White\u2019s case.\u201cUnfortunately, the woman in the Bronx is being treated like collateral damage,\u201d said Thomas D. Nerney, a retired 36-year veteran of the Police Department and a former detective on the Major Case Squad. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the people in that area of the Bronx that if you\u2019re not high-profile then you don\u2019t count. And that irks me.\u201dThe city\u2019s tips website, CrimeStoppers, lists two unsolved homicides in the Bronx with rewards above $10,000.Since the beginning of 2015, there have been at least 122 felony crimes in and around the Adams Houses, according to a city crime map. By comparison, the killing of Ms. Vetrano in Queens was one of three felony crimes recorded within 10 square blocks over the same period.The Police Department pulled detectives from around the city to comb Ms. Vetrano\u2019s crime scene, sampling every scrap for evidence. The playground at the Adams Houses had just the usual two-person crime scene team assisting the detectives.In an interview, the city councilman for that part of the Bronx, Rafael Salamanca Jr., said that the reward should be higher, but that he had not spoken to City Hall about it. He was distressed to hear about the experience of Ms. White\u2019s fianc\u00e9 outside the housing project, when patrol officers had not known her name.\u201cThese are the types of things that affect the community-police relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that makes the community feel like they don\u2019t care.\u201dAt a packed tenants\u2019 meeting after Ms. White\u2019s death, people said they were grateful for the additional patrols, but asked why it took a murder to get the police walking through the development.\u201cMaybe just for that one second that you walk past, you can stop, maybe slow the process or stop someone getting hurt,\u201d one woman called out to a police commander. \u201cY\u2019all not God, y\u2019all can\u2019t see everything. But your presence walking through here would make a big difference.\u201dAfter Gola White\u2019s son was killed, she bought a burial plot for two. The second grave was going to be hers. She put a down payment on a tombstone, and gave her children instructions for adding an icon of an open Bible next to her name when she died.Instead, in June, she told the tombstone maker to add her daughter\u2019s name. She is still $200 short of what she needs to get the black stone placed.\u201cNever in my imagination did I think I would be burying another one of my kids,\u201d Ms. White said.She often lies in bed awake past 3 a.m. She is cajoling city workers to help her move into other subsidized housing, among them the same official who had tried to get her a new apartment after her son was killed. One apartment the official offered her then was too small; another was in a neighborhood where she said she had tense relationships. She cries when she wonders if she could have done more to protect her daughter.Her grandchildren no longer like being outside. A grandson, Tyshon, 5, heard a bang from workers taking down scaffolding after school and asked to go home. Another time, he dove under a play set when someone started lighting firecrackers.\u201cEvery bang, every boom, everything he hears \u2014 if he hears people fighting \u2014 everything is just, \u2018I want to go in the house, I want to go home, when are we leaving?\u2019\u201d Ms. White said.Early on, Jessica White\u2019s younger two children, Damian Jr. and Jessiah, would sometimes tell their father, Mr. Bell, \u201cGo to the doctor and get Mommy.\u201d The oldest, Danielle, had no choice but to confront what had happened. Her father showed her the Facebook page of a man he had heard committed the killing and asked if she recognized his face from the playground.One afternoon in July, Mr. Bell\u2019s mother, Ms. Void, was doing the girls\u2019 hair before a trip to the movies. Danielle, named after her mother\u2019s sister who had died in the fire, got it straightened with a flat iron. Jessiah had wanted a ponytail until she looked up at her sister. She decided she wanted the same.A great-uncle dropped by and kissed Danielle on the forehead. \u201cYou looking just like your mama,\u201d he said. The girl took a look in the mirror to make sure.Sandra E. Garcia, Nate Schweber and Ashley Southall contributed reporting. Doris Burke and Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Helping Immigrants, Chobani\u2019s Founder Draws Threats", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byIts founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, is a Turkish immigrant of Kurdish descent. He bought a defunct yogurt factory in upstate New York, added a facility in Twin Falls, Idaho, and now employs about 2,000 people making Greek yogurt.But in this contentious election season, the extreme right has a problem with Chobani: In its view, too many of those employees are refugees.Now there are calls to boycott Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya and the company have been taunted with racist epithets on Twitter and Facebook. Fringe websites have published false stories claiming Mr. Ulukaya wants \u201cto drown the United States in Muslims.\u201d And the mayor of Twin Falls has received death threats, partly as a result of his support for Chobani.Online hate speech is on the rise, reflecting the rising nationalism displayed by some supporters of Donald J. Trump, who has opposed resettling refugees in the United States.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Chobani is one more flash point in this battle between the voices of xenophobia and the voices advocating a rational immigration policy,\u201d said Cecillia Wang, director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.Chobani and Mr. Ulukaya declined to comment for this article. The Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment.As the business grew, Mr. Ulukaya needed more help. When he learned there was a refugee resettlement center in a nearby town, he asked if any of the newcomers wanted jobs at Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya provided transportation for the new hires, and he brought in translators to assist them. He paid the refugee workers salaries above the minimum wage, as he did other workers at the factory.When Chobani opened its factory in Twin Falls, Mr. Ulukaya once again turned to a local resettlement center. The company now employs resettled refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey, among other countries.\u201cThe minute a refugee has a job, that\u2019s the minute they stop being a refugee,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said in a talk he gave this year.\u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. \u201cThese companies are looking to provide resettled refuges with the ability to live happy and productive lives.\u201d\u201cHe was quite a sensation there,\u201d said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who attended the event. \u201cHere was someone who went beyond the well-meaning chatter of Davos and was walking the walk.\u201dBut while an alliance of well-known companies was now working together on the issue, the online critics zeroed in on Chobani. Shortly after Mr. Ulukaya spoke in Davos, the far-right website WND published a story originally titled \u201cAmerican Yogurt Tycoon Vows to Choke U.S. With Muslims.\u201dThen this summer, Breitbart, the conservative news website whose former executive chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is now running the Trump campaign, began publishing a series of misleading articles about Chobani.As Breitbart began publishing its articles, the online attacks grew more intense. On Twitter and Facebook, users called for a boycott of Chobani. An image was widely shared on social media that claimed Mr. Ulukaya was \u201cgoing to drown the United States in Muslims and is importing them to Idaho 300 at a time to work in his factory.\u201d And bloggers fabricated stories claiming that Chobani was pressuring local officials \u201cto facilitate their multitude of Muslim friendly/Islamification requests.\u201dSoon the mayor of Twin Falls, Shawn Barigar, found himself at the center of a conspiracy theory.\u201cIt got woven into a narrative that it\u2019s all a cover-up, that we\u2019re all trying to keep the refugees safe so that Chobani has its work force, that I personally am getting money from the Obama administration to help Chobani hire whoever they want, that it\u2019s part of this Islamification of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dAs the online comments escalated this summer, Mr. Barigar and his wife received death threats.Breitbart said it was simply covering the news.\u201cBreitbart has been a leader in delivering important and breaking news on refugee crises throughout the Western world, which pose both national security and financial risks,\u201d Alex Marlow, editor in chief, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Ulukaya hasn\u2019t merely involved himself in this issue, he\u2019s been one of the leaders in expanding refugee resettlement in the United States. Breitbart\u2019s explosive growth is due in large measure to the mainstream media\u2019s refusal to cover vital topics like this one.\u201dBut civil rights advocates said they believed it was no mystery why Mr. Ulukaya was targeted while other chief executives had been spared. \u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s an immigrant himself,\u201d Ms. Wang of the A.C.L.U. said.Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch attributed some of the xenophobia directed at Chobani to the election season.\u201cSome people are feeling left behind, and some people are concerned about terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Trump has given a voice to these sentiments.\u201dMr. Barigar, a Democrat, concurred. \u201cDonald Trump really fueled a sentiment about immigration that is shared by a very small part of our community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are an agricultural center. We\u2019ve depended on immigrants for a half-century or more.\u201dMr. Ulukaya appears undeterred. In September, he participated in a round-table discussion with President Obama and business leaders on how corporations could do more to help refugees.\u201cHe\u2019s the xenophobe\u2019s nightmare,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cHere\u2019s an immigrant who isn\u2019t competing for jobs, but is creating jobs big time. It runs completely counter to the far-right narrative.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about criticism of Hamdi Ulukaya, founder of the yogurt maker Chobani, because of his hiring of refugees misstated the timing of a round-table discussion Mr. Ulukaya participated in with President Obama and business leaders. It was in September, not \u201clast month.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I think Apple should have just bought a carmaker and brought it all in-house. Seems to me that the great hubris of Silicon Valley is thinking that you can build everything, no matter how complex, on your own.TechCrunch criticized the hire, citing a screed against the homeless that Gopman posted to Facebook a while back that made him persona non grata of San Francisco for quite some time.For me, the biggest takeaway here is that VR tweets seem like the most insane thing ever. But I have been wrong before.To me, it seems we\u2019re witnessing a newfound political awareness in the tech industry, which is reliably lefty but has long been willing to sit out national political disputes. I don\u2019t think Thiel\u2019s donation is going to cost him anything beyond social awkwardness, but in the long run, I suspect it will spark a progressive awakening among many in the industry. What do you think?To me, if you\u2019re building technology that is literally shaping the world as it will be defined in the future, there is no avoiding that your personal ideologies will come into question at some point. Perhaps this Thiel situation will finally bring that sense of self-awareness to those who hadn\u2019t realized this yet. In any case, yeah, I think it\u2019s probably going to rouse techies to be more vocal than they\u2019ve been in the past.It\u2019s a novel idea: People still want to play video games on their big-screen TVs at home, so you have to produce a console as successful as the Xbox or PlayStation that can run next-generation graphics and games.That said, everyone games on the go these days. The advent of the smartphone changed what we think of when we think of gaming, as users have migrated en masse to freemium or low-cost app gaming on their phones. It\u2019s easier if, say, you\u2019re commuting, since you only have to carry one device that you already have in your pocket anyway.I have my thoughts on this \u2014 namely, it could be awesome or terrible \u2014 but I wonder mostly about the content that needs to fill this thing out. And other than the highly successful franchises Nintendo has built out over the years like Mario, Zelda and a handful of others, I haven\u2019t really seen any blockbuster titles from them in some time.What do you think? Fail or win?But if that\u2019s the case, you have to wonder why you need a stand-alone device \u2014 why couldn\u2019t you just carry around a controller for your smartphone or tablet, and then connect your device to your TV when you\u2019re home? In other words, why is Nintendo making new hardware when it could simply put out its games for the iPhone, iPad and Android devices?To me, it seems like a complicated path. I\u2019d favor something simpler: Kill the hardware, focus on creating killer games, release them for high prices on iOS and Android, and profit.Look at Disney: After they bought \u201cStar Wars\u201d they planned to crank out a movie a year until 2020, and everywhere I look there\u2019s a BB-8 motorized ball for me to trip over.O.K., enough for me today.

{"Headline": "Tunisia Briefly Holds Two From U.S. on Suspicion of Terror Ties", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byJENDOUBA, Tunisia \u2014 Two Americans were detained in this small town in northwestern Tunisia, suspected of involvement with a terrorist organization, police officials said on Wednesday.The men were arrested on Tuesday and then transferred to the country\u2019s main counterterrorism center in Tunis, the capital, the police said. They were released and driven away in a United States Embassy car on Wednesday, police officials said.The United States Embassy in Tunis said it could not comment on the case and referred questions to the State Department in Washington. A State Department spokesman, John Kirby, said in an email statement that the agency was aware of reports that American citizens had been arrested on suspicion of terrorist activities, but he declined any additional comment. The men are brothers, Nathan Wells Lawwliss, 32, and Patrick Alan Lawwliss, 31, according to both the police and a man who rented them an apartment.The police in this small, hardscrabble town have been dealing with terrorist suspects for several years. Islamist fighters operate in the low scrubby mountains that rise behind the town and occasionally they ambush police officers or lure youths to join them. But the police were scratching their heads over the latest arrivals: two Americans from Michigan with long beards and unkempt hair, who rented an apartment and said they were enrolling in the local university. The men did not fit the stereotypes that most Tunisians have of Americans. \u201cUsually Americans are clean and physical,\u201d said Lotfi Ouerghli, 52, a cafe owner who rented the men an apartment. \u201cThey seemed like they had not been living in the city. They looked like they had been living in the wild.\u201dThe men gave him a month\u2019s rent, he said, but he was uncomfortable about his lodgers. The younger one seemed anxious and unhappy, he said. The older brother was religious; he was teaching his brother the Quran in Arabic, Mr. Ouerghli said.For the Tunisian police, the arrival of Americans in town was an alarm. Tunisia was targeted in a bombing by Al Qaeda in 2002 and has been grappling with a new wave of terrorist attacks since 2013. Dozens of foreign tourists were killed in attacks in 2015 by gunmen at the national museum in Tunis and on a beach resort hotel.\u201cFor Americans we were a bit worried,\u201d said Abdelfatteh Ayadi, the police commissioner of the university district where the two men found lodging. \u201cAmericans are a target and in my position I have to guard them. That\u2019s my job.\u201d\u201cI went to talk to them, but it was a bit strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wore big boots full of mud and they spoke only English, but they could understand Arabic.\u201d The men were renting a cheap apartment in a working-class area near the university, not a place where foreigners usually stay, he said.The police commissioner asked them to come to the police station. The older brother was carrying the identity card of his wife, who is Tunisian. When the police called her, she told them the couple had recently divorced. \u201cWhen I saw things were incomprehensible, I passed it on to my superiors,\u201d Commissioner Ayadi said.The men, who had arrived in town on Sunday, were interviewed at the police station on Monday, when the police also obtained a warrant to search their apartment. By Tuesday morning they were under arrest and taken to Tunis. The elder brother possessed photos of Osama bin Laden, as well as numerous photos of women in full Islamic niqab, police officials said. He also displayed the black flag of the Islamic State on his Facebook page. He also had been messaging with someone in Syria on Facebook and expressed his desire to be in the front line of jihad to protect his younger brother, according to a police investigator. The message was dated Oct. 19, he said.The police are uncertain what the two men intended to do in Jendouba. They did not have the right qualifications to enroll in the university, so they could not have studied in Jendouba, the police said. They may have hoped to link up with insurgents in the mountains, but they had little chance of slipping under the radar of the authorities in a small town like Jendouba, the police said. If they wanted simply to study the Quran, they should have gone to Tunis, the police said.\u201cWe do not know if it was a coincidence or really something,\u201d a police officer concluded.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "It was among the earliest significant reports in a major American newspaper of the Sandinista movement that would topple Somoza, a Cold War ally of the United States. It was also the first magazine cover for Ms. Meiselas, then 30. She went on to spend much of the next 10 years covering conflicts and human rights issues in Central America, where tens of thousands of people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mostly civilians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 died in civil wars between right-wing governments and leftist insurgents.The image of the masked men has become, Ms. Meiselas said, one of the most important to her, not just because of the role it played in her career but also for personal reasons. In the middle of the photo is a young shoemaker named Justo Gonzalez who became a good friend; he once rescued her from a dicey situation in Masaya during the insurrection and stayed in close touch with her for over 30 years. The film scenes come mainly from \u00e2\u0080\u009cPictures From a Revolution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d produced and directed by Ms. Meiselas, Richard P.  Rogers and Alfred Guzzetti in 1991. Ms. Meiselas returned to the locations where the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photos were taken and searched for her subjects to record their memories about the images and their experiences.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was turning the pages of the book and walking down streets, going back to the corners, trying to figure out where I can find people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no idea if they would remember that moment. Ten years is a long time. Many had never seen the photos. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very poignant moment when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at themselves in the book.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms Meiselas, a longtime Magnum photographer, filmed her friend Justo in 1989. When you look at his image in the book and hold a smartphone over it, you see and hear him recount why he joined the revolution. Ms. Meiselas also recalls how the shoemaker living a clandestine life was the first Sandinista she met. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor some strange reason he trusted me\u00e2\u0080\u009d with his secrets, she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was at a time when very little was visible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in explaining about the image. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was no fighting yet. I didn\u2019t know yet that that would even come. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strange, but through Justo I understood how little I understood \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that what I could see was not what necessarily was happening. So it changed everything about how I would look at things.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe book provides an opportunity to look at these historic photos with the luxury of reflection that only time provides. Looking back on what happened over the last 30 years evokes a different reaction if you had experienced it as a reader of The Times Magazine than if you were the budding revolutionary and  father of two holding the improvised bomb.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look at photographs that freeze time, but then time moves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Meiselas said. Much has changed since then. Ms. Meiselas became one of the  most influential documentary photographers and established the Magnum Foundation.Nicaragua is holding an election on Nov. 6, and President Daniel Ortega, the former Sandinista leader, is seeking re-election. He first served as president from 1985 until 1990 in the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first democratic elections and has been back in office since 2007. He is seeking a third straight term, with his wife, Rosario Murillo, on the ticket for vice president.  Mr. Ortega is now regarded by many as an authoritarian who has purged the National Assembly of opponents and packed the courts with allies to push through laws that would abolish presidential term limits. Over the years, former revolutionary allies have split from the party, establishing their own factions to denounce his political deal-making and lodge allegations of corruption and betrayal of their once-shared ideals. Ms. Meiselas is scheduled to return to Nicaragua on Dec. 1 and is looking forward to catching up with old friends in Managua.  But one will not be there.Last month, Ms. Meiselas received an email that Justo had died after a long battle with cancer. Attached was a photo of him in his coffin. Resting atop a Sandinista flag draped over his coffin was a print of the photo of him and his comrades. The image that launched her career now commemorated the end of his life.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps the most meaningful act of my life as a photographer is that he asked that the photograph I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d made of him be buried with him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTime is a powerful force for all of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}

People who, as she told me recently, think that \u201cclassical music is better than the Andalusian music\u201d of Morocco, or that \u201cChekhov is more important than Maimonides.\u201dWhen at last Regev materialized, wearing an all-black ensemble and crimson lipstick, a murmur swept through the auditorium. She is a striking, fiery presence with wide-set eyes, prominent lips and dark hair streaked with reddish highlights. Standing in front of the audience, her expression set between a smirk and a scowl, she clutched the lectern with one hand. \u201cI was always told to start a speech with a quote; it makes for a cultured impression,\u201d she began. \u201cSo here goes. As the famed Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu once put it\u201d \u2014 she switched to accented English \u2014 \u201cCut the bullshit! Cut the bullshit!\u201dStunned silence fell over the crowd. Then people began to jeer. Someone cried out, \u201cThe minister of occupation!\u201d\u201cWe will expose the hypocrisy and the greed,\u201d Regev continued, her voice rising. \u201cWe will guarantee loyalty to the laws of the country!\u201dPeople rose from their seats and booed. \u201cShame on you!\u201d a voice rang out.Since joining Likud in 2008, Regev has become known for her provocations no less than for her nationalist fervor. The columnist Nahum Barnea called her \u201ca walking graffiti wall.\u201d There was the time she described migrant workers from Africa as \u201ccancer in our body.\u201d And the time she lashed out at an Arab member of the Knesset: \u201cGo to Gaza, you traitor!\u201d She sometimes unfurls an Israeli flag during speeches and has on occasion taken reporters to pray at the Western Wall before an interview. In 2013, she introduced a bill to annex the Jordan Valley, a move that would all but foreclose the prospect of a two-state solution.Now she continued on a familiar course, stating that the ministry would stop serving \u201cas an A.T.M.\u201d and calling to divert money away from \u201cpowerful institutions.\u201d At one point she paused. \u201cLet\u2019s admit it,\u201d she said. \u201cYour culture demands exclusive funding, while another culture has been silenced for years.\u201dThe socioeconomic gap between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim has since narrowed, spurred by a rise in interethnic marriage (about a third of Jewish Israeli children born today are ethnically mixed). But it hasn\u2019t disappeared altogether. Mizrahim earn roughly 25 percent less per capita than Ashkenazim, according to Momi Dahan, a professor of public policy at Hebrew University. Social and cultural tensions still percolate. In a 2007 poll, more than half of respondents characterized relations between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim in the country as \u201cnot good.\u201d\u201cIt was all planned,\u201d Regev told me this summer of her speech. We were in the back seat of her ministerial car, driving north on the Yitzhak Rabin Highway to attend a ceremony in her honor. It was a scorching day, and she had kicked off her stilettos and wedged her bare feet between passenger seat and window. \u201cI knew that if I went to the Haaretz conference, there was no way I was going to be nice and say, \u2018Thank you for inviting me.\u2019 You know those invitations to high society? You tell yourself, I have to look pretty and be nice and wear my high heels? No way. No way. I was there to tell them what I thought of them. To tell them: \u2018You talked enough. Now you listen.\u2019\u2009\u201dNetanyahu has tried to distance himself from many of the more flagrant displays of such McCarthyism. And yet similar measures are routinely promulgated on the Knesset floor. One recent bill calls for enshrining Israel\u2019s legal status as \u201cthe national home of the Jewish people.\u201d A newly passed law requires nongovernmental organizations that receive more than half their funding from foreign governments to disclose this in all their official communications; an earlier version went so far as to demand that representatives of these organizations wear a special badge while in the Knesset. The law is widely seen as targeting the left because it affects most human rights organizations in the country, which typically receive money from foreign governments, but not most pro-settler groups, whose funding comes largely from private donors.The politicians peddling those bills represent a new vanguard of far-right activism. Younger and more unabashedly anti-democratic than Netanyahu\u2019s cohort of Likudniks, they do not feel the need to pay lip service to the idea of the occupation as a temporary necessity. Some \u2014 like Naftali Bennett, the education minister, and Ayelet Shaked, the justice minister \u2014 belong to a smaller party in Likud\u2019s coalition that ensures its continued drift rightward. Their platform includes \u201cfighting anyone who acts to turn Israel into \u2018a state of its citizens.\u2019\u2009\u201d Others are the Likud\u2019s own. Earnest, dour politicians like Yariv Levin and Ze\u2019ev Elkin make up the maximalist camp of the party, its rough equivalents of Ted Cruz and Darrell Issa. Likud today \u201cholds the worldview that historic rights are superior to natural, human rights,\u201d says the political scientist Zeev Sternhell. \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying in effect is, \u2018We are the majority, and we can do whatever we want.\u2019\u2009\u201dRegev is often placed in the maximalist camp. Like them, she doesn\u2019t believe in the \u201cillusion of peace\u201d and has spoken out vehemently against a Palestinian state. She argues that Jews should be allowed to pray on the Temple Mount, which goes against Israel\u2019s security arrangements with the Islamic council that has administered the site since the 12th century. And she is unapologetic about seeking to cement her party\u2019s power. She told me: \u201cThere\u2019s a new group on the right that says: We\u2019re unwilling to bow our heads any longer. We\u2019re unwilling to let the left decide for us if we\u2019re in charge.\u201dBut unlike other politicians in the maximalist camp, for whom the territorial question remains central, Regev has decided to set her sights elsewhere. Regev\u2019s goal is to dislodge the \u201celites\u201d in order to elevate previously marginalized groups. To do so, she has issued new criteria for the allocation of state funds for cultural institutions. These include a clause that gives the government the power to punish acts of \u201cdelegitimization of the state\u201d \u2014 burning the Israeli flag during a play, for example \u2014 and provides financial incentives to troupes that perform in Jewish settlements in the West Bank.For Mizrahi activists like Cahlili, Regev is an unequivocal good. \u201cFor once in 67 years, a culture minister is speaking the truth,\u201d Cahlili says. \u201cEven if she does one-tenth of what she has set out to do, we\u2019ll have a historic correction of injustice.\u201d But others see her as hurting the Mizrahi cause. \u201cThe danger of the Mizrahi struggle is that it will fall to a place of unjustified hatred, where there\u2019s no grace and no compassion, and where there\u2019s an inability to accept a multiplicity of voices,\u201d says Mati Shemoelof, a Mizrahi writer and editor. And many on the left see an inherent hypocrisy in the gap between Regev\u2019s words and her actions. Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, an alliance of Arab political parties, told me: \u201cYou can\u2019t reconcile this seemingly liberal and egalitarian approach with an attack on Arabs, which is what she\u2019s doing.\u201dRegev\u2019s driver stopped, and we stepped into the thick heat of the day. She was dressed for an event that evening: high heels and a short black dress that flattered her recently slimmed-down figure. Her neck was burdened with heavy necklaces, one a blend between a Star of David and a sheriff\u2019s star.\u201cShalom!\u201d a neighbor stopped her. \u201cWhat did we do to deserve this?\u201d\u201cShh, don\u2019t tell Dror\u2019s parents I\u2019m here,\u201d Regev laughed before enveloping the woman in a hug.That afternoon we sat in the snug, well-lit living room of the Sibonis. Regev had swapped her heels for a pair of worn flip-flops and piled up her hair with a clip. The news was on in the background. I asked her parents about politics. \u201cI grew up among the progressives, the Labor Party,\u201d Felix said. \u201cWhen my daughter joined Likud, as a father I had to support her, so I switched.\u201d This came as something of a shock. As far as I knew, Regev had never before spoken about growing up in a Laborite home.Later I would learn that despite her hard-line positions, Likud might not have been Regev\u2019s first choice. In 2008, after retiring from the military, she considered her options. She wanted to enter politics but wasn\u2019t sure which party to join. \u201cShe was debating,\u201d recalls Daniel Ben Simon, who ran in the Labor primaries that year. \u201cShe told me, \u2018If there\u2019s an opportunity at Labor, I\u2019ll go with Labor.\u2019\u2009\u201d She met with Ehud Barak, then the chairman of the Labor Party, but he refused to guarantee her a top spot on the party roster. Realizing she stood a better chance of being elected under Likud, which was riding high in the polls, Regev scheduled a meeting with Netanyahu. Nitza Friedman, a close friend of Regev\u2019s for nearly 20 years, remembers being \u201csurprised\u201d when Regev joined Likud. (Regev acknowledges meeting with Barak. But she says that they didn\u2019t talk of her joining the party and that her preference was always to be a member of Likud.)When Regev joined the Knesset, she wasn\u2019t given any significant assignments. Despite her military bona fides, she barely managed to get on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. She struggled to find a voice in the party. Then, in 2009, she objected to a tax on fruits and vegetables proposed by Netanyahu and made a name for herself as a populist hero of sorts when she appeared on the cover of a newspaper chopping salad. \u201cUnacceptable,\u201d Netanyahu fumed at the time. Gradually, she also began to align herself with the coalition\u2019s more hard-line elements, making headlines for her outrageous statements in the Knesset. In 2010, an Arab lawmaker participated in a flotilla protesting the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Regev publicly yelled at her, calling her a traitor in Arabic and a Trojan horse. \u201cShe gave the show of her life,\u201d Ben Simon said, morosely. \u201cThat day, Miri Regev was born.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d the host replied warmly.The atmosphere was festive, but the gathering itself seemed unlikely, surreal even, considering Regev\u2019s past rebukes of Arab lawmakers \u2014 \u201cBetrayers! Terrorists!\u201d she fulminated in 2014 \u2014 and the fact that Arab Israelis rarely vote for Likud (the party garnered about 1 percent of the Arab vote in the last election). I was told that the evening\u2019s host was a veteran Likudnik \u2014 he referred to Regev as being \u201clike family\u201d \u2014 but I wondered how many of the other men present actually voted for her.Regev nodded. \u201cWrite it down,\u201d she told an aide.The evening began to take on the distinct feel of electioneering, of a quid pro quo exchange. Regev has perfected the craft. A staggering amount of her time is spent shuttling to events of potential voters, where she schmoozes and canvasses in equal measure: \u201cWe can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d she was seen telling guests at a bar before the last primary. It isn\u2019t only supporters whom she showers with attention. She kisses everyone: the strangers who ask to take selfies with her, the traffic cop who lets her entourage pass through, the bleary-eyed cook catering a work lunch that she attends. She doesn\u2019t see a disconnect between her radical statements against the Palestinians and her attempt to promote Arab culture or woo Arab Israeli voters, many of whom identify as Palestinian. Arab Israelis want to \u201craise their children in peace,\u201d she says, while members of the Palestinian leadership \u201csanctify death.\u201d (Arab municipalities are used to such double speak from government ministers but often decide to swallow the insult in order to maintain working relations.)She stood up and thanked Shanati. \u201cThe cultural revolution that I am leading is to give voice to the Arab sector,\u201d she said at a volume more suitable for a conference hall. \u201cMy office is your home. Every problem, every issue.\u201d Yet earlier she ventured a qualifier by way of hyperbole: \u201cWhoever is loyal to the state, we\u2019ll bring him the moon.\u201dA few years ago a quiet agreement was reached: Artists who objected to performing in the West Bank were to be substituted during those productions. But Regev imperiled this delicate compromise. When the Arab-Israeli actor Norman Issa refused to perform in the Jordan Valley last year, Regev threatened to pull funding from a Jewish-Arab children\u2019s theater he helped found. The statement letter, which has become known in the Israeli news media as the \u201cloyalty form,\u201d drew fire not just from a handful of personal objectors; some 1,500 artists signed a petition objecting to Regev\u2019s moves. Stage directors worried that in order to mount shows that would appeal to the tastes of settlement councils, theaters would have to adopt, as the journalist Israel Harel, who himself lives in a settlement, wrote earlier this year, \u201ca repertoire that is homophobic, nationalistic, even religious, resembling Iran under Khomeini.\u201dMany who oppose Regev\u2019s stipulations say her approach to culture is colored by her stint as chief military censor. In a recent government meeting to discuss the establishment of a new public broadcaster, Regev excoriated the prospect of an independent broadcasting authority. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that we\u2019ll establish a corporation that we can\u2019t control,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Regev doesn\u2019t deny that the role of censor has shaped her thinking, but she seems to have learned that to advocate censorship outright is bad form. Instead, when liberals complain of her curbs on freedom of speech, she counters with what she calls the state\u2019s \u201cfreedom of funding.\u201d As Regev told me, her voice rising with each sentence: \u201cIf, as a cultural institution, you decide not to perform in Judea and Samaria, to boycott an entire population that lives there, that\u2019s fine. But you won\u2019t get all of your funding. \u2026 If you put on a play about a terrorist who says he supports killing soldiers, then you won\u2019t get funding. Not from me.\u201dWhen I asked heads of cultural institutions what they made of this notion, they all noted that the funding in question isn\u2019t Regev\u2019s to distribute but comes from taxpayer money. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018freedom of funding,\u2019\u2009\u201d one added. \u201cCitizens have freedoms; states have duties. In a fascist state, the state has freedoms and the citizens have duties. Without funding, cultural production can\u2019t take place.\u201dNoam Semel has been the Cameri general director for the last 24 years. He is 70, slight of build, with a smooth face and the booming voice of someone who likes to hear himself speak.\u201cThere is huge unrest,\u201d he said as soon as I sat down in his office, a modest room whose walls were crowded with framed posters, including one of him shaking hands with Yitzhak Rabin. Like most of the heads of the cultural institutions I spoke to, who have dozens of employees on their payroll, Semel was quick to point out that he was on good personal terms with Regev, though, he added, \u201cprofessionally, or intellectually, we have a disagreement.\u201d Semel believes that Regev\u2019s war on the cultural elites, and especially on Tel Aviv, is misplaced. He named as his inspiration the longtime French minister of culture, Jack Lang, who concentrated France\u2019s artistic talent in Paris, creating a hub of cultural vibrancy. This could be Tel Aviv, Semel argued.\u201cAnd that\u2019s regardless of Miri,\u201d a colleague of his interjected.\u201cThat\u2019s a typical day,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018Tel Aviv elite\u2019 for you.\u201dRegev isn\u2019t deaf, but her ability to mute her critics and forge ahead is indeed remarkable. There are many who believe that Netanyahu has watched her rise not only with awe but also with trepidation. She has more than hinted at coveting Israel\u2019s highest office. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he feels intimidated, but there\u2019s no doubt that today I\u2019m a force,\u201d Regev told me.As Regev\u2019s professed cultural revolution continues, she seems increasingly to revert to her old role as censor, demanding that culture march in lock step with the state. In July, she caused controversy when she called to withdraw public funds from Army Radio for airing a segment about the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish. She blamed the station for \u201csanctifying the anti-Israeli narrative\u201d and threatened to remove it from the army altogether. In September, she stormed out of a film-awards ceremony during the performance of a duo rapping a Darwish poem. \u201cIf you\u2019re not loyal to the country, then you should be punished,\u201d she told me in no uncertain terms.\u201cWhat is this loyalty?\u201d Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List, said when asked about Regev\u2019s ultimatum. \u201cA person who is against the settlements: Is he loyal to the state of Israel or not? A person who is against the occupation: Is he loyal to the state of Israel or not? A person who is against Arab discrimination, who is against antidemocratic laws: Is he loyal or not? When you demand loyalty from an entire Arab population, is that not collective condescension? Who is this higher being who demands loyalty from us?\u201dRegev\u2019s answer to that question would most likely be: the new right, the military, the ruling majority. Back on her front porch, she began taping a video for a coming race to honor an Israeli soldier who was killed in 2014. \u201cDear residents of the Golan Heights,\u201d she said, finding her stride as she squinted against the rising morning sun. \u201cI want to salute you!\u201dRuth Margalit is an Israeli writer living in New York.

I\u2019ve never heard the phrase BALANCED EDIT (for \u201cBalanced diet\u201d), and I\u2019ve been on both sides of the editorial process for years, but I suppose it could be a thing.

{"Headline": "Twitter Has an Old Media Problem. Here\u2019s a Solution.", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorSAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Twitter is a communications marvel, with 317 million active users who instantaneously convey a collective reaction to news.But a business based primarily on advertising needs advertisers. Twitter has not figured out how to attract enough of them to eke out regular quarterly profits. A few potential buyers, including the Walt Disney Company and Salesforce.com, have kicked the tires but decided not to buy the company.I have a solution: Larry Page, a founder of Google, should buy Twitter. Pull out his own wallet and buy it. Personally.It doesn\u2019t literally have to be Larry Page; it could be any civic-minded billionaire who sees Twitter for what it is: a primary source for news and information, not the next Google or Facebook.When Jeff Bezos purchased The Washington Post, it wasn\u2019t because the newspaper was a compelling business opportunity. It was, and remains, a hallowed institution of journalism.The country\u2019s pre-eminent newspapers, including this one, have long been controlled by families who have understood that the press is not just an ordinary industry, but a civic calling. Twitter is not yet treated as hallowed, but it has the makings of an institution that could be.Twitter puts no intermediary between speaker and listener. When public figures do the actual composing \u2014 and, oh, what a difference between Donald J. Trump\u2019s own tweet eruptions and those prepared by his staff \u2014 we get not just information but also a glimpse of the candidate\u2019s unguarded self that we don\u2019t get in other media outlets. For that alone, we should thank the heavens for Twitter.This election has also highlighted Twitter\u2019s capacity to augment coverage of civic events like the three presidential debates as they are happening. Instead of waiting for the predictable reactions of network anchors, guests and pundits, we can use Twitter to see reactions, smart and snarky alike, from hundreds of personally chosen observers while the debate is still on.Put another away, if journalism is the first draft of history, Twitter is the first draft of journalism.The nation\u2019s founders recognized the importance of speedy dissemination of news when they provided for low postal rates for newspaper subscribers and allowed newspaper printers to mail one another newspapers without charge. The content of many newspapers consisted mostly of reprints of articles obtained from these exchanges. In the same way, links in tweets serve as an indispensable guide to the best of journalism that originates outside of Twitter.So who better to rescue Twitter than Mr. Page, a founder of the company dedicated to organizing the world\u2019s information? Twitter takes the first cut of doing that organizing, in real time.Mr. Page also commands an empire built on algorithms. And Twitter has a pressing need for better algorithms to keep the platform free of the sludge discharged by racists, anti-Semites and other trolls.The Anti-Defamation League, in a recent study, counted 2.6 million tweets with anti-Semitic language in a year, but despite Twitter\u2019s disavowal of \u201chateful conduct,\u201d the league found, only 21 percent of the anti-Semitic accounts were suspended. Twitter relies on humans, not software, for enforcement, and they are overwhelmed.This computer-science problem \u2014 filtering out trolls \u2014 remains as difficult as any of the moonshots being tackled in Alphabet\u2019s Google X division. If Mr. Page developed a way to help Twitter keep the hate speech out, that technology would not only win back the advertisers who are fleeing because of trolls, but also, if shared, enable newspapers to reopen their comments\u2019 sections at their own websites, promoting the airing of differing views in public space. What service to the public could surpass that?While I\u2019m offering Mr. Page unsolicited advice about what he should do with his money, I\u2019ll also note that Twitter\u2019s current market capitalization, of around $12 billion, is a triumph of hope over reality. If Twitter\u2019s revenue and user growth fail to surge, the asking price will fall. Look at Yahoo: Eight years ago, the company spurned an acquisition offer from Microsoft for more than $45 billion. This year, it accepted an offer from Verizon for about a tenth of that.In 2011, Mr. Page had an exploratory conversation with one of Twitter\u2019s founders, Jack Dorsey, about Google\u2019s acquiring the company, but Mr. Page\u2019s interest then was in using tweets in search results. Google subsequently struck a deal to gain access to tweets that allows it to enjoy the milk without buying the cow.As Twitter\u2019s prospective suitors have one by one turned away, Twitter\u2019s board surely has come to the realization, at last, that the company has less to do with the sexy, endlessly expanding world of \u201csocial media\u201d \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat \u2014 than with the seemingly duller world of old-school newspapers, limited circulation and less-than-stratospheric profit margins.Mr. Page does not have a Twitter account and is a famously reticent chief executive. But a stray remark he once made suggests he is well suited temperamentally to be Twitter\u2019s white knight. Mr. Page told a friend that our laws would be much improved if their length, in characters or words, was capped to keep them brief. This would ensure that lawmakers would actually read the drafts in their entirety before voting on them.William Randolph Hearst built a newspaper empire on sensationalism when that\u2019s what the audience demanded. Today, consumers are, above all else, impatient, preferring a news snack rather than a feast. Mr. Page, a connoisseur of brevity, would seem to be the perfect billionaire rescuer for Twitter, the highest-circulation short-form \u201cnewspaper\u201d on earth.Randall Stross, a professor of business at San Jose State University, is working on a book about Stanford University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Men Need Help. Is Hillary Clinton the Answer?", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisIf Hillary Clinton wins this election and becomes the first female president of the United States, American men may well be one of her most urgent problems.Consider some startling statistics.More than a fifth of American men \u2014 about 20 million people \u2014 between 20 and 65 had no paid work last year.Seven million men between 25 and 55 are no longer even looking for work, twice as many black men as white.There are 20 million men with felony records who are not in jail, with dim prospects of employment, and more of these are black men.Half the men not in the labor force report they are in bad physical or mental health.Men account for only 42 percent of college graduates, handicapping them in a job market that rewards higher levels of education.Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and now a professor of economics at Harvard, estimates that a third of men between 25 and 54 without college educations could be out of work by midcentury.Well-paying jobs that don\u2019t demand a college degree have been shrinking for generations \u2014 and technology is accelerating that trend. Driverless cars, for instance, could eliminate trucking as we know it, a refuge for many blue-collar men.The crisis is not confined to the white men backing Donald J. Trump, who has commanding majorities among men without college educations. The challenge of masculinity in America extends beyond race and political party.Economists and scholars have assembled a trove of disturbing data about the plight of men, even as they acknowledge that women\u2019s employment has stalled for the past 15 years as well.Nicholas N. Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute has released the latest compendium, \u201cMen Without Work.\u201d Drawing on multiple data sets, he sketches an unsettling portrait not just of male unemployment, but also of lives deeply alienated from civil society. The seven million men who are not even looking for work \u2014 about 60 percent of whom do not have four-year college degrees \u2014 spent an average of five and a half hours a day watching television or movies. Very few cared for children or other household members, or did housework. A third admitted to illegal drug use.Many of Mr. Trump\u2019s backers talk about losing out in the new economy, echoing the points the candidate makes on the campaign trail.Joe Peterson and Al Paslow, 61 years old and friends since high school, waited for hours the other day to attend a Trump rally in Ambridge, Pa. \u2014 a town named for the American Bridge Company. It was a resonant spot, in the heart of what was once a thriving steel and energy powerhouse. Mr. Paslow\u2019s mother grew up in Ambridge on the very street where the rally took place. Their family, friends and relatives all worked in the abundant steel mills in the Pittsburgh area \u2014 Mr. Peterson\u2019s father as an electrician, Mr. Paslow\u2019s father as a blacksmith.\u201cNow these mills are gone, replaced by stores, shops and offices that could have been placed almost anywhere,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cNo industry here now; it\u2019s all been lost.\u201dThe two friends most recently worked as independent contractors in the oil and gas industry, earning six-figure salaries. Mr. Peterson had a high school education; Mr. Paslow a college degree. Last year, they were both laid off \u2014 no severance or unemployment, because they were not technically employees.\u201cI worked for the oil industry, which is dead because of Hillary,\u201d Mr. Peterson said. Now, he said, he was \u201cconsidered nothing.\u201d He is worried about whether his son will find work; both friends fear that they may never get a job again.The friends were thrilled that Mr. Trump promised at the rally to bring the oil and gas industry back on his very first day in office. \u201cUnbelievably, that was exactly what we wanted to hear,\u201d Mr. Paslow said. \u201cOur hearts were uplifted.\u201dAdd to economic anxiety a spate of illness and disability. American men \u2014 particularly men without a college degree \u2014 are simply less healthy than women.Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton, recently conducted a study of working-age men. \u201cI came away thinking our biggest social problem is men,\u201d he said.A huge number are on painkillers, including 43.5 percent of men who have stopped looking for work. Both physical and emotional pain \u2014 sadness, stress and dissatisfaction with their lives \u2014 were particularly acute among men without college degrees, the unemployed and those not looking for work.Poor health makes it harder to work. Mr. Krueger found that 11.5 percent of men who were not employed cited illness and disability as a factor. Mr. Eberstadt\u2019s analysis found that nearly two-thirds of American households where men were not in the labor force reported receiving money from at least one disability program in 2013.American men are also far more likely than women to be in jail or to be convicted of a felony, compounding the difficulty of finding work. The government keeps almost no data on the 20 million men who are not in prison but have felony convictions. Mr. Eberstadt estimates that for men with a criminal record between 45 and 54, the odds of being out of the work force are 35 percent for white males and 40 percent for black males.A segment of American men feel under cultural as well as economic assault.Most economists, though, don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to go back to the days when manufacturing was king \u2014 and few women would want to give up economic or societal power, either. So what could help American men?Many of the policies aimed at spurring economic growth and supporting low-wage workers would assist American men without college educations in particular.Liberal economists tend to coalesce around other solutions, such as raising the minimum wage and expanding eligibility for the earned-income tax credit, a proven way to reduce poverty. Mr. Summers is one of many who would push the Federal Reserve to continue stimulating the economy to boost employment, rather than focusing on curbing inflation. He also argues for government subsidies to bolster the wages of less-skilled employees.Wage insurance could address the plight of men like Mr. Paslow; as Mr. Krueger explains it, payroll taxes could be used to make up some of the gap between the higher hourly wages earned in manufacturing and the lower wages more common in the service industry.Liberal and conservative economists agree on the failings of the education system and urge more focus on the school-to-work transition, since so many men without a college education are flailing.Apprenticeship systems and expanded access to community colleges \u2014 both ideas backed by President Obama \u2014 could help train workers for high-demand jobs without requiring four-year colleges, Mr. Cherlin said. But conservatives worry about the cost of subsidizing community colleges.Mr. Summers would like to see more government investment in areas with bad school systems, but conservatives prize local control.Re-examining the effects of mass incarceration \u2014 on black men in particular \u2014 and reconsidering mandatory sentences have attracted bipartisan support, though such efforts stalled in Congress. Mr. Summers calls for improving incarceration-to-work programs.While debate continues to rage about Obamacare, Mr. Krueger is convinced that expanding health insurance could provide American men with more preventive treatments and promote healthier lifestyles.Economically, \u201cwomen have adjusted better than men,\u201d Ms. Sawhill said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are winning.\u201d Women dominate the (often lower-paying) service jobs that are the backbone of the new economy. Men make up just 20 percent of elementary and middle-school teachers, 9 percent of nurses, 16 percent of personal aides and 6 percent of personal assistants, Ms. Sawhill and Mr. Reeves noted.Succeeding in the new economy and culture may well require rethinking conventional ideas about masculinity. Mr. Cherlin bemoans men\u2019s \u201ccontinued reluctance to take jobs they think are beneath the dignity of real men.\u201dFrom the conservative end of the spectrum, Mr. Eberstadt flags the disability system. He\u2019d like to see it redefined as a \u201cwork first\u201d program, much like welfare reform under Bill Clinton. He cites a Swedish program that ties disability benefits to showing up for job training and job placement.Mr. Eberstadt would also like to intensify social pressure on the cadre of men who have stopped looking for work. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we had the same sort of conversation about stigmatizing or shaming unworking men that we had 20 years ago about mothers on welfare?\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not idle; they had little kids.\u201dIf she wins, focusing on American men could pay off for Mrs. Clinton. She could shore up support with traditional Democratic voters such as African-American men. Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic Party have lost considerable ground with a constituency they used to own, blue-collar men. Angry white men are not likely to trust Mrs. Clinton, Beltway politicians or the political system. But they will need their help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Montana Bear Attack, Lessons on Hope, Survival and First Aid", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byA 50-year-old man was attacked by a bear in the wilderness of southwest Montana. Alone and injured, he walked \u2014 then drove \u2014 for miles to save himself.How did he do it?The man, Todd Orr, said he was scouting for elk in a mountainous valley on Sept. 30 when he was attacked twice by a female grizzly. Bleeding, stunned and suffering a cracked bone and deep gashes, Mr. Orr said he hiked through the woods for miles to reach his truck.While few people will encounter an angry bear in their lives, those in the business of first aid and extreme survival said his social media imprints invited general reflection: When someone finds themselves isolated, injured and bleeding, what should he or she do to survive the lonely trek in search of medical help?Dr. R. D. Marks, whose medical staff was the first to treat Mr. Orr, said the injured man came out of the woods on the morning after the attack and went to the Madison Valley Medical Center in the small city of Ennis, Mont., for help.\u201cHe just showed up at the door,\u201d Dr. Marks said on Thursday. \u201cI think he called ahead and said he was coming. By that time it was like his badge: \u2018I got bit by a grizzly bear and I got a story to tell.\u2019 \u201dMr. Orr, who builds custom knives for a living, was recovering from multiple surgeries and unable to return telephone messages, according to a statement on his website. But in Facebook posts published last weekend, he said he had been scouting elk in Madison Valley, in the Lee Metcalf Wilderness area.That is bear country, Mr. Orr wrote. He should know; he was raised in the area. Armed with a pistol and repellent spray, he made lots of noise so as not to surprise any bears, which can make them lash out.\u201cI hollered out, \u2018Hey, bear\u2019 about every 30 seconds,\u201d he wrote. But suddenly, on the trail ahead, he spotted a grizzly with cubs. She charged.A dose of repellent did nothing to slow her down. He hit the ground, face down, and she was on top of him, biting his arms, shoulders and backpack.\u201cThe force of each bite was like a sledgehammer with teeth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe would stop for a few seconds and then bite again. Over and over.\u201dThen the bear ambled away. Stunned and bleeding, Mr. Orr started back down the trail toward his truck, about a three-mile trek. He took stock of his injuries: mostly puncture wounds on his arms and shoulder. He did not want to pause to dress the wounds, he wrote, so he half-hiked, half-jogged toward what he thought was safety.So, Mr. Orr said, he played dead, lying motionless and silent as the bear bit his head, even as blood gushed into his eyes and face.\u201cI thought this was the end,\u201d he wrote.Finally, the animal stopped. She stood on his back. Without moving, he endured moments of terrifying intimacy as the animal sniffed him. He felt her breath on his neck, her claws digging into his back, smelled her \u201cpungent odor.\u201d Then she was gone.Somehow, Mr. Orr got to his feet. His pistol had been knocked out of reach. \u201cBut a quick assessment told me I could make it another 45 minutes to the truck without losing too much blood,\u201d he wrote. He took off along the trail. At the end of the path, he took photographs and the video.Panting, dry-mouthed and with streams of blood crisscrossing his face, Mr. Orr recorded his injuries as he spoke to the camera.\u201cShe got my head good,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is under my hat. My ear, my arm, pieces of stuff hanging out \u2014 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in there,\u201d he said, displaying his mangled arm.\u201cAnd then my shoulder she ripped up; I think my arm\u2019s broke. But legs are good. Internal organs are good. Eyes are good,\u201d he said.He got into the truck and drove, calling his girlfriend and 911, and asking a rancher along the way to telephone ahead for help. When Mr. Orr arrived at the medical center, Dr. Marks said, it was about 8 in the morning. Mr. Orr had driven six miles to reach a highway, and another 10 to get to the medical center, Dr. Marks estimated.\u201cPeople are kind of amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think about how terrible these things are, and some people do freak out, but most people go into survival mode, and you get crystal clear: \u2018Here is what I gotta do,\u2019 and they do it.\u201cYou take inventory and find everything is working \u2014 I am alive,\u201d he added.Mr. Orr said he had a five-inch gash above his ear and multiple bite marks for which he underwent several surgeries. Dr. Marks said Mr. Orr most likely stanched some of the heavy bleeding from his scalp wound by having his baseball cap pulled down over his head while on the trail.\u201cIt kind of pulled the edges together and controlled the bleeding, for the most part,\u201d Dr. Marks said. \u201cKind of like putting a pressure dressing on. I don\u2019t know if he thought about it that way.\u201dTod Schimelpfenig, the curriculum director at NOLS Wilderness Medicine, a Wyoming school for wilderness medicine education, said that Mr. Orr was lucky the bear did not bite into an artery, penetrate his chest or skull, or rip off a large hunk of flesh. That would have made the bleeding unmanageable alone (though had he had help, he could have contained it with an expertly placed tourniquet).For people who might find themselves in similar situations, Mr. Schimelpfenig said puncture wounds should be treated by applying direct pressure for up to five minutes. With multiple punctures, you must \u201cfigure out the worst one.\u201dX-rays showed that Mr. Orr had a cracked forearm bone, but on the trail he was apparently unhindered by it. A stabilizing splint could be fashioned with a shirt tail and a safety pin, Mr. Schimelpfenig said.Replenishing fluids is key, because you could lose blood while exerting yourself \u2014 as Mr. Orr was while walking while injured.Mr. Orr\u2019s presence of mind was notable. In the video, he demonstrated behavior common to extreme survivors. He was objective, giving a factual accounting of the parts of his body that still worked. He was accepting \u2014 admitting what he did not know, like the extent of his other wounds.In the Facebook post, Mr. Orr recalled that at one point he felt gratitude on the trail, saying he \u201cthanked God for getting me through\u201d the first attack. He grieved when the second attack occurred, then said he felt \u201cdouble lucky\u201d when he survived it.During the lonely trek out of the woods, in the dark, he continued to plan.He emphasized a connection with his fellow human beings, saying that after the attack, he had been concerned that other people might run into the bear.He imparted advice. \u201cBe safe out there,\u201d he said, his eyes darting around while he was still out in the open. \u201cBear spray doesn\u2019t always work. But it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dMost important for survival, Mr. Orr described focusing on living, Mr. Schimelpfenig observed.\u201cHe came up with a plan, he saw the future, he was happy with what he had: \u2018This is my reality; here is what I am going to do,\u2019 \u201d he said. \"He did not lie there and hope someone was going to find him.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Silence Goes Way Beyond Debate Moderators", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "But first, here are a few thoughts on this year\u2019s debates and climate change.Was that lack of such a pivot in this debate season\u00c2\u00a0an epic failure of the moderators?To those of us focused on climate risks and solutions, and science-based issues more generally, sure.The presidential debates, in theory, offer one of the few times when a prominent journalist can pivot\u00c2\u00a0from the heated real-time issues and buzzy talking points to pinning candidates down on tougher challenges that, mostly, lie over the horizon.That didn\u2019t happen this year. But it\u2019s too facile to point fingers. Here\u2019s why.\u00c2\u00a0The director of the program, Anthony Leiserowitz, was explaining how President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus on climate change in the past couple of years likely helped move global warming up a notch in public concern. He said Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpart of the reason why global warming is No. 6 on the priority list among liberal Democrats and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there before.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIf that\u2019s the case for the sector of society most worried about climate change, it gets harder to\u00c2\u00a0justify attacks on debate moderators for failing to squeeze it in, no matter what you or I think.In the end, climate change shares characteristics with other momentous issues humans tend to tuck away \u2014 mortality being an example. (Woody Allen is probably an exception on that front.)The figures are worrying. Dig deeper and it gets\u00c2\u00a0 even more\u00c2\u00a0 curious.My view is that the climate change community \u00c2\u00a0(a deliberately all-embracing term that encompasses politicians, policy makers, scientists and\u00c2\u00a0 campaign organizations) have all underestimated the critical importance of social conversations in generating change. Peer-to-peer conversations provide a vital signal to us about the issues that are important and the opinions that are socially required for us to hold. And the conversation itself provides us with the forum within\u00c2\u00a0 which we can then rehearse and negotiate our own views.Such conversations are the essential underpinning for political change. If people do not mention climate change with friends, they do not mention it to pollsters either, which is why climate change never appears on the regular polls of key voter issues and is sidelined in elections. Politicians see it as a risky and divisive issue which will yield few votes so they too avoid mentioning climate change.The news media in turn finds no place for this long-term crisis on a news agenda set by the daily political debates. \u00c2\u00a0As our colleagues at Yale and George Mason\u00c2\u00a0say, there is a spiral of silence which, like climate change, is built on positive feedbacks that amplify that silence further.However the reverse is equally true: that when people start to engage with an issue with \u00c2\u00a0friends and family and beyond, we could see an acceleration in attention as it becomes socially salient at all levels. This is why the Scottish government, now arguably the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most progressive government on climate change, has made conversations a core component of their engagement strategy.And it is not enough just to encourage people to talk: I believe we have to encourage people to recognize and name that silence, and to find the fire that can drive them to directly challenge it: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDamn\u00c2\u00a0 it all \u2014 \u00c2\u00a0this is important and I AM going to talk about it.\u201d \u00c2\u00a0For exactly these reasons the challenge of silence and the demand for visibility has long been a key component of social right campaigns- against racism, sexism, child abuse and campaigns for gay rights and marriage. There is much to learn from these struggles.These campaigns are strongly resonant with people of progressive, liberal and left wing values but I would stress that talking-out must be given a meaning that crosses the political spectrum. For people of faith, especially evangelicals, the principle of publicly living and witnessing your beliefs\u00e2\u0080\u0093 of not \u00e2\u0080\u009chiding your lamp under a bushel\u00e2\u0080\u009d as it says in the Matthew gospel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is a central\u00c2\u00a0 tenet of faith. \u00c2\u00a0And let us not forget that, even on this most politically polarized of issues, there are large numbers of conservatives who are deeply concerned about climate change and bravely hold onto this conviction despite the social pressure towards \u00e2\u0080\u009cstealth denial\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They are currently isolated and, polls find, hugely underestimate their own numbers. \u00c2\u00a0If they could only see how many others with their politics and worldview share their concern we might finally break the toxic political \u00c2\u00a0polarization that paralyses political action. And to do that we must name, challenge and break the silence.FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Activist for the Poor Joins Pepsi\u2019s Board. Is That Ethical?", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byRevaluedSo it seemed discordant to some critics when, this month, Mr. Walker joined the board of PepsiCo. Pepsi, after all, makes the bulk of its money by selling sugary drinks and fatty snacks. What\u2019s more, there is a well-established link between obesity and economic inequality. His new Pepsi connection raised the question: Would Mr. Walker\u2019s day job and his new board duties be working at cross-purposes?\u201cFor Darren, who\u2019s making his case as a reformer, making the case of real change, I don\u2019t know why he\u2019d do this,\u201d said Michael Edwards, a former Ford Foundation executive who now writes about philanthropy. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that he will be viewed as inconsistent.\u201dPepsi, it may be argued, isn\u2019t a bad company. In addition to soda and chips, Pepsi makes Quaker Oats oatmeal and Tropicana orange juice. Its chief executive, Indra Nooyi, acknowledges that consumer preferences are changing and is introducing healthier products.\u201cThey are saying they want these problems solved, while at the same time lobbying against public health legislation that would help solve these problems,\u201d said Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health and a co-writer of a recent paper on the soda industry. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same thing the tobacco companies did. It\u2019s exactly the same thing the alcohol companies are doing.\u201dAs Pepsi\u2019s newest board member, Mr. Walker is now accountable for all that Pepsi is doing \u2014 for its noble efforts to promote health, but also for its other activities. There does not appear to be a direct conflict of interest for Mr. Walker: The Ford Foundation, which provides about $500 million in grants annually, has not funded organizations working specifically to combat obesity or diabetes. But Mr. Walker acknowledged that colleagues have expressed skepticism about his work with Pepsi, and said he was sensitive to the optics.\u201cI know that my own credibility and the credibility of the Ford Foundation is tied to this decision,\u201d Mr. Walker said in an interview. \u201cThose of us in philanthropy have to be discerning about the corporate boards we join, and be discriminating to ensure that our service on a board is aligned with our values.\u201dBorn in a charity hospital in Louisiana and raised by a single mother in East Texas, Mr. Walker grew up gay in the Deep South. He became a lawyer and trader in Manhattan but, dissatisfied with Wall Street, he walked away from it and devoted himself to bettering the lives of poor blacks in Harlem before starting to work for big foundations.Mr. Walker said that as a Pepsi director, he planned to be as righteous in the corporate boardroom as he said he tries to be in his Ford Foundation office.\u201cI will bring my perspective as the leader of a social justice organization,\u201d he said. \u201cI will bring my perspective as someone who is deeply concerned about the welfare of people in poor and vulnerable communities.\u201dMs. Nooyi echoed these aspirations and said she sought out Mr. Walker precisely because of his reputation for speaking his mind.\u201cHe\u2019s outspoken, he\u2019s global, and he feels all these issues rather than just gives them lip service,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want people who give us trouble and ask tough questions. I saw in Darren someone who would hold us accountable.\u201dThese are lucrative posts. Pepsi directors make between $275,000 and $418,000 a year. (The Ford Foundation paid Mr. Walker $789,000 last year.)Some critics contend that such arrangements are simply ways for companies to neutralize potential detractors. \u201cThe best tactic is to bring your critics into the fold,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way of managing your reputation and softening your image.\u201dMr. Walker disputed this notion. \u201cI can assure you that I am not there for window dressing,\u201d he said.And Ms. Nooyi said that at Mr. Walker\u2019s first board meeting this month, he already had an impact. As she briefed the directors on plans to expand into an African country (she wouldn\u2019t say which one), she said Mr. Walker pushed her to emphasize a nutritious product lineup, rather than sugary beverages.\u201cHe was not shy and he gave us his point of view,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very principled person, and my goal in having Darren on the board is that he\u2019ll make us a better company.\u201dBut as hard as she and her directors may try to instill high-minded values throughout the company, Pepsi is still a for-profit corporation with a quarter of a million employees working to sell sugary, fatty snacks. At such a sprawling operation, some unsavory activity seems inevitable.\u201cThis is the way corporations operate,\u201d said Mr. Siegel of Boston University. \u201cPepsi is not in the business of public health; they\u2019re in the business of selling soda.\u201dMr. Walker made no apologies for Pepsi\u2019s transgressions in the past. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for or answer for what happened at Pepsi before I got there,\u201d he said.Instead, he said he wants to help Ms. Nooyi shape a company that sells fewer unhealthy snacks and that does more to improve the well-being and welfare of its customers.\u201cAs I join the board, what I\u2019m comfortable with is the long-term vision,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to helping this company transform itself.\u201dAlready, there are signs of transformation. A longtime fan of Diet Coke, Mr. Walker said his preferences had recently changed.\u201cMy favorite product is Diet Pepsi,\u201d he said at a Manhattan diner as he ate breakfast. \u201cI am, as we speak, consuming Quaker Oats oatmeal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "I was a medical student and political activist when the revolution against the Mubarak regime in Egypt broke out in 2011.  While studying in Alexandria, I assisted as a medic during clashes between demonstrators and government forces.  A few days before the fall of Mubarak, a young man was shot dead while standing between my friend Hesham and me. We could not save him.I went to Tahrir Square for the regime\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fall, then returned to my studies. I was arrested several times and beaten by the police before and after the revolution because of my continued activism.Today, I live in New York and work at a bagel store in Astoria.  Over the last two years, I have slept in more than a dozen places, mostly friends\u00e2\u0080\u0099 apartments, although on rare occasions even on the subway or in a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s car, as I shuffled through one menial job after another.   Many of my friends who were active in the Egyptian revolution are living similar lives in the United States. I have documented their stories with my phone.I remember clearly the day I arrived in the United States: It was midnight on Oct. 15, 2014. It was raining and I loved the calmness that enveloped me. I stayed at a friend of a friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place in Flushing, Queens. I came here to visit friends, save money, go to Europe and finish my studies. I soon went to work at a store in Virginia selling T-shirts, putting in 72 hours a week at $8 an hour. Converting the numbers in my head made me rich in Egyptian pounds. I had nothing to lose, and a good amount of money to gain, so my days blurred into each other as my savings grew.  By then, I no longer found any hope in returning to Egypt after the coup. My revolutionary dreams and aspirations seemed childish compared to my newly found practicality and realism. Then I received a phone call from my family telling me not to come back to Egypt: An old politically motivated court case had been reopened, and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t safe to return. Now, in a small store in Virginia, I was utterly alone. My carefully planned life no longer made sense. The stench of a failed revolution clung to me like an unwanted relative. No revolution saved me and no democracy protected me. My low-wage safety net ended when the store\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lease expired. I shuffled on to the next odd job. I moved to Roanoke, Va., to live with some high school friends. Fawzy had been a pharmacist and medical rep at a multinational drug company in Cairo. Khaled had been a dental student who was passionate about philosophy, art and music. (Although he had hoped to be a professor here, he now delivers pizzas in Philadelphia.) During this time, I began to recognize our parallel narratives, the endless connections that tied us together. I wasn\u2019t alone in my despair, sharing their pains, fears, nostalgia and dreams. As members of the generation of change, we all shared the same great disappointment. We were tied together by a thread that danced across the Atlantic, mixing our old passions and youthful conversations with the grim reality of our present. At nights, the mask of this new world came off, and in the after-work darkness we briefly felt like victorious revolutionaries. Free.But every morning reminded us of reality, a new day with the same old fears. Endless questions ran through our heads as we went about our routines. I remember everyone\u2019s face in the morning before going to work. This mundane cycle made me fear that I was losing sight of my own ambition to be a photographer and filmmaker. I owed it to myself to never let this illusory American dream drain me of my spirit. I packed my bags and moved to New York City. I called my friend Hesham to say I was coming to the city in a few days and asked if he could help me find a job and a place to stay. Hesham, then 25, had graduated from medical school and was a general practitioner when he left Egypt in July 2015. When I arrived to New York, he was working two jobs, delivering bread to coffee vendors around the city from midnight until 6 a.m., then working as a physical therapy aide during the day. My friend the doctor was living his American dream. I bounced between housing and jobs until a friend, Shaaban, a former environmental science student in Egypt and Italy, joined us. He ended up as a deliveryman for an Egyptian restaurant in Astoria. My story is their story. So I photographed them and others like us, including a few I knew, mostly from high school. They seemed happy, but they were changing, psychologically, like me. I became despondent shuttling between temporary beds and odd jobs while applying to colleges, where my Egyptian education and legal situation made admission difficult. My self-portraits show different versions of me. The difficulties I endured show on my face. But I knew that I would be a photographer and that these images would one day mean something to me. In some ways, this is a typical immigrant story. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also about the unrealized Egyptian revolution. And this phase of the uprising also needs to be documented. People keep focusing on what happens in Egypt. But the youths who started the revolution with great hope now live in exile, reduced to washing dishes and delivering food. In October of last year I met Hadiya, an amazing, smart and strong young Arab-American. She writes poetry, is a committed feminist and is devoted to helping refugees in the United States and around the world. We recently became engaged to get married. While photographing this, I was often unemployed and ran out of money.

{"Headline": "Why Are Americans So Anxious?", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The first day I arrived in Paris for my semester abroad I smiled at all the helpful strangers: the passport agent, the taxi driver, the random person I asked for directions. No one smiled back but I must have been too excited to notice. Then I smiled at the guy at the cash register who sold me some bubble gum and he muttered something. It took a minute to absorb his words, although he was speaking in mocking, accented English: \u201cStupid American.\u201dI had largely forgotten that slap in the face until I read Ruth Whippman\u2019s new book, \u201cAmerica the Anxious: How Our Pursuit of Happiness Is Creating a Nation of Nervous Wrecks.\u201d For us natives, reading this book can be an unnerving experience. Whippman, who is a transplanted British writer, moved to California when her husband got a job here. She spent much of her time settling in her family, but all the while she was watching us \u2014 how we read, eat, work, medicate, exercise and pray. And what she noticed the most was how the same subject comes up all the time: happiness.The gynecologist \u2014 mid-exam \u2014 chats with her about Gretchen Rubin\u2019s best seller, \u201cHappier at Home.\u201d Her new friend Allison is so busy self-actualizing that she has no time to hang out. At the playground, the mantra of mellow parenting is \u201cI don\u2019t care, as long as he\u2019s happy.\u201d Whippman notices after a while that her reflexively sardonic British brain is suddenly looping around a new set of questions: Am I happy? Right at this moment? What about now? And now? Am I happy enough? As happy as everyone else? What about Meghan? Is she happier than me?Tuning into this alien internal monologue reveals her grand thesis about America: The problem with our quest for happiness is that, apparently, it\u2019s making us miserable. After some idle Googling, her suspicions are confirmed. Various clever studies by psychologists at the University of California, Berkeley, show that \u201cparadoxically, the more people valued and were encouraged to value happiness as a separate life goal, the less happy they were.\u201d When it comes to emotional temperament, America is the clumsy suitor of nations. We yearn and obsess and plot new elaborate strategies as the object of our desire shrinks ever farther away. It\u2019s a little embarrassing.Whippman\u2019s book is not a scathing social critique. For that we have Barbara Ehrenreich\u2019s 2009 \u201cBright-Sided,\u201d a rigorous dissection of American \u201cpositive thinking.\u201d Instead it\u2019s more like a travelogue narrated by a curious, funny and highly motivated guide. Once she\u2019s acquired her filter, Whippman ventures out and applies it to various corners of American life: the business world, parenting culture, religious communities, social media. Each discrete adventure doesn\u2019t really turn up anything new or profound \u2014 it\u2019s not the first time, for example, I\u2019ve read that your cheery vacation pictures on Facebook are making the rest of us anxious. But put together, the snapshots add up to an uncomfortable picture of American life.My favorite chapter is Whippman\u2019s visit to Zappos, the online shoe and clothing shop run by the \u201chigh-profile happiness evangelist\u201d Tony Hsieh. For Whippman\u2019s purposes Zappos is the perfect microcosm of the American paradox: a place stocked with life coaches and colorful balloons and ever inventive examples of \u201ccorporate fungineering.\u201d Whippman has a weird email exchange with Hsieh in which he uses lots of exclamation points and refers to the \u201cholacracy\u201d and \u201cbrand aura\u201d (she doesn\u2019t know and neither do I). But he declines to meet with her because he doesn\u2019t prioritize people he feels \u201cdrained by after I interact with them,\u201d he writes.Instead, Whippman visits the Downtown Project, the 60 acres near Las Vegas that Hsieh aimed to turn into \u201cone big party\u201d with no distinctions between \u201cworking and playing.\u201d I knew where this chapter was going because it\u2019s been well covered, but I was satisfied to follow Whippman as she discovered it for herself. As she soon learns, in 2013 a few of the tech entrepreneurs who had moved there, subjected themselves to endless happiness reviews and set happiness goals every day, died by suicide. One of them, Ovik Banerjee, a 24-year-old administrator for Hsieh\u2019s project, was known for starting his daily blog posts with inspirational sayings: \u201cIf you aren\u2019t scared, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u201dWhippman could have marinated a few more years in American culture before passing judgment. She seems to have trouble, for example, distinguishing between what\u2019s fringe and what\u2019s mainstream. An early chapter on the self-help industry uses Landmark Education as its central example, although Landmark has complicated roots and isn\u2019t as ubiquitous as other such operations. Her chapter on a Mormon community employs the typical European approach of treating religious Americans as exotic zoo animals (although I was surprised to learn that Mormon Utah has the country\u2019s highest rate of antidepressant use).In the end, Whippman\u2019s own cheery nature gets in the way of a decisive critique. Yes, she successfully dismantles some of the popular happiness studies. And she convinces us that the American emphasis on personal happiness takes the pressure off, say, the social welfare system to actually help people better their lives. But emotionally she seems pretty delighted to be living in America, with all the upbeat moms and spirited toddlers and oversharing small talk. Or at the very least she doesn\u2019t seem eager to get back to the U.K., where the moms compete over who is most bitter.As a result the book reads like a first draft of anthropology, early field notes on the American emotional landscape. The observations are somewhat dashed off but useful in their honesty and immediacy. It\u2019s always good to hear what outsiders have to say. If I had written a book after my year in France, it would have read much like Whippman\u2019s but in reverse: Frenchmen are not all that friendly with people they don\u2019t know. In fact, they seem boringly contented, seeing the same friends they saw in childhood, eating the same food, wearing the same collared shirts tucked in the same way. They are not constantly striving for happiness because they are not constantly striving for much of anything, beyond what they already know. There\u2019d be some truth in what I wrote, but not a deep truth. A Frenchman would read it, bristle, and dismiss me as a stupid American.Hanna Rosin is co-host of the NPR show \u201cInvisibilia,\u201d and the author of \u201cThe End of Men: And the Rise of Women.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Not a Regular Day\u2019: What a Trump Rally Clash Reveals About a Divided Nation", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "The rally where these two lives collided by happenstance erupted into one of the most violent episodes of this contentious presidential election. Video footage of protesters punching, egging and tackling Trump supporters went viral, sparking outrage among Republicans and soul-searching among Democrats.Today, the clashes between ordinary people like Mr. McBride and Mr. Tong are playing out in the California courts, in a series of criminal prosecutions brought about as Republican officials accused a city led by Democrats of failing to protect Trump supporters at the rally.The San Jose rally and its aftermath may be the most powerful illustrations of the dangerous polarization that has gripped the country during the 2016 election.But a closer look at Mr. Tong, one of rally\u2019s 24 victims, and Mr. McBride, one of 22 people charged with crimes after the event, suggests that there is much that the two men share. The economic struggles and personal dreams that guided them that day are not so different, after all.On June 2, Mr. Tong woke up in his parents\u2019 house, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.He is 46, an age he does not like saying out loud because it reminds him how far he is from where he had hoped to be. He had dreamed of becoming a product designer and starting his own company. But art school was too expensive and he left after only a year.\u201cCompanies like Facebook and these so-called social networking companies here in Silicon Valley became the economy,\u201d he said.\u201cIf your occupation is in anything other than that,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are not a whole lot of jobs.\u201dMr. Tong\u2019s faith in the American Dream has been shaken. But that day, he had a ticket to see Mr. Trump speak about making America great again. Despite the sweltering heat, Mr. Tong parked in the garage at the San Jose Convention Center and walked a few blocks to the rally.That same morning, Anthony McBride, who is anti-Trump, woke up in his friend\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.He is 21, too young to carry the stain of life\u2019s disappointments. He dreams of being a fashion designer and starting his own company. But art school is too expensive. He works two jobs \u2014 at a car dealership and a clothing store \u2014 to save for it.He also designs shirts that read \u201cBE YRSLF.\u201dHe hopes they will inspire \u201ca movement where people are just being themselves and are not following trends or what society says they have to be,\u201d he said.Mr. McBride\u2019s faith in the American Dream remains intact, but it is marred by the bigotry that he sees as a product of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. On the morning of the rally, Mr. McBride put on a \u201cBE YRSLF\u201d T-shirt and boarded the light rail to the convention center, eager to see for himself what a Trump event was really like.\u201cIt was hot that day,\u201d Mr. Tong recalled. \u201cI was still debating whether or not I wanted to go, and I just kind of thought, \u2018Oh, I got to show my support.\u2019\u201dIn the convention hall, Mr. Tong delighted in the diverse makeup of the crowd.\u201cI was really surprised,\u201d he said. A rally he had attended earlier in the spring in Southern California, he said, \u201cwas mostly Caucasian and middle-aged.\u201d But in San Jose, a city that is about 30 percent Asian and 30 percent Hispanic, more minorities turned out.Outside the hall, beyond the police barricades, protesters waved signs demanding socialism. Young men handed out the Revolutionary Communist Party\u2019s newspaper.Like many Asians in San Jose, Mr. Tong was born in Vietnam. He was 4 when Communists captured Saigon.His family had three strikes against it: His father had worked with the United States military. His grandfather had an import-export business. And they hailed from China, a country that once colonized Vietnam. Officials forced Mr. Tong\u2019s family to move to a remote hut with a dirt floor.\u201cThe Communist philosophy was, \u2018If you are a teacher, a professor, an intellectual, wealthy, then we are going to make you suffer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tong said.When he was 9, his family made it to California. Like others who had fled Vietnam, they embraced the Republican Party\u2019s strong anticommunism stance.Mr. Tong considers himself a moderate. During the booming 1990s, he once cast a ballot for Bill Clinton. He says he does not agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about immigrants and Mexicans.Still, Mr. Tong feels anxious about the racial unrest flaring up across the country. Like many Trump supporters, he blames President Obama.\u201cHe seems more polarizing,\u201d Mr. Tong said of Mr. Obama. \u201cHe stirs people up.\u201dMr. Tong once felt boundless optimism about the United States. His parents, who worked entry-level jobs in electronics, had been able to buy a three-bedroom home in a well-off San Jose suburb. But now Mr. Tong cannot afford to rent \u2014 let alone buy \u2014 a home of his own. He was drawn to the June rally by Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to make America as strong as it was when Mr. Tong arrived in the country.Mr. Trump took the stage and declared, \u201cWe have a country that\u2019s not working anymore.\u201d\u201cWe have a chance to be greater than ever before,\u201d he told the crowd.Mr. Tong left the rally clutching a sign: \u201cThe silent majority stands with Trump.\u201dHe meandered back to his car, chatting with a teenager from Mexico who held a sign opposing Trump. They joked about trading signs. Nothing seemed threatening or out of the ordinary. But when Mr. Tong reached the parking garage, he witnessed something shocking: protesters trying to steal Trump hats off the heads of an older Hispanic couple.He added: \u201cAt that moment, I felt the whole crowd surrounding me. You\u2019re fearing for your life.\u201dMr. Tong ran into the garage. He noticed a tall black man coming behind him.It was Mr. McBride\u2019s day off, he recalled. \u201cI slept in, watched some TV,\u201d he said.While checking Twitter, he noticed that Mr. Trump was coming to town.Mr. McBride hoped to get into the rally \u201cto go experience what he says for myself,\u201d he said. But a wall of police officers blocked the entrance. So he drifted to the \u201cfree speech\u201d area, where protesters \u2014 including some friends from Oak Grove, where he had gone to high school \u2014 gathered. Mr. McBride had fond memories of Oak Grove, even though he was asked to leave it.In his senior year, he had attended a basketball game against a suburban school from a more affluent community. Rival fans chanted that Oak Grove students were on welfare. Mr. McBride said he and his friends responded with their own chant, \u201cWe drive sober\u201d \u2014 a painful reference to a drunken-driving death the rival school had recently suffered. Afterward, Mr. McBride said, school authorities asked him to finish his credits with independent study. (The school\u2019s principal declined to comment.)At the time, Mr. McBride lived with his aunt, who told him he had to be in school to stay with her. He ended up on the couch in the apartment of his best friend\u2019s mother. Three years later, he is still there.Mr. McBride considers himself a moderate. He opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He believes that the entrepreneurial spirit should be rewarded.But it is racism \u2014 not government regulation of the economy \u2014 that worries him. The son of an African-American father and an Irish mother he has not seen since he was 4, Mr. McBride blames the recent racial unrest on injustice, not Democratic politicians.\u201cPeople are just frustrated,\u201d he said. \u201cWith police brutality. With feeling not equal to white people.\u201dTo Mr. McBride\u2019s generation, the spate of high-profile police killings of black people shows the limits of politics and the need for activism. Protests \u2014 not the election of a black president \u2014 have brought a modicum of justice.Joining the gathering crowd outside the convention center, Mr. McBride felt he had justice on his side.At first, he said, it felt like a carnival outside the arena. People danced to Mexican music. Street vendors sold watermelon.But then the rally inside ended. Trump supporters poured out. Protesters chanted obscenities at them. They hurled insults back.A blonde woman named Rachel Casey, who was wearing a Trump shirt, filmed herself sticking her middle finger up at the crowd. Protesters traded insults with her as she drifted past the police barricades to the Marriott Hotel next door. Protesters surrounded her in the doorway.Then someone threw a piece of watermelon.\u201cI was in the front, just clapping,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cSomeone in the back started throwing eggs. One of them hit me. I was like, \u2018Wow, who brought eggs?\u2019\u201dA hotel security guard opened the door and Ms. Casey slipped inside. The crowd marched on. A black female protester burning an American flag got into a shoving match with a white female Trump supporter. A white teenager got scared and started running. A black teenager tackled him. A first-generation Mexican who opposes Mr. Trump punched in the nose a third-generation Mexican who supports the candidate.The police later traced the most violent run-ins to \u201clocal gangsters\u201d with long criminal records, according to Sgt. Brian Anderson, who headed the San Jose police team that pored over thousands of hours of videos from the rally.Some Oak Grove High School students were also charged. \u201cSeveral of them were good students and athletes, but they decided to forget their upbringing,\u201d Sergeant Anderson said.Mr. McBride might have fit into in that category. He was an athlete, but he said his father, who works at a warehouse, allowed him to play sports only if he got good grades.But Mr. McBride admits that he got angry that day at the rally. He says Trump supporters mistook him for Mexican and shouted insults at him.\u201cI heard, \u2018Go back to your country, wetback,\u2019\u201d he said. He started taking every Trump sign he saw and ripping it in half.He followed a wave of protesters into a parking garage. That\u2019s where he spotted an Asian man with a Trump sign.\u201cI was kind of disappointed in him,\u201d Mr. McBride recalled. \u201cHe\u2019s a minority, and I didn\u2019t see why he\u2019s supporting Trump.\u201dMr. McBride snatched Mr. Tong\u2019s sign. Mr. Tong grabbed it back. For a split second, they held it together, in a tug of war. Mr. McBride could see the fear in Mr. Tong\u2019s eyes.Months later, Mr. Tong looked back at the encounter and wondered about Mr. McBride. Was he a college student?\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem like a gangster,\u201d Mr. Tong recalled. \u201cThere are protesters who are just upset, and I think if I was in their position, I\u2019d be upset, too. But no protester \u2014 no matter how angry they are \u2014 can break things and harass people.\u201dMaybe because of the stress of what happened to him at the rally, Mr. Tong dreams of escaping on Election Day. He thinks about camping in Death Valley on Nov. 8 just so he can get away from the news. But sometimes he has the opposite desire. He wants to visit an old friend \u2014 a black man he met in a long-ago photography class \u2014 so they can have political debates about Mr. Obama that he keeps bottled up inside.Meanwhile, Mr. McBride thinks back on that moment and regrets being the source of Mr. Tong\u2019s fear.\u201cI\u2019d probably have been afraid, too,\u201d Mr. McBride said. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with any of the fighting.\u201dBut two weeks after the rally, police officers showed up at Mr. McBride\u2019s job at the mall and asked him to answer some questions. Mr. McBride, who has no criminal record, cooperated. He did not ask for a lawyer. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared because I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said.He said he told them everything he could remember. Afterward, he expected to be allowed to go home. Instead, they handcuffed him and took him to jail, where he remained for six days, accused of vandalism, battery and the attempted theft of Mr. Tong\u2019s sign.On a recent Wednesday, Mr. McBride sat in court on a row of benches filled with black and Hispanic men, nearly all of them represented by a single public defender.\u201cMcBride? You\u2019re our Trump guy, right?\u201d she asked.She explained that because of what he had told the police about the confrontation outside the rally, prosecutors were adding a new charge: the false imprisonment of Ms. Casey, who had been egged.\u201cWe\u2019ll try to get it down to \u2018disturbing the peace,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get there, but that\u2019s our goal.\u201dNow Mr. McBride, who cannot afford a lawyer, is not sure if he should plead guilty to a crime he doesn\u2019t feel he committed, or fight the charges. He thinks about that moment when he grabbed Mr. Tong\u2019s sign, and about what made him let it go.\u201cI realized it was stupid,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIf it was on a different street, at a different time, I probably would have just talked to him about why he was supporting Trump. But it was not a regular day.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s 4-Year Odyssey With the 6-Second Video App Vine", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byEarly use skyrocketed, and it looked like Mr. Dorsey\u2019s $30 million dollar bet on the tiny start-up was going to pay off.The rapid ascent \u2014 and even steeper decline \u2014 of Vine is a reminder of a Silicon Valley axiom: Being first to a trend rarely means you will win. And when a little company with a good idea gets acquired, more often than not, what made the little guys worth buying gets lost in the shuffle.\u201cI think like any big company swooping in, the acquisition was a kind of blessing and a curse,\u201d said Ry Doon, one of Vine\u2019s earliest stars. \u201cTwitter made Vine huge, then Twitter put Vine on the back burner \u2014 and now, Twitter is shutting it down.\u201dIn 2012, video on smartphones was a fairly new idea, and a scary one for people worried about burning through the data limits on their cellphone plans. Vine avoided the problem by setting a six-second limit \u2014 long enough to create little narratives more interesting than a single photo but short enough to not devour data.Mr. Dorsey, who is now Twitter\u2019s chief executive, spotted an opportunity in Vine after he was introduced to it by an acquaintance in the venture capital community. Eight months earlier, archrival Facebook had outmaneuvered Twitter by acquiring the up-and-coming photo-sharing app Instagram. Vine could offer a way to leap past Instagram\u2019s static photos.The Vine stars, people who took to the app\u2019s six-second looping constraints and used them in unique ways, became internet staples.But in June 2013, Instagram introduced video to its app, allowing users to record up to 15 seconds. It was an instant threat \u2014 Instagram\u2019s network was 10 times the size of Vine\u2019s.Nine former employees and executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to publicly discuss the company, said the impact of Instagram video was felt right away.Users who already posted photos on Instagram found it easier to stay in that app to post videos, too, instead of using Vine. And Instagram users already had their social connections with other users. If they went to Vine, they\u2019d have to start all over again.The leadership at Vine tried to rally the troops, according to the former employees. Driven by the prospect of fighting a copycat competitor, Vine\u2019s employees created more tools like importing video and better editing features. More features, the idea went, could mean the creation of more popular Vines, which could in turn bring in more users.Other leaders came and left. Colin Kroll, a co-founder and former chief technical officer, was temporarily in charge before Jason Toff, a former Google employee, took over as general manager. Mr. Toff left roughly a year later to go back to Google to work on virtual reality projects.And, as often happens at start-ups, Vine employees balked when they were asked to move to Twitter\u2019s office in New York. Yet many did it anyway.Leadership turnover, not surprisingly, slowed product development, four employees said, and Vine quickly fell behind the fresher features of its competitors, like some of Instagram\u2019s GIF-like animated photos and trademark filters.Vine stars also left for more lucrative opportunities at Instagram, which began paying social media celebrities to post to its platform, and for other competitors like Snapchat. Vine and Twitter, which never paid users and did not have Facebook\u2019s deep reservoir of cash, could not compete.While Niche worked across all platforms like Instagram and YouTube, it was also a chance to make Vine into a moneymaking business for the first time.Unfortunately for Vine, the attrition in talent meant that there were fewer Vine stars who needed to cut deals, and most of Niche\u2019s talent brokering went to other platforms, like Instagram. While Niche still operates inside of Twitter, it could do little to help Vine.In the end, Vine proved too expensive to keep running. The app was costing about $10 million a month for infrastructure and employees, according to two former employees. When Twitter began to take stock of its business and decide which assets to trim down, the Vine was at the top of the list.Twitter, which has attempted to find a buyer for itself in recent months, will cease support for Vine in the coming months. Previously uploaded Vine content will still be available online.After Twitter\u2019s announcement, former executives and employees were sentimental about the company\u2019s rise and fall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Who knows what motivates anyone? For a fledgling photographer like Zachary Tyler Roberts, it was \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at first \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a desire to reconnect with his creative roots after years making money and drinks tending bars at trendy spots in New York and Stockholm.  A little over a year ago, he returned to his childhood home in Lancaster County, Pa., to document the lives of his family and the Amish who live nearby.As ghastly as that was, what followed was just as incomprehensible to many: The area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Amish families, wracked by unspeakable grief, embraced the Robertses. Forgiveness was a given \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hard as it might be \u00e2\u0080\u0094 demanded by their faith. Zach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, Terri, became friendly with the family of one of the surviving victims, visiting them often. And when Terri Roberts\u2019s cancer returned not long ago, some of the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Amish families came to her aid.This is the world that Zach Roberts, 38, has been photographing for a little over a year. He is not making pictures of the Amish families directly affected by the tragedy, but has been documenting the rhythms of daily life in the area. Yet it is clear to him that his images are a way of coming to terms with issues \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be it violence or forgiveness \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that have haunted him for the last decade.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are these people, what is their area and how do they live?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zach Roberts said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the back story, all this became interesting: my brother, my family, cancer, how does the family survive and stay intact? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I have any great answers, but I felt all these things were connected.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor someone who just started making pictures, his images betray a probing eye. That is no accident: He had studied filmmaking in his 20s and admits it had a big influence on him. But although he dabbled in the medium, he left it to pursue more regular and better-paying work as a bartender in New York. He met a Swedish woman, moved to Stockholm and had two children. A few years ago, he returned to New York to get ideas for opening a New York-style bar in Stockholm. After a few months, he had had enough and was bored and looking to do something totally different. He needed a creative outlet.Filmmaking, he thought, was too complicated. Photography struck him as something more accessible, especially as it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require a crew. He started taking pictures around Stockholm.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really passionate about taking pictures of buildings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen my mom got the bad news again that her cancer had returned. The docs basically gave her six months; that was in October of last year. We talked, and she was weak. So I was like, if this is going to be it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to come back and be with her, Dad and the family.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOf course, he brought his camera.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile I was sitting around, I had to have something to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI started taking pictures in Lancaster County, my family and the Amish. It took a while to find my mark.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe had returned to the area fully aware that the 10th anniversary of the shootings was near. When the tragedy happened, he had thought his ties to the area would be erased: He thought his parents would have to move away. Instead, the forgiveness that captured the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention made it possible not just for them to stay, but also to forge new ties.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was pretty remarkable of the Amish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zach Roberts said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is their nature. Forgiveness is obviously something that takes years to fulfill, but their act says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reach out to you and not hold anything against you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhen his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cancer returned, she resumed a raw-food diet that had helped her during her previous bout. This time some Amish women would visit and drop off natural foods. Today, she has outlived her cancer prognosis, enjoying \u00e2\u0080\u009ca quality life one day at a time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zach Roberts said. He has since returned to Stockholm.The images he has made of the Amish are not of the families directly affected by the murders. Mr. Roberts knew the local Amish \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as well as other communities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were averse to being photographed, so he limited his picture taking of their community to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmud sales\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 auctions with food and livestock sales that attracted tourists and media, including many professional photographers. He felt in that amid that throng of people it was okay for him \u00e2\u0080\u0093 using a small rangefinder camera \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to take pictures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn reality, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there are any absolute truths about what is acceptable and not in a given situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Roberts said in a follow-up email after readers raised the issue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to use your intuition.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe added that, for him, how he intended to use the pictures also mattered: they were his way of coming to terms with his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crime, and keeping alive the story of forgiveness that followed. He understands some people may still fault him.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people who gain some insight or feel moved, that\u2019s who I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m targeting and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what makes this all worthwhile,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis whole ordeal stemming from the actions of my brother have ravaged so much, too much at times to comprehend. My journey is my own.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIndeed, it was at one of those mud sales where he made one image \u2013 of five girls \u2013 that holds special meaning.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is one image where you can almost see the faces of all these girls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, a reference to Slide 7. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how old they are, but they could be the age of what those five girls would be today. In a way, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of looking at me. They could be alive today. It represents to me five girls who were taken away.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIt is, he admits, a very personal image and connection."}

AT&T\u2019s shareholders did not seem too thrilled either \u2014 its shares were off nearly 2 percent.The question for the market is whether it makes sense for a cable and wireless provider to spend all of that money to acquire the home of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros.On a conference call with analysts on Monday, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, and his Time Warner counterpart, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, sought to address some of their biggest criticisms:During the hourlong call, a form of the word \u201cinnovate\u201d was used 32 times. The two chief executives believe combining their companies will help them innovate around advertising, the shows and movies people watch and where they watch them (hint: on their cellphones).Innovation, of course is not a strategy. It is something that every top executive is focused on, with or without a deal.There is one aspect to this deal that could help the two companies foster such innovation: data. AT&T has access to 133 million mobile subscribers, as well as 25 million for video. Owning the content that its users are watching will give the company better insight on how to focus on their customers through both programming and advertising, the executives argued.One analyst asked why the combination of cable and content made sense now, despite Mr. Bewkes\u2019s decision to spin off Time Warner Cable in 2009. Mr. Bewkes responded by saying, \u201cThe world has changed,\u201d citing new competition from companies like Netflix, Google, Facebook and Amazon.Over the weekend, politicians from across the political spectrum came out against the deal. Both Democrats and Republicans argued that too much consolidation between telecommunications and media could only be bad for consumers.On the call, Mr. Bewkes argued that consumers would not feel the effect of this transaction, that the cost would be \u201cborne by advertisers and consumers get a break.\u201dWhen asked about what gave him comfort on the regulatory approval process, Mr. Stephenson joked, \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but once Time Warner closes, I\u2019ll play one on TV.\u201dHis non-lawyerly take, however, focused on the fact that the companies are proposing a vertical merger. Most of the pushback lately from the Justice Department has been on companies that were taking out competitors. Because Time Warner supplies programming for AT&T, their deal would not get that same type of scrutiny.\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not sure I know of a situation where vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our two sectors,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Vertical integration may help the two companies on the regulatory front, but it does not get them far from a cost-savings standpoint. The companies pegged so-called synergies at $1 billion in annual run rate, within three years of the deal closing.That figure is small for a deal this size because there is little duplication by which to cut costs. The customer service representatives at AT&T cannot also anchor the news on CNN, for example.Analysts have been dubious of AT&T\u2019s ability to integrate another huge acquisition after closing on a $48.5 billion takeover of DirecTV last year. Why do another large acquisition now, they asked? Mr. Stephenson said that AT&T was ahead of schedule in achieving cost synergies from the DirecTV deal and that \u201cthe convergence of media and distribution is moving fast.\u201d\u201cWe want to be at the front of it. We don\u2019t want to be chasing it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Crunch.That is the noise of water bottle flipping \u2014 the compulsion promoted through online videos to toss a partly filled plastic bottle and try to get it to land upright \u2014 which has captivated children across the country.Boys and girls view it as a harmless pastime, but for parents the repetitive noise of the children flipping (gurgle), landing (thud) and grabbing (crunch) the bottles is torture.Dayle Tuna, 40, of Rockaway, N.J., described a refrain directed at one of her sons: \u201cWould you stop with the bottles?

Ms. Tuna said she was unaware of the online videos and thought the activity was something her sons cooked up.\u201cI\u2019m going to need a bottle of Xanax to deal with the bottle crunching,\u201d said Ms. Tuna, who has five children, four of whom are living at home: three boys, ages 10, 12 and 13, and an 11-year-old daughter.

Just look at Twitter and the company formerly known as Snapchat.In Silicon Valley, if you are not a hero, you are a loser. And this all-or-nothing narrative is driving the fates of companies beyond all reasonable expectations.For one, the reports of the Salesforce negotiations come on the heels of reports that others, including Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company; the Walt Disney Company; and possibly even Microsoft had taken a look at Twitter and decided to pass. All of this reduces whatever leverage the micromessaging service, which has a market value of more than $12 billion, might have possessed before the frenzy of deal speculation began.Salesforce, meanwhile, is stuck in a situation similar to the one Microsoft found itself in when it tried to acquire Yahoo in 2008, with its bidding conducted more or less on a public stage and its own shareholders protesting.As a result, Salesforce will have to show its shareholders that any deal is a good one for the company, and this will come at the expense of Twitter. And if Salesforce subsequently walks away from the discussions, a broken deal will leave Twitter with the label of damaged goods.Any way you look at it, it\u2019s not a great place to be for Twitter.Revenue growth may be on track, increasing about 20 percent in the quarter ending June 30 over the same period of last year, but it is the user growth numbers that have put Twitter into the loser category.It\u2019s the secret sauce of internet valuations. Revenue and earnings are forgiven if you can show growth in users. Whether that makes sense, of course, is another matter.It does explain the puzzle of why Twitter struggles to sell itself and LinkedIn goes for a huge premium. In short, the story line isn\u2019t clean at Twitter, and the growth is not phenomenal. Even though by some metrics Twitter is worth more, it has failed to adequately find a way to make money from its user base. Other Twitter properties like Vine are also struggling with no or low growth.Still, the gloom around Twitter seems overblown. Twitter is an important part of the internet, and even Yahoo found a buyer willing to pay $4.8 billion despite being in slow-motion collapse. A figure twice that high for Twitter would seem to be a bargain. And remember that Facebook faced issues after its initial public offering, but was able to find solid footing in mobile.Sharp leadership \u2014 whether that is from its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, or new blood \u2014 could certainly help Twitter exploit its huge user base.But the problem is that in the eyes of the Valley, Twitter has lost its mojo.A $25 billion valuation would be about 25 times its projected 2017 revenue. In comparison, Facebook went public in 2012 at 19 times revenue, which at the time was considered a rich valuation.It\u2019s easy to be skeptical about such a rock star valuation. Snap lives and dies on the fickle under-30 crowd. At any time, the youth of the world may turn to another product. (WhatsApp appears to be increasingly popular among the tween crowd, for example.) And Snap has no pretensions of being useful or changing the world. It is simply about having fun. So Snap has quite a few risk factors beyond those of Facebook.There are, however, only a few big social media companies left. The rest have been bought up by Google, Microsoft and the like. And Snap has the growth.The question is whether Snap can sustain its messaging business and turn into another Facebook or Google, justifying that $25 billion valuation. So far, Snap has worked hard to keep its product nimble and updated, and it has retained users.The start-up might have just gotten lucky with its messaging product, but there is a clearly a belief at the moment that its co-founder and chief executive, Evan Spiegel, can be a visionary like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and push successfully into new products.Momentum can mint money in Silicon Valley, but you have to sustain it. Snap, if it manages the public offering process right and isn\u2019t too headstrong with the markets, may get the valuation it seeks.Yet the fickle gods of Silicon Valley will turn if the company can\u2019t sustain its growth story. You can debate whether maybe it might be better to question that potential at the public offering stage, but then people will point to Google and Facebook as success stories. How could you not invest in Snap?Once again we have a case in which Silicon Valley\u2019s overreliance on momentum creates an unrealistic proxy for valuation. Snap will reap billions as a result, while Twitter will struggle to salvage what it can from what was once a valuation of more than $40 billion. It is a story that will have real consequences.Steven Davidoff Solomon is a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

But maybe not super helpful to the Clinton campaign?The Clinton camp spin was that he was talking about the problems that need to be fixed. Obamacare\u2019s been stuck in a political hellhole where the Republican majority in Congress refuses to repair what everybody agrees are problems because the only thing they\u2019re allowed to talk about is repeal.Hillary\u2019s said all along that she\u2019s going to repair it. And working with Congress is one area where her record is much better than Obama\u2019s.

I find it interesting that he\u2019s so much better informed on Clinton\u2019s email issues than the nation\u2019s health care problems. Suspect the average voter is more interested in the part involving hospitals.All I could think of was Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live. He\u2019s going to be our national Trump image the way Tina Fey took over Sarah Palin.As much as I\u2019d like to say Trump was the loser on Sunday, I guess he did pretty well in the sense that he beat expectations. Real gift to be a candidate where the expectations are that after 15 minutes you\u2019ll start howling and wander off the stage.That was pretty harsh, given the way Pence spent his debate defending Trump even when it required \u2014 um, fictionalization.I remember once describing a prominent official as a guy who if he showed up at a grocery store, everyone would switch lines to make sure they weren\u2019t stuck having to make small talk with him at checkout. If Debate Trump was headed into the store, the other customers would run shrieking out the back door.Yet for now, Trump is still in it. And if you trust the polls, maybe even still within striking distance.Advertisement"}

The leaders of what came to be known as the religious right were kingmakers and household names, like Pat Robertson, James C. Dobson, Ralph Reed.But this year, Ms. Hatmaker\u2019s outraged post was one small sign of the splintering of the evangelical bloc and a possible portent of the changes ahead. While most of the religious right\u2019s aging old guard has chosen to stand by Mr. Trump, its judgment and authority are being challenged by an increasingly assertive crop of younger leaders, minorities and women such as Ms. Hatmaker.The fault lines among evangelicals that the election of 2016 has exposed \u2014 among generations, ethnic groups and sexes \u2014 are likely to reshape national politics for years to come, conservative Christian leaders and analysts said last week in interviews. Arguments that were once private are now public, and agendas are no longer clear.But the evangelicals now challenging the old guard tend to have a broader agenda. They see it as a Christian imperative to care for immigrants and refugees, the poor, the environment and victims of sex trafficking and sexual abuse. Many support criminal justice reform and the aims of the Black Lives Matter movement. While ardently opposed to abortion, some are inclined to be more accepting of same-sex marriage.\u201cI do not think there\u2019s any way to get evangelical women in any force to show up for Donald Trump at this point,\u201d Mr. Moore said.\u201cLiberty University is not Trump University,\u201d said Dustin Wahl, a junior majoring in politics and policy, who wrote the petition. \u201cWe don\u2019t stand with our president on Donald Trump. It\u2019s embarrassing because most people here realize that Trump is a joke.\u201dMr. Wahl said that more than 2,500 people had signed the petition in two days, including more than 1,100 who used email addresses affiliated with Liberty University. There are about 15,000 resident students at Liberty, and an additional 90,000 online.Mr. Falwell, Mr. Reed and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, who have all stood by Mr. Trump, did not respond to interview requests. However, Mr. Falwell issued a response to the students\u2019 petition, saying that it represented the views of only a \u201cfew students,\u201d and that he had endorsed Mr. Trump as an individual, not on behalf of the university.The student body president, Jack Heaphy, as well as some students interviewed on campus, defended Mr. Falwell and Mr. Trump.\u201cI believe the vast majority of students on campus will be voting for Mr. Trump on Nov. 8 \u2014 not because he\u2019s the perfect candidate, but because his policies align most with the viewpoints of students,\u201d Mr. Heaphy said.While evangelicals on both sides are alarmed at the vitriol and division, not everyone agrees that it signifies a long-term split. Some maintain that the dissenters will return to the Republican Party post-Trump, and those who supported him will be forgiven.\u201cI don\u2019t think it is permanent,\u201d said Mr. Moore, the publicist who sits on Mr. Trump\u2019s advisory board.But the petition is one sign that the traditional reverence among evangelicals for authority figures has fallen by the wayside. On social media, there are calls for Mr. Perkins to step down for continuing to back Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that someone could run an organization named the Family Research Council and support a man like Donald Trump for president,\u201d said Matthew Lee Anderson, 34, the author of several books and the blog Mere Orthodoxy.Four years ago, he spoke on a young leaders\u2019 panel at the Values Voter Summit, which is sponsored by Mr. Perkins\u2019s organization. Now, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any trust in his judgment any longer.

The city immediately erupted in protests, which spread on Sunday to cities like Marrakesh and Rabat, the capital.According to news accounts, Mr. Fikri and several friends dived into the garbage truck after the authorities confiscated his merchandise, around $11,000 worth of swordfish, a protected species in Morocco. As the compactor started operating \u2014 it was not clear why \u2014 the friends jumped out, but Mr. Fikri was stuck inside.In a statement, the Moroccan interior minister, Mohamed Hassad, promised a thorough investigation that \u201cwill make sure people are held accountable.\u201dOn Sunday, thousands of men marched on a hill above the Mediterranean Sea behind Mr. Fikri\u2019s coffin.\u201cDon\u2019t forget us.

They want to pressure the authorities so this never happens again. Tomorrow, it could happen to me or anyone else.\u201dAl Hoceima is part of a mountainous region of Morocco, the Rif, that has had a rebellious history with the monarchy. The Berber population in the region waged war against Spain, then Morocco\u2019s colonial ruler, in the 1920s, and the Rif was home to a violent rebellion against the monarchy in the late 1950s, shortly after Morocco won independence.The region is poor and isolated, but has started to get more attention from the government in recent years.

Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat whom he endorsed across party lines in 2014. (Mr. Cuomo has had no comment on the arrest.)\u201cNassau County was a focal point for us this fall just because the demographics and the presidential race were making it competitive,\u201d said Senator Michael N. Gianaris of Queens, the Senate Democrats\u2019 chief political strategist. \u201cAnd with all our candidates stressing ethics reform and corruption as our main message, recent events make it more favorable than ever.\u201dThere are perhaps 10 competitive races statewide that could tip the balance of power in the Senate, where the math of majority can be hard to follow: The 63-seat chamber actually includes 32 Democrats, but one Democrat \u2014 Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn \u2014 caucuses with the Republicans, giving that party power.Democrats hope to pick up at least one seat to seize the majority, but even so, they also will probably have to work with the Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of Democratic senators who have often worked closely with Republicans.On Thursday, Democrats began new internal polling in the Eighth District on behalf of their candidate, John E. Brooks, to determine a path to victory. And on Friday, Mr. Brooks unveiled a four-point ethics plan, saying that \u201ccorrupt officials have lined their pockets at the expense of Long Island taxpayers, and people like Senator Mike Venditto have stood by and let it happen.\u201dMr. Kaminsky wasted little time calling for Mr. Mangano and John Venditto\u2019s resignations, along with a \u201cwholesale ethics reform.\u201d\u201cPay-to-play politics is disgraceful,\u201d Mr. Kaminsky said in a statement released on Thursday. \u201cAnd taxpayers deserve better.\u201dThat call was echoed by every other Democratic Senate candidate in the county \u2014 each used the phrase \u201cresign immediately\u201d \u2014 and placed Republicans in an awkward position of doing the same. This included Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s opponent, Chris McGrath, a lawyer and Hofstra University law professor, who said in an interview that \u201cthe public deserves someone who will give 100 percent of their time to the job.\u201dRepublican officials noted that all five of their candidates also called for resignations and denounced the alleged behavior outlined by Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\u201cWe have zero tolerance for corruption of any kind, regardless of whether it is committed by a Democrat or a Republican,\u201d said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans. \u201cOver the next few weeks, we are going to remind people of the comprehensive ethics reforms we have already achieved, and that we are committed to doing more to ensure citizens have faith and trust in their government at every level.\u201dMr. Gaughran, the chairman of the Suffolk County Water Authority, had already tried to make ethics a part of the race, with campaign mailers arriving this week that characterize Mr. Marcellino, who has deep ties to Oyster Bay, as part of a \u201ccorrupt political machine.\u201dDemocrats are also optimistic about the Sixth District, where the Republican incumbent, Kemp Hannon, is facing Ryan Cronin in a rematch of a 2012 race. Senator Hannon won that race by fewer than 5,000 votes.Craig Burnett, an assistant professor of political science at Hofstra who has studied the Senate races, said that Mr. Marcellino and Mr. Venditto\u2019s seats should be safely Republican, but that the arrests could complicate that, even if the incumbents are state officials and not county. \u201cVoters don\u2019t necessarily make these distinctions,\u201d Professor Burnett said, adding, \u201cThey know that there\u2019s people on the ballot and that\u2019s the only way they have to express themselves.\u201dHe added that Mr. Kaminsky\u2019s victory in April over Mr. McGrath in the Ninth District showed that solid Republican seats could flip. \u201cThere is evidence there that this can be done,\u201d he said.Professor Burnett and others said the younger Mr. Venditto, a first-term legislator, could lose votes from those who confuse him with his recently arrested father. Mr. Venditto offered an emotional statement on Thursday about the arrest, calling it \u201can extremely difficult situation for our entire family.\u201d\u201cIt is breaking our hearts,\u201d he said in the statement, noting that John Venditto should be considered innocent until proven guilty. \u201cI love my father.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thank You, Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byDispatchDonald J. Trump could well go down in history as a feminist hero.For decades, feminists have tried to stir outrage about how women are routinely groped, belittled, and weight-shamed. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s words and boasts have shown millions of voters, including people who believe feminism is a dirty word, what women endure every day.This was supposed to be an election where Hillary Clinton had to convince voters that a woman had the fitness and temperament to be president.Yet instead of worrying whether a woman is too emotional, impulsive and unqualified for high office, voters have been weighing whether that\u2019s true of the man running to be president.In debates that drew the largest audience in television history and rallies featuring signs taunting Hillary Clinton as a bitch and worse, viewers saw live, visceral demonstrations of misogyny in action.Indeed, Mr. Trump is not just a gift to feminists \u2013 he is breathing renewed life into a movement to redefine just what a real man is and ought to be.A man who prides himself on being a red-blooded embodiment of masculinity \u2013 with bodacious women there for the taking, big hands and more, political correctness be damned \u2013 has unleashed a wave of revulsion about that vision of manhood.Men have begun asking themselves what they can do to intervene in cases of sexual harassment or denigration \u2013 how not to stand by silently. Mothers and fathers have been asking how to raise sons who do not act like this.The Access Hollywood tape induced a stream of defections from high-level Republicans who had not broken with him over the attack on a war hero\u2019s family, the impugning of a judge of Mexican ancestry, or his threats to ban all Muslims from these shores.Even if their defense of women was based on outdated Victorian notions of chivalry, there was something about Mr. Trump\u2019s unvarnished male entitlement, that droit du seigneur, that many Republican men could not stomach.Many Republican women, meanwhile, have deserted Mr. Trump. Suburban women \u2013 the vaunted soccer moms who have helped Republicans bridge a longstanding gender gap \u2013 seem largely out of his reach. The latest CBS poll of probable voters, conducted a few days after the release of the tape, counted 60 percent of women supporting Mrs. Clinton, compared to 24 percent for Mr. Trump.This has turned out to be an election in which many of the old dog whistle issues about women \u2013 working motherhood, single mothers, a woman\u2019s ability to be commander-in-chief, women\u2019s assertiveness and self-confidence \u2013 have not seemed to resonate.Mrs. Clinton, who shied away in 2008 from the historic nature of her candidacy and was wary of presenting herself as an advocate for women, has changed course this time. She is unabashedly speaking out about her commitment to families and children and her identity as a mother and grandmother. Her full-throated rallying cry for women\u2019s control over their own bodies in the debate Wednesday night was unusually blunt and expansive. She did not shy away from defending late-term abortions \u2013 often a political minefield.It\u2019s an open question whether the election of the first female president would prompt an even more blatant and toxic display of sexism, as the election of the first black president forced American racism even more to the surface. But if Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of sexual swagger and hyper-masculinity alienates enough voters to elect a woman, feminism will be in his debt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Now at GQ, Keith Olbermann Takes His Outrage Online", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byKeith Olbermann knows the question before it is asked: How, after a career spent anchoring news and sports shows on ESPN, MSNBC, NBC and Fox, has he come to be delivering anti-Donald J. Trump commentaries on GQ magazine\u2019s website?He was a big, talented, peripatetic TV star, who, at times, was his own worst enemy, too often clashing with management. And now he\u2019s on a short-term assignment for GQ.com that will end with the election, with no guarantees afterward.Still, he says he is happy, even liberated. He can say what he pleases and is performing in an evolving online environment that reminds him of being at CNN in its early days, and ESPN in its early middle period. So what if he has left behind the trappings, and production values, of prime-time TV?\u201cThis is it,\u201d he said, with a triumphal tone in his baritone during a recent interview. \u201cThis is where it\u2019s going. There will be a garage-band quality to news, particularly video news, in the years to come, and I think it\u2019ll be limitless. Maybe there will be a NewsFlix in the future, with 37 options \u2014 with Olbermann\u2019s commentaries and a three-minute Al Roker forecast.\u201d\u201cIf this looks like a downward spiral,\u201d he continued, \u201cI would point out that I don\u2019t need the money. I\u2019m doing this for charity \u2014 for dogs groups and veterans groups. I\u2019m doing this for the rides downtown.\u201d\u201cWere it the choice,\u201d he said near the end of one of them, \u201cI would sooner and happily vote for a third term of George W. Bush than five minutes of President Donald Trump.\u201dAt a certain point, a return to political commentary in any medium looked improbable for Mr. Olbermann.He returned to sports and ESPN in 2013 with a studio show, \u201cOlbermann,\u201d on ESPN2 that ultimately could not overcome various factors, including shifting time slots and modest viewership.His interest piqued, Mr. Olbermann thought of a comeback, but talks that focused on returning to MSNBC and CNN (or its sibling network, HLN) ultimately went nowhere.During the summer, a friend of Mr. Olbermann\u2019s who writes for GQ heard that the magazine wanted to talk to him about creating online commentaries for its website, whose most popular feature explores extremely expensive luxury goods with the rapper 2 Chainz. Mr. Olbermann and the magazine came to a quick agreement in August.\u201cWe wanted to add to our political and election coverage, and that dovetailed with Keith\u2019s desire to get back into the game,\u201d said Jim Nelson, editor in chief of GQ. \u201cWe felt that no one was meeting Trump at the temperature level that was needed. And I missed Keith\u2019s rage. We miss Jon Stewart. And we only get weekly doses of Samantha Bee and John Oliver. That\u2019s not enough.\u201dA decade ago, GQ lauded Mr. Olbermann in an article for producing \u201cthe most electric, intelligent and eviscerating news commentary on television,\u201d and posed him in a raincoat as Howard Beale, the unhinged, mad-as-hell newsman from \u201cNetwork.\u201dSo far, Mr. Nelson is pleased that the magazine is swimming in Mr. Olbermann\u2019s indignation. His more than 20 videos have attracted about 25 million views on GQ.com, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, and sites like Yahoo and Huffington Post, according to internal measurements.Jamie Horowitz, who produced Mr. Olbermann\u2019s show at ESPN2 and is now president of Fox Sports national networks, looks at the commentaries on GQ.com as less of a surprising career shift than a simple change in where content is available.\u201cMy belief is that content has to be platform-agnostic,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can create quite compelling content on a variety of different platforms. That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\u201dMr. Olbermann goes into GQ\u2019s offices at least twice a week to tape \u201cThe Closer.\u201d A small group of GQ staff members work on the series. A fashion editor, Jon Tietz, fusses over his tie and shirt collar. Geoffrey Gagnon, an articles editor, goes over the scripts. Instead of an elaborate anchor desk, Mr. Olbermann sits at a plain white table. A blue blanket is beneath his feet to muffle sound. A blue and red backdrop hangs behind him.His commentary style is feverish, erudite and emotional \u2014 unchanged since his \u201cSpecial Comment\u201d segments on MSNBC.In a comment posted after Mr. Trump said at last Wednesday\u2019s debate that he might not accept the results of next month\u2019s election, Mr. Olbermann pointedly addressed several Republican leaders, including Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.The same Mr. Olbermann. Just in a very different venue.Advertisement"}

My gimbal \u2014 an elaborate, selfie stick-like device that holds the phone steady while filming \u2014 went haywire, pulling the camera up then down. I wrestled to hold it steady, fumbling for the off switch. The border agent kept talking. The problem: We couldn\u2019t stop to fix it because we were live, broadcasting to thousands of viewers on Facebook.New forms of digital journalism brim with possibilities \u2014 telling stories in exciting, innovative ways, attracting new audiences, obtaining instant feedback. But they also involve an array of cables, batteries and equipment that, like my drunken gimbal, can malfunction at just the wrong moment. Sometimes I yearn for the days of a notepad and pen.I had come to Arizona, with the photographer Tomas Munita, to write about one of the campaign\u2019s totemic issues: Donald J. Trump\u2019s proposed wall. What did the people who live along the border with Mexico think of the idea? We flew in to Tucson, 60 miles from the border, rented a 4-wheel-drive Jeep and headed south, toward the Mexican border, with Google Maps as a guide.That was already a novelty: Renting a car is impossible or inadvisable in Libya and Syria, two of the Arab countries where I\u2019ve worked this year. Petrol (or gas, as Americans call it) is also strikingly cheap in Arizona: $30 for 15 gallons, or about one-third the price of what it costs in London, where I lived for a couple of years before moving to Cairo.We spent a week roving back and forth along a 120-mile stretch of border, under giant skies filled with dramatic columns of rolling clouds. Small towns with names like Apache, Rodeo and Tombstone echoed the Old West I had in my head. (The re-enactment of the shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone was entertaining but not as eventful as it had been one day last year when an actor, having accidentally loaded real bullets into his gun, shot and wounded another cast member during the show.)The Cochise County Fair in Douglas, with its glittering fairground and rodeo riders, presented a slice of amber-hued rural Americana that, until then, I had imagined only existed in the pages of National Geographic. In the animal stalls, children in cowboy hats cleaned and blow-dried their competition goats and cattle; vendors offered a glorious profusion of snacks like \u201cZach\u2019s Poppin Johnny Ice Cream,\u201d made using a 1927 John Deere hit-n-miss engine that pops and chugs as it turns two old-fashioned oak churns (delicious). Otherwise they sold items that I found funny (\u201cWarning: You are Entering a Red Neck Area,\u201d read one sign) or faintly disturbing (Confederate flags hung from a stall where a tattoo-wearing trader displayed his array of large daggers to a spellbound young boy).We crossed the border several times, parking the Jeep and traveling by foot. Getting into Mexico was easy \u2014 a simple security scan and a desultory document check and we were over. (Once, I didn\u2019t even have to show my passport.) Returning to America was another matter \u2014 a weaving journey through an elaborate, multimillion-dollar border post, replete with guards, cameras, scanners and dogs.The election was never far from the surface. One evening, returning to my room in the American Nogales, I found the maid had planted a copy of the Bible on top of the book I was reading: \u201cTrump Revealed.\u201d A political statement? If it was, others were more overt. An elderly Mexican-American woman declared herself a Trump enthusiast (\u201cViva el Donald Trump,\u201d read the post on her Facebook page). A hardy cowboy rancher said he had rooted for Bernie Sanders, the failed Democratic contender, in the primary elections.Some folks exhibited hints of the anti-media hostility that has grown across America as this divisive campaign has progressed. At the Cochise fair, I found a man wearing a \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d T-shirt at a gun-club stand. After a few minutes of terse conversation, the head of the club interjected, \u201cCome over here, we need you,\u201d and pulled the man away while glaring at me. The two men sat down together and pointedly turned their backs to me. Interview over.Accommodations varied. In Tucson we stayed at the historic Hotel Congress, where the notorious bank robber John Dillinger was captured in January 1934. One night in Douglas, a budget motel only had smoking rooms available: Imagine an air-conditioned ashtray with minimal comfort and a sign on the door that urged guests, \u201cFor Your Protection: When In Room Engage Deadbolt And Security Latch.\u201d Not particularly reassuring.Then there was what you might call the serendipity of the road: chance meetings with good people. In the border town of Naco, we bumped into David Loyd, a gracious and generous resident who offered food and a bed for the night. Mr. Loyd had run a ferry to a remote island in Washington State, on the border with Canada, before moving to southern Arizona three years ago. On the night we stayed with him, we fell asleep in his guest room to the mournful sound of howling coyotes on the plains outside.The complicated reality of life on the border \u2014 sweeping beauty alongside human tragedy \u2014 loomed close. A kindly rancher named Dan Bell took us to see two monuments near the border: a memorial dedicated to Alexander Kirpnick, a border patrol agent killed in the line of duty in 1998, and a cross that marked the spot where an anonymous migrant, trying to cross the border, had died.Sometimes, though, you miss the moment. We had just finished a Facebook Live session and put away the equipment when there was a skirmish behind us. A border agent hustled two illegal migrants, a man and a woman, into a van. They had been scooped up minutes earlier, soon after they vaulted the fence, the agent said. They would likely be back in Mexico by evening.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Online Video View: We Can Count It, but Can We Count on It?", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingONE OF THE great promises of online videos was the potential to measure precisely how effective they were: Audiences reported not through inexact ratings and surveys but directly, down to the person and the millisecond he or she spent watching.For the most part, that promise has been realized. Digital audiences are nothing if not minutely monitored.But an abundance of data, largely self-reported by internet platforms that are in direct competition with one another, presents a challenge of its own. Namely, what numbers are truly reliable?Consider the closest thing the industry has to a basic, universal metric \u2014 the video view.Facebook counts a video as viewed after it has played for just three seconds, as does Twitter. Vine, in which videos are mostly limited to six-second loops, counts a view once a video has been watched to completion. Snapchat, which does not publicly display the number of views, counts users\u2019 posts as viewed after one second.Instagram, which hosts up to one-minute videos, registers a view after three seconds. Vimeo, which hosts videos that can be much longer, counts a view instantly, as does Twitch, on which broadcasts can last hours. YouTube has never fully disclosed its methods for counting views, but industry insiders have divined that it is somewhere around 30 seconds.For decades, TV viewership was measured primarily by one company, Nielsen, and expressed as relatively straightforward ratings \u2014 a currency upon which 30- and 60-second television ads were bought and sold. Digital video pairs more precise measurement with a vast proliferation of metrics and formats: videos viewed live, or later; on phones, computers or other devices; with obvious intention, after a search, or more incidentally, as in a feed filled with other posts; for seconds, minutes or hours.Even within the same company\u2019s online entities, data is hard to reconcile. \u201cYou have Twitter now with live video, then you have a Periscope product, then you have Vine, and they all integrate into this feed,\u201d said Nick Cicero, founder of Delmondo, a social media marketing and analytics firm. \u201cThen you have Twitter on TV, where you can watch live video from your couch.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say what is comparable to what,\u201d he said.Those who post videos can afford to look at these shifting definitions of what counts as a view with at least a modicum of humor.The Association of National Advertisers, a trade group, took the opportunity to scold Facebook, which has rapidly altered the online advertising industry. \u201cWith more than $6 billion of marketers\u2019 media being directed to Facebook, we believe that it is time for them \u2014 and other such major media players \u2014 to be audited and accredited,\u201d the agency\u2019s chief executive, Bob Liodice, said in a statement.Such demands are not entirely new, and some websites, in an effort to appease and court clients and partners, have already begun to take tentative steps in that direction. In April, Facebook announced a series of deals with Integral Ad Science, comScore and Nielsen to offer third-party verification. It also made a deal with a company called Moat, which seeks to standardize some forms of measurement across websites that host video. YouTube, Twitter and Snapchat have made similar deals in recent years.\u201cWe think it is really important to have a standard set of metrics like audience reach, total minutes, average minutes viewed,\u201d said Jessica Hogue, senior vice president for product leadership at Nielsen. \u201cThe market doesn\u2019t want more metrics, just a refined set applied in a consistent manner regardless of the content type or platform.\u201dThough it has recently been criticized for failing to keep up with TV\u2019s digital revolution, Nielsen has for decades offered familiar ratings and is hoping to find its place \u2014 by creating simple, Nielsen-like ratings across different services \u2014 despite competition. The use of familiar measurement methodology may help persuade advertisers to move more of their spending from TV, where the bulk of it has traditionally gone, to digital.Facebook\u2019s stumble may represent the beginning of a bigger conflict between sites that host video and advertisers.\u201cEvery other medium has a currency,\u201d said Jonah Goodhart, the founder of Moat. \u201cYou can measure time in the same way across platforms even if the impact of time is different on those platforms.\u201dBut such standardization could also diminish what platforms regard as their own unique advantages that cannot always be captured in raw numbers \u2014 differences in the ways users use particular apps, and consume video, that could command a premium.It is in a platform\u2019s interest, in other words, to be regarded as a different medium than its competitors, measured not just in views or time spent watching.\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to have is a whole bunch of ad sales people trying to make the case as to why their thing is better,\u201d said Tony Haile, the founder and former chief of Chartbeat, an analytics company. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be very difficult to try to match the experiential differences on the platforms to the media buyer\u2019s desire for a simple message about performance.\u201dA compromise, he suggested, could be a clearer distinction between public metrics \u2014 view counts displayed to influence users\u2019 behavior or provide positive feedback to those who post \u2014 and the numbers the companies use to sell advertising.Already on Facebook, advertisers are able to buy video impressions, which are counted as soon as someone sees a video, or 10-second views, which are more expensive and counted only if the user makes it to 10 seconds. But the three-second view, the one behind the totals the public sees, is not for sale.\u201cA video view which isn\u2019t being transacted on, but which is there to make someone feel good about how many views their video received, is useful for a totally different purpose,\u201d Mr. Haile said. \u201cThey almost should diverge.\u201dMr. Goodhart, of Moat, suggested a shift in attitudes over the last year. \u201cNo individual media owner can be their own referee anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t be against that.\u201dAt a news conference during the recently concluded Advertising Week in Manhattan, Facebook executives seemed to concede as much, noting plans to focus more on metrics that they think advertisers should care about, like sales outcomes, though they did not offer a specific timeline for when that would happen.\u201cThere is very universal agreement that the industry needs to evolve to metrics that actually matter,\u201d said Carolyn Everson, vice president for global marketing solutions at Facebook.Sapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Dawoud Bey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large-scale color photographs of Harlem vividly document a bustling and rapidly transforming neighborhood: a verdant Marcus Garvey Park; construction sites popping up for more luxury housing; street vendors hawking hats and used clothing; posters of black women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hairstyles in the window of a hair weave distributor adjacent to a vacant lot; faded paper covering the windows of the legendary \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and shuttered \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Lenox Lounge; and white tourists intent on hearing gospel music waiting outside the Abyssinian Baptist Church. A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.These photographs are featured in a new exhibition, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarlem Redux,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago, running through Dec. 3. Although Mr. Bey\u2019s images are largely devoid of people, his sharp attention to the physical details of urban life manages to \u00e2\u0080\u009creveal a much deeper truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he wrote in the exhibition\u00e2\u0080\u0099s catalog. The neighborhood is beset by gentrification and unsettling demographic shifts, but it also remains home to a dynamic and determined African-American community.Mr. Bey said he felt it was important to take an open-ended approach, allowing the circumstances of exploring the neighborhood to guide his choices. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want this work to participate in the conversation about the changes taking place in Harlem as its evolution continues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u2019t want to photograph that at the end of that process, I wanted to visualize what that looks like as it is happening \u2026 the moment in between what was and what will be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The photographs of \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarlem Redux\u00e2\u0080\u009d are alternately vibrant, elegiac and lyrical. They let us witness the neighborhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dynamic physical changes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as its continuing African-American presence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as it undergoes a complicated and wrenching transformation. The irony and profundity of these pictures lie in their ability to say so much about Harlem through the depiction of its physical spaces rather than its residents and visitors.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause those physical changes portend so much more than just \u00e2\u0080\u0098a change of scenery,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I thought it was important to come to terms with that visually,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bey said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaking portraits in Harlem at this moment just didn\u2019t feel like the right response. I wanted to make photographs of the place that function as a metaphorical suggestion of the shifts taking place. So I had to devise a different visual language in order to achieve that.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Bey, a professor at Columbia College Chicago, grew up in New York, and Harlem has always had special meaning for him. His parents met there and he was born there, just before the family relocated to Jamaica, Queens. But while he never lived there, his personal connection to Harlem remains deep. It has been intellectually and culturally important to him, as the site of the Harlem Renaissance, which spanned the 1920s through the mid-1930s, and, in subsequent decades, as the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pre-eminent setting for black cultural, political and social expression.Mr. Bey began his career as a professional drummer, but gave that up for photography in the early 1970s, receiving his M.F.A. from Yale University School of Art. His first series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarlem USA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d begun in 1975 and completed in 1979, consisted of impeccably photographed portraits. As he recently observed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarlem USA\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which met with critical acclaim when it was first exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1979 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 set the foundation for his subsequent work.Also on view at the Daiter Gallery are portraits from \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarlem USA,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which along with Mr. Bey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new series create an evocative interplay between past and present. Together they remind us that Harlem has become a place \u00e2\u0080\u009cincreasingly defined by a sense of \u00e2\u0080\u0098erase and replace,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wherein pieces of social and cultural history, along with memory itself, are routinely discarded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Mr. Bey wrote. In her book \u00e2\u0080\u009cHarlem is Nowhere: A Journey to the Mecca of Black America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts, like Mr. Bey, liberates her subject from clich\u00c3\u00a9s and stereotypes, offering a fresh and historically minded view of an evolving community. Regarding gentrification, she described overhearing a conversation between two white men in a new Harlem cafe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one a stay-at-home father who worked in marketing, the other visiting his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neighborhood for the first time. Exclaiming Harlem \u00e2\u0080\u009cfabulous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the visitor, aware of the first man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skills in advertising, insisted that he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo something to get the word out. There need to be more people up here!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dIntentionally or otherwise, as Ms. Rhodes-Pitts observed, the tourist invoked the rhetoric of a colonialist who viewed yet-to-be conquered property as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cno man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land\u00e2\u0080\u009d despite the presence of established \u00e2\u0080\u0094 black \u00e2\u0080\u0094 residents. In this context, Mr. Bey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barren cityscapes read as wistful meditations on absence, memory and loss, on the vanishing of a people who made the neighborhood the Mecca of black America. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving spent so much time in Harlem in the past, I have been increasingly struck by the ways in which the community has physically changed, and at an increasingly rapid pace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bey said, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to find a visual language that would allow me to make a visually compelling and evocative representation of those changes happening to the place I came to know all those years ago, and to provoke thinking about the parts of it that were disappearing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

This is beyond my wildest nightmares,\u201d said Ms. Pietruszka-Drozdz, 37, a mother of two. \u201cWomen don\u2019t have abortions because they are promiscuous and it\u2019s convenient. They do it because they need to, and it\u2019s often the most traumatic decision ever.\u201dForeign Minister Witold Waszczykowski dismissed the protesters, saying, \u201cLet them have their fun.\u201dThe protests have won the approval of numerous Polish employers, including restaurant owners, museum and gallery directors, the deans of several universities and mayors of a couple of large cities, all of whom allowed their female workers to take a day off.Poland introduced a restrictive abortion law, known as the \u201cabortion compromise\u201d and championed by the Roman Catholic Church, in 1993 after the collapse of Communism.According to official figures, around 1,000 legal abortions are performed in Poland every year. Estimates of the number of illegal terminations vary widely, from 10,000 to 120,000, from anti-abortion and abortion rights groups.\u201cThe abortion compromise was supposed to curb the number of illegal terminations and increase the number of births in Poland,\u201d Ms. Nowacka said. \u201cIt has failed miserably on both accounts. We need a new law that actually corresponds with reality.\u201dCritics of the legislation, which is supported by senior members of the right-wing government, argue that if the bill is passed, doctors will stop performing invasive procedures on pregnant women, even to correct a fetal defect, unless the woman\u2019s life is directly threatened. That is the only exception under which doctors could undertake a procedure and avoid prosecution if it ended in a miscarriage.Dr. Romuald Debski, the head of gynecology and obstetrics at Bielanski Hospital in Warsaw, said every invasive procedure carries a minor risk of miscarriage.Tomasz Latos, a member of the governing Law and Justice party and head of the Health Committee in the Polish Sejm, or lower house of Parliament, said viewing the legislation as a threat to prenatal diagnostics was \u201ceither an act of ill will or incompetence.\u201d\u201cNo one is saying that this bill will be even passed in the end,\u201d he said. \u201cOur senators are preparing a separate bill.\u201dKatarzyna Plutowska, 44, and Malgorzata Zyra, 39, took a day off from their accounting jobs to join a demonstration held near the Palace of Science and Culture in Warsaw.\u201cDue to the protest, our entire office is closed today,\u201d Ms. Plutowska said. \u201cYou cannot change the world from your couch, you know.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Want to Help Pay for a Child\u2019s College? Grab a Gift Card", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserParents are often reluctant to solicit gifts for their children\u2019s college funds, even though they might prefer a gift of cash to another stuffed animal. But friends and relatives will soon have an option to contribute to a 529 saving account without being asked.Giftofcollege.com, a registry for online gifts to 529 accounts, will make plastic 529 gift cards available at Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Babies \u201cR\u201d Us retail stores, said Wayne Weber, founder and chief executive of Gift of College Inc.The first cards are scheduled to be available starting Friday at stores in California, where the state\u2019s ScholarShare College Savings program is the first 529 plan to join with Gift of College to market the co-branded cards in stores.On Nov. 7, the 529 gift cards should be available at the retail chain nationally, Mr. Weber said. While some cards may promote a specific state plan, like the cards in California, they may be redeemed for deposit into any state\u2019s 529 plan, Mr. Weber said.Alyssa Peera, spokeswoman for Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, said by email, \u201cAs customers shop in our stores for special occasions in children\u2019s lives, including Christmas, birthday, graduations and more, these gift cards make for a unique present that both the kid and their parents will appreciate.\u201dThe cards offer a tangible way to contribute to a college fund, Mr. Weber said \u2014 perhaps along with a toy or game purchased at the same time \u2014 rather than simply writing a check. Shoppers will be able to buy them at checkout counters and elsewhere in the stores, he said, in fixed amounts of $25 or $50, or in variable amounts of up to $500. (Gift of College also offers electronic gift cards on its website.)\u201cNever before has it been this easy\u201d for relatives and friends to help children save for college, John Chiang, the California state treasurer and chairman of the ScholarShare Investment Board, said in a statement.\u201cAnd we think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Mr. Weber said.While 529 plans have been around for two decades, many parents remain unaware of them, said Andrea Feirstein, a 529 plan consultant and spokeswoman for the College Savings Plans Network. Teaming up with Gift of College on gift cards in stores, she said, is another way that 529 plan representatives are \u201cgetting the word out.\u201dAt least one has stopped accepting 529 gifts. Mr. Weber said that since then, Gift of College has taken extra steps to make sure 529 plan representatives were confident in its website, including hiring a compliance officer and putting in anti-money laundering and other fraud protections.Here are some questions and answers about gifts to 529 plans:Yes. When people buy a Gift of College gift card, they will pay $3.95 to $5.95, depending on the card\u2019s value, Mr. Weber said. There is no extra fee for redeeming the card. The recipient of a $25 gift card will receive $25 in the college account.Yes, and there\u2019s no fee to do so. But you will have to obtain the 529 account number from the child\u2019s parents and write it on the check to make sure it\u2019s properly credited. Some plans also require that you fill out a deposit form and may offer printable gift certificates.Yes, in many cases. But the parent typically has to initiate the transaction somehow, so 529 managers are using social media tools to make it easier for parents to ask for the gifts. Fidelity, for instance, which manages plans in four states, gives parents the option of setting up an online gift page for their child, personalized with a photo and other details. The parents may share a link to the page on Facebook, for instance, or by email. Friends and family members click on the link and make a gift, without seeing the account number, said Keith Bernhardt, vice president for college planning at Fidelity Investments. Funds are withdrawn directly from the giver\u2019s bank account.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

The earnings also showed budding signs of progress, as user growth and revenue rose more than Wall Street had anticipated.\u201cWe see a significant opportunity to increase growth as we continue to improve the core service,\u201d Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a clear plan, and we\u2019re making the necessary changes to ensure Twitter is positioned for long-term growth.\u201dIn a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Mr. Dorsey also swept aside any questions about the takeover discussions around the company. His focus, he said, was bringing Twitter to profitability as soon as next year.In total, Twitter posted revenue of $616 million for the third quarter, up 8 percent from a year ago and above Wall Street estimates of $605 million. Twitter continued to lose money, though its net loss narrowed to $103 million, or 15 cents a share, better than Wall Street\u2019s estimates of 19 cents a share.Twitter\u2019s users increased 3 percent from a year ago, to 317 million, and over the latest quarter, it added four million more users, which was slightly more than analysts had expected.The results were relatively positive compared with Twitter\u2019s history of uneven quarterly earnings over the last three years. Since the company went public three years ago, it has been haunted by its inability to attract new users, especially when compared with Facebook, the social networking giant that hosts more than 1.7 billion regular visitors each month.Twitter\u2019s small increase in user growth shows an accelerating curve. Growth of average daily active users, for instance, has increased over the last three consecutive quarters to 7 percent in the most recent quarter. The company said the improvement was a result of product changes in signing up people, its user interface, notifications and customers\u2019 tweets.Shares of Twitter, which have been sliding for months, rose less than 1 percent to end the day at $17.40.Instead, Mr. Dorsey has taken a more methodical approach \u2014 one that has received mixed reactions internally \u2014 and opted to make small changes to how tweets are composed and consumed. In previous interviews, Mr. Dorsey has said many of these tweaks are long overdue and accretive to overall user growth.Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, expects that such companywide layoffs could save the company more than $50 million to $100 million annually.In a companywide address at Twitter\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco on Thursday, Mr. Dorsey spoke soberly to the thousands of workers in attendance about the company\u2019s future and renewed efforts to focus on core parts of Twitter\u2019s business, according to three employees who attended. Much of the meeting was spent trying to boost morale and lay out a vision of Twitter remaining an independent company going, while also fielding questions from employees.\u201cOur live strategy is showing great progress,\u201d Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve received very positive feedback from partners, advertisers and people using the service, and we\u2019re pleased with the strong audience and engagement results.\u201dMr. Noto has largely commandeered the live video push and negotiated relationships with partners like the N.F.L., where he once worked as chief financial officer.Those efforts, while still nascent, have shown signs of progress. Twitter\u2019s N.F.L. viewership has steadily increased each week, according to the social media company, even as viewership on traditional television channels has fallen.Twitter also said it had experienced strong demand from marketers that wish to buy advertising during live broadcasts, which also include deals with the N.B.A. and Bloomberg, along with BuzzFeed and CBS News for election coverage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court to Rule in Transgender Access Case", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday entered the national debate over transgender rights, announcing that it would decide whether a transgender boy may use the boys\u2019 bathroom in a Virginia high school.The court is acting just a year after it established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, as state laws and federal actions on transgender rights have prompted a welter of lawsuits. In taking the case, the court signaled that it may move more quickly in the area of transgender rights than it has in expanding gay rights.The case revolves around how the Obama administration is entitled to interpret a federal regulation under a 1972 law that bans discrimination \u201con the basis of sex\u201d in schools that receive federal money. The legal question is whether it can also ban discrimination based on gender identity.The Department of Education said last year that schools \u201cgenerally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity.\u201d In May, the department went further, saying that schools could lose federal money if they discriminate against transgender students.The case the Supreme Court agreed to hear concerns Gavin Grimm, who was designated female at birth but identifies as male. He attends Gloucester High School in southeastern Virginia.For a time, school administrators allowed Mr. Grimm, 17, to use the boys\u2019 bathroom, but the local school board later adopted a policy that required students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms for their \u201ccorresponding biological genders.\u201d The board added that \u201cstudents with gender identity issues\u201d would be allowed to use private bathrooms.Mr. Grimm, the brief said, \u201cavoids drinking liquids and tries not to urinate during the school day\u201d and has, as a consequence, \u201cdeveloped painful urinary tract infections and felt distracted and uncomfortable in class.\u201dIn a statement issued on Friday, Mr. Grimm said: \u201cI never thought that my restroom use would ever turn into any kind of national debate. The only thing I ever asked for was the right to be treated like everyone else.\u201dHe continued: \u201cWhile I\u2019m disappointed that I will have to spend my final school year being singled out and treated differently from every other guy, I will do everything I can to make sure that other transgender students don\u2019t have to go through the same experience.\u201dSpeaking of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Shannon Minter, the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said: \u201cThis is one of the most important days in the history of the transgender movement. The outcome of this case is likely to shape the future of that movement in ways that will resonate for a very long time.\u201dGary McCaleb, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, which filed a brief supporting the school board in Virginia, said, \u201cSchools have a duty to protect the privacy and safety of all students.\u201d\u201cIn light of the right to bodily privacy, federal law should not be twisted to require that a male be given access to the girls\u2019 facilities, or a female to the boys\u2019 facilities,\u201d he said.A 1975 regulation adopted under the 1972 law, Title IX, allowed schools to provide \u201cseparate toilet, locker rooms and shower facilities on the basis of sex.\u201d The Fourth Circuit said that it was ambiguous and that the Education Department\u2019s interpretation of it was entitled to \u201ccontrolling weight.\u201dA 4-to-4 tie in the Virginia case \u2014 Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., No. 16-273 \u2014 would leave that decision in place but set no national precedent. In agreeing to hear the case, the justices set aside their recent caution in adding cases to their docket while the court is reduced to eight members.The justices may be hoping they will have a new member to replace Antonin Scalia, who died in February, in time for the argument in the case early next year.The court also agreed to decide whether states may bar registered sex offenders from using Facebook and other social media.That case, Packingham v. North Carolina, No. 15-1194, concerns a North Carolina law that makes it a crime for registered sex offenders to use Facebook, Twitter and many other sites that allow the exchange of information and do not limit their membership to adults.The law was challenged by Lester Packingham, a registered sex offender who was convicted of violating it after posting an account of having a traffic ticket dismissed. \u201cGod is good,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.Mr. Packingham, who had pleaded guilty in 2002 to taking indecent liberties with a minor when he was a 21-year-old student, said the law violated the First Amendment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Neighborhood Bookstore\u2019s Unlikely Ally? The Internet", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byIn the summer, this small town five hours north of Detroit is a haven for tourists and summer residents who are drawn to the state\u2019s wine country. But after the fall colors fade and the sapphire waters of Lake Michigan chill, the region\u2019s population slumps by as much as 40 percent for much of the other nine months of the year.But even as the summer visitors disappear, Brilliant Books is still thriving as a result of robust online sales.A decade ago, independent bookstores were viewed as an industry on the decline. Crushed on price by Amazon and by the wide selection of national retailers like Barnes & Noble, thousands of mom-and-pop outlets had closed up shop.In a twist of fate, it is the internet \u2014 the very thing that was supposed to wipe them out \u2014 that is helping these small stores.\u201cBookstores are being reinvented by taking advantage of how the world has changed,\u201d said Oren Teicher, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, which represents independent sellers. \u201cThe whole ability to put technology to work for you has changed everything.\u201dUndoubtedly, the bookselling industry is still digging out of a deep trough. Sales of physical books in physical stores were just $11 billion in 2015, compared with $17 billion in 2007.But owners like Mr. Makin are finding ways to gain customer loyalty with the aid of technology. He knew he could not compete with Amazon on price, but he believed that online buyers would flock to Brilliant Books if they experienced the same customer service that shoppers in his physical store do.\u201cI say, \u2018We are your long-distance local bookstore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Makin said.One of his most successful ways of getting repeat business is his store\u2019s version of a book-of-the-month program, which makes personalized recommendations for each of its nearly 2,000 subscribers every 30 days. Rather than use an online form to track preferences, Brilliant sends each new subscriber a customer card to fill out by hand and mail back.Employees then scan the card into the system so that when it is book-selection time, they can see what the customers said they liked and how they said it.\u201cHow we might write something might show an entirely different taste in books,\u201d Mr. Malkin said. \u201cPeople scribble things out. They draw arrows. We get a feel for who they are.\u201dIndividually selecting titles for nearly 2,000 people can be time-consuming. \u201cAn awfully long time,\u201d Mr. Makin said, laughing. \u201cBut the technology allows us to make this happen.\u201dOnce the selections are made, the back-end system orders books from the publishers and prints postage and address labels. After the books arrive, the staff mails personalized packages.The investment is paying off: Sales are up 14 percent this year, and Mr. Makin anticipates that 30 percent of Brilliant\u2019s sales will come from online orders \u2014 doubling last year\u2019s total. Facebook customers buy more nonfiction titles, while Twitter conversations generate more sales of young adult and children\u2019s books.\u201cWe\u2019re in the 21st century and we\u2019re a 21st century book store,\u201d said Aimee Jodoin, Brilliant\u2019s social media manager. \u201cShop small is the way to beat Amazon. People are going to shop online, so we have an online presence.\u201dThese social media experiments are shifts in culture for many small businesses.\u201cThe one thing small business has over big boxes is that they can get to know every customer, but they have been hesitant to engage online,\u201d said Peter Shankman, a social media strategist and the author of \u201cZombie Loyalists: Using Great Service to Create Rabid Fans.\u201d \u201cThey heard about needing followers but didn\u2019t see any returns. When they realized that by making it personal, they could get return shoppers, it changed.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re part of a downtown that is booming and gentrifying, so we\u2019ve had a lot of attention to our geography,\u201d said the store manager, Katie Orphan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect that it would lead to the Instagram attention that we have had.\u201dInstead, the store communicates with its customers via social media and an email newsletter, where the most-read stories are about events and staff picks.\u201cThat\u2019s been the best tool for reaching customers and finding new sales,\u201d said Andrew Unger, Bookcourt\u2019s events and publicity manager.Still, he hopes to find a way in the future to promote the store\u2019s deep trove of audio interviews of popular talks by notable people like Garrison Keillor and Oliver Stone.\u201cSmall business, when it comes to something like this, it\u2019s hard to find someone with enough time to really dedicate themselves to it, but we hope to,\u201d Mr. Unger said.\u201cOne of our grandchildren took her out of the store so there was a whole thing about \u2018Where is Barista Barbie? Has she been kidnapped?\u2019\u201d said Crystal Wilkinson, who owns the store with Mr. Davis.Although social media helps spread the word, Ms. Wilkinson\u2019s focus is on staying a local shop for local customers. She even hosts Sunday salons to discuss race, gender and gentrification \u2014 all issues relevant to her patrons.\u201cWe love what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Ms. Wilkinson, a writer herself. \u201cWe keep our finger on the pulse of the community, which doesn\u2019t bring any dollars, but it helps the community and that\u2019s what matters.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I know that it\u2019s brilliant because in my first attempt at solving, I tanked pretty miserably.I blame the GHOSTs. They are haunting today\u2019s puzzle by Milo Beckman and you will eventually see them if you look carefully. But we ain\u2019t afraid of no GHOSTs, are we?This is a tough one to explain simply, but I will have to explain it for the Thursday group solve on Facebook Live, so let\u2019s consider this a dry run.The revealer clue at 35A pretty much gives away the concept, although solvers will still have quite a bit of work to do to get the theme consistently. The clue is \u201cFull of ghosts ... like four answers in this puzzle?\u201d and the answer, of course, is HAUNTED. While those four theme answers are not highlighted in any way, they may be recognizable simply because it will seem like you need more squares to fill in the correct answer. For example, at 22A, the clue is \u201cLike many celebrity memoirs,\u201d and we have a seven-letter slot. Instinctively, we know that the answer is GHOSTWRITTEN, but where to put the extra five letters? Nowhere, that\u2019s where; GHOSTs are invisible. So just fill in WRITTEN and let that GHOST float away.So kudos to Mr. Beckman and the editors on the work that went into this puzzle. More like this, please, even if I do tank miserably at them the first time. It\u2019s worth the blow to my dignity to enjoy work this good.Here is the entire GHOST theme set:22A: [GHOST] WRITTEN24A: [GHOST] TOWN51A: [GHOST] STORY53A: [GHOST] BUSTERS\u25a0 1A: Hi kids! Long before there was streaming and even Blu-ray, people recorded television programming (ask your folks) that they wanted to watch at a later date on machines called VCRs. The medium for recording was a large, brick-shaped videocassette that you inserted into the front of the machine, if the children in the household had not already inserted Play-Doh into it first, not that I would know. Your folks may even still have some video cassettes. Check under the leg of that wobbly table in the dining room.\u25a0 19A: I met the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Dangerous Group,\u201d N.W.A., back when they first got started and my ex-husband worked with them in his recording studio. They are very nice people, but showbiz spin is showbiz spin. I cannot print what the entire abbreviation of the group\u2019s name stands for, but the last two words are \u201c ... With Attitude.\u201d\u25a0 34A: Tricky! An \u201cAddress not found on a GPS\u201d is not a physical address at all; it\u2019s a URL.\u25a0 62A: ONE is the \u201cWord before \u2018Happy New Year!\u2019\u201d because we usually count down from 10 as we welcome Baby New Year.\u25a0 11D: \u201cOne involved with underground rock bands\u201d is not a groupie, at least not today. What other kinds of rock bands do you know? How about the bands of rock in mines? Yup, those. That\u2019s why today\u2019s answer is MINER.\u25a0 27D: #TodayILearned about the Amu Darya, a river that flows through the Kara Kum desert into the South Aral Sea. #NowIKnow\u25a0 31D: Oh, if only this scene from \u201cThe Big Lebowski\u201d wasn\u2019t riddled with f-bombs and such. John Goodman steals this scene, and the entire line is \u201cSmokey, this isn\u2019t \u2018NAM. This is bowling. There are rules.\u201dA few years ago, I wanted to make a puzzle where the solution involved leaving some squares blank. My original idea involved theme entries like \u201cRUNNING ON [EMPTY]\u201d and \u201c[NOTHING] PERSONAL\u201d where the Down answers only made sense if you left the bracketed words blank. But Will rejected a couple iterations of this theme idea, on the grounds that solvers wouldn\u2019t enjoy seeing a Down answer like \u201cASHG\u201d (not knowing they were supposed to leave the G blank).Then, in 2013, my laptop got stolen and I didn\u2019t have a backup of my laboriously compiled crossword dictionary, may it rest in peace. I tried to start over, but I was back to square one \u2014 AARE and IS AT and INRI in every fill! I got discouraged, and stopped constructing ... until I graduated college last year, needed some supplemental income, and decided to get back in on that crossword cash.I picked this \u201cghost\u201d idea backup, since (lacking a good dictionary) I\u2019d have to do some hand-filling anyway. I wrote a Python script to generate a list of answer pairs like HOLY LAND / HOLLAND to work with, and went from there. My submitted version didn\u2019t have the second half of the revealer clue (it was just \u201cRiddled with ghosts\u201d) since I like the idea of a gimmick puzzle that has no indication anywhere that it\u2019s a gimmick puzzle \u2014 just clues and words. But I get that people would have had too much trouble without a revealer.There you go. Easy as pie, sort of.Your thoughts?Advertisement"}

Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We\u2019re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you\u2019ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students\u2019 homework, do you feel you\u2019re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today\u2019s youth?CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that\u2019s a very good question, because I\u2019ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we\u2019re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That\u2019s why the slogan of my campaign is \u201cStronger Together,\u201d because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals \u2014 and I\u2019ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there\u2019s nothing in my opinion that America can\u2019t do. So that\u2019s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I\u2019m hoping to earn your vote, I\u2019m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that\u2019s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I\u2019ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I\u2019ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.TRUMP: And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what\u2019s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it\u2019s a one-sided transaction where we\u2019re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we\u2019ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it\u2019s in business and trade, where we\u2019re doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It\u2019s hard to believe. Inconceivable.You say who\u2019s making these deals? We\u2019re going the make great deals. We\u2019re going to have a strong border. We\u2019re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.But I want to do things that haven\u2019t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It\u2019s called make America great again.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today\u2019s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?TRUMP: No, I didn\u2019t say that at all. I don\u2019t think you understood what was \u2014 this was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I\u2019m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have \u2014 and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven\u2019t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on.Yes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We\u2019re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.COOPER: So, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.COOPER: So, for the record, you\u2019re saying you never did that?TRUMP: I\u2019ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.COOPER: Have you ever done those things?TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I\u2019m going to make our country safe. We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.We\u2019re going to make America safe again. We\u2019re going to make America great again, but we\u2019re going to make America safe again. And we\u2019re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don\u2019t do that, it just \u2014 it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they\u2019re taking our wealth.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: And that\u2019s what I want to talk about.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn\u2019t represent who he is.But I think it\u2019s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we\u2019ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We\u2019ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We\u2019ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it\u2019s not only women, and it\u2019s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That\u2019s why \u2014 to go back to your question \u2014 I want to send a message \u2014 we all should \u2014 to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.CLINTON: These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I\u2019m so fortunate enough to become your president.RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online...TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.TRUMP: It\u2019s just words, folks. It\u2019s just words. Those words, I\u2019ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.I\u2019ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I\u2019m going to help the African-Americans. I\u2019m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.She\u2019s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump \u2014 I want to get to audience questions and online questions.TRUMP: So, she\u2019s allowed to do that, but I\u2019m not allowed to respond?Reporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump during Sunday\u2019s presidential debate.RADDATZ: You\u2019re going to have \u2014 you\u2019re going to get to respond right now.TRUMP: Sounds fair.RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it\u2019s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \u201cTrump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\u201d So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I\u2019m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I\u2019m not proud of it. But that was something that happened.If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he\u2019s done to women. There\u2019s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she\u2019s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.So don\u2019t tell me about words. I am absolutely \u2014 I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who\u2019s also here tonight.And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it\u2019s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he\u2019s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people\u2019s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that\u2019s his choice.When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he\u2019s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.CLINTON: He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn\u2019t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \u201cMexican.\u201dHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal \u2014 he\u2019s another real winner that you have \u2014 and he\u2019s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You\u2019re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.Number two, Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I\u2019ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I\u2019ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.And I\u2019ll tell you what. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails \u2014 and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.So we\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor, and we\u2019re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been \u2014 their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you\u2019ve done. And it\u2019s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: I\u2019m going to let you talk about e-mails.CLINTON: ... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I\u2019m not surprised.TRUMP: Oh, really?CLINTON: In the first debate...(LAUGHTER)RADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.CLINTON: ... I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I\u2019d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we\u2019re going to really make lives better for people.So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump \u2014 you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we\u2019ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is \u2014 it\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.TRUMP: Because you\u2019d be in jail.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton...COOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You\u2019re just wasting time.RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You\u2019ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \u201cextremely careless.\u201d The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don\u2019t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say \u2014 and I\u2019ve said before, but I\u2019ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it \u2014 that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I\u2019m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.But I think it\u2019s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all \u2014 anyone who says otherwise has no basis \u2014 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.RADDATZ: OK, we\u2019re going to move on.TRUMP: And yet she didn\u2019t know the word \u2014 the letter C on a document. Right? She didn\u2019t even know what that word \u2014 what that letter meant.You know, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m watching Hillary go over facts. And she\u2019s going after fact after fact, and she\u2019s lying again, because she said she \u2014 you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don\u2019t think so.She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter\u2019s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we\u2019ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she\u2019s saying there wasn\u2019t anything wrong.And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn\u2019t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I\u2019ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did \u2014 and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.COOPER: We have to move on.TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.RADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.TRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you\u2019d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.CLINTON: Look, it\u2019s just not true. And so please, go to...TRUMP: Oh, you didn\u2019t delete them?COOPER: Allow her to respond, please.CLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.TRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.CLINTON: Not \u2014 well, we turned over 35,000, so...TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t talk while you talked.CLINTON: Yes, that\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t.TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.CLINTON: I didn\u2019t in the first debate, and I\u2019m going to try not to in this debate, because I\u2019d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.Here\u2019s how we analyzed in real time the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.TRUMP: Get off this question.CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you\u2019re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it\u2019s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let\u2019s at least focus...TRUMP: Let\u2019s see what happens...(CROSSTALK)COOPER: Allow her to respond.CLINTON: ... on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let\u2019s get to their questions.COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?TRUMP: I\u2019d like to know, Anderson, why aren\u2019t you bringing up the e-mails? I\u2019d like to know. Why aren\u2019t you bringing...COOPER: We brought up the e-mails.TRUMP: No, it hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t. And it hasn\u2019t been finished at all.COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.TRUMP: It\u2019s nice to \u2014 one on three.QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.TRUMP: No, I\u2019m a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead.(LAUGHTER)COOPER: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he\u2019s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I\u2019m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I\u2019ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.But here\u2019s what I don\u2019t want people to forget when we\u2019re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn\u2019t just that 20 million got insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can\u2019t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.Number three, women can\u2019t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you\u2019re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn\u2019t happen before.So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we\u2019ve got to get costs down. We\u2019ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: It is such a great question and it\u2019s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It\u2019s going up at numbers that nobody\u2019s ever seen worldwide. Nobody\u2019s ever seen numbers like this for health care.It\u2019s only getting worse. In \u201917, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.Obamacare will never work. It\u2019s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It\u2019s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want \u2014 and President Obama and whoever was working on it \u2014 they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven\u2019t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It\u2019s catastrophic in certain ways.But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody\u2019s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you\u2019re never going to be able to use it.COOPER: Mr. Trump, your time...TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \u201cthe craziest thing in the world,\u201d saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it\u2019s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That\u2019s where the vast majority of people get their health care.And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn\u2019t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn\u2019t have the money to afford insurance and didn\u2019t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald\u2019s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...COOPER: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: ... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...COOPER: Your time is up.CLINTON: ... you may not be able to have insurance because you can\u2019t afford it. So let\u2019s fix what\u2019s broken about it, but let\u2019s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That\u2019s not going to work.COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want \u2014 just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything\u2019s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.COOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare...TRUMP: By the way...COOPER: You\u2019ve said you want to end Obamacare. You\u2019ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you\u2019re no longer mandating that every American get insurance?TRUMP: We\u2019re going to be able to. You\u2019re going to have plans...COOPER: What does that mean?TRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what it means. You\u2019re going to have plans that are so good, because we\u2019re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out \u2014 once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...COOPER: Are you going \u2014 are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?TRUMP: President Obama \u2014 Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said \u2014 he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn\u2019t work.But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we\u2019ll also be able to help people that can\u2019t get \u2014 don\u2019t have money because we are going to have people protected.And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We\u2019re going to block grant into the states. We\u2019re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: ... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.RADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.QUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I\u2019m one of them. You\u2019ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re first.TRUMP: Well, you\u2019re right about Islamophobia, and that\u2019s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that \u2014 because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They\u2019ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.And, you know, there\u2019s always a reason for everything. If they don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible \u2014 these are radical Islamic terrorists.And she won\u2019t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won\u2019t use the term \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won\u2019t say the name and President Obama won\u2019t say the name. But the name is there. It\u2019s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I\u2019ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there\u2019s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.I want to say just a couple of things. First, we\u2019ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we\u2019ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.CLINTON: My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That\u2019s what America is. That\u2019s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.It\u2019s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I\u2019ve met with a lot of them, and I\u2019ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that\u2019s what I want to see.It\u2019s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. \u201cDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\u201d Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?TRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands \u2014 excuse me. Excuse me..RADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you \u2014 no, answer the question. Do you still believe... TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.RADDATZ: I do.TRUMP: Why don\u2019t you interrupt her?RADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?TRUMP: It\u2019s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they\u2019re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don\u2019t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That\u2019s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children \u2014 think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he\u2019d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we\u2019re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he\u2019s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It\u2019s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.TRUMP: That\u2019s not been debunked.CLINTON: So, please...TRUMP: That has not been debunked.CLINTON: ... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.TRUMP: I was against \u2014 I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, I just want to say...RADDATZ: There\u2019s been lots of fact-checking on that. I\u2019d like to move on to an online question...TRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.RADDATZ: She did not.TRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?RADDATZ: Very quickly, please.TRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don\u2019t want them. In some cases, they\u2019re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don\u2019t want them.And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that\u2019s OK, we can\u2019t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I\u2019m going to force them right back into their country. They\u2019re murderers and some very bad people.And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen.ICE just endorsed me. They\u2019ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn\u2019t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It\u2019s a horrible thing she\u2019s doing. She\u2019s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition\u2019s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu (ph), from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \u201cLincoln.\u201d It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great \u2014 I thought a great display of presidential leadership.But, you know, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s accurate information, and then they put it out.We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they\u2019re not doing it to get me elected. They\u2019re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.CLINTON: Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don\u2019t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...RADDATZ: We\u2019re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re out of time.CLINTON: ... with the Russians and other foreign powers.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because \u2014 so ridiculous. Look, now she\u2019s blaming \u2014 she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things \u2014 WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t...(LAUGHTER)OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That\u2019s the good thing. That\u2019s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That\u2019s a big, big difference. We\u2019re talking about some difference.But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don\u2019t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don\u2019t know Putin.But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are \u2014 she doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know \u2014 I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don\u2019t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have \u2014 first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who\u2019s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her \u2014 took massive deductions.I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But \u2014 but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I\u2019ll release my returns. I\u2019ll be very proud to. They\u2019re actually quite great.RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.COOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?QUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.TRUMP: Well, one thing I\u2019d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She\u2019s a United States \u2014 she was a United States senator.She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn\u2019t she change it? Why didn\u2019t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn\u2019t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn\u2019t change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.But \u2014 and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I\u2019ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \u201cI wish you would have done this.\u201d But she\u2019s been there for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.We\u2019re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I\u2019m lowering taxes actually, because I think it\u2019s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving \u2014 massive corporations and little ones, little ones can\u2019t form. We\u2019re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.But we\u2019re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We\u2019re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She\u2019s raising your taxes really high. And what that\u2019s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I\u2019m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There\u2019s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it\u2019s like a national catastrophe. We\u2019re down at 1 percent. And that\u2019s, like, no growth. And we\u2019re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I\u2019m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it\u2019s so important \u2014 one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody\u2019s taxes massively.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?CLINTON: Well, everything you\u2019ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I\u2019m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn\u2019t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he\u2019s going to do.But I\u2019ll tell you what he\u2019s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they\u2019ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.Now, here\u2019s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year \u2014 and that\u2019s the vast majority of Americans as you know \u2014 will have their taxes raised, because I think we\u2019ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It\u2019s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who\u2019s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it\u2019s been unfortunate, but it\u2019s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.CLINTON: And we\u2019re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.COOPER: Thank you. I want to give you \u2014 Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she\u2019s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You\u2019ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?TRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.COOPER: So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?TRUMP: A lot of my \u2014 excuse me, Anderson \u2014 a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she\u2019ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That\u2019s why.See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that\u2019s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and it\u2019s extremely complex \u2014 Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary\u2019s leaving. Very interesting why she\u2019s leaving carried interest.But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won\u2019t mention their names, because they\u2019re rich, but they\u2019re not famous. So we won\u2019t make them famous.COOPER: So can you \u2014 can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?TRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it\u2019s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she\u2019s given it to us.Hey, if she had a problem \u2014 for 30 years she\u2019s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn\u2019t she do something about it? She doesn\u2019t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it\u2019s all talk and no action.COOPER: In the past...TRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it\u2019s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She\u2019s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they\u2019ve left, that\u2019s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they\u2019re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.COOPER: Secretary \u2014 I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, here we go again. I\u2019ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that\u2019s not the point here.TRUMP: Why didn\u2019t you do it? Why didn\u2019t you do it?COOPER: Allow her to respond.CLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.TRUMP: Oh, really?CLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That\u2019s exactly right.TRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective \u2014 if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn\u2019t interrupt you.CLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \u201c30 years this and 30 years that.\u201d So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I\u2019m very glad to do so.Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women\u2019s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.COOPER: Thank you, secretary.CLINTON: I\u2019ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I\u2019ve produced results for people.COOPER: Thank you, secretary.RADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.TRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...RADDATZ: No, we can \u2014 no, Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to go on. This is about the audience.TRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we\u2019re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world\u2019s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.So this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn\u2019t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.CLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.Russia hasn\u2019t paid any attention to ISIS. They\u2019re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it\u2019s all in, in Syria. And they\u2019ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve stood up to Russia. I\u2019ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that\u2019s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That\u2019s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It\u2019s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...CLINTON: No, I wasn\u2019t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...TRUMP: OK. But you were in contact \u2014 excuse me. You were...CLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.TRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don\u2019t think he would be listening to you very much anymore.Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they\u2019ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We\u2019re tired. We\u2019re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn\u2019t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it\u2019s in Iraq or anywhere else, we\u2019re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi\u2019s out. It\u2019s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I\u2019m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she\u2019s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it\u2019s been a disaster.But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn\u2019t there, but possibly she\u2019s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone\u2019s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I\u2019ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There\u2019s only one problem. You don\u2019t even know who the rebels are. So what\u2019s the purpose?RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.TRUMP: And one thing I have to say.RADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.TRUMP: I don\u2019t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president...(LAUGHTER)... what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.TRUMP: OK. He and I haven\u2019t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.RADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?TRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it\u2019s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn\u2019t.RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?TRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?TRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can\u2019t they do it quietly? Why can\u2019t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we\u2019ve knocked out the leaders, we\u2019ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we\u2019re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they\u2019re saying? How stupid is our country? RADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.TRUMP: I can\u2019t think of any. I can\u2019t think of any. And I\u2019m pretty good at it.RADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.TRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have \u2014 look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can\u2019t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How \u2014 why would these people stay there? I\u2019ve been reading now...RADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.TRUMP: ... for weeks \u2014 I\u2019ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it\u2019s the harbor of where \u2014 you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying \u2014 they\u2019re not staying there anymore. They\u2019re gone. Because everybody\u2019s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can\u2019t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we\u2019re doing in the Middle East.RADDATZ: I\u2019m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?CLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don\u2019t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don\u2019t think that is a smart strategy.I do think the use of special forces, which we\u2019re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...RADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I \u2014 if I\u2019m fortunate...TRUMP: Everything.CLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn\u2019t.There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders \u2014 and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones \u2014 made a difference. So I think that could help.I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there\u2019s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to move on...TRUMP: You know what\u2019s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don\u2019t stop her. When I go one second over, it\u2019s like a big deal.RADDATZ: You had many answers.TRUMP: It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s really very interesting.COOPER: We\u2019ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?QUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?COOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I\u2019ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she\u2019s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn\u2019t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she\u2019s lied about a lot of things.TRUMP: I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what\u2019s happening to our inner cities. She\u2019s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn\u2019t get it done.Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don\u2019t get it done. You go into the inner cities and \u2014 you see it\u2019s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 you know, and I\u2019ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can\u2019t get any worse. And she\u2019s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing\u2019s going to ever happen.Let me tell you, if she\u2019s president of the United States, nothing\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She\u2019s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others\u2019 favors, she\u2019s doing me favors.COOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.TRUMP: But I will tell you, she\u2019s all talk. It doesn\u2019t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.COOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?TRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.COOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I\u2019ve been in public service. I\u2019m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos \u2014 one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn\u2019t have a place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He\u2019s 10 years old now. This is the only one country he\u2019s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there\u2019s a lot of fear \u2014 in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.COOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don\u2019t vote for me, I still want to be your president.COOPER: Your two minutes is up.CLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters are, quote, \u201cdeplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\u201d You later said you regretted saying half. You didn\u2019t express regret for using the term \u201cdeplorables.\u201d To Mr. Carter\u2019s question, how can you unite a country if you\u2019ve written off tens of millions of Americans?CLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It\u2019s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he\u2019s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said \u2014 I\u2019m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.COOPER: Thank you.CLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...COOPER: Thank you, Secretary.TRUMP: ... but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.COOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.TRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that\u2019s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her \u2014 and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they\u2019re irredeemable, you didn\u2019t mention that, but when she said they\u2019re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.COOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.TRUMP: She\u2019s got tremendous \u2014 she\u2019s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting with her.COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn\u2019t have it, quote, \u201che or she won\u2019t be one for very long.\u201d In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?TRUMP: No, there wasn\u2019t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.COOPER: You mentioned sex tape.TRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn\u2019t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...COOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?TRUMP: ... 600 \u2014 wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, but I won\u2019t even mention that. But she said she\u2019ll be awake. Who\u2019s going \u2014 the famous thing, we\u2019re going to answer our call at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens \u2014 Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who\u2019s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn\u2019t be talking about that.Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It\u2019s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I\u2019m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.COOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?CLINTON: No.TRUMP: I\u2019m shocked to hear that.(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Well, it\u2019s not only my opinion. It\u2019s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it\u2019s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it\u2019s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.And it\u2019s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you\u2019ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.COOPER: We have to move along.CLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to...CLINTON: Five million homes were lost.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re moving.CLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We\u2019re almost out of time. We have another... TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.RADDATZ: We\u2019re moving to an audience question.TRUMP: It is \u2014 our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you.(LAUGHTER)We have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.QUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?RADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Thank you. Well, you\u2019re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn\u2019t agree with that.I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don\u2019t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.I want a Supreme Court that doesn\u2019t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you\u2019re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn\u2019t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they\u2019ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You\u2019re out of time. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I\u2019m looking for judges \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They\u2019ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in \u2014 of my money, meaning I\u2019m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she\u2019s doing. What I ask is this.So I\u2019m putting in more than \u2014 by the time it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We\u2019re raising money for the Republican Party, and we\u2019re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.I ask Hillary, why doesn\u2019t \u2014 she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn\u2019t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don\u2019t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?It\u2019s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren\u2019t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You\u2019ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you\u2019ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren\u2019t you putting money into your own campaign? I\u2019m just curious.CLINTON: Well...(CROSSTALK)RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We\u2019re going to get on to one more question.CLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you.RADDATZ: We have \u2014 we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.CLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.COOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?QUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?COOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?TRUMP: Absolutely. I think it\u2019s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our \u2014 buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.We are killing \u2014 absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I\u2019m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable \u2014 we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.I will bring our energy companies back. They\u2019ll be able to compete. They\u2019ll make money. They\u2019ll pay off our national debt. They\u2019ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.You take a look at what\u2019s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they\u2019re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It\u2019s a disgrace.COOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.TRUMP: It\u2019s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.CLINTON: And actually \u2014 well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That\u2019s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don\u2019t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.You know, because it sounds like you\u2019re in the business or you\u2019re aware of people in the business \u2014 you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that\u2019s an important transition.We\u2019ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.But I also want to be sure that we don\u2019t leave people behind. That\u2019s why I\u2019m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don\u2019t want to walk away from them. So we\u2019ve got to do something for them.COOPER: Secretary Clinton...CLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.COOPER: Your time is up.CLINTON: And that\u2019s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.COOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more...RADDATZ: We have...COOPER: One more audience question.RADDATZ: We\u2019ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.QUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?CLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that\u2019s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don\u2019t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.So I believe that this election has become in part so \u2014 so conflict-oriented, so intense because there\u2019s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It\u2019s one of the most consequential elections that we\u2019ve had.And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that\u2019s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I\u2019ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don\u2019t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great \u2014 I\u2019m very proud of my children. And they\u2019ve done a wonderful job, and they\u2019ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.I will say this about Hillary. She doesn\u2019t quit. She doesn\u2019t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She\u2019s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she\u2019s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.RADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.COOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.RADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "MailChimp and the Un-Silicon Valley Way to Make It as a Start-Up", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtATLANTA \u2014 The typical start-up fairy tale goes something like this: You begin with young entrepreneurs from Stanford or Harvard who have come up with some novel idea for disrupting restaurants or dog walking or whatever else.After creating a prototype, the guys (they are almost always men) enter start-up boot camps like Y Combinator, recruit a group of early investors, and perhaps launch a Kickstarter with a slick video. If the initial plan succeeds, the founders go into heedless expansion mode, which usually means selling off huge chunks of their company in exchange for gobs of money from venture capitalists. Then, after a few years, if all goes according to plan, they hit the big time \u2014 an initial public offering and a chance to be the next face of the future.Well, sometimes. What\u2019s often left out of the start-up dream story is any mention that there\u2019s another way.In fact, it\u2019s possible to create a huge tech company without taking venture capital, and without spending far beyond your means. It\u2019s possible, in other words, to start a tech company that runs more like a normal business than a debt-fueled rocket ship careening out of control. Believe it or not, start-ups don\u2019t even have to be headquartered in San Francisco or Silicon Valley.Under the radar, slowly and steadily, and without ever taking a dime in outside funding or spending more than it earned, MailChimp has been building a behemoth. According to Ben Chestnut, MailChimp\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, the company recorded $280 million in revenue in 2015 and is on track to top $400 million in 2016. MailChimp has always been profitable, Mr. Chestnut said, though he declined to divulge exact margins. The company \u2014 which has repeatedly turned down overtures from venture capitalists and is wholly owned by Mr. Chestnut and his co-founder, Dan Kurzius \u2014 now employs about 550 people, and by next year it will be close to 700.As a private company, MailChimp has long kept its business metrics secret, but Mr. Chestnut wants to publicize its numbers now to show the road less traveled: If you want to run a successful tech company, you don\u2019t have to follow the path of \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d You can simply start a business, run it to serve your customers, and forget about outside investors and growth at any cost.There are downsides to this approach. MailChimp\u2019s path was circuitous, and it came without the glory of enormous funding rounds. But it is also suffused with a basic common sense.\u201cOne of the problems with raising money is it teaches you bad habits from the start,\u201d said Jason Fried, the co-founder of the software company Basecamp, who has written frequently on the perversions of the venture capital industry. \u201cIf you\u2019re an entrepreneur and you have a bunch of money in the bank, you get good at spending money.\u201dBut if companies are forced to generate revenue from the beginning, \u201cwhat you get really good at is making money,\u201d Mr. Fried said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a much better habit for a business to work on early on, to survive on their own rather than be dependent on money people.\u201dFor MailChimp, these lessons didn\u2019t have to be learned \u2014 they were simply a necessary part of running the business. \u201cThe whole point of this business is to prove to small businesses that you can do this, because we did it,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said.MailChimp is run out of two sprawling floors in the Ponce City Market, a massive complex in Atlanta\u2019s Old Fourth Ward neighborhood that was originally built as a Sears Roebuck warehouse. \u201cA lot of people think it\u2019s cool and vintage, but it\u2019s actually a neat reminder of disruption,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. \u201cSears used to be the biggest thing, and then it went away.\u201dOn a recent visit, I found all the trappings of start-up life seen in countless offices in the Bay Area: Stylish d\u00e9cor, kitschy accents (there are paintings and sculptures of MailChimp\u2019s logo, a chimp named Freddie, all over), and zany conference room names. The walls of MailChimp\u2019s boardroom are covered from floor to ceiling in vintage skateboards, which Mr. Kurzius collects. Get it? It\u2019s a \u201cboard room.\u201dMailChimp wasn\u2019t always this fancy. Mr. Chestnut and Mr. Kurzius founded the company in 2000, at the crest of the dot-com bubble, after they had gotten laid off from corporate web design jobs. They used their small severance checks to start a firm they called the Rocket Science Group, which offered design consulting for large and small businesses in Atlanta.Late in 2000, some of those customers started asking for ways to reach their customers by email. Mr. Chestnut thought he could repurpose some old code he had used to create a failed online greeting card business. One of his old greeting cards featured a drawing of a chimp, so he thought he would call the new email service ChimpMail, but the domain name was taken. So he went with MailChimp.For years, the pair ran the email service as a side project to the main web design gig. Around 2006, they began to grow wary of web design; the business was growing, but not very quickly, and they weren\u2019t passionate about it.What Mr. Chestnut and Mr. Kurzius were passionate about was helping small businesses grow. They had both been raised in entrepreneurial families \u2014 Mr. Chestnut\u2019s mother ran a salon out of her kitchen, and Mr. Kurzius\u2019s father was a baker whose business was forced to close after Wonder Bread moved into town \u2014 and they thought that maligned as it was, email presented a low-cost marketing channel for companies on small budgets. In 2007, they stopped doing web design and focused exclusively on MailChimp.At the time, MailChimp faced a host of larger and better-capitalized rivals, including Constant Contact, which went public late in 2007. But Mr. Chestnut said MailChimp had a proximity to its customers that its competitors lacked. Because MailChimp was itself a small business, it understood what those businesses wanted out of their marketing tools. Its offerings were cheaper, it added features more quickly, and it allowed greater customizations to fit customers\u2019 needs.Though Mr. Chestnut insists that he isn\u2019t worried about the longevity of email \u2014 people have been predicting its death for years, and email just keeps getting more important \u2014 the company is also pushing into other channels, including social media. The next phase of MailChimp, he said, is to become a one-stop shop for the entirety of a small business\u2019s marketing needs.Its future is far from assured \u2014 new modes of communication like voice and text messaging could undermine email, and there is always the threat of some large platform like Facebook or Google building a rival to MailChimp. Still, to Mr. Chestnut, MailChimp\u2019s future is more secure if he and Mr. Kurzius control the company, rather than run it at the behest of outside investors.\u201cEvery time we sat down with potential investors, they never seemed to understand small business,\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. Venture capitalists always wanted MailChimp to serve \u201centerprise companies,\u201d large businesses with thousands of employees and, potentially, thousands to spend.\u201cEverybody we talked to said, \u2018You\u2019re sitting on a gold mine, and if you pivot to enterprise, you could be huge,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chestnut said. \u201cBut something in our gut always said that didn\u2019t feel right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Men Who Found Bomb in Chelsea Are Identified as Airline Security Guards", "Date": "2016-09-30", "News": "Supported bySurveillance footage showed two men finding the bag on West 27th Street on the evening of Sept. 17, soon after a bomb exploded on West 23rd Street, injuring 31 people and triggering terrorism fears across the region.In the video, the men were seen pulling from the travel bag a white plastic bag that contained a pressure cooker connected to wires and a mobile phone. They left the white bag on the sidewalk and walked away with the travel bag. The bomb did not explode, and investigators have said that the men may have inadvertently disabled the device.The two men, identified as Hassan Ali and Abou Bakr Radwan, had flown to New York from here, serving as unarmed security guards on the flight, the officials said.American investigators released footage of the two men, appealing for help in identifying them.The EgyptAir officials who identified them as Mr. Ali and Mr. Radwan spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The officials said they believed that the two employees were not connected to Mr. Rahami or the bomb plot.\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what was in it,\u201d one of the officials said of the travel bag. Mr. Ali \u201ctold me he saw it and thought it was nice,\u201d the official recalled. \u201cHe opened the bag to check it out and found a pot.\u201dMr. Ali did not want to go to the trouble of flying the pot back to Cairo, the official said, so he put it aside and left with the travel bag.\u201cYou know, we see things left on the street in New York all the time,\u201d the official said. \u201cStuff no one wants. It\u2019s normal to take them.\u201dThe two men told friends and colleagues that they had not read the news or realized the significance of their find until Egyptian reporters started calling EgyptAir, the officials said.One of the officials said Mr. Ali and Mr. Radwan flew back to Cairo the day after the episode. American investigators have not been able to interview them, the officials said.Egyptian police officers went to Cairo International Airport on Friday to question the two men but were unable to find them because it was their day off, one of the officials said.Mr. Ali and Mr. Radwan have not been disciplined by EgyptAir, staff members of the airline said. Tarek Attiya, a spokesman for the police, said he could not deny or confirm any of the developments.Friday\u2019s revelation is troubling for Egypt, whose aviation security procedures have come under intense scrutiny after three major air disasters in the past year.EgyptAir employs in-flight security officers like Mr. Ali and Mr. Radwan to maintain order during flights and to ensure that planes are secure during stopovers at foreign airports. Unlike the undercover air marshals who travel on American carriers, Egyptian security officials are unarmed and can be identified by an understated uniform. Generally, one security officer sits near the front of the cabin and another toward the rear. In some foreign airports they are responsible for searching workers who clean planes between flights. When a plane is in the air, they sometimes deal with unruly passengers.They receive modest training and are typically paid about $400 a month. Before the identities of the men who found the bag were revealed, Dina el-Fouly, a spokeswoman for EgyptAir, said that they were not EgyptAir workers and that the men shown in the surveillance footage did not resemble any of their employees. Ms. Foulycould not be reached for comment after the men were identified.But images from Mr. Radwan\u2019s Facebook page appear to match one of the men in a photograph released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The F.B.I. declined to comment.Both Mr. Ali and Mr. Radwan have no known political affiliations, according to several EgyptAir officials. \u201cThese guys are harmless; they would be useless in a fist fight,\u201d one of the airline officials said. \u201cThey cannot be in any way involved.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t understand that they are wanted as witnesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are shocked and scared now. Radwan is especially scared. The poor guy is always anxious.\u201d\u201cPlease, I cannot say anything,\u201d Mr. Radwan said when reached by phone on Friday. \u201cThere is a spokesperson for the company. Speak to them.\u201d He then ended the call.Mr. Radwan\u2019s last public post on Facebook came a day before the attacks in New York and New Jersey. It is a video of a man urging people not to associate Islam with terrorism.Several attempts to reach Mr. Ali on Friday through an intermediary were unsuccessful.Declan Walsh contributed reporting from New York, and Adam Goldman from Washington.Advertisement"}

He was upstairs bathing their three children. \u201cShould I save you the leftovers?\u201dHer phone vibrated: \u201cSure.\u201dMs. Zheng, a 37-year-old stay-at-home mother in Oakton, Va., describes her marriage as happy, and she\u2019s thankful for those kinds of small conveniences that her smartphone affords her. But like most couples, there are also times, when her husband pecks away at a screen, that she wants to toss his device away with the table scraps.Just the other day, Ms. Zheng was talking to her husband about their plans for the weekend, and when he didn\u2019t respond, she realized he was buried in his phone answering a work email. She tried again, and when he failed to even look up, she lost her temper \u2014 something she rarely does.\u201cCan\u2019t you just acknowledge me?\u201d she hollered. \u201cI\u2019m standing right here.\u201d Mr. Zheng promptly placed his phone on the table. (Since then, she has made her point a bit more clearly by texting him her questions, even if they\u2019re in the same room, since she knows she\u2019ll get a response.)We live in a culture of dings, beeps and buzzes, as most people manage everything from bank accounts to fantasy football teams on their smartphones.Spouses may pout if their partners don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d their every Facebook post, an expectation, for some, of marital boosting. Pull out your device to check the baseball scores while on a date with your wife, and you\u2019re bound to get an eye roll.Type an actress\u2019s name into IMDb while watching TV and suddenly you\u2019re on a 10-minute bender into the black hole of your screen, distracted by a text or game notification. \u201cAre you even watching?\u201d your husband snaps.Married or not, many of us sleep with our phones on our night stands, pocket them as we go from room to room and think nothing of using them in the presence of our partners, whether they are talking or snuggling or reading beside us.Experts say that smartphone use is meddling in our marriages in ways that are sometimes benign but often frustrating, causing quarrels and forcing couples to address an ever more important question: At what point are we choosing to spend more time with our smartphones than with our spouses?Many couples work hard to reduce their screen time while around their children; several couples interviewed said they have a policy of no phones at the dinner table.Elizabeth Sciupac, 31, a research associate at a think tank in Washington, said she realized one night that she and her husband, Ivan, 41, were at the same table but worlds apart.\u201cWe\u2019d been at work all day, and instead of talking to each other, we\u2019d be looking down at our screens,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were like: \u2018We can\u2019t keep doing this. We\u2019re not even having a conversation.\u2019\u201dThey\u2019ve tried to enforce the no-smartphone rule on dinner tables most of the time, but when their 2-year-old goes to sleep, they engage in a bit of a screentime free-for-all.\u201cWe definitely have things that bug each other,\u201d Mr. Sciupac said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand when we\u2019re watching a TV show and she\u2019s on Candy Crush, because she\u2019s not actually paying attention, but she insists she is.\u201dDr. Sameer Sheth, 40, is a neurosurgeon who lives in Scarsdale, N.Y., with his wife, Sarita Sheth, 39, and their two children (who are in elementary school). He is inclined to catch up on work emails as soon as his family is busy with an activity; it\u2019s the nature of his job, he said.Ms. Sheth, who admits that she is guilty of pulling out her phone during family dinners, said that the sight of her husband answering emails on a Saturday morning can make her hair stand up, because it feels as if he\u2019s bowing out of the day.\u201cIsn\u2019t there something you could do around the house? Aren\u2019t there any light bulbs that need fixing?\u201d she\u2019ll say. When asked why it bothers her, she doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cBecause when he\u2019s home, it\u2019s our time. I want him to be here.\u201d And by that, she means mentally, not just physically.Marital therapists say the feeling of vying with a smartphone for your partner\u2019s attention isn\u2019t unique, especially because of just how often we\u2019re looking down, rather than up.While 72 percent of adult internet users reported that the internet has had \u201cno real impact at all\u201d on their marriage, of those that did see an impact, 20 percent said it was mostly negative. A quarter of respondents said that partners were distracted by their cellphone when they were together. But therapists say it\u2019s not that smartphone use leads to divorce, just that it strains existing tensions.Steve Brody, a psychologist, said he often hears this refrain in his therapy practice in Cambria, Calif.: \u201cMy husband spends too much time on his phone.\u201dWhile men and women are equally tethered to their devices, it seems, anecdotally at least, as if women may be more sensitive to the rejection felt when a spouse looks at his phone than a husband is.\u201cWomen immediately think, \u2018He doesn\u2019t want to be with me,\u2019\u201d Dr. Brody said. \u201cIt gives them a sense of separateness.\u201dHe chuckles at the thought that even he and his wife, Cathy Brody, who is also a marriage and family therapist, have struggled with each other\u2019s screen time. (For them, laptops are the issue; they don\u2019t get smartphone service at home in the mountains.)While Dr. Brody likes to stay up reading the news and checking email, his wife thought it was crucial that they go to bed at the same time. \u201cIt was hard for me to give that up,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she\u2019s right: It\u2019s an important time to spend together.\u201dIf couples don\u2019t actually speak to each other before bedtime, they\u2019re unlikely to crawl into bed anywhere close to being in the mood. Call it verbal foreplay, said Susan Heitler, a Denver clinical psychologist and relationship coach.For women, a great conversation with your partner is a turn-on, since it makes you feel emotionally close. But men are often turned on by visual signals. This can be a problem when both people are buried in a screen, she said.Smartphones may be particularly disruptive if both partners are on their phones in bed.Therapists say that when a marriage hits a rocky patch, they\u2019ve seen one or both partners hide behind their phones. Dr. Heitler said that one of her clients feared his wife was attracted to her flirtatious boss; rather than address it, he grew depressed and spent more and more time gaming on his smartphone.\u201cIt distracted him, but it didn\u2019t fix the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked with them on learning how to talk to each other again. I think that\u2019s getting lost in relationships today.\u201dAnd when Dr. Jamie Borin, a urologist in Manhattan, awakes from a good night\u2019s sleep and rolls over to chat with his wife, Dr. Stacy Loeb, also a urologist, she\u2019s often on her phone.\u201cIt helps me wake up,\u201d she said, noting she spends some of her free time on Twitter. When she begins texting her husband at the end of the day about dinner plans (\u201cFifteen texts may come through: What should we eat? Take in or eat out? What neighborhood?\u201d), he often just picks up the phone to call her.\u201cI don\u2019t have the patience for that kind of back and forth,\u201d he said. They chalk it up to age differences: he is 45, she is 36.Dr. Borin said, \u201cI\u2019d just rather talk.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementOctober 25, 2016Matthew RojanskyKathryn StonerDonald Trump, defending his peculiar admiration of Vladimir Putin, has declared as though it were his own idea, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if actually got along, as an example, with Russia?\u201d In fact, it has been nice \u2013 for the United States and for Russia, and it has happened many times over the last 30 years. The United States and the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev signed the most sweeping arms reduction agreements in history. Under Russia\u2019s first president, Boris Yeltsin, Russia entered the Group of 8 with American support and joined peacekeeping forces in Kosovo, while the United States supplied aid to the Russian economy. When Yeltsin\u2019s successor Vladimir Putin came into office in 2000, the relationship between Russia and the United States continued to be relatively close, although relations soured over NATO expansion and the invasion of Iraq. Still, in his first administration, Putin was the first foreign leader  to express condolences to President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, and vowed to help the United States in its war on terrorism. Under Putin\u2019s successor (and then predecessor), Dmitri Medvedev, and the tenure of Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, a \u201creset\u201d in relations resulted in the New Start Treaty, further reducing nuclear weapons, and on the Northern Distribution Network, which enabled supplies to flow through Russia into Afghanistan for U.S. efforts there, and the American support of Russia\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization.But when Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, cooperation with the U.S. ended. It was not the U.S. that declared game over, it was Trump\u2019s friend. As the long history of cooperation demonstrates, there is no structural reason Russia and the U.S. cannot get along. They have and did for over 30 years. It was Putin\u2019s offer of asylum to rogue U.S. security contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, followed by his unanticipated demand that the U.S. Agency for International Development leave Russia the same year, harassment of the U.S. ambassador and other embassy officials since, and finally his seizure of Crimea in Ukraine in 2014 and support of a low boil conflict in eastern Ukraine that ended cooperation. The next U.S. president will inherit not a \u201cRussia problem\u201d but a Putin problem, which makes Trump\u2019s position not only odd, but dangerous. The current U.S. approach to Russia has failed.  Moscow is ostensibly isolated and subject to sanctions.  Yet it has not appreciably changed its course on Ukraine or Syria; instead it is escalating and broadening the conflict via nuclear saber rattling, cyber attacks and information warfare.  Meanwhile it has re-established considerable influence throughout the Middle East, the former Soviet region, and even East Asia and Latin America.  What is to be done?First, we need to stop obsessing over Putin.  Our problem is with Russia.  Putin stands in the mainstream of a centuries-old Russian foreign policy tradition and worldview and he enjoys broad elite support and popular consent for his policies.  Any approach premised mainly on \"being tough\" with Putin (as Hillary Clinton promises) or on charming him into making a deal (as Trump does) misses the point entirely. Second, we need to stop pursuing policies with the expectation either that Russia will change into a friendly democracy or that it can be fully defeated and sidelined.  Neither is remotely likely in the foreseeable future.  Instead, we need an approach to engaging Russia that extracts the best balance of cooperation and competition from across a web of interrelated issues.  How we deter Russia in the Baltic will influence how hard Russia pushes in Syria, just as how we frame a deal on Ukraine and sanctions relief will shape Russia\u2019s options for energy and economic engagement, whether with China and Iran, or with U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia.Finally, we need to re-establish dialogue.  Not for its own sake, but as an indispensable tool for advancing our national interests.  Closing the door on previously established bilateral channels was a mistake, yet another case of the \"we talk to reward good behavior and don't talk when we disagree\" syndrome in U.S. diplomacy.  When Washington declares it will no longer talk to Russia about Syria, that doesn't change the reality that Russia holds the keys to stopping the humanitarian catastrophe and re-launching negotiations aimed at a durable settlement.  When we seek to impose diplomatic isolation, it creates an incentive for the Russians to raise the risk level \u2014 such as with near-miss incidents at sea and in the air \u2014 until we are forced to talk.Most of all, we need coordination and consistency on our side.  The worst kind of policy is the kind that every official, politician and analyst understands differently.  The next president will need a trusted senior figure to serve as the main channel between the White House and the Kremlin.  That job is needed when relations are going well just as much as when they are going badly.Matt raises some important issues, but the problem isn\u2019t structural and isn\u2019t, therefore, about Russia, as much as it is about Russia\u2019s current leader and the situation in which he has put himself and his countrymen. As the past examples of U.S.-Russia cooperation I provided initially demonstrate, working together to mutual benefit has not always been the problem that it is now. The relationship has, of course, been troubled at times, but there is lots of blame to go around. It is a mistake to point the finger exclusively at the United States and a purported misunderstanding on the part of American policy makers of Russia\u2019s vital \u201chistorical\u201d interests. We have understood those interests pretty well over time and often supported them \u2013 including supporting Russian membership in the World Trade Organization and the G-8, and working closely with Russia to come to an agreement with Iran over its nuclear program even as it helped the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad stay in power in Syria.Focusing on Putin is not \u201cobsessing,\u201d as Matt puts it. Gennady Zyuganov, the longtime head of the Russian Communist Party recently noted in a meeting of newly elected parliamentarians that the current Russian president can exercise \u201cmore power than that of the general secretary of the Soviet Union.\u201d That was not true of any previous presidents of Russia \u2013 not Boris Yeltsin, whom the Russian Duma attempted to impeach; and not Medvedev, who was reliant for his support and legitimacy on his prime minister, Putin. Thus, the authority within his country that Putin has amassed is not structural; it is personal. Civil society organizations are effectively banned from political expression. Therefore, the next U.S. president must focus on Putin since our best information is that he has made his own interest in staying in power and maintaining the system he has built in the last 16 years is what dominates Russia\u2019s foreign policy choices at the moment.\nWould it be \u201cnice\u201d if Russia and the United States could cooperate?  Maybe.  It depends entirely on the purpose of that cooperation, and how it fits into a broader balance of interactions that advances our national interests.  Cooperation itself is not a valid foreign policy goal, just as friendship between the leaders in Moscow and Washington is not an end in itself.So, while it is absolutely true that Vladimir Putin has declared \u201cgame over\u201d on U.S.-Russia cooperation, what matters far more is that U.S. policy toward Russia is now preoccupied with shaming, pressuring and outmaneuvering Putin, instead of addressing the fundamental drivers of an increasingly dangerous conflict with Russia.  No U.S. policy can effectively decide for Russians whether Putin stays or goes, nor can U.S. pressure predictably influence what Putin, or any other Russian, thinks and says.  So it makes sense to deal instead with the concrete problem of what must be done where U.S. interests and Russian interests interact.Where Washington and Moscow\u2019s goals are complementary, as on nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism, cooperation is clearly desirable.  Yet, as Russia\u2019s recent withdrawal from the Plutonium Disposition Agreement and its skipping of President Obama\u2019s Nuclear Security Summit illustrate, the overall balance of relations may be such that one or both sides prefer not to cooperate, even when it might be in their interest to do so.One way not to solve the problem is to continue our focus on cooperation as a search for good conversations with Russia about areas of ostensible agreement, while putting off hard but necessary conversations about our persistent disagreements.  Unfortunately, the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201creset\u201d succumbed to exactly this pattern.  There should be no doubt that by 2012, Vladimir Putin had embraced harsh anti-Americanism as a central theme of his orchestrated return to the Kremlin.  But by that same time, positive conversations about cooperation on Afghanistan, arms control and trade had also run out of steam.  What remained were persistent disagreements over NATO, Russia\u2019s treatment of its own citizens and the post-Soviet space, especially Georgia and Ukraine.  These disputes had been left to fester, often developing into domestic political wedge issues, so that their champions on both sides had an easy time derailing and displacing what remained of the cooperative \u201creset\u201d agenda.Rather than marshaling reasons why the collapse of U.S.-Russia cooperation is mostly Vladimir Putin\u2019s fault, we should ask whether applying a different mix of diplomatic, economic and security instruments in our disagreements with Russia, such as over Ukraine and Syria, might produce a different outcome \u2014 one in which both Russians and Americans saw their interests advanced through cooperation.Russia is enabling the slaughter in Syria, occupies part of Ukraine and threatens action in the Baltic region. But would it still make sense for the United States to try to deal more closely with Russia?"}
{"Headline": "Granting Shares for Fares: An Uber Rival\u2019s Play for Drivers", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byPrototypeWhen Kathleen Boylan walked into an orientation meeting last spring for a new ride-hailing company called Juno, held at its 1 World Trade Center office, she liked what she heard. Ms. Boylan, a New Jersey mother of two teenagers, had been driving for Uber and Lyft since last year, and while she appreciated the flexibility of the work, she wanted to earn more money.So when she learned that Juno would take only a 10 percent commission on her fares, as opposed to the at least 20 percent collected by Uber and Lyft, and that she would be able to receive tips through the Juno app, she signed right up. (Currently, Lyft allows for tipping through its app, and Uber, which says tipping is optional, does not.)Another big draw for Ms. Boylan was Juno\u2019s promise of equity ownership. Its founders have set aside a pool of restricted stock for drivers that they say is equal to their own shares.This means that the more fares Ms. Boylan picks up, the more Juno shares she might be able to earn. Bonus shares go to drivers who pull in the most in fares.Gett came out against surge pricing, an Uber practice in which fares rise during periods of high demand. Curb lets riders hail taxis either by hand or via its app, and then pay for them with the app. Lyft is perceived as a less corporate option, using the tagline \u201cLyft is your friend with a car, whenever you need one.\u201d And Juno\u2019s approach is to promise drivers a supportive corporate culture and a larger cut of its business.The founders had conducted informal research, hitting the streets of New York to talk to Uber drivers about their experiences. They said they detected a morale problem. \u201cIf somebody can treat them better, they\u2019ll jump ship,\u201d Mr. Marco concluded.Their next step was to ask riders whether they, too, would be amenable to hopping over to a new company. The answer was yes, Mr. Marco said. \u201cAs long as the ride-sharing company can provide a quality of service, there\u2019s no problem,\u201d Mr. Marco said he and his Juno co-founders discovered.Then they spent a month devising what he refers to as a \u201cmini constitution,\u201d a philosophy and a set of principles the company would apply to its drivers. These include respect, kindness, fairness and transparency. Their theory was that happy drivers would make for satisfied customers.Mr. Sundararajan sees Juno\u2019s equity offer as a message of inclusiveness to its drivers. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cYou are one of us. You\u2019re a part of us,\u201d he says.Every quarter, Juno allocates restricted stock units to its drivers. The first allocation was in July, and the company announced on its Facebook page that its top-rated driver earned 29,673 stock units. (\u201cFinally drivers are getting some respect,\u201d one commenter wrote.)The stock units vest when drivers accept fares for 120 hours a month for 24 out of 30 months. They can cash in the units if the company is sold or goes public.\u201cThousands of drivers are asking me, \u2018When is Juno coming to my city?\u2019\u201d Mr. Campbell said.But the equity possibility aside, Juno\u2019s strategy may not be drastically different from that of Lyft, which has always been driver-focused, according to Alexandra LaManna, a Lyft spokeswoman.\u201cWhen we launched it was all about the driver because normal everyday people were driving,\u201d Ms. LaManna said. \u201cWe try to treat people better. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re doing to respond to another company. It\u2019s just what we do.\u201dLyft drivers have long been able to retain their full fares if they pick up a certain number of rides a week, in that way increasing their earnings. One new Lyft initiative, instituted at its drivers\u2019 behest, is an instant-pay option that lets drivers cash out their earnings at any time rather than waiting a week for payment.Uber, which says it is committed to its drivers, introduced a similar program a few months later.\u201cCompetition means that we have to demonstrate Uber offers more stable, reliable opportunities to earn money than the alternatives,\u201d Michael Amodeo, an Uber spokesman, wrote in an email. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are focused on: ensuring that Uber is the best experience for drivers across the world.\u201d (The company would not comment further on the record.)Uber and Lyft recently opened help centers in some cities where drivers can ask questions of company representatives. At Lyft, they can also use the restroom and congregate during breaks.And last month Uber started a retirement savings account program for its drivers.One of Uber\u2019s major advantages is its huge corps of drivers. In New York alone, Uber has 35,000; worldwide, there are 1.5 million. More drivers means shorter wait times for riders, stoking a cycle of demand for Uber cars.Yet some drivers remain optimistic that Juno can compete. Even though Ms. Boylan is frustrated that the company doesn\u2019t yet do airport pickups and wonders what the value of the stock units will actually be, she is willing to be patient because she thinks drivers eventually will get paid more than they are now.Until Juno ridership increases, Ms. Boylan says she will often need to travel long distances to pick up passengers, typically an undesirable prospect for drivers. But she can live with that.\u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018O.K., this is my business,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMy ability to suck it up is going to make this business work better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And what broader questions might the election raise?\u201cLadies First,\u201d a 40-minute documentary using the local election as the occasion to focus on social and political reform in Saudi Arabia, resulted from my attempts to find out.From the outset, I was prepared to work around various Saudi restrictions, including rules that strictly segregate the population along gender lines. I knew, for example, that I would have to work with a female cinematographer if I intended to film women and a male shooter if I wasn\u2019t allowed to access certain spaces because I am a woman.I landed in Riyadh and spent days just talking to people. I took my camera everywhere, but I didn\u2019t use it at that time. I wanted to figure out exactly who to follow and to get a clearer sense of the broader story.It was easy to find candidates in the more affluent neighborhoods of Riyadh. These women were generally more accessible, some spoke English and many had already been approached by Western reporters.Wanting to see what I might find in less commonly traveled parts of the city, I took a ride out to areas that felt more insular. I walked into random convenience stores, real estate businesses (there were many of those), wedding halls (used for campaign events by some male candidates) and neighborhood parks on weekend nights. I wanted to feature the women whose names were on the ballots in these regions.Eventually I found Reem. She impressed me with her sincerity. She was, however, extremely cautious because she did not want to stand out or challenge cultural norms. She thought freely but spoke carefully. When I left her house after conducting a long, off-camera conversation, I had a more complete sense of the story I would set out to do.This is when I was joined by my colleague Yousur al-Hlou.

And we can keep the conversation going.It was a true privilege to screen \u201cLadies First\u201d to a wide audience. There were many Saudis in attendance and the response, at least of those who came up to chat after the screening, was particularly interesting.A little summary: A Saudi woman who had not returned to her home country in 10 years told me the film had \u201cresurrected her woes.\u201d An anthropology student said there was an authenticity, rarely seen in films about women in Saudi. Soheir Khashoggi (sister of Adnan Khashoggi, once considered the richest man in the world) congratulated me and recommended I read her book, \u201cMirage.\u201dA group of four Columbia students said they appreciated the effort to show a range of women who weren\u2019t neatly packaged into the usual stereotypes, but still, they did not like the overall tone or premise of the film. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with how we are?\u201d That\u2019s how the one guy in the group put it, emphasizing that they are proud and content with their culture and strong family values. (I keep thinking about this, wanting not to dismiss it as the standard defensive response.

{"Headline": "Tech Billionaire Backing Trump Suggests Silicon Valley Is Out of Touch", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byIt has been a provocative six months for Peter Thiel. That is the way he likes it.Eight days before the presidential election, Mr. Thiel went to the National Press Club in Washington on Monday to defend his contrarian positions. He made the case for Trumpism beyond Trump, journalism without malevolence and Silicon Valley shorn of overweening hubris. It was the latest step in his unusual journey to becoming a prominent critic of politics, the media and technology, as well as a lightning rod for criticism.Given a chance to celebrate the Republican presidential candidate in a significant setting, Mr. Thiel did not mention Mr. Trump until the eighth paragraph of his prepared text, and then he quickly denounced the candidate\u2019s comments about women as \u201cclearly offensive and inappropriate.\u201dAs endorsements go, this was somewhat less than full-throated. \u201cWe\u2019re voting for Trump because we judge the leadership of our country to have failed,\u201d Mr. Thiel said.He argued that both the Republican and Democratic elite in this country have for decades been inflating and promoting bubbles. \u201cThe trade bubble says everyone\u2019s a winner; the war bubble says victory is just around the corner,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these over-optimistic stories simply haven\u2019t been true. And voters are tired of being lied to.\u201dThe 13-minute speech was covered like a major Washington event in a room filled to capacity. A dozen television cameras were set up in the back with bright lights flooding the stage. A dozen photographers sat behind a red velvet rope in front of the stage. More than 100 reporters, some who had come from Silicon Valley, sat in the audience. Many held up their smartphones to take videos and photos of Mr. Thiel.Bracing for the possibility of a confrontation with protesters, Mr. Thiel brought extra security beyond the usual number of guards who follow the billionaire during travel. Before his speech, two members of Mr. Thiel\u2019s security detail stood at the entrance of the National Press Club building. During his speech, personal guards with matching gray suits, neatly cropped hair and ear pieces stood scanning the audience, one at each corner of the room.The event was low key. This was not a political rally. These were journalists. Even the applause was muted. After the speech, delivered in front of a large American flag, Mr. Thiel spent about 40 minutes answering reporters\u2019 questions that were presented by Thomas Burr, the press club president.Silicon Valley has been incredibly successful over the last decade, said Mr. Thiel, who was the first outside investor in Facebook and a co-founder of the data-mining company Palantir. But he says he thinks that claims for the supremacy and influence of the tech world have gotten out of hand.\u201cThe story people in Silicon Valley always want to tell is one in which their specific success, as individuals and as companies, gets conflated with the story of general success and general progress in the United States,\u201d he said. Silicon Valley, he said, believes this: \u201cWe\u2019re doing well, therefore our whole civilization is doing well.\u201dAs opposed to this upbeat narrative, Mr. Thiel said, \u201cI think the truth has been more one of specific success but more general failure.\u201d Silicon Valley, in other words, is not doing much to improve the welfare of people who are not in Silicon Valley.Despite his victory, Mr. Thiel was still angry. He characterized the pro-Gawker arguments this way: \u201cIf you make a sex tape of someone with their permission, you are a pornographer. If you make it without their permission, we are told now, you are a journalist.\u201dThat, he said, \u201cis an insult to journalists.\u201dAs for his future, Mr. Thiel was ambivalent, or at least noncommital.\u201cI always have a somewhat schizophrenic view of politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible business, incredibly destructive. A lot of it is like trench warfare on the Western Front \u2014 crazy amounts of carnage and nothing ever changes.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cSome problems can\u2019t be solved outside of the political arena.\u201d So he might keep his hand in.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jordan Tones Down Textbooks\u2019 Islamic Content, and Tempers Rise", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMAAN, Jordan \u2014 When Jordan\u2019s school year began last month, educators began noticing tweaks in the curriculum.Along with the images of women wearing head scarves were a few who went without them. Cleanshaven men appeared alongside drawings of devout, bearded ones. And references to Islam, once sprinkled liberally throughout textbooks and other class materials, were scaled back.The 70 or so tweaks to Jordan\u2019s textbooks for first through 12th grades are small. The books are still laden with Islamic references: The 10th-grade science text, for example, encourages students to marvel over God\u2019s creation as it discusses evolution.But they are one of the Middle East\u2019s first noticeable efforts to moderate the school curriculum in hopes of preventing youths from drifting to extreme ideologies.\u201cIt could be a test case for the region,\u201d said Musa Shteiwi, a sociologist who sat on an Education Ministry committee for six months last year to change the textbooks. \u201cAll of us in the Arab world have the same problems. We are all entering this battle.\u201dSo far, this modest effort has not gone well. Islamists see it as a threat to their traditional domination of the education system. And among Jordan\u2019s mostly conservative Muslim population, many view the changes as a declaration of war on Islamic values.\u201cObama and Clinton\u2019s schools are not for us!\u201d shouted Mahmoud Abu Rakhiya, an Islamist in Maan, a desert town in southern Jordan, at a rally on a recent Friday in late September. In the capital, Amman, around the same time, teachers set a pile of textbooks on fire. A woman in a white face veil shouted: \u201cWe don\u2019t need these textbooks anyway! We will teach them what we want!\u201dEven those who support changes to the curriculum say the government bungled the effort. Jumana Ghunaimat, the editor in chief of Al Ghad, a liberal newspaper that campaigned for a new curriculum, said the changes, introduced without public debate, had antagonized conservative Jordanians.\u201cI fear that this will not bring positive change,\u201d Ms. Ghunaimat said.She added, \u201cAnd today we are in a hard place,\u201d referring to growing fears of extremist violence in Jordan.The problem with the previous Jordanian curriculum, advocates for change said, was that Islam dominated every subject, without teaching children about the shared humanity of non-Muslims, including other Jordanian citizens. For instance, Jordanians are taught, \u201cYou are a Muslim, and therefore you are moral,\u201d said Oraib al-Rantawi, director general of Al Quds Center for Political Studies, which argued for revisions. \u201cSo the question is, what of others? Non-Muslims? Are they moral?\u201dGovernment officials began to question how the education curriculum was influencing Jordanians, said Mr. Shteiwi, the sociologist. \u201cWe began feeling that what we are doing in our schools was an important factor,\u201d he said.The curriculum changes were meant to give students a better chance \u201cto enter the labor market, and to make them more immune to extremist ideas circulating against them,\u201d said Mohammad Momani, a government spokesman.It is unclear how effective the new curriculum will be in a country with around 1.7 million students and 30,000 teachers working in 4,000 schools, many of them overcrowded.Because of the protests, the Education Ministry has set up another committee to review the changes. The teachers\u2019 union, for its part, has urged educators to ignore the new textbooks.Atef al-Numat, a union member in Maan, called the changes a \u201cdisaster for our children and our values.\u201d He particularly objected to an image of a man vacuuming a house, a crucifix hanging on the wall behind him.

At a girls\u2019 school in a working-class neighborhood of Amman, the principal said teachers were using the new curriculum. But her secretary interjected, \u201cWhat the teachers\u2019 syndicate is saying, we are doing.\u201dHasan Abu Hanieh, a researcher on militant Islam, described the curriculum changes as \u201ca disastrous experiment,\u201d because Jordanian Muslims already believe that \u201cthere is an attack coming from the outside on Islam, and the government is kneeling to that pressure.\u201dMr. Momani, the government spokesman, described those claims as \u201can extreme version of a conspiracy theory.\u201dBut it is something many Jordanians believe. In one Amman neighborhood, Leila Hassan, a 40-year-old mother of six, said the government had changed the curriculum because \u201cthey don\u2019t want us to follow the prophet.\u201dMs. Hassan\u2019s neighbor interjected, saying Israel dictated the curriculum changes to weaken belief among Muslims. \u201cThey want these changes so that people don\u2019t think of Jerusalem,\u201d said the woman, who gave her name as Umm Ahmad.Ms. Hassan said that since the new curriculum was introduced at her children\u2019s school, teachers had insisted on communal Muslim prayers, to make sure the children did not forget their faith. Some teachers are also giving extra religious lessons, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s not the result they wanted,\u201d Ms. Hassan said, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s the opposite.\u201dDina Baslan contributed reporting from Maan and Amman, Jordan.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Mr. Lyon came by his love of photography early, if indirectly, when he noticed a friend, who had a real 2 1/4 camera rather than a Kodak Brownie, was attracting a lot of attention from the girls in school. He was impressed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt that point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas with a lot of my later life, much of my motivation was how to get girls. I thought if I had a camera, maybe I could emulate his success.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe left high school at 14, briefly worked for a local commercial photographer and then studied photography at the Art Center in Los Angeles. One of the instructors there was Ansel Adams, another San Francisco photographer uninterested in a traditional education. (And apparently he made a mean Old-Fashioned.) Adams, a printing guru famed for creating the zone system, once gave him an obscure but helpful bit of advice after he showed off a still-wet print from darkroom. Young Fred Lyon asked the master what he thought.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe looked at it and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hmmm, the reality of the light does not exist,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lyon recalled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thank you very much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 went back into the lab and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What the hell does that mean?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It meant I was making dark prints. People like Bill Brandt made dark prints to great advantage, but I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t developed to that point.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAfter working as a Navy photographer, Mr. Lyon eventually found the success he had craved. He worked commercially and editorially for decades, photographing five presidents for publications like Time and Life. As an artist, he had San Francisco as his muse, with its thick fog, steep hills and \u00e2\u0080\u009crakish\u00e2\u0080\u009d attitude.The city is the subject of his work, as much as its inhabitants. He has been called the San Francisco Brassai (whom he knew), and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not difficult to see why. In \u00e2\u0080\u009cLand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s End, Foggy Night, San Francisco, 1953,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re transported into a grayscale universe. Car headlights backlight an automobile; its front end juts into the sidewalk as the moist Pacific air envelops everything.A couple walks past, down the hill, with a flashlight that spotlights the curb, as glowing light illuminates the rowhouses in the left of the frame (Slide 2). It is one magical photograph. (If you happen to disagree, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong.)Throughout the images, we see bridges and sailors, fishermen and cops. Children play, jazz musicians wail, and neon signs pop in the night on the Barbary Coast. It was all true to the life Mr. Lyon was living, back when he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to drink all night, so he would throw back a few and then go out with his camera. When it was time to prowl, he would call his friend Herb Caen, the quintessential San Francisco columnist (Slide 10), for a night out.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Herb, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to go out and do it again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Lyon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe knew all the ladies. We were in the jazz joints. The jazz scene was terrific.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSan Francisco, too, has undergone a reinvention lately, with the much-publicized arrival of residents and money from nearby Silicon Valley. But with a longer-term perspective than most of us have, Fred Lyon is not concerned for the future of his beloved city, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery city that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really alive has to keep changing.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThere is one change he dislikes, though, as it marks the 21st century as profoundly different from a more na\u00c3\u00afve time. (No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the digital revolution, which he confidently embraces.) It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that fewer families live in San Francisco now, and the ones who do keep their children on tighter leashes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I really miss is the kids playing in the street,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was a constant source of joy for me. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone. Their parents don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow them out. It just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen. The kids were always great. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d laugh at this silly guy with the camera, and know I really wanted to get in their games with them. And indeed I did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

There\u2019s a dozen correspondents and a handful of stringers and freelance photographers on the ground. We just held a planning meeting here at my desk, and there had to be more than 20 editors gathered around. If I needed one more set of legs down in Florida and I walked over to your cubicle and asked YOU to go, would you a) curse at me or b) knock me over as you hustled toward the exit and the airport?Suffering long ago became normal here, passed down through generations of children who learn that crying does no good.Got some of your old words to share?It was 11 p.m. Thursday when Sergio Leo and Carlos Flores stopped off for two $2.29 six packs of Milwaukee Best Beer at the Pronto Mart N9 down the road from the McDonald\u2019s.

So, one way to view the wreckage of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 was through the near miss of Hurricane Andrew in 1992. I wrote in 2005:After Hurricane Andrew huffed and puffed and then somehow veered away in 1992, the way the storms always seemed to do, the manager of a praline shop in the French Quarter mused on the mixture of fatalism and bravado that has always been at the heart of New Orleans.\u201cYou do live with the belief that some day the big one\u2019s going to get you,\u201d said Patricia McDonald Gomez, general manager of Aunt Sally\u2019s Original Creole Pralines as the party resumed, as it always did on Bourbon Street. \u201cYou\u2019re almost fatalistic, which is part of the reason New Orleans has that mixture of frivolity and fatalism.

{"Headline": "Start-Up Taking Aim at Bloomberg Terminals Hires Former Bloomberg Head", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byA start-up looking to take on the financial information behemoth Bloomberg L.P. is hiring a former Bloomberg executive to begin a new financial news service.Norman Pearlstine, a former top editor at Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Time, is joining Money.net, which has been building a low-cost alternative to the data terminals that sit at the core of Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s business empire.Mr. Pearlstine is tasked with building a news feed for Money.net that will be based on machine-generated news bulletins and stories. He will be hiring journalists to help guide the computers and potentially supplement them with reporting \u2014 part of a broader move toward the automation of journalism.\u201cI think I know what the customer is looking for, and I think I know where smart developers and journalists working together can add value,\u201d Mr. Pearlstine said in an interview. \u201cMy bias is toward not spending a lot of time duplicating things that everybody else is doing \u2014 trying to think about what timely, usable information is for a professional investor.\u201dMr. Pearlstine was the chief content officer at Bloomberg until 2013, shortly before Mr. Bloomberg ended his final term as New York City\u2019s mayor and rejoined the company he founded in the 1980s. Mr. Pearlstine is currently the vice chairman of Time Inc. and will remain in that role.Money.net was founded by another former top executive at Bloomberg, Morgan Downey, who got to know Mr. Pearlstine when they were both at the company.Mr. Downey has been outspoken about his belief that Money.net can win over Bloomberg customers who are unhappy with the high price of the terminals, which generally cost around $21,000 a year. A Money.net subscription costs about $1,500 annually.Mr. Downey said that Money.net now had about 50,000 paying subscribers, up from fewer than 10,000 a year ago. Over the same time period, the number of Bloomberg subscribers has remained steady at around 325,000.Mr. Downey has been trying to capitalize on the fact that revenue is down in the financial industry, leading many banks and asset managers to look for lower-cost service providers.\u201cThe industry is at this inflection point,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that the ecosystem of Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters can\u2019t continue.\u201dA Bloomberg spokesman said the company had no comment on Mr. Pearlstine\u2019s hiring.Money.net began as a platform for basic financial data, but Mr. Downey has been trying to add tools that can compete with other parts of the Bloomberg terminal.Recently, Money.net announced a partnership with the Wall Street messaging service Symphony, which is mostly owned by a consortium of banks. Symphony has been described as an effort by the banks to create an alternative to Bloomberg\u2019s messaging system, which is often cited as a main reason to have the terminals.Professional investors also choose Bloomberg because of the huge journalistic operation it has built, focusing in particular on market-moving news.But Mr. Downey sees another opportunity to take on Bloomberg at a lower cost.He contends that much of the information that investors need is freely available in news releases, government statements and social media.Mr. Downey already has a team of developers working on software that can scan the web for news releases and stories from other publications to generate headlines for Money.net customers.Last week, for instance, Money.net generated a headline from a Department of Transportation release. It read: \u201cD.O.T. issues emergency order banning all Samsung Galaxy 7 phones from air transportation in the U.S.\u201dHigh-powered computers are crucial to processing more news and doing so faster than Bloomberg\u2019s human-based system, Mr. Downey said.Several other technology companies are already working to automate journalism, using software that can take raw data and turn it into proper sentences. But this strategy has run into obstacles. When Facebook recently moved to make its trending stories feature more automated, fake news stories crept in unnoticed.Mr. Downey is hoping that Mr. Pearlstine can bring in a team of journalists to help guide the machines toward accuracy. Mr. Downey says that he wants Mr. Pearlstine to hire about 25 journalists to work with around 75 programmers.Mr. Pearlstine is more measured than Mr. Downey in his ambitions to immediately take on Bloomberg. He says that for now the data giant still has a big lead in many areas.But Mr. Pearlstine says there is an opportunity to do things in a smarter way given the current state of technology. He said that Bloomberg News began more than three decades ago as a small team of people aggregating news from other publications.\u201cTechnology has given you the opportunity to revisit that model in ways that could be better, faster and smarter,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Ask These Guys", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byThe Male AnimalBen Schickel walked into the offices of a software firm in Boston, where he had worked in sales for more than a year. It wasn\u2019t easy. He was coming back from a two-week vacation, time he had spent not on some faraway beach but indulging his passion for landscaping work.At his desk, he looked over his leads. He knew he needed out.\u201cI didn\u2019t hate it with a burning passion,\u201d Mr. Schickel, 26, said of his white-collar days, which he left in November 2015. \u201cI was good at my job. I did very well. But it didn\u2019t really excite me. The question was, \u2018When I die, do I want to have spent 50 years of my life sitting in an office?\u2019 The answer was no.\u201d\u201cThere are some people who are perfectly happy working in the office,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you see that for others, the morning walk to the office felt like a boulevard of broken dreams.\u201d\u201cThe most important distinction, whether you work with your hands or in an office, is whether the job involves using your own judgment or not,\u201d said Dr. Crawford, who fabricates parts for custom motorcycles when he is not writing or researching. \u201cYou can\u2019t have this separation from thinking to doing.\u201cIn the assembly line, you dumb the work down to where everyone can do it. And the logic of separating thinking from doing has seeped into a lot of white-collar work, too. To remain engaged, you have to be using your mind, and that\u2019s certainly true when you\u2019re diagnosing a machine like a mechanic does. Nothing is really routine.\u201dBy all measures, Evan Lundy was a success. After earning an undergraduate degree and a law degree at the University of Mississippi, he started working at the Jackson, Miss., office of a national firm handling bankruptcy cases for large banks.The hours were long. Worried about deadlines, he said he rarely slept through the night.\u201cThe repetitive practice of anything in the extreme leads to dissatisfaction,\u201d Mr. Lundy said. \u201cI think that is the killer for someone who is career minded \u2014 doing the same thing over and over, without hope of moving up to something bigger.\u201dIn his dwindling spare time, he built things; for instance, a toy chest. Almost immediately after he posted a photo of it on Instagram, he sold it. He found himself spending more time making furniture and selling it on Etsy or around Jackson.Mr. Lundy, 33, who had a wife and two children to support, believed he didn\u2019t have the luxury to turn his hobby into something more until he ran into a childhood friend who built furniture and made custom curtain rods. After learning of Mr. Lundy\u2019s passion and his longing to escape the office, the friend offered a solution: If Mr. Lundy could install drapery 50 percent of the time, he could earn enough money to devote the other half to building furniture.Mr. Lundy made the break this past May. While his close friends and especially his wife understood, many at the law firm did not.\u201cI hang drapes,\u201d Mr. Lundy said. \u201cI make service calls. I go back and I build furniture. In high school, I would have never said that was what I would want to do, down the road. But as you mature, your priorities change.\u201dIn the late 1990s, Kevin Tyschper heard the call of the \u201cnew economy.\u201d He held positions in areas like \u201cnetwork planning\u201d and \u201cinventory management\u201d at a series of corporations.In 2007, Mr. Tyschper started going to culinary school in the evenings. This meant driving an hour from his home in suburban Naperville, Ill., to Chicago three nights a week for a year. The class lasted from 6 until midnight.By 2009, he was spending more and more time baking. At first, he did it for family and friends. Then came a Facebook page and a website, and a business developed through word of mouth. Just when it seemed he would have to make a choice between his day job and his passion, the company that employed him left town.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like to work long hours, this is not the business to be in,\u201d Mr. Tyschper, 43, said. \u201cIt\u2019s constant movement. We make everything by hand here, too. It\u2019s not like we pull something out of the freezer and bake it. You are kneading it, scaling things out, mixing things, deep-panning things, sheeting things. There are times at 6 or 7 at night when you finally sit down and you realize you haven\u2019t sat down in 15 hours.\u201cBut there are tangible results,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I developed a fiscal forecast, I didn\u2019t always see those results. When I make a loaf of bread, I see the results. I can firmly taste those results.\u201dLandscaping, furniture building and baking can offer a counterpoint to the alienation that may come with many office jobs. Endless days at the computer often leave cubicle workers who were once go-getters giving into the cry of that clerk of yore, Melville\u2019s Bartleby, whose motto was \u201cI prefer not to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s blue collar, but so what?\u201d said Shawn Kelley, a 42-year-old stonemason in Portland, Ore. He had studied at the University of Hartford and worked as a graphic designer in Northampton, Mass., before being driven mad by the monotony of moving fonts around on a screen and designing restaurant menus.\u201cI was giving myself up all those years to this idea that graphic design was my only choice,\u201d Mr. Kelley said. \u201cI went to college for it. And it really emotionally brought me down.\u201dDuring a long drive in the New England countryside, Mr. Kelley stopped to admire a series of stone walls. He saw the effort that went into them. He liked the idea of taking heavy objects of different shapes and sizes and forming them into a cohesive whole. Soon after that epiphany, he began calling stonemasons, seeing if he might find work.They warned him about the intense physical labor involved with carving stone and fitting it into place. But in 2005, he moved west for a full-time job in the field. Now his workday often begins at a quarry, where he selects what he needs to build stairways, walls and backyard sanctuaries.\u201cI stopped her and said, \u2018Lady, I built this wall,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kelley said. \u201cI had to explain to her that just because I have a broom in my hand right now doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t go to college. The assumption there is that you didn\u2019t have opportunity at some point so you are stuck in a blue-collar situation, that you aren\u2019t smart enough.\u201dMr. Schickel, the landscaper, knows that conversation, that look. But he said it stopped bothering him. \u201cIf I cared what everyone else thinks, I would still be at a blue-chip company and feeling unfulfilled,\u201d he said.Mr. Schickel allowed that there are challenges, both physical and financial. And because his job is seasonal, he\u2019ll have to work construction over the winter.\u201cThere are hard days when you are working labor and you hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way around it, and anyone who has ever worked labor will tell you that. But sometimes it\u2019s nice to come home and your body is aching. You take a shower. You eat food as quickly as you can and you pass out. You wake up sore, and it\u2019s nice. It really is.\u201cYou will be working on a crisp fall day, and the leaves are changing, and you are outside and working hard, and then it\u2019s lunchtime, and you grab your lunch and are lying in the grass, looking at the trees, and it\u2019s a beautiful day and you think, \u2018It\u2019s worth it.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

And no flavorless, mushy vegetables force-marched into the interior, either. Instead, Julia serves them on the side. Hers is a modern potpie, and if you don\u2019t cook it tonight, you ought to by the weekend, and again and again through the end of the year.Get a sheet pan ripping hot in a 425-degree oven while you dice the vegetables. Toss the vegetables in a splash of neutral oil, salt and pepper them, and tip them into a single layer on the hot pan. Allow these to roast in the oven while you cut the kielbasa into thin slices, stopping short of cutting all the way through the meat. You want to end up with a long accordion, basically \u2014 or an attenuated pill bug. Now remove the vegetables from the oven, give them a stir, and put the kielbasa on top. Return the sheet pan to the oven and allow everything to roast into crisp softness, basting heavily two or three times with a mixture of a couple of tablespoons of apricot preserves and an equal amount of mustard. Serve with steamed greens or a fresh baguette. It\u2019ll go fast.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Refugees Need a Nation\u2019s Better Angels", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byFixesSixteen years ago, Sasha Chanoff faced a decision that could mean life or death for 144 people. Chanoff, then 29, was working for the International Organization for Migration. He was in the Democratic Republic of Congo on a mission, negotiated by the United States government, to arrange safe passage out of the country for 112 refugees \u2014 ethnic Tutsis who had been imprisoned, raped and beaten, and had witnessed family members massacred.His instructions were clear: Get just those people out. Any attempt to save others could jeopardize the mission.Once in Congo, however, Chanoff and his colleague Sheikha Ali discovered 32 more women and children, some close to starvation, in a tent outside the main compound. Many were almost certain to die if not evacuated.\u201cThe fact that the Sudanese Lost Boys were chosen to go first meant that hundreds more Bantu women were going to be raped,\u201d Chanoff wrote. \u201cOthers would be attacked and killed. That didn\u2019t mean the Lost Boy decision was wrong. Their lives and futures too would have changed dramatically if the Bantus had gone first.\u201dThe experience highlighted the power that decision makers who oversee refugee matters have over individual lives. \u201cHow are you supposed to act when you have that kind of power?\u201d he wrote.One young woman Chanoff and Ali met in the tent was Mamy Najurama, 15 at the time. \u201cHer father and brother had been separated from the family,\u201d said Chanoff. \u201cHer mother had severe trauma and Mamy was a primary caretaker for six younger siblings during 16 months in prison camps where many people lost their lives.\u201dAfter being flown to safety in Cameroon, Mamy Najurama, her mother and her siblings were resettled in Phoenix in 2000. Her father and brother were discovered alive, and joined them in 2001. Najurama is now married, with two young daughters. She works as an independent living aide, assisting people with severe mental illnesses, while studying to be a pharmacist.\u201cFrom Day 1 in Phoenix, I\u2019ve seen so much kindness,\u201d Najurama told me.She cited Bob Mulhern, a manager for a real estate firm, who had heard about Najurama and her family from Catholic Charities shortly after they reached Phoenix, and offered help. \u201cAt the time, the father and the oldest brother weren\u2019t with them because they had been detained in the Congo,\u201d Mulhern recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018If my wife was in the same position, what would I hope that people would do?\u2019\u201dThe Mulherns, a family of 11, helped Najurama\u2019s family furnish their home, reaching out to friends and gathering a truckload of donated bed frames, dressers, lamps, fans. Over the years, Mulhern and his wife, Tina, bought the family computers, passed along used cars, and helped them find a house in a neighborhood with a good public school, and served as guarantors for the rent.The two families have shared many moments: graduations, weddings, Thanksgivings, funerals. \u201cWe just accepted them as a family in transition and we were a family that could help them,\u201d said Mulhern. \u201cIt seemed like the right thing to do. We\u2019ve never regretted it.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf you want to look for a golden thread through the relationship, it would be gratitude.\u201dNajurama said she had been inspired by Mulhern\u2019s generosity. \u201cEvery time I think about what I came from and compare it to how I am today, I feel so lucky to be alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a dream. I love my job. I love the people I work with. They need someone to be there for them. I am so thankful. I dream to help people who were like me. I want to be like Bob.\u201dThe current focus on the Syrian crisis, along with inflammatory and irresponsible language about Muslims, has distorted a policy that usually was much more straightforward \u2014 grounded less in political expediency, and more in America\u2019s enduring self-definition.Resettlement slots are scarce and precious. They\u2019re intended to help those facing the gravest risks. But that\u2019s not always how it works. Media attention, political considerations and institutional limitations frequently determine who gets saved and who doesn\u2019t.Often, refugee slots remain empty. Since 2002, nearly 250,000 slots for refugee resettlement in the United States have gone unfilled. (Slots are allocated every year by the president and they do not carry over.) During President George W. Bush\u2019s second term, more than 86,000 slots were unused. During President Obama\u2019s first term, the number was 53,000. \u201cTo not use one of those slots is like not administering a vaccine\u201d for a life-threatening illness, said Larry Yungk, a senior resettlement officer for the United Nations refugee commissioner\u2019s office for the United States and Caribbean.Over the past four years, however, the situation has changed markedly. Since 2013, only 156 slots out of 295,000 have gone unfilled. That\u2019s because the Obama administration redoubled its commitment to resettlement, and the major organizations charged with identifying and prioritizing those in need, particularly the United Nations and the State Department, have become better at doing so.Chanoff realized that if he and Sheikha Ali had not looked into that tent 16 years ago, Mamy Najurama and her family might not be alive today.How to ensure that others in need are similarly spotted and can comply with the stringent application requirements for nations that accept refugees?Today, RefugePoint tries to fill that gap, activating resettlement as an option where it is desperately needed, but often has been unavailable. For instance, it works in Nairobi\u2019s slums, where many refugees remain in hiding, ostracized for having been raped, or hiding from killers who chased them from their home countries. It works with children and youths in Ethiopia who risk becoming victims of human traffickers or kidnappers after fleeing violence or forced conscription in Eritrea or South Sudan. It also works in urban areas of South Africa, where refugees from Somalia, Ethiopia and Congo have been attacked and killed in xenophobic violence.Unlike the United Nations or government agencies, RefugePoint, which is supported largely by philanthropy, can deploy its staff quickly. It provides training to other organizations across Africa (and in a few parts of Asia), teaching local staff how to conduct interviews and identify good resettlement candidates. Then it fosters collaborations of those groups with the United Nations refugee office, which prepares official dossiers for submission to governments.\u201cRefugePoint has been extremely proactive in a number of a situations to help us to identify refugees,\u201d said Vincent Cochetel, who heads the commission\u2019s European office. \u201cTheir identification work is absolutely precious. We need actors with local knowledge.\u201dSometimes, RefugePoint temporarily embeds its own staff members in United Nations offices until it can incorporate those positions into its own budget. In so doing, it demonstrates how an organization with a staff of just 70 and a budget just over $4 million can catalyze changes in a much larger system.RefugePoint also helps address bottlenecks in the system. For instance, many refugee families care for children from other families, often orphans. (Up to a third of Congolese refugee families who have fled to Tanzania, Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda are taking care of non-biological children.) To process cases involving \u201cunaccompanied minors,\u201d child protection specialists first have to make \u201cbest interest determinations\u201d for the children. However, many United Nations refugee offices are short on this expertise, so cases get held up. RefugePoint has embedded specialists in several locations to move them along.To ensure that refugee slots get fully used, it\u2019s also critical to prepare dossiers from a range of countries. Refugees seeking resettlement in the United States must undergo an interview in their host country by officials from the Department of Homeland Security. The interviews are periodically delayed by political instability or outbreaks of violence or disease. So it\u2019s important to have case referrals from diverse locations to accommodate this uncertainty, and to ensure that resettlement is available equitably. RefugePoint measures its progress on this front by the proportion of host countries in Africa that resettle at least 1 percent of their refugee cases each year. Since 2005, that figure has almost doubled, from one-fifth to nearly two-fifths.On the issue of humanitarian assistance to refugees, voters will soon have a chance to weigh in. When they do, it is important to remember that there are vast differences not just between the presidential candidates, but also among many of the candidates for Congress and state governments in both major parties. Since the president has broad discretion to set the refugee ceiling, but is not alone in setting the political agenda on the issue, American voters should carefully consider the entire ballot before them, as well as all the suffering people abroad whose lives may depend on the outcome of this election.\u201cIf the U.S. resettlement program stopped,\u201d said Chanoff, \u201chundreds of thousands of lives would be at risk over the coming years.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Though addressed to people his own age, we thought it worked so well as a lesson plan that we decided to hold it until school resumed this fall. _________Writers and demographers don\u2019t even have a consistent definition of when one generation ends and the next begins. But here are some approximations:Keep in mind that while some high school students fall into Generation Z, they are frequently also described as millennials \u2014 a contemporary byword for young adults.Below, a selection of Times articles about millennials and Gen Z, along with suggested questions to keep in mind as you read them. At the end, a few ideas for taking this topic even further. My hope is that all these pieces together will give you a more complete, nuanced view of what a person\u2019s age can tell you about his or her values.\u2022 How much does when you\u2019re born shape who you are?\u2022 How meaningful and useful are blanket descriptions of different generations?\u2022 How do you think our generation is characterized by the media? Are we portrayed fairly?\u2022 What claims or generalizations made in these articles do you think are true? Which are untrue? Why?\u2022 Which articles are backed up by data and which are the author\u2019s opinion?\u2022 How does the way we have been represented compare with representations of past generations?\u2022 In your view, what are the three most important characteristics of our generation? What about your parents\u2019 generation? Why?___It is easier to attribute characteristics to a vast segment of the population if that group is called by one name. Generalizations snowball and millions of people are made to share one identity. These stereotypes can reinforce prejudices and make groups into easy scapegoats. Though perhaps necessary to describe trends, generalizations can obscure the truth with sweeping, unsubstantiated claims. Kate Dries, a millennial herself, explains a few of the most ridiculous and inaccurate claims made about millennials._________One of the most ubiquitous detractions leveled at millennials is that they are lazy. Are young people lazier than their elders? If so, do all people develop a work ethic as they mature, or is there something unique about the millennial generation?__________________Lynn Vareck covers another way that millennials\u2019 values differ from those of older people. What in this article is true for you or the people you know?_________Generational differences even extend to locker rooms, according to this article._________When we look at generations, it can seem as if there are millions of 20-year-olds, 35-year-olds and 65-year-olds.Of course, we know that there are just as many people whose age is near the line between generations as there are people who sit right in the middle of Gen X, Y or Z. Age is a continuous spectrum; perhaps our beliefs can also be described by a sliding scale. Our societal values are continually evolving, so maybe we should say, \u201cA 36-year-old is more likely to be agnostic than a 37-year-old, and the 37-year-old is more likely to be agnostic than a 38-year-old.\u201d_________Some traits may really apply only to people in a certain age range. For example, people who graduated from college during the recession have a profoundly different experience than their peers only a year or two older. How else, besides being \u201cless likely to leave the nest,\u201d do you think that experience affects them?_________Some of the articles I\u2019ve included make life as a millennial seem pretty bleak. Here\u2019s Sam Tanenhaus with a more upbeat take:But first, what besides youth sets millennials apart from their elders \u2014 the wizened silent generation, the graying boomers, the midlife Gen-X\u2019ers?The usual answer seems to be \u201cnarcissism\u201d \u2014 self-absorption indulged to comical extremes. We all can recite the evidence: the breathlessly updated Facebook profile, the cascade of selfies, the Kardashians.Read what this research reveals, and decide if you think it is true._________In this Op-Ed column, David Brooks weighs in with another positive take on our age group._________Though Frank Bruni presents a brief, simplified look at American political life, in this article he addresses a few of the most salient intergenerational issues: How will we pay for our parents\u2019 Medicare and Social Security? And on the geological, globally significant scale, how will we confront the environmental problems our parents created?_________These articles describe millennials as the newest generation, but some demographers are beginning to characterize a younger group \u2014 current high school and college students \u2014 as we reach adulthood._________\u201cFrom fashion to work spaces, there\u2019s a communal feeling of we before me,\u201d writes Ian Daly. Do you think this is true? How do you see it among the people you know?_________\u2022 If you were born in the year your parents were born, how would your life be different? Do you think your personality would be different? How?\u2022 Ask an experienced teacher how his or her students have changed over time, in general. To what extent does he or she think young people today are different from previous generations of students? Why?\u2022 Make a video depicting the characteristics of your generation or another generation mentioned in the articles.\u2022 These articles from The Times are only a starting point. Find more portrayals of our generation in other media and apply the same questions posed above.

{"Headline": "Verdict in Oregon Draws Surprise and Questions About Equity", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byIt looked like an open-and-shut case.Everybody knew that armed militia members led by Ammon Bundy and his brother, Ryan, had occupied a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon starting on a bitterly cold day in January. The Bundys and their five co-defendants in Federal District Court in Portland never argued that they had taken over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge buildings out of some mistake or accident. They knew full well, the defendants and their lawyers said, that the refuge was government property and that the government did not want them there.\u201cI\u2019ve done more federal trials than I can count and I\u2019ve never won like this,\u201d said Matthew A. Schindler, a lawyer representing the defendant Kenneth Medenbach.Though the exact reasoning of the jurors, who came from across Oregon and were never identified by name in court, remains unknown, most onlookers blamed prosecutorial overreach \u2014 that the government stretched its case too far to fit the events at the refuge \u2014 or stumbles in the presentation of evidence.In an attempt to end the 41-day standoff, the government sent paid informants into the refuge, about 225 miles southeast of Portland. But the prosecution only grudgingly admitted as much during the trial, and the protester\u2019s lawyers used that fact to suggest that the government had something to hide, or had perhaps even induced occupiers into committing criminal acts.The conspiracy charges leveled against the occupiers did not help either. Though often used for criminal enterprises \u2014 like a plot to steal money or to sell illegal drugs \u2014 conspiracy appeared to be a cloudier explanation for the occupation, which drew an array of people with grievances against Washington.In an election year fraught with allegations that the system is rigged against everyday people, many antigovernment activists interpreted the verdict as a potent sign that they still have some voice and power.\u201cVindicated. World news. Let\u2019s take back the narrative America,\u201d was the message posted Friday morning on the Bundy Ranch Facebook page.But people angry about the acquittals were also energized and speaking out \u2014 with some saying that race had clouded the case. (All the occupiers were white.) And people involved in the case said the divisions would not be healed anyway.Mr. Schindler, the lawyer, said in a telephone interview on Friday morning that he had just gotten off the phone with a caller who had threatened him. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re coming with guns to take adverse possession of your office,\u2019\u201d he quoted the caller as saying.Mr. Schindler laughed it off, but he said he had no doubt that the repercussions of Thursday\u2019s verdicts were far from over.During the occupation, the Bundys were cheered on \u2014 both in person and online \u2014 by members of the so-called Patriot Movement, a loose network of militia-type groups, who are deeply skeptical of federal power and sometimes attend protests armed with semiautomatic rifles. The government, militia group members say, is all powerful and out to take away rights and guns.The paradox of Thursday\u2019s court verdict is that it delivered the exact opposite message. Supposed federal omnipotence and overreach became flat-footed haplessness in one brief, powerful court session, as the 12 jurors were polled about their conclusions, rejecting everything about the government\u2019s case.The United States attorney for Oregon, Billy J. Williams, said in a statement on Thursday that prosecutors were disappointed with the outcome, but did not second guess the decision to bring the case to trial.\u201cWe strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a court, publicly tried and decided by a jury,\u201d he said. A spokesman for Mr. Williams said on Friday that there would be no further comment or interviews.The acquittals drew cheers that were less widespread, but no less passionate, than the criticisms.\u201cIt gives some hope and some light to the people who are saying the country is lost,\u201d said B.J. Soper, 40, a leader of the Pacific Patriots Network, who spent about 36 days on the fringes of the occupation, saying that he was providing security for the occupiers. The verdict was a sign, he added, that government officials needed to listen to everyday people, unless they want to be put \u201cin harm\u2019s way.\u201dOn Friday afternoon in Portland, several dozen Black Lives Matter protesters marched through downtown and blocked a street where some of the freed defendants had gathered near the courthouse for a celebratory hot-dog cookout with supporters.As about 10 Portland police officers watched, some of the Black Lives Matters protesters burned an American flag, barely a quarter of a block from where the Malheur supporters had gathered with a half-dozen flags of their own on display. One man helping to burn the flag yelled, \u201cThis is not a terrorist threat!\u201d A Malheur supporter yelled back, \u201cI fought for that flag!\u201dSome passing motorists honked their horns, though it was unclear which side they were cheering.The occupiers took control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge for 41 days starting just after New Year\u2019s Day, opposing both federal ownership of vast tracts of the West, and supporting a local ranching family, the Hammonds, who the occupiers said had been unfairly prosecuted. One occupation leader, LaVoy Finicum, was shot and killed \u2014 and Ryan Bundy wounded \u2014 in late January at a police roadblock during an arrest operation. The remaining occupiers held out for nearly three more weeks.\u201cWe have a long tradition in this country of people resorting to protest politics, and all protest politics is the result of folks feeling that they are not getting a fair hearing from established institutions,\u201d Professor Cawley said. \u201cThis is just the latest of a whole series of land disputes going back to the \u2018Sagebrush Rebellion\u2019 of the late \u201970s, early \u201980s.\u201dHow Thursday\u2019s verdicts might affect a second trial of Malheur occupiers, scheduled for February, is another uncertainty. Some defense lawyers representing Malheur occupiers said they believed the government might abandon that case, in which seven defendants are charged.\u201cHow can you have the leaders acquitted and still go forward?\u201d said Marcus R. Mumford, Ammon Bundy\u2019s lawyer, who was surrounded by federal marshals and arrested in the courtroom after Thursday\u2019s verdict. That came after Mr. Mumford vehemently protested that both Bundy brothers would continue to be held in federal custody while awaiting trial in Nevada next year. Mr. Mumford said he was cited for failure to comply with the lawful direction of a police office and impeding a federal officer.Courtney Sherwood contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweet-Toothed Egypt Endures a Sugar Crisis: \u2018People Are Going to Snap\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported bySo a weekslong sugar shortage has plunged people into a panic. The sugar crisis, as it is known, has quickly become shorthand for the brewing anger against President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s management of the economy and his overall rule.\u201cThe people are going to snap,\u201d Ahmad el-Gebaly said as he turned away customers seeking sugar he did not have at his subsidized-goods store in Bulaq, a working-class neighborhood of Cairo.\u201cNobody can stand him anymore,\u201d he added of Mr. Sisi. \u201cSugar is like rice and oil and wheat. You can never run out of it. You can never mess with it. Who can live without sugar?\u201dSugar is not the only scarce staple, as the plummeting pound has slashed Egypt\u2019s import-purchasing power. Cooking oil disappeared from shelves for a time this year, residents said, as did baby formula, and rice is in low supply. Some people complained that they could not find certain medicines, or that the prices had skyrocketed.These cuts and other actions were \u201cinevitable to save the economic situation,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in a recent interview with a state-owned newspaper. He described the current situation as a \u201cbottleneck\u201d and promised, \u201cWe are on our way out.\u201dBut people are not patient. They are desperate. The official price for sugar is more than 15 cents per pound, up from 6 cents per pound two years ago, and on the black market it goes for triple that. Small shops ran out of sugar weeks ago, and upscale markets are rationing it to one kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, per person.\u201cIt is the worst shortage I can remember in my lifetime,\u201d said H. A. Hellyer, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a research organization based in Washington. \u201cI think what everybody is worried about is a repeat of the 1977 bread riots.\u201dDr. Hellyer was referring to the nationwide protests that followed attempts by Anwar el-Sadat, then the president, to dismantle the subsidy system.It was the only attempt, said Amro Ali, an associate professor of sociology at the American University in Cairo. The subsidies, he added, were untouchable. \u201cIt\u2019s kryptonite,\u201d he said.Ahmed Kamal, an aide to the minister responsible for the subsidies, blamed the private sector, a scarcity of Egyptian hard currency and rising global prices for the sugar shortage. He said that private importers were expected to bring in some of the 800,000 tons of sugar that Egypt must purchase from abroad annually, about a quarter of the nation\u2019s yearly demand for 3.2 million tons, but that the country had fallen short of its goal this year.Mr. Kamal said the problem had been exacerbated by business owners hoarding supplies and by the news media whipping up angst. He added that the government still had a four-month supply of sugar.But little of it was available in Bulaq, the Cairo neighborhood where Mr. Gebaly\u2019s shop was the only subsidized grocery reliably open \u2014 and he mostly turned people away.\u201cAll I say, all day, is: \u2018There\u2019s no sugar, there\u2019s no sugar, there\u2019s no sugar, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Gebaly said, before he was interrupted by a call of another customer asking for sugar. An older man waiting nearby gave up, grumbling: \u201cYou keep saying, tomorrow! Tomorrow!\u201dResidents said that the other six shops in the neighborhood that were licensed to sell subsidized goods had closed to avoid a police crackdown, but that they sometimes opened after hours to sell sugar illegally to small-time confectioners, cafes and people. The subsidy police have already arrested two neighborhood sugar traders, residents said.Sumaya Oweis, 37, said she had stopped making her beloved sweet rice pudding and had cut down on tea. On a recent morning, she smacked her 4-year-old son after he stuck his hand in the sugar bowl. But what was she to do about her husband?\u201cMay God destroy his mother\u2019s house!\u201d Ms. Oweis groaned, slapping her palms to her face. \u201cHe has sugar in everything!\u201dFor Ms. Oweis, like many residents, the sugar shortage came after months of growing hardship. Her husband, an itinerant worker, struggled to make $2 a day, she said. They are eating less because they cannot keep up with rising prices for food, like potatoes, which cost about 26 United States cents a pound now, up from about 5 cents several weeks ago.\u201cI\u2019m losing weight,\u201d she said, pointing to her skinny arms. Her subsidized birth-control pills had disappeared off the shelves for a few weeks this year. When they returned to the market, Ms. Oweis said, the price for a month\u2019s supply had increased to $2 from $1.30.Perhaps the shortage of sugar is somewhat of a blessing, given Egypt\u2019s problems with obesity and diabetes, wrote Mohammed Nosseir, a liberal politician.A teenager tried to make a similar point at Mr. Gebaly\u2019s shop. \u201cI found out why there\u2019s no sugar!\u201d he called out. \u201cSo nobody gets diabetes!\u201d Everybody ignored him.Videos about the crisis have been shared widely on social media.\u201cThey go on TV and they say Egypt is rising,\u201d Mr. Abdou said. \u201cAnd the poor citizen cannot find a kilo of rice on the street.\u201dIn another video, a man set himself on fire in Alexandria, screaming after he set himself alight: \u201cI can\u2019t afford to eat.\u201dMr. Ali, the sociologist, said it was the first public self-immolation since the uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.\u201cIt shows you that the core problems have yet to be resolved,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the United States dollar equivalent of the Egyptian pound on the black market. The pound is worth 6 cents, not 0.06 cents.Advertisement"}

But the room\u2019s potential never escapes me. All my clutter troubles are solved. Finally, I have space.Then I wake up to a reality shared by many New Yorkers: There are no hidden rooms to house all the junk currently shoved in those plastic bins under the bed.There must be others. How else did Eloise putter around the Plaza Hotel with such ease in those children\u2019s stories? And how did Katie Holmes miraculously appear with a shopping cart in Whole Foods in Chelsea without ever walking through the front door?But such things are not just the stuff of imagination and intrigue. Last year, Sandra Williams and Frank Milliron bought and renovated a two-family Victorian in Ditmas Park. During the project, their contractor tore out a wall on the second floor, and to their surprise, revealed unfinished space behind it. The space had a sloped ceiling beneath the dormered roof and amounted to a sprawling unfinished attic, measuring 23-by-11 feet. An ambitious homeowner could raise the roof, which is over six feet at its highest point, and make it a full-height room \u2014 or a small child could use it as a hide-out. \u201cWe saw the space and thought \u2018This is magical,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Williams.The couple already had whimsical aspirations for the home, building a tiny door in the back of their daughter\u2019s bedroom closet that opened into the back of their own. \u201cWe thought it was really cool if I could disappear through the closet,\u201d said Ms. Williams, who likened the doorway to the wardrobe in C. S. Lewis\u2019s \u201cThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u201dFor Ms. Williams, the discovered room became another opportunity to create a home \u201cwith quirks\u201d for their daughter Emme Milliron, who is now 3. (The family now also has a 5-month-old son, Owen Milliron.)The discovered space could have become a playroom, complete with a door disguised as a bookshelf, like \u201can eerie Victorian entrance to a secret room,\u201d said Ms. Williams, who works in fashion and has a clear flair for the dramatic. Mr. Milliron is a property manager.Secret spaces are not just in the past. Some developers have designed hidden doors and passages into their recent projects.\u201cThrough a secret door, they can experience another world,\u201d said Robert Vecsler, the president of residential development for Silverstein Properties, which developed the 82-story tower.Indeed, the stairwell feels like a threshold between two worlds \u2014 an innocuous space where the serene black-and-white marble lobby of the condo ends and the boisterous energy of the hotel begins.It\u2019s not just New Yorkers who want to disappear into other worlds. Films and books are rife with fantastical destinations. Harry Potter\u2019s Hogwarts School exists in a world accessible by an invisible train platform. What would \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d be without the rabbit tunnel? \u201cThe Secret Garden.\u201d \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby.\u201d \u201cClue.\u201d \u201cPanic Room.\u201d The list goes on.\u201cHumans all are on a quest for a secret space,\u201d said Elizabeth Goodenough, a lecturer at the University of Michigan and the editor of \u201cSecret Spaces of Childhood\u201d (University of Michigan Press, 2003). Without such retreats, \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of not growing or developing into our true selves.\u201dThroughout history, hideaways have not just been a novelty, they have also provided a lifeline for people fleeing war, persecution and slavery. I grew up hearing tales of my great-grandmother hiding in a spot beneath the floorboards of her home during pogroms in Odessa. We would never have had Anne Frank\u2019s diary if not for the attic that, for a time, shielded the Frank family and their companions from their terrible fate.Consider the Underground Railroad. Its very name conjures an image of a clandestine tunnel winding its way through the American landscape. Stories of hollows tucked behind walls and in the cellars of old homes have become part of a collective (and sometimes unreliable) narrative.\u201cThat would seem very likely to me,\u201d said Dr. Sinha, largely because the church\u2019s first pastor, Henry Ward Beecher, \u201cclearly was involved with the fugitive slave issue.\u201dIn an era of mass government surveillance, hacked emails and Facebook over-sharing, secret hideaways take on a new significance. \u201cWe live in an age of surveillance and insecurity, so that idea of hiding has taken on a kind of scary potential,\u201d said Dr. Goodenough.Others have something to hide, like the New Yorker who asked Mr. Humble to disguise a laundry room to conceal her washer and dryer from the super, since the building prohibited such appliances.These spaces do not come cheap. Sara Nainzadeh spent $25,000 adding a camouflaged door designed by Creative Home Engineering in her three-bedroom apartment on 15th Street and Fifth Avenue.Walk inside her master bedroom, and the wall-length bookshelf looks unassuming enough. But tug on a copy of Shel Silverstein\u2019s \u201cA Light in the Attic\u201d and a portion of it swings open, revealing another full bedroom. Ms. Nainzadeh, who works in finance, uses the room as an office and stores her safe there. Mostly, she likes having a retreat. \u201cSometimes I lock myself in there and relax,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in there, you really don\u2019t hear anything else going on in the apartment.\u201d\u201cI never have enough space for books,\u201d said Mr. Watson, whose portraits of luminaries like Alfred Hitchcock, Andy Warhol, B.B. King and David Bowie have filled the pages of numerous books and magazines. The photographer claimed another 72 square feet of space for his collection by adding shelves to an 8-foot-high door separating the library from the guest room. Still, stacks of books are piled around the apartment, and even more are in storage.Sitting in the library, you would never know that part of the wall-length bookshelf opens. When overnight guests come to visit, some are baffled after he brings them to his library. \u201cI\u2019ve actually had a relative say, \u2018Where\u2019s the bed?\u2019 \u201d And that\u2019s when he surprises them, pushing open part of the wall of books to reveal a serene bedroom behind it.\u201cIt\u2019s quite fun because it\u2019s so unexpected,\u201d said Robby Browne, an associate broker with Corcoran Group, the listing agent for Mr. Watson\u2019s apartment, which has been on the market since January. \u201cIf you shut the door, you feel like you\u2019re in a whole other world.\u201dI asked Mr. Watson if he planned to incorporate any covert escape routes into the museum. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is a secret passageway from the museum to my house.\u201dFor some people, the notion that you might be able to have a private world all your own can be hard to resist \u2014 it\u2019s like a game of hide-and-seek, but for grown-ups. \u201cEvery guy wants to be James Bond,\u201d said Mr. Humble of Creative Home Engineering. \u201cThe secretive element of it is just alluring.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In a letter to one of her sons, Queen Victoria, whom a historian once called \u201cthe first media monarch,\u201d wrote that what you wear gives \u201cthe one outward sign from which people in general can and often do judge upon the inward state of mind and feeling of a person; for this they all see, while the other they cannot.\u201dThe queen knew the public scrutiny her family was always under. Lucy Worsley, the chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces, wrote in an email that outside an 18th-century palace, \u201cyou\u2019d have found crowds waiting and watching to see the female courtiers arriving for parties \u2014 the Georgian equivalent of the red carpet.\u201dThey had a lot to occupy them on this most recent trip, one in which the duchess was accompanied not only by her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, but their children, George and Charlotte, both budding fashion stars.On the eight-day flurry of a trip in late September, the duchess appeared in a mix of high- and low-cost British brands, diplomatically sprinkling in a few Canadian choices, plus looks from Carolina Herrera (Venezuelan-American), See by Chlo\u00e9 (French) and Dolce & Gabbana (Italian).\u201cI think she\u2019s very much watched by the British fashion industry,\u201d said Sarah Mower, the chief critic for Vogue.com and a member of the British Fashion Council. \u201cWe really like it when she wears something from a British designer. It\u2019s fantastic for our exports.\u201dDuring more physically active events, the duchess wore pieces from less costly brands as well, including Topshop, Zara, Smythe, Somerset by Alice Temperley and H & M. \u201cThat\u2019s when you see her come alive,\u201d Ms. Mower said, noting that the duchess\u2019s athleticism and her affinity for casual style make her relatable.\u201cShe\u2019s very cleverly navigating her role,\u201d Ms. Mower said. \u201cI think she\u2019s achieving a balance because of the sporty, normal, laughing, active side of it.\u201dCanada was the theme for Day 5: The duchess wore a coat from the Toronto designer Bojana Sentaler and a pair of earrings by Shelley MacDonald, who has a small boutique in Carcross, a town in the Yukon Territory.Ms. MacDonald, speaking by phone, said she had no idea the duchess would be wearing an item she had created. \u201cI was looking online to see if my store\u2019s sign made it into any videos or photos,\u201d Ms. MacDonald said. \u201cAnd then I got a message on my Etsy store.\u201dMs. Sentaler, whose coat sold out within hours, said that her office had been contacted by Natasha Archer, who has worked for the royal household since 2007 and is thought to be the duchess\u2019s stylist. \u201cAt first, we didn\u2019t know who it was,\u201d Ms. Sentaler said. \u201cI looked up her name online, and after that we put two and two together.\u201d\u201cShe certainly looked much better in Canada than India,\u201d Ms. Mower said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say a makeover.\u201dShe said that the hypothesis may have been sparked by a standout dress from Preen by Thornton Bregazzi that appeared on the royals\u2019 third night in Canada. \u201cI think the Preen dress she wore is the best dress she\u2019s ever worn, apart from her wedding dress,\u201d Ms. Mower said. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning.\u201dMs. Mower also noted several pairs of red heels the duchess trotted out, a departure from the nude pumps she has helped popularize. \u201cThe nude pumps have been her thing, which has become so widespread,\u201d Ms. Mower said. \u201cEvery woman who goes to a wedding or a family event now wears them. It\u2019s totally British middle of everything.\u201dShe added: \u201cBut as soon as she puts on a pair of red shoes, suddenly that looks much more like fashion.

{"Headline": "Trump Recording Narrows Divide on Sexual Assault", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byOf all the silver linings one might have expected from this whiplash-crazy election, a new national understanding of sexual assault would have been quite hard to imagine.Until two weeks ago.The lewd and aggressive comments by Mr. Trump, the Manhattan tycoon turned Republican presidential nominee, revealed a generational divide in the way many Americans understand sexual assault and consent. But, remarkably, the widespread outrage and outpouring it unleashed, with millions of women speaking out about their own experiences \u2014 appear to have narrowed that gap.\u201cThis is a moment of transition,\u201d said Estelle B. Freedman, a Stanford University historian who studies the evolution of laws and norms surrounding sexual assault.\u201cWe are having a national conversation about new rules,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are nationally trying to rethink issues of sexuality, consent, autonomy, relationships.\u201dWhile the Trump tape and its aftermath feel like a turning point in the public understanding of sexual assault, Alexandra Brodsky, a co-founder of Know Your IX, an organization dedicated to ending sexual violence on college campuses, believes that \u201cit\u2019s actually a reflection that we are already past the turning point.\u201d\u201cIt is not obvious to me that five years ago, grabbing or kissing someone without her permission would have been recognized as sexual assault,\u201d she said.Dr. Freedman sees this moment as the culmination of decades of change.Until the mid-19th century, her research shows, sexual assault and rape were viewed primarily as crimes against the honor of women\u2019s husbands and fathers, not themselves. As women gained new rights to control their own property and legal decisions, sexual assault began to be considered a matter of consent, not honor.But there was little agreement about what consent meant, Dr. Freedman said. Many people believed consent could be implied or presumed by the way a woman dressed, for instance, or even her decision to accept a job with a male boss.By the 1990s, feminist advocacy had begun to push the idea of \u201cno means no.\u201d Antioch College in 1991 adopted a code of conduct requiring students to affirmatively opt in to sexual activity starting with a kiss.While such affirmative-consent rules were lampooned on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d as political correctness run amok, they have become increasingly mainstream. States including New York and California require colleges and universities to adopt them.The widespread backlash to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, experts say, was fueled in part by the growing view, among people in their 20s and 30s, of affirmative consent as a guiding principle, not a lofty ideal or extreme demand.\u201cI think that affirmative consent is an imperfect legal concept,\u201d Ms. Brodsky, a recent graduate of Yale Law School, allowed. \u201cBut it\u2019s a powerful normative concept.\u201dBut old beliefs about honor and consent persist.Mr. Trump\u2019s bragging in the video that women \u201clet\u201d him kiss and grope them because he was a star, for instance, seems straight out of the implied-consent era, in which anything other than a clear \u201cno\u201d could be seen as passive acquiescence.Dr. Freedman also detects shades of the old honor-based system in some men\u2019s responses that, as husbands and fathers, they found the video unacceptable.Until recently, pervasive shame and stigma meant that silence was often the rational choice for survivors of sexual violence. That was particularly true for women who grew up in an era when any sexual activity outside of marriage was considered unacceptable: revealing an assault risked being labeled promiscuous or worse.But as those norms have changed, the costs of speaking out have dropped.Younger women in particular are becoming more willing to protest sexual assaults that once might have been deemed too minor to merit reporting. And that, in turn, may be affecting the way older generations of women perceive episodes from their own pasts.It certainly worked that way for Emily Hoffman, 25, who works in the television industry in New York, and her mother, Amy Plummer.\u201cI really don\u2019t want to post this,\u201d Ms. Hoffman wrote on Facebook on Oct. 10, a few days after the Trump tape was aired. But she went on to reveal to her 1,326 Facebook friends what for seven years had been one of her most private secrets: that she had been assaulted by a senior male colleague while an 18-year-old intern at a film-promotion company.He attacked her in a deserted stairwell, Ms. Hoffman announced, kissing her, groping her breasts and genitals, and then forcibly masturbating against her.\u201cMy experience mimicked what Donald Trump described in those tapes,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt was very upsetting.\u201dFor Ms. Plummer, who is in her 60s, seeing her daughter\u2019s post was transformative.\u201cWhen Emily felt brave enough to put her experiences down was when I specifically started to think about my own experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized I would not have had the courage she had to say it publicly.\u201dBut she also realized she had things of her own to share. She still felt that some of her experiences were too \u201cexplicit\u201d to discuss. But she shared others with her daughter.How in junior high, for instance, her male guidance counselor told her that she should \u201cconsider a career as a Playboy bunny.\u201d And how she left graduate school without her master\u2019s degree after a professor told her that she would not be able to pass her oral exams \u201cunless I was \u2018nice\u2019 to him.\u201dOne thing is notably missing from most of the stories survivors are now sharing: perpetrators\u2019 names. The stigma of having been assaulted may have waned, but making an accusation against a specific individual is a different matter.It can raise the risk of legal consequences such as libel or slander suits. Many survivors, however, say social consequences are a more significant deterrent.\u201cThere is a sense that a \u2018good victim\u2019 merely shares her story to raise awareness or make people feel less alone,\u201d Ms. Brodsky said. \u201cBut the minute there is a desire for accountability or change or retribution, suddenly she\u2019s untrustworthy.\u201dWhen women accuse celebrities or other high-profile people like Mr. Trump or Roger Ailes, the former Fox News executive, she said, \u201cthat triggers the unfounded but insidious myth that women say that they\u2019ve been assaulted for attention or money.\u201dThe pressure not to name names can be strong whenever the perpetrator is someone the woman knows. An accusation forces everyone who knows the two people to choose a side: accuser or accused? Choosing the accuser often means going against the broader group or community.In her work on college campuses around the country, Ms. Brodsky said, she has observed that \u201cpeers and friends are much more inclined to be sympathetic to victims if they don\u2019t make anyone\u2019s life more complicated.\u201d\u201cNaming names creates an inconvenience,\u201d she added.Psychological research shows that people find it extremely difficult \u2014 even painful \u2014 to challenge their peer groups. In the famous \u201cconformity study\u201d conducted by Solomon Asch, a professor of social psychology at the University of Pennsylvania who died in 1996, participants were asked to answer a series of simple, questions with obvious answers. There was a catch, though: Before the subject had a chance to respond, other research assistants disguised as participants all confidently selected the same wrong answer.That set up a dilemma: Choose the right answer, or conform to the group by selecting the wrong one? Even though the stakes were very low, about three-quarters of participants capitulated to group pressure at least once.Ms. Hoffman believes that her decision not to name her accuser is the reason her post has received such a uniformly positive response. \u201cI\u2019m not naming anybody in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s somebody who they need to defend.\u201dNancy Erika Smith, a New Jersey lawyer who has represented victims of sexual assault and discrimination for more than two decades, said she recognized that asking people to identify who had harmed them was in many ways an unfair burden.\u201cDon\u2019t do it for yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it for all of us. Speak up.\u201dAn article on Oct. 23 about a new national understanding of sexual assault, apparently provoked by a recording in which Donald J. Trump brags about how his fame allows him to grope women, misidentified, using information from a Stanford historian, the century whose midpoint is regarded as the time when patriarchal attitudes toward sexual crimes began to change. Sexual assault and rape were viewed primarily as crimes against the honor of women\u2019s husbands and fathers until the mid-19th century \u2014 not the mid-20th, according to the historian, Estelle B. Freedman.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sony PlayStation VR Review: The Best of an Early Crop", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byTech FixWhen Sony releases its virtual-reality headset next week, you can live your childhood fantasy of donning the cape and cowl of a classic superhero in the video game Batman: Arkham VR.Sadly, suiting up in the virtual environment is just about the coolest thing you can do.The concept of becoming the masked vigilante, who is as brilliant at solving crimes as he is skilled in martial arts, sounds great on paper. But soon after you start playing the immersive game, you will feel more like Batman confined to an easy chair.That\u2019s because Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR, set to be released on Oct. 13 for $399, was designed to be played sitting or standing \u2014 but not while walking. The headgear connects with Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 game console, working with the PlayStation camera, to detect body movements, and Sony\u2019s Move motion controllers, which are Wii-like wands that let you interact with virtual objects with your hands.When you play Batman, you can flick your wrist to toss a Batarang and turn your head to get a look at your surroundings. But to move around, like from your Batmobile to your Batcomputer inside the Batcave, you have to shoot a grappling hook at wherever you want to go. Outdoors, when lurking in the shadows of Gotham, you won\u2019t get to sneak up on foes and pound them with your fists \u2014 but you can teleport to their location and watch an animation of them being pummeled.PlayStation VR was meant to overcome those hurdles. The system was the odds-on favorite for mainstream success, partly because it has a lower barrier to entry and partly because tens of millions of people who already own a PlayStation 4 can easily hook it up to the console. In contrast, Oculus Rift and Vive require using a powerful, expensive computer to get a virtual reality experience.For now, the headset is best just for early adopters, who will benefit from PlayStation VR\u2019s easier setup and more comfortable feel compared with competing virtual-reality systems.Setting up PlayStation VR involves a bit more than plugging the device into a PlayStation.First, you hook up a box containing processors to the PlayStation, and then you plug the headset into the box. The processor box adds the ability to use 3-D audio \u2014 for example, you can hear helicopter sounds from up above, or footsteps coming from the stairs below.From there, you plug the camera into the console. If you are using Move controllers, you also plug those into the console to pair them up. Then you can unplug the Move controllers and use them wirelessly, or use the traditional PlayStation controller to navigate the menu and play virtual-reality games.Putting on the headgear is easy. Pressing a button on the back of the headset lets you extend it until it fits around your head. On the headset\u2019s cable is a headphone jack.After that, all that is left to do is download some games and wait for them to install to get started. Over all, it took about 15 minutes to set up the device and another 15 minutes to download a game.Among the three premium virtual-reality devices \u2014 PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive \u2014 the PlayStation device is the only one I would recommend for consumers who are eager to dive into virtual reality. There are four main reasons:\u25a0 PlayStation VR is significantly cheaper than rival systems. When the price of Sony\u2019s headgear ($399) is combined with the price of a slimmer PlayStation 4 ($299), along with two Move wands ($99 for a pair) and the PlayStation camera ($59), that totals about $860. By contrast, Oculus is selling its Rift headset for $599, or about $1,400 when combined with a computer. HTC\u2019s Vive is even more expensive: about $800 for the headset and roughly another $800 for a computer that supports it.\u25a0 PlayStation VR is a safer bet for games. In the video game industry, the console with the best content is king. Sony has had longstanding relationships for decades with game developers big and small, dating to the original PlayStation, so you are more likely to see familiar game franchises appear on PlayStation VR than the other systems. Sony\u2019s sample of nine titles for testing PlayStation VR was more compelling than the first titles for Vive and Rift.\u25a0 The PlayStation virtual-reality system is more practical to have in a living room. Because PlayStation VR connects with the PlayStation console, the system won\u2019t take up as much space. Both Oculus Rift and Vive require a PC, along with a mouse and keyboard to download or open games, which is cumbersome. (Have you ever tried using a mouse and keyboard on the living room floor or on a TV stand? Not pleasant.)\u25a0 Sony\u2019s entry into virtual reality has been smoother. Before releasing PlayStation VR, Sony had already released motion controllers and a camera that would eventually support the technology. Oculus has postponed the release of its motion controllers for Rift, which severely limits what you can do inside virtual reality, and HTC\u2019s release of Vive ran into many problems.Virtual reality is still in its early days, and it\u2019s unclear whether it will ever catch on with people beyond gamers. If you already own a PlayStation, spending a few hundred dollars for the headgear and accessories is a worthwhile purchase to get started on virtual reality.But for the average consumer, the thrill of virtual-reality gaming with PlayStation VR may be fleeting. Initially, virtual reality will probably mesmerize you because it\u2019s so unlike any gaming experience you have ever had. But the scarce number of good games available today, combined with the fatigue you will experience after 30 minutes of game play, may drive you back to gaming on your smartphone or television screen.So I wouldn\u2019t run \u2014 or even stroll, for that matter \u2014 to buy a virtual-reality system.

I saw on Facebook that one of my sisters and one of my cousins were doing something called the #22pushups challenge, and I wanted in.The concept was simple: do 22 push-ups a day for 22 days, post video of said push-ups to Facebook and nominate someone each day to play along. The cause was noble: raising awareness of veteran suicide. The number was not arbitrary: a 2012 study suggested an average of 22 former service members killed themselves each day.I started Sept. 29. Mostly, I did the push-ups in my basement around 6 a.m., tacked onto my daily workout. Sometimes my 9-year-old daughter held the iPhone \u2014 and sometimes she forgot to push video, and 22 push-ups became 44, or, once, 66.Compliments poured in, but so did a few critiques: Two trainers told me push-ups were worthless unless my chest touched the floor. They said to put my knees down, so I did, though it felt like cheating.Of course, colleagues at The New York Times were among the people I nominated. I noticed that Ian Fisher, our top weekend editor, was using Facebook Live rather than uploading video later \u2014 and that he was doing his push-ups in the newsroom (and in dress shoes!). As I headed into my last days of the challenge, I suggested we join forces. Since I suggested this on Ian\u2019s Facebook page, other colleagues raised their hands, too.So on Wednesday, a baker\u2019s dozen of us dropped and did 22 on a carpeted area near the third-floor elevators. Craig Allen, a photo editor on the international desk, helmed the video. As we left the building that evening, Marc Lacey, the national editor, joked that we should take the party to the broad sidewalk outside its grand entrance.A few among us were wary about putting their hands on New York City pavement; Marc thoughtfully brought some pages from the newspaper. But the intrepid Ian, a longtime foreign correspondent, demurred.\u201cI\u2019ve worked in a nursing home, I\u2019ve covered wars, I have children,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing that water won\u2019t wash off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Sandy, Overpromising and Underdelivering", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe fourth anniversary of Hurricane Sandy will come and go next week, but thousands of storm-struck New York City homeowners will still be waiting for their houses to be rebuilt under the city\u2019s misbegotten Build It Back program.The program is $500 million over budget and on track to blow its end-of-2016 completion deadline. Under the program, begun by Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the city was to repair or rebuild homes or to reimburse homeowners for repairs they completed themselves.Of the 5,565 single-family homes in the city-managed construction pipeline, only 44 percent have been completed so far, and Mayor Bill de Blasio says that figure will reach 75 percent by the end of the year. Build It Back was originally budgeted to use $1.7 billion in federal housing funds, but now the de Blasio administration says it needs an additional $500 million in city funds to finish the job.It\u2019s clear from the anger that administration officials faced at a City Council hearing on Thursday that Mr. de Blasio is paying the price for the managerial blunder of overpromising and underdelivering. Councilman Mark Treyger, chairman of the Recovery and Resiliency Committee, called it an \u201coutrage\u201d that the budget had somehow climbed by half a billion dollars, even though the total number of participants \u2014 about 8,500 \u2014 was far lower than the 22,000 who filed applications when the program began.Mr. de Blasio clearly needs more time, a chance to deliver on his promises. But there should also be, as Mr. Oddo has urged, an independent post-mortem investigation of this and other Sandy failures, looking into why its initial cost estimates were so far off and what the city plans to do to avoid problems the next time.One likely answer is going to be very hard for homeowners to accept: In a rapidly changing climate, their windblown condos and bungalows are in harm\u2019s way, and what government really should be rebuilding is storm-absorbing wetlands and parks.Advertisement"}

The residents call it Copacabana Palace, after a famous five-star hotel. They also call it Jambalaya, after a popular TV show, or Carandiru, after a notorious prison in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo. The people he met were mostly honest, hard-working people, he said. Some had lost their jobs or could not afford rising rents because of inflation. Others were born on the street and never had a home. Some were fleeing problems with drug gangs.Some residents worried that Mr. Bauza, 57, was trying to take advantage of them, so he spent weeks just talking with them. He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t promise that their lives would change because of his photographs, but he told them that he would treat them with dignity and show the reality of their daily lives. Not only the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpain, misery and needs but also joy and happiness and dreams,\u201d he said.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he moved in, staying with families or living inside a tent that he pitched in one of the buildings. He shared \u00e2\u0080\u009cbarbecues and siestas on sofas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and grew close to several families.There was a vibrant economy in the development, including hairdressers, food vendors and a candy store. Some residents worked as day laborers, while others existed on meager social welfare payments. There was not much drug dealing, but some young women worked as prostitutes outside of the development, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are average people, like us, who at times are forced to do certain things to survive,\u201d he said.When construction stopped at the development decades ago, scavengers swooped in and stripped the buildings clean of pipes and cables, leaving the structure vulnerable to corrosion and water damage. The development lacks the basic infrastructure for sewage or electricity, Mr. Bauza said, and a partial roof collapse led to the evacuation of one of the buildings.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, bad or good, it is a shelter and better than the street,\u201d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can always be better, but it can always be worse.\u201dThe police are rarely seen there, but neither are drug gangs. Security is provided by a militia, made up largely of former police officers, firefighters and soldiers who charge for protection, Mr. Bauza said. Residents who do not follow the militia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rules \u00e2\u0080\u009crisk merciless retribution,\u201d he added.Mr. Bauza has been a serious amateur photographer since he was a teenager in Germany, but he worked for much of his adult life as a manager for international chemical companies, mostly in South America. A business trip to rural Uganda in 2012 brought him in contact with survivors of attacks by the violent Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Resistance Army.  He stayed longer, and his photos of them were published widely. The experience made him keenly aware, he said, of the global disparity between the rich and the poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfrica changed me and opened my mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Bauza said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI realized that I needed to defend the rights of poor people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is what led him to stay at the Copacabana Palace, even though he could afford the real five-star hotel by the beach.

I did not contend or imply that Snowden was acting legally or should not be prosecuted for acting in behalf of what he claims is a more morally compelling cause, namely, to protest congressionally approved but sometimes abusive police-state practices adopted to combat international terrorism at whatever cost to a free and open society. I further pointed out that one measure of America\u2019s mostly enhanced press/media freedom is that since The New York Times and The Washington Post prevailed in their 1971 defense against the Nixon administration\u2019s efforts to quash publication of the Pentagon Papers, the federal government has not attempted to prosecute publishers for disclosures that it feels are inimical to national security priorities.But what the government, including the Obama administration, has done is to put heat on the media to disclose the names of whistle-blowers involved in national security leaks. Such pressure, chilling the willingness of whistle-blowers to make (often lawbreaking) revelations that the media would otherwise be unable to obtain, is tantamount to an authoritarian intrusion on press freedom. In that context only did I contend that our liberty of expression is no less imperiled now than when as British subjects, American colonists faced harsh punishment for defaming their royal rulers. Snowden, whatever you think of him, did not hide his whistle-blowing from the world, sparing the media from having to confront extreme government pressure to identify their informant.RICHARD KLUGERBERKELEY, CALIF.Bill Keller replies:In Kluger\u2019s epilogue he worries about a climate of menace that goes considerably beyond the absence of a national shield law (which would not have spared Snowden from exile).

Rabbits of every possible size and color hopped and groomed and basked in the sun.\u201cAs you can see, we have many babies,\u201d the woman, Dorota Trec, said as a little black fluff ball bounded by. \u201cAll of them were born in the tunnels, in the caves, but now some of them are out front. That is good for people to see.\u201dIt was early afternoon \u2014 not an active time for rabbits \u2014 on a recent Thursday, and Ms. Trec apologized that most were in their burrows.\u201cI will get more of them to come out,\u201d she said. She fetched a bag of timothy hay and sang out \u201czajaczka,\u201d the Polish word for bunny. (It sounded like \u201czye-YONNNCH-ka!\u201d) Several more rabbits appeared from various directions.\u201cIt is essential that they learn the song before winter comes,\u201d Ms. Trec said. In cold weather, she explained, the water in their drinking bowls freezes shortly after she puts it out, so they must be quick. \u201cI\u2019m raising them to be wild, and strong.\u201dMs. Trec, undaunted, has rebuilt her colony.Now there are six dozen, she said: plain brown rabbits, white ones with black patches, tawny ones, black dwarfs, brindles, floppy-eared lops and one adorable smudge-nosed calico.Ms. Trec pointed out a freakishly large creature over by one of the five wooden hutches.\u201cLook at that huge rabbit!\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s still growing. That means we will have more huge rabbits.\u201dMs. Trec, who lives nearby, said she began keeping rabbits in the vacant lot \u2014 she calls it a garden \u2014 in 2012, with help from the property\u2019s owner, who declined to comment but seemed supportive of her.An A.S.P.C.A. vet examined the rabbits, and her findings were disturbing. More than two-thirds had injuries, mostly bite wounds. Thirty-three had sustained genital or anal trauma. Around half tested positive for syphilis. Others had abscesses, skin inflammations, fever, lameness.At least nine of the rabbits later died. Most were adopted. Ms. Trec set about repopulating the warren by buying unneutered rabbits from slaughterhouses, many of which had been discarded by show breeders, she said.She also filed a lawsuit against the police, prosecutors, the A.S.P.C.A. and several others, including Ms. Reeves.Ms. Trec sought a total of $2.8 billion. A judge dismissed the suit against Ms. Reeves and stayed certain claims against the police and prosecutors for procedural reasons, pending the outcome of the criminal trial.Ms. Trec, who is representing herself, has scored one legal victory: A judge turned down prosecutors\u2019 request to issue a restraining order barring her from keeping rabbits. The decision galls Ms. Reeves.\u201cSome people say, \u2018Well, she hasn\u2019t been convicted of anything,\u2019\u201d Ms. Reeves said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m accused of child abuse, the state is not going to give me the benefit of the doubt and let me have custody of a child while the case is pending.\u201dIf Ms. Trec is convicted, prosecutors could seek a restraining order again.Ms. Trec contends that she is the steward of a thriving community. \u201cIt\u2019s not rabbit hoarding \u2014 this is a herd of rabbits,\u201d she said. \u201cRabbits in the wild live in large groups, just like penguins in the wild live in large groups.\u201dAs for the health of her current crew, this untrained observer was not sure what to conclude. Many of the rabbits were missing small clumps of fur but seemed otherwise normal and active. Two rabbits rested on each other in a patch of sun, looking a bit lethargic. All the rest appeared fine. None looked underfed. Most of them were going about rabbit business.A starling hopped into the yard over by the water bowls. \u201cSee that bird?\u201d Ms. Trec said. \u201cYou see more and more life in this garden. I\u2019ve seen tarantulas here. I\u2019ve seen that big green insect. You see all kinds of worms, more and more organisms.\u201dThe rabbit herd, Ms. Trec promised, would continue to grow.\u201cThere is no such thing as too much life.\u201dAn article last Sunday about a woman in Brooklyn who owns many rabbits and is facing animal-cruelty charges described incorrectly the status of a civil lawsuit she filed. The suit was stayed, pending the outcome of her criminal trial, against at least six of the 12 defendants; it was not dismissed against most of the defendants.Email petcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

Jan Brewer and Gen. Michael T. Flynn pre-hyped the debate. Ivanka Trump, in a taped message, called for donations and promised, \u201cMy father will make us all proud!\u201d There were \u201cad breaks\u201d for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign spots. Even he could not call this coverage rigged against him.From the beginning, the former \u201cApprentice\u201d host has approached this campaign like a programmer, assiduously feeding the beast to maximize free media coverage of his rallies.On Wednesday, he dominated the pre-debate chatter by inviting to the event a list of provocative guests \u2014 among them Sarah Palin, Barack Obama\u2019s half brother and the mother of a man killed in the attack at Benghazi \u2014 as if he were casting a reality show: \u201cSo You Think You Can Rattle Hillary Clinton.\u201dMrs. Clinton had the more normal, boring job at the final debate, something you might recognize from a past election cycle, before we all entered Mr. Trump\u2019s reality. As the front-runner, she sought to protect her lead and make a final case, needling her opponent strategically and deflecting potential damage (including questions on the Clinton Foundation and the revelations from WikiLeaks).But there were two Donald Trumps at the debate, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with two conflicting missions. The presidential candidate, trailing in the polls, was looking at his last chance to broaden his appeal for a general electorate. The possible future media mogul had to service a passionate niche audience that expects edgier content.The candidate showed up first. Prompted by the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox, to discuss the Supreme Court, the two nominees actually discussed it. It was the kind of debate Mrs. Clinton might have imagined having against, say, Jeb Bush, in which two politicians soberly contrast positions on judicial issues \u2014 abortion, gun regulation \u2014 that don\u2019t involve one throwing the other in jail.It was not a friendly meeting. There were no handshakes, before or after the face-off. But Mr. Trump was more stone-faced and conscious of his body language than at the first debate, where he raged, or the second, where he loomed. He declined the bait early when Mrs. Clinton accused him of having \u201cchoked\u201d in a meeting with the president of Mexico.But like the previous two debates, this one took a turn, as Mr. Trump the performer gave in to the urge to riff and mix it up.It played like a preview reel of Trump TV attractions. There was an old-timey Western, in which Mr. Trump promised to rid the country of \u201cbad hombres\u201d from across the border. There was a Charlie McCarthy routine, as Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Trump a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, and he responded: \u201cNo puppet. You\u2019re the puppet!\u201d At times, the glowering candidate seemed to be imitating Alec Baldwin on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d imitating him.Mr. Wallace had raised concerns earlier that he would be a laissez-faire moderator, saying that it was not his role to fact-check candidates. But he proved a tough disciplinarian, policing not only the candidates but \u2014 at long last \u2014 the crowd, whose hooting and cheering he shut down. (Memo to America in 2020: No more debate audiences, ever.)Mr. Wallace prompted the biggest headline of the night, asking Mr. Trump, who has charged that the election is rigged against him, if he will accept the results of the vote. \u201cI will tell you at the time,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you in suspense, O.K.?\u201dIn other words: Stay tuned for the shocking series finale of \u201cAmerica\u201d!Was it a mistake? For a candidate trying to reassure a general-election audience, you would think so. That candidate might also \u2014 already under fire for his treatment of women \u2014 not volunteer the sound bite, \u201cSuch a nasty woman,\u201d when Mrs. Clinton dinged him for avoiding taxes.But for the potential owner-operator-star of Trump TV, it was all branding.Ask Roger Ailes, late of Fox News, who has advised Mr. Trump, or Stephen Bannon, of Breitbart News, who is his campaign chief executive: A loyal political-media audience needs continual grievance and craves conflict.

{"Headline": "Liberal Economists Think Big Companies Are Too Powerful. Hillary Clinton Agrees.", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsThat\u2019s what makes Hillary Clinton\u2019s new comments about corporate power and antitrust law important.Her campaign has embraced an emerging line of thought in left-of-center economic circles: that a big part of what ails the United States economy are policies that have allowed the biggest companies to become too big and too powerful, resulting in less competition, less opportunity for entrepreneurship, and lower levels of investment and compensation for workers.Notably, this is an area of economic policy in which the president has great leeway to act. If you want huge spending on public infrastructure or subsidies for college, Congress needs to agree; if you want more aggressive antitrust enforcement, you need only appoint the right people to key jobs at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.The campaign frames her efforts as being all about giving smaller companies a better shot against the big guys \u2014 \u201crewarding innovation and entrepreneurship in the private sector,\u201d as the fact sheet puts it. Besides aggressively questioning proposed mergers, Mrs. Clinton intends to appoint antitrust officials who will retrospectively analyze past deals and potential \u201cexploitation of excessive market power where it already exists.\u201dIn other words, she wants even companies that have already attained enormous market share to know that the government will be watching how they use that power.With the proposal, Mrs. Clinton taps into a stream of research from left-leaning economists and lawyers over the last few years, including the Obama White House, that frames excessive market power for large companies as a key culprit of many of the United States\u2019 economic problems.It\u2019s not a given that these shifts are entirely, or even mostly, because antitrust enforcers turn a blind eye to industry consolidation. These trends may be connected to technological shifts that create \u201creturns to scale,\u201d or major competitive advantages that accrue to being the biggest company in an industry. They can relate to the \u201cnetwork effects\u201d that mean a product becomes more valuable the more people use it.Those arguments might help explain why Boeing and Airbus are the only makers of commercial jumbo jets, or why Facebook has such a huge share of the social networking market. But those arguments are harder to mount in some sectors, and that\u2019s where Mrs. Clinton has aimed her fire.Of course, companies seeking to merge would fight in court against more activist regulators who try to stop them. And some mergers can create companies that are more efficient and can produce a broad range of consumer benefits.But it\u2019s now evident that a Clinton administration would embrace the idea that the biggest companies shouldn\u2019t get any bigger.Advertisement"}

For many Filipinos, Mr. Duterte\u2019s passionate outbursts, however crude and impolitic, are signs of his fearlessness and willingness to act. The weak leadership of previous presidents, they say, led to high rates of violent crime, drug use, woefully inadequate infrastructure and widespread poverty.\u201cHis initiatives, and this includes the antidrug campaign, are well received by the people,\u201d said Ramon C. Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an impact on the overall perception of his administration or presidency.\u201dWhile Mr. Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign and outrageous statements have received all the attention abroad, he has pushed ahead with an array of progressive social policies that have won him broad support in the Philippines.Lorraine Badoy, a dermatologist and a volunteer at a nongovernmental organization who lives in one of Manila\u2019s gated communities, acknowledges that the president\u2019s outbursts make her cringe. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d shut up sometimes,\u201d she said.President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has a reputation for frank speechmaking that often angers the international community.But she says she is more enamored of his social policies than she is concerned about the casualties of the antidrug campaign. In Mr. Duterte, she said: \u201cI see something that I have not seen in a long time in the Philippines, which is that he cares. He cares for the small guy, which is very important to me.\u201dHis government has paved the way for indigenous people displaced by mining and logging to return to their ancestral lands, has committed to providing free irrigation to subsistence farmers, has suspended the operations of mining companies that violated environmental protection laws, and has begun a program of free checkups for the 20 million poorest Filipinos.His support has blossomed on social media \u2014 followers on the most popular pro-Duterte pages number in the millions \u2014 which his administration has cannily harnessed.Social media catapulted Mr. Duterte to the presidency, says his communications secretary, Martin Andanar, and it remains a bastion of support in the face of what Mr. Andanar considers negative coverage by international and local news media.\u201cIt is very important for our team to maintain, and even encourage \u2014 foster \u2014 the relationship of the different social media patriots of President Duterte,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do it by reaching out to them, they reach out to us.\u201dMr. Duterte\u2019s social media team, which Mr. Andanar oversees, selects a weekly message, often tied to the news, and creates posts it hopes will be reposted and widely shared by supporters.He said he recently told followers on social media that \u201cthe crime news has been blown out of proportion, and nobody\u2019s listening to our economic policies.\u201dWhen Mr. Duterte likened himself to Hitler, his supporters rushed to defend him on social media, arguing that the comment was precipitated by a remark by former President Benigno S. Aquino III, who compared Mr. Duterte to Hitler five months earlier.The argument aligned with ones made the same day by administration officials. \u201cIt is a matter of record that the reference to Hitler did not originate from the president,\u201d his spokesman Ernesto Abella said in a statement.A pro-Duterte site went further, posting photographs of two Reuters journalists it accused of causing the furor by misrepresenting Mr. Duterte\u2019s words, and calling for their punishment. The post was shared thousands of times on social media and whipped up an untold number of commenters, who created a flurry of threats and insults. Mocha Uson, a blogger with 4.2 million followers on Facebook, shared the images, adding the caption in Tagalog, \u201cEnemies of change.\u201dCritics of Mr. Duterte have been threatened with rape and a variety of deaths, including by hanging, drowning and, as one pro-Duterte doctor suggested to Emily Rauhala, who has written about the Philippines for The Washington Post, that she crawl back into her mother\u2019s uterus and suffocate.Mr. Andanar said that the administration did not condone threats of violence on social media. So far, none has been carried out.However, he said, \u201cI cannot blame the Duterte social media patriots when they protect the president and when they do everything that they can to pounce on the enemy.\u201dMany Duterte supporters say their cause is unfairly portrayed in the mainstream news media.But Melinda Quintos de Jesus, executive director of the Center for Media Freedom, said that threats by pro-Duterte online mobs had intimidated the national news media.The local news media has published some criticism and several reports on specific cases of extrajudicial killings, she said, but the major television stations and newspapers have failed to produce critical analyses of Mr. Duterte\u2019s policies.\u201cThey like him, they fear him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey basically are afraid to be singled out.\u201dIn The Hague on Thursday, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, issued a blunt warning to the government, saying that the violent anti-drug crackdown could become a target of a criminal investigation because large-scale killing fell within the jurisdiction of the court.There are signs, in some quarters at least, that the killings have begun to tarnish Mr. Duterte\u2019s popularity.In a slum in Pasay, a district of greater Manila, on a recent Saturday, Migo Paladio, 24, stood in a narrow alley and watched the crowds from two wakes spill out. They were for men killed by vigilantes on the presumption that they were drug dealers.Mr. Paladio, a technician, said they were not dealers. He said they were among 10 people he knew who had been killed in the last three months in Mr. Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign.He voted for Mr. Duterte, but he said his support was wavering.\u201cI was wrong about what I thought was going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s prioritizing the killings too much.

{"Headline": "8 Nursing Home Killings Leave Ontario Asking: Why?", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byOn Tuesday, the Ontario Provincial Police charged the nurse, Elizabeth Wettlaufer, with eight counts of first-degree, or premeditated, murder over a seven-year period, 2007 to 2014. The patients ranged in age from 75 to 96. Seven of them lived at a nursing home in Woodstock, a farming and manufacturing city of 37,000, where Ms. Wettlaufer worked until two and a half years ago. The eighth patient died about an hour\u2019s drive away, at a home in London, Ontario, that had briefly employed Ms. Wettlaufer.Mayor Trevor Birtch of Woodstock said few people did not have at least some connection to the victims or their families.\u201cAt this time, everyone is being extra sensitive and tactful,\u201d said Mr. Birtch, whose family established the city\u2019s first homestead in the early 19th century. \u201cAs things progress, we\u2019ll learn more.\u201dFor now, however, unknowns prevail. Relatives and friends of Ms. Wettlaufer declined to speak to reporters, and the families of the victims indicated that they wished to keep their thoughts private.On Wednesday, the air inside the red brick Anglican Church of the Epiphany was filled with the aroma of roasting poultry as volunteers set up a turkey dinner. But the Rev. Stephen Hendry, the rector, said the church, in cooperation with the city, would soon be transformed into a center for grief counseling.\u201cMy sense is that the whole community is affected by different degrees of pain,\u201d he said in his study. \u201cPeople are asking a lot of questions. That\u2019s one of the huge issues: How, when, why, where? Understanding how something like this might happen.\u201dThe answers to many of those questions may not emerge until Ms. Wettlaufer goes on trial. But reports on Wednesday shed some light on why the provincial police, along with the local forces in Woodstock and London, moved so rapidly on deaths that occurred years ago.At a news conference on Tuesday, the police said that they had acted on a tip that they received on Sept. 29. They declined to disclose its source.It also emerged that Ms. Wettlaufer\u2019s dealings with the legal system began before her arrest on Monday. This month, she agreed to meet conditions laid out in a peace bond, essentially a promise to a court not to break the law.The conditions included a strict curfew; that she live at either her apartment or her parents\u2019 home in Woodstock; that she continue mental health treatment and abstain from alcohol; and that she stay out of hospitals, nursing homes and other health care facilities.Another of the conditions also suggested how the murders might have been committed. Ms. Wettlaufer is specifically barred from possessing insulin, which would be readily available to the staff in any nursing home.Dr. Michael Rieder, a professor at the Schulich School of Medicine at Western University in London, said that an insulin overdose would rapidly raise blood pressure and heart rates. With older people, that would most likely lead to a swift coronary-related death, which, given the patients\u2019 ages and general health, would probably not arouse suspicion.Dr. Rieder, who is also a regional coroner, said that in Ontario, the deaths of older patients were rarely examined and that if they were, insulin levels were not part of any toxicology screening.\u201cIt didn\u2019t surprise me in these cases that it took a long time to detect,\u201d he said.As for Ms. Wettlaufer, 49, little has emerged about her private life. At her seven-story apartment building, which overlooks an attractive park with four tennis courts, neighbors were, perhaps predictably, surprised to learn that she had been accused of being a serial killer.Five years ago, as part of a contest, she wrote \u201cInevitable,\u201d a poem about a female serial killer, which reads in part: \u201cHer knife sings a love song/to the splattering gore/slicing through breast bone/romancing some more.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pedals the Walking Bear Is Dead, New Jersey Officials Believe", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byThe internet mourned over the weekend after unconfirmed reports that Pedals, a bear that walked upright on its hind legs and was often captured on video strolling around New Jersey suburbs, may have been killed by a hunter.On Monday, the worst fears of Pedals fans seemed to be confirmed. The State of New Jersey said it believed the famous bear was dead. And it had photographic evidence.The New Jersey Department of Environment Protection released five pictures on Monday that showed the lifeless body of a 333-pound American black bear. He had injured or deformed forepaws \u2014 just like the ones Pedals held close to his chest as he meandered through the backyards of Rockaway Township, N.J.One picture released by the department showed the bear\u2019s body strung up from a ceiling by a chain. Bob Considine, a spokesman for the department, said that Pedals \u2014 whom he referred to only as \u201cthe upright bear\u201d \u2014 had been \u201charvested.\u201dMr. Considine said in a statement that the department could not conclusively determine the identity of the bear because Pedals had never been tagged or had a DNA sample taken. But they believed this bear to be him.\u201cThe injured paws and chest blaze of this particular adult bear brought to Green Pond appear to be consistent with the bear seen walking upright on several videos taken from North Jersey residents over the past two years,\u201d he said.The department did not appear to take a particularly warm view of the public affection for Pedals. Mr. Considine explained that there was \u201cno practical way\u201d to single out one bear for protection, however popular he may have been, during the hunt. And besides, he said, bears are wild animals.\u201cWhile many have developed an emotional attachment to the upright bear, it is important to recognize that all black bears are wildlife,\u201d Mr. Considine said. \u201cThey are not pets. They are capable of doing damage, even in a compromised state.\u201dNew Jersey has grappled in recent years with an exploding bear population that jostles for space alongside its human residents, who themselves are packed into the most densely populated state in the country.An annual hunt was introduced in 2010 to help manage the bear population. The 2016 hunt was the first time since the 1960s that bear hunters were allowed to use bows and arrows, Mr. Considine said. A total of 562 bears were killed last week.The department said on Monday that northwestern New Jersey has more black bears per square mile than anywhere else in North America and that its bears also enjoy one of the country\u2019s highest reproduction rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Artificial Intelligence Evolves, So Does Its Criminal Potential", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byImagine receiving a phone call from your aging mother seeking your help because she has forgotten her banking password.Except it\u2019s not your mother. The voice on the other end of the phone call just sounds deceptively like her.It is actually a computer-synthesized voice, a tour-de-force of artificial intelligence technology that has been crafted to make it possible for someone to masquerade via the telephone.Such a situation is still science fiction \u2014 but just barely. It is also the future of crime.The irony, of course, is that this year the computer security industry, with $75 billion in annual revenue, has started to talk about how machine learning and pattern recognition techniques will improve the woeful state of computer security.But there is a downside.\u201cThe thing people don\u2019t get is that cybercrime is becoming automated and it is scaling exponentially,\u201d said Marc Goodman, a law enforcement agency adviser and the author of \u201cFuture Crimes.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is not about Matthew Broderick hacking from his basement,\u201d a reference to the 1983 movie \u201cWar Games.\u201dThe alarm about malevolent use of advanced artificial intelligence technologies was sounded earlier this year by James R. Clapper, the director of National Intelligence. In his annual review of security, Mr. Clapper underscored the point that while A.I. systems would make some things easier, they would also expand the vulnerabilities of the online world.The growing sophistication of computer criminals can be seen in the evolution of attack tools like the widely used malicious program known as Blackshades, according to Mr. Goodman. The author of the program, a Swedish national, was convicted last year in the United States.The system, which was sold widely in the computer underground, functioned as a \u201ccriminal franchise in a box,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. It allowed users without technical skills to deploy computer ransomware or perform video or audio eavesdropping with a mouse click.The next generation of these tools will add machine learning capabilities that have been pioneered by artificial intelligence researchers to improve the quality of machine vision, speech understanding, speech synthesis and natural language understanding. Some computer security researchers believe that digital criminals have been experimenting with the use of A.I. technologies for more than half a decade.That can be seen in efforts to subvert the internet\u2019s omnipresent Captcha \u2014 Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart \u2014 the challenge-and-response puzzle invented in 2003 by Carnegie Mellon University researchers to block automated programs from stealing online accounts.Both \u201cwhite hat\u201d artificial intelligence researchers and \u201cblack hat\u201d criminals have been deploying machine vision software to subvert Captchas for more than half a decade, said Stefan Savage, a computer security researcher at the University of California, San Diego.\u201cIf you don\u2019t change your Captcha for two years, you will be owned by some machine vision algorithm,\u201d he said.Surprisingly, one thing that has slowed the development of malicious A.I. has been the ready availability of either low-cost or free human labor. For example, some cybercriminals have farmed out Captcha-breaking schemes to electronic sweatshops where humans are used to decode the puzzles for a tiny fee.Even more inventive computer crooks have used online pornography as a reward for human web surfers who break the Captcha, Mr. Goodman said. Free labor is a commodity that A.I. software won\u2019t be able to compete with any time soon.So what\u2019s next?Criminals, for starters, can piggyback on new tech developments. Voice-recognition technology like Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are now used extensively to interact with computers. And Amazon\u2019s Echo voice-controlled speaker and Facebook\u2019s Messenger chatbot platform are rapidly becoming conduits for online commerce and customer support. As is often the case, whenever a communication advancement like voice recognition starts to go mainstream, criminals looking to take advantage of it aren\u2019t far behind.Social engineering, which refers to the practice of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging information, is widely seen as the weakest link in the computer security chain. Cybercriminals already exploit the best qualities in humans \u2014 trust and willingness to help others \u2014 to steal and spy. The ability to create artificial intelligence avatars that can fool people online will only make the problem worse.This can already be seen in efforts by state governments and political campaigns who are using chatbot technology widely for political propaganda.Researchers have coined the term \u201ccomputational propaganda\u201d to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.It is only a matter of time before such software is put to criminal use.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cleverness in designing social engineering attacks, but as far as I know, nobody has yet started using machine learning to find the highest quality suckers,\u201d said Mark Seiden, an independent computer security specialist. He paused and added, \u201cI should have replied: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Dave, I can\u2019t answer that question right now.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conundrum for Justices: Does a Design Patent Cover a Whole Smartphone?", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday seemed inclined to let Samsung have a fresh shot at arguing that it does not have to give up all of its profits for copying a part of the distinctive look of Apple\u2019s iPhone.\u201cIt seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone,\u201d said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u201cIt\u2019s not applied to all the chips and wires.\u201dIt followed, he said, that \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t be profits awarded based on the entire price of the phone.\u201dSeveral justices seemed to agree that the damages Samsung must pay may well be less than its total profits of about $400 million on several phones. They said the right award might be limited to profits attributable to the protected features, including the iPhone\u2019s rounded corners and grid of icons.But the justices seemed frustrated about how to articulate the right legal standard. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he did not know what jurors should be told in deciding how much companies that infringe design patents must pay.\u201cNeither side gives us an instruction to work with,\u201d he said.Justice Sonia Sotomayor echoed the point. \u201cHow do we announce the right test?\u201d she asked.Kathleen M. Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, said jurors could, for instance, hear expert testimony from accountants.Justice Kennedy responded that such evidence could not place a value on a \u201cstroke of genius\u201d like the design of the Volkswagen Beetle. That analogy came up throughout the argument, with some justices arguing that the car\u2019s design provided much of its value.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. disagreed. \u201cI can\u2019t get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if it, you know, costs, I think, $1,800 when it was first sold in the United States? What if it cost $18,000? What if it got two miles per gallon? What if it broke down every 50 miles?\u201dJustice Stephen G. Breyer said jurors could be given examples. \u201cYou know, wallpaper, you get the whole thing,\u201d he said, referring to total profits. \u201cA Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don\u2019t get all the profit from the car.\u201dDesign patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.Ms. Sullivan, Samsung\u2019s lawyer, argued that design patents are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties.\u201cA smartphone is smart,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work.\u201dDesign patents once covered household items like spoons and fireplace grates \u2014 whose design was central to the product \u2014 and a finding of infringement required the defendant to turn over all of its profits.The case before the Supreme Court is just one challenge faced by Samsung. The firm is killing its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after struggling to address reports that the device can overheat and catch fire because of a manufacturing flaw.The three design elements at issue in this case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung\u2019s description, \u201ca particular black rectangular round-cornered front face\u201d; \u201ca substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim\u201d; and \u201ca particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.\u201dThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the court said.The design patent law says that infringers \u201cshall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit\u201d from the sale of \u201cany article of manufacture.\u201dAs the case reached the Supreme Court, the two sides and the Obama administration all focused on that last phrase, agreeing that the \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d at issue could be a component of the product rather than the entire product sold to consumers.\u201cThe parties, actually, and the government are fairly close,\u201d Justice Breyer remarked.But Ms. Sullivan said the appeals court had not allowed it to make its case on what was the \u201carticle of manufacture.\u201d Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for Apple, responded that Samsung had litigated the case on the understanding that the entire phone was the relevant product and that it could not change its mind now.The justices did not seem inclined to adjudicate that last dispute. \u201cWe have a hard enough question trying to figure out what the standard is,\u201d Justice Breyer told Mr. Waxman. \u201cNow, why can\u2019t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your arguments and theirs, and work it out.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Specter of Trump Loosens Tongues, if Not Purse Strings, in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-10-16", "News": "Supported byPALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 After years of scorning the political process, Silicon Valley has leapt into the fray. The prospect of a President Donald J. Trump is pushing the tech community to move beyond its traditional role as donors and to embrace a new existence as agitators and activists.Getting involved in politics used to be seen as clashing with Silicon Valley\u2019s value system: You transform the world by making problems obsolete, not solving them through Washington. Nor did entrepreneurs want to alienate whatever segment of customers did not agree with them politically.Such reticence is no longer in style here.\u201cWe\u2019re a bunch of nerds not used to having a lot of limelight,\u201d said Dave McClure, an investor who runs a tech incubator called 500 Startups. \u201cBut to quote Spider-Man, \u2018With great power comes great responsibility.\u2019\u201dAn initial group of donors pledged $50,000; the goal was to ask the \u201cnerdz\u201d for small donations to match that sum. They have not come through yet. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of optimistic we\u2019ll get the other $50,000 in a few weeks,\u201d Mr. McClure said.That relatively slow pace reflects Silicon Valley\u2019s shifting position: Even as it becomes increasingly free with its opinions, it has been less free with its checkbook. The most recent data, from late August, shows Mrs. Clinton taking in $7.7 million from the tech community, according to Crowdpac, a start-up that tracks donations. By that point in 2012, Crowdpac says, President Obama had raised $21 million from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of the business networking site LinkedIn, offers a snapshot of Silicon Valley\u2019s evolving approach to politics.Mr. Hoffman\u2019s outright donations, however, have been smaller this election cycle. In May, he gave $400,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund. Asked if there was more recent giving that had not shown up in federal election records, Mr. Hoffman cryptically responded in an email, \u201cLooking at some PACs, etc.\u201d He declined several opportunities to elaborate.Even as Priorities USA has raised $133 million this election cycle, far exceeding its total in 2012, its tech contributions have dwindled. The only familiar tech name this time around is John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, who gave $500,000.When he wrote the op-ed, he was uncertain about donating money to Mrs. Clinton, saying only that it was \u201cprobable.\u201d A spokeswoman said Sunday that Mr. Case gave $25,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund.Mason Harrison, Crowdpac\u2019s head of communications, offered a possible reason for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s less-than-robust support. \u201cDonors give to support candidates they love, not to defeat candidates they fear,\u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton is not as enthusiastic toward Silicon Valley and its disruptive ways. In a speech in the summer of 2015, she noted that start-ups in the \u201con-demand or so-called gig economy\u201d \u2014 Uber, Airbnb and their ilk \u2014 were \u201cunleashing innovation\u201d but also \u201craising hard questions about workplace protection and what a good job will look like in the future.\u201dThe Clinton campaign declined to comment. The Trump campaign did not respond to a query.If Silicon Valley\u2019s political involvement outlasts this unusual election, the tech community may start contributing more to the process than commentary and cash.\u201cNot only are tech people going to be wielding influence, but they\u2019re going to be the candidate,\u201d Mr. McClure said. \u201cReid Hoffman, Sheryl Sandberg\u201d \u2014 the chief operating officer of Facebook \u2014 \u201cand a bunch of other folks here have political aspirations.\u201dBut perhaps being vocal is a temporary condition after all. The venture firm CRV was in the spotlight at the end of August with its blunt anti-Trump message, which included the earthy epithet. A few weeks later, it cleaned up its website. The partners went from employing a publicist to seek out attention to declining interviews.\u201cWe reached everyone we wanted to reach, and hopefully influenced opinions,\u201d said Saar Gur, a CRV venture capitalist. \u201cThen the buzz died down and we went back to our day jobs, which are super busy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Malaysian Art Scene, Under the Radar", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Mahathir Mohamad \u2014 who transformed this country of paddy fields and rubber plantations into a modern economy of factories, highways and skyscrapers \u2014 is known as much for his bold economic vision as for his intolerance of anybody who got in his way.While he was prime minister of Malaysia between 1981 and 2003, Mr. Mahathir detained opponents, fired top judges, controlled the media, clipped the power of Malay royalty, fired one deputy and pushed another to resign.Yet the visual arts mostly escaped his attention.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d a show of 48 works by 28 artists at Ilham Gallery here that is on view until Nov. 20, is evidence of that inattention. Despite their critical nature, many of the pieces in the show appeared in state-funded institutions such as the National Art Gallery; some won national awards.Art was seen as a concern of the urban elite, with no influence on the masses. \u201cIt was not really on his radar,\u201d said Valentine Willie, the curator of \u201cEra Mahathir\u201d and the creative director of Ilham Gallery. \u201cIn a way, it was a saving grace for us. He didn\u2019t take us seriously.\u201dMr. Mahathir\u2019s policies created a growing wealthy class who were looking for ways to spend its money. \u201cIf you have a million-dollar apartment, what are you going to put on the wall? Not your grandmother\u2019s portrait,\u201d Mr. Willie said.Around Asia, artists who have criticized government through their works have struggled for funding and, in some cases, for their freedom. In the 1960s Indonesia, Hendra Gunawan, one of the archipelago\u2019s most celebrated artists, was imprisoned for years under Presidents Sukarno and Suharto for his alleged association with communists. More recently, the Chinese government detained the artist Ai Weiwei and prevented him from traveling abroad. In Malaysia this year, the artist Fahmi Reza was charged \u2014 twice \u2014 under cybercrime laws for posting a caricature of Prime Minister Najib Razak with a clown face on Instagram and Facebook.But in Mahathir\u2019s Malaysia in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, even as art took a decidedly sociopolitical turn, galleries flourished, as did theater.The show, which features works on loan from the national art gallery, private collections and the artists, opens with a panel by Mohd Nor Khalid, better known as Lat, whose cartoons ran in the pro-government New Straits Times.In the panel, the late Singapore prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, is drawn clutching a newspaper and asking Mr. Mahathir why he allows cartoonists to get away with such unflattering depictions of him. \u201cLook what they do to your nose!\u201d Mr. Lee says. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Mahathir (with a giant nose) agrees, \u201ctoo much freedom.\u201d It\u2019s funny, and makes a point: even among autocrats, there are degrees of autocracy.\u201cEra Mahathir\u201d also includes a politically charged work by Ahmad Fuad Osman. In 1998, the artist joined thousands in the streets protesting Mr. Mahathir\u2019s firing of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was later charged with corruption and sodomy \u2014 a crime in this country. Then he went home and picked up his brush.Until then, Mr. Ahmad Fuad had been known for his studied, symbolic pieces. He ended up producing four vigorous self-portraits, in oil, each over two meters high. Three were based on the old proverb \u201csee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,\u201d to which he added a fourth portrait, of him holding his nose.\u201cThere are times we have to scream,\u201d Mr. Ahmad Fuad said in a phone interview from his current base in Bali. \u201cWe can\u2019t whisper anymore. We have to let our voices out.\u201dMr. Ahmad Fuad\u2019s self-portraits were shown at Galeri Petronas, owned by the national oil company. It is one of these four pieces \u2014 titled \u201cShhh!\u201d and showing the artist with finger to lips \u2014 that is included in \u201cEra Mahathir.\u201dAnother work, \u201cNEP\u201d by Roslisham Ismail, is a wall-sized collage forming the acronym for the New Economic Policy, an affirmative-action plan for the country\u2019s majority Malays that Mr. Mahathir wielded to a greater degree than any leader before him. Look closer and the three giant letters are made up of posters and calling cards for loan sharks, a comment on the abuses of the policy and the growing chasm between rich and poor Malays.Liew Kung Yu\u2019s \u201cProposals for my country\u201d features a photo montage of the Greek and Roman columns that mushroomed during the building boom, adorning everything from mansions to office buildings to wooden stilt houses \u2013- a sign of new money gone mad.Mr. Liew, in an interview, decried Mr. Mahathir\u2019s obsession with showy construction; the Petronas Twin Towers, briefly the world\u2019s tallest buildings, were erected during his time.Kathy Rowland, a Malaysian arts researcher who wrote an essay for the show\u2019s catalog, noted that it was during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s time that the state built a national theater, a national art gallery \u2014 both planned under earlier administrations \u2014 and a home for the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra at the base of the Petronas Twin Towers. \u201cI suppose a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d she said.The show comes at a time when Mr. Mahathir, 91, is starting a new political party and forging a once-unthinkable alliance with the opposition to try to oust the current prime minister, Najib Razak, who is implicated in a billion-dollar scandal involving a state fund named 1MDB. That the gallery, as well as the skyscraper it\u2019s located in, is owned by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and one of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s closest allies, only adds to the intrigue.Mr. Willie, the curator, said that he had the idea for the show for a while and that the timing with current events is coincidental. Mr. Daim, a longtime art collector, provides the space for Ilham \u2014 12,000 square feet over two floors, in a building designed by Foster + Partners on the edge of the central business district. He pays Mr. Willie, who used to own five galleries across Southeast Asia, a fee to run it, but does not interfere in curatorial decisions, Mr. Willie said. Entry is free and none of the works are for sale.Ilham\u2019s ownership has perturbed some in the arts community, who fear that artists are being co-opted in some larger political tussle. Ray Langenbach, an American who worked in Malaysia for years and is now a theater professor at the University of the Arts Helsinki, said he rejected a request from the gallery to include his 1994 video documenting a performance piece by another artist.The piece was based on one of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s most severe crackdowns, 1987\u2019s Operation Lalang \u2014 \u201clalang\u201d is a hardy local weed \u2014 when 106 activists, politicians, intellectuals, students and others were detained for allegedly stoking racial tension. \u201cAllowing criticism of his past acts makes Mahathir stronger now,\u201d Mr. Langenbach said in an email. (The gallery used news clippings about the performance piece instead.)Still, the gallery has attracted the participation of many independent voices.\u201cIt\u2019s a relevant art show, and you see a lot of anger from the time he was in power,\u201d said Jahabar Sadiq, a Malaysian journalist who also wrote an essay on Mr. Mahathir\u2019s legacy for the show\u2019s catalog. In it, he described the former leader\u2019s biggest fault as bringing an over-concentration of power to the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cOf course there\u2019s an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sadiq said. \u201cThe agenda is I want you to talk about it! This is therapy for the country. The country needs this therapy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Better Citizenship, Scratch and Win", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byFixesChina, with its largely cash economy, has a huge problem with tax evasion. Not just grand tax evasion, but the everyday \u201cno receipt, please\u201d kind, even though there have been harsh penalties: Before 2011, some forms of tax evasion were even punishable by death.The country needed a different approach. So what did it do to get people to pay sales tax?When a receipt is a lottery ticket, people ask for a receipt. They hope to get money, but just as important, they like to play games. Those axioms apply around the globe.What else could lotteries do?What effect did Voteria have? (More than one can apply)The answers are A and B.Guerra told a local radio program that Voteria was unique among nonpartisan efforts to increase turnout. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that\u2019s been as successful as this, at least that political science literature has been able to capture,\u201d he said.A counterargument is that millions of dollars are spent in elections \u2014 including public money in many places \u2014 in ways that alienate and misinform voters. Why is a lottery worse?Sweden\u2019s Speed Camera Lottery, instead of just ticketing speeders, also rewarded drivers going at or below the speed limit. They could enter a lottery with a grand prize of $3,000 \u2014 prize money culled from the proceeds of speeding tickets.What were the results?It\u2019s B.But even though the average speed dropped while the camera was up, the effect quickly vanished when the experiment ended. Sweden tried the camera in five other places. On average, speed was reduced by 8 percent, which would cut fatal accidents by 32 percent. Swedish traffic officials concluded that while the lottery was effective, it would have to be in use continuously.But Sweden didn\u2019t expand or continue the speed lottery, and no one else has used it. Richardson has a theory about why: \u201cSweden was very open to it because their goal is to achieve zero traffic deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile in the U.S.A. and other countries, giving tickets is a revenue-generating thing and the idea of getting rid of it would be abhorrent to somebody.\u201dLike any scheme to pay people to do things they should be doing anyway, lotteries have their critics.One fear is that enforcing norms with money could make things worse: if people are rewarded for good behavior, they tend to think of it as an economic choice and not a moral one. That can weaken the social norms that are often a more powerful enforcer of rules.On the other hand, people are fined for bad behavior all the time. Rewarding them for good behavior is essentially the same action, in reverse. Insurance companies have good driver discounts, for example. That\u2019s just a more pleasant way to say that they charge bad drivers more.One big market for lotteries is in promoting health. Such lotteries have been used to get people to:It\u2019s D, of course.More than 50 years later, researchers set up a lottery among young adults in Lesotho, designed to promote safe sex practices. Every four months the subjects were tested for two sexually transmitted diseases, syphilis and trichonomiasis. A negative test got them entered into a lottery to win either $50 (equivalent to a week\u2019s average salary) or $100. The idea was to see if incentives to reduce the spread of syphilis would also protect against HIV.Back in America, almost every medical clinic has a big no-show problem. All patients suffer, because to compensate for no-shows, clinics book multiple patients for the same slot \u2014 hence the 12-minute doctor\u2019s appointment.OfferCraft worked with one clinic where the no-show rate was 50 percent, said Ezra. The clinic had tried fining people when they didn\u2019t come to their appointments. This increased attendance slightly, but patients hated it, and it was very difficult to collect the fines.So the clinic set up a lottery. When patients checked out and made their follow-up appointment, they were invited to play a Spinning Wheel game. A prize was certain, but they didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d won a $10, $50 or $150 gift card. To find out and receive their prize, they had to keep their appointment.The no-show rate dropped to below 30 percent.Games can provide powerful incentives for just about any behavior. (And perhaps the quizzes in this column kept you reading to the end.) So let\u2019s play one more game: Tweet your best ideas for using a lottery, using #GameMyFix.Could a lottery for graduates reduce school dropout? Would a chance at a big prize get people into the gym? Could it keep ex-offenders from falling back into crime? How about a lottery for carpoolers? People who reduce their home water consumption by 15 percent?We\u2019d love to be able to enter those tweets in a prize lottery, but that\u2019s against Times rules. So we\u2019ll choose the best ideas, publish them, and put them in front of people who might use them.

{"Headline": "Why Wouldn\u2019t Tiffany Trump Speak for Herself?", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byIn this piece, Alessandra Stanley, a Times correspondent who profiled Tiffany Trump for Sunday Styles, describes her attempts to crack a mysterious Trump family dynamic.Journalists have an adage about writing profiles of the rich and famous: The only thing worse than not getting the interview is getting it.This wasn\u2019t an investigative probe into Donald J. Trump\u2019s tax returns or charitable donations. Then again, the Trump family dynamic is almost as mysterious: His children\u2019s obedience, loyalty and nearly impeccable public demeanor impresses even some of his harshest critics. A lot of voters say they figure he can\u2019t be too bad if none of his children has defied or disappointed him. (Quite the opposite: They are so attentive and doting I called them \u201chelicopter offspring.\u201d)Tiffany, 22, seemed to be in the same mold, but nobody knew much about her, and many were curious about whether and how she measured up against the three adult children from his first marriage.I hadn\u2019t expected this kind of resistance from the campaign when I started the reporting this summer. I began the usual way: searching news clips, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn for people who knew her in high school and college, in Los Angeles and New York, and asking Trump family friends all over for their insights. Some said they had nondisclosure agreements; others said they had to get permission from the campaign before talking.I had many fun and interesting conversations with the people the campaign made available \u2014 particularly with Janice Kiker, a close Trump family friend in Georgia who was a hoot in a refined Southern drawl. She is a \u201chuge\u201d admirer of Mr. Trump and wanted me to know so; in fact, the only thing she didn\u2019t want me to tell anyone was that she once shook hands with Hillary Clinton.For reasons I still don\u2019t get, the campaign didn\u2019t relent even after I explained that readers might not understand why Tiffany would pose for a portrait but not talk to the reporter. Michael Kirby Smith, the photographer who shot that portrait in a penthouse at Trump Tower, said Tiffany and her mother, Marla, who acted as Tiffany\u2019s stylist, were both very nice and polite though \u201cnot super outgoing.\u201dI\u2019m sure she could have handled it. Yet the campaign was subliminally suggesting that somehow she couldn\u2019t.So the experience taught me less about Tiffany than it did about the Trump campaign. The candidate may be a loose cannon, but his media handlers are every bit as cautious, defensive and unyielding as the Clinton team.Sometimes, though, staying on message sends a mixed signal.Advertisement"}

A former official in the Church of Latter Day Saints, Mr. Romney won Utah handily in 2012.Even so, much of the Republican establishment was grudgingly resigned to his candidacy.Until Friday.At the headquarters of the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, the initial impulse was to cover the video, which was first published by the Washington Post, as straight breaking news. Editors huddled late into the night, wresting over how to portray Mr. Trump\u2019s tawdry descriptions of unsolicited sexual groping in the three-minute recording, while upholding the outlet\u2019s conservative editorial standards, said Paul Edwards, the editor and publisher of the 166-year-old publication.\u201cWe tried to keep it to the issue,\u201d Mr. Edwards said, but as the night wore on, \u201cit got to where we felt we that we had to take a stand.\u201d\u201cWe did not see this as a political issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really saw it as a moral issue.\u201dThe outrage among Utah conservatives over the recording has allowed Democrats to begin to contemplate what was once unthinkable: taking the state for Mrs. Clinton in November. The hope is that disaffected Republicans will abandon Mr. Trump and split their votes between two third-party candidates: Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Evan McMullin, a former C.I.A. official who is a Mormon.Mrs. Clinton has opened a campaign office in Utah, something that no Democratic candidate has done in decades, said Peter Corroon, the state\u2019s Democratic Party chairman.\u201cTrump will be losing votes,\u201d Mr. Corroon said. \u201cWhere those votes go is yet to be determined.\u201dBy Saturday, few of the state\u2019s political leaders appeared ready to immediately throw their support behind an alternative. Most, like Senator Mike Lee, seemed more focused on getting Mr. Trump to go away.In a video recorded at Mr. Lee\u2019s home and posted on Facebook, the senator addressed the Republican candidate directly: \u201cWith all due respect sir, you sir are the distraction,\u201d he said. \u201cYour conduct, sir, is the distraction, is the distraction from the very principles that will help us win in November.\u201d\u201cI respectfully ask you, with all due respect, to step aside, step down.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Mitt Romney\u2019s affiliation with the Church of Latter Day Saints during his presidential campaign in 2012. He was a former official in the church by that time, he was not a ranking official.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks Bet on the Next Big Thing: Financial Chatbots", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byYour bank really wants to chat.This week Bank of America, MasterCard and several financial start-ups announced new tools \u2014 known as chatbots \u2014 that will allow customers to ask questions about their financial accounts, initiate transactions and get financial advice via text messages or services like Facebook Messenger and Amazon\u2019s Echo tower.The early versions of the financial chatbots generally do little more than answer basic queries about recent transactions and spending limits.But companies are aiming to build the chatbots into full-service automated financial assistants that can make payments and keep track of your budget for you.\u201cWhat will banking be in two, three or four years? It\u2019s going to be this,\u201d Michelle Moore, the head of digital banking at Bank of America, said in describing the bank\u2019s new offering, which it has named Erica.These bots are generally powered by artificial intelligence software that lets them pull in data and turn it into comprehensible answers, in the way that Apple\u2019s Siri attempts to do.Many companies are betting that automated bots \u2014 both in text messaging and voice-activated form \u2014 could become the dominant interface of the future, surpassing phone apps and websites as the way to reach consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the tech industry thinks this is the next big thing,\u201d said Tom Poole, the managing vice president of digital at Capital One.Mr. Poole\u2019s firm rolled out its first voice-activated bot on Amazon\u2019s Echo personal assistant system earlier this year, and it is planning advanced capabilities in the coming months: \u201cIt\u2019s just scratching the surface right now.\u201dA few start-ups have already found success \u2014 and attracted attention from the banks \u2014 by creating chatbots that do particular financial tasks.Digit, a San Francisco-based start-up, offers an iOS and Android mobile app that can monitor a customer\u2019s spending habits and pull small amounts of money from a bank checking account into a Digit savings account several times a month \u2014 with all interactions channeled through text messages. The company has raised $36 million from venture capitalists and saved $230 million for its customers since starting in 2015.Saving is one of the features being built into Bank of America\u2019s offering, Erica. The early version that the bank debuted this week can also track your credit score, look at your spending habits and offer advice on how to pay off bills, along with moving money.A day after Erica was unveiled at the financial technology conference Money 2020, MasterCard revealed its Kai offering, which it will make available to the banks that issue its cards. Neither Erica nor Kai is available to customers yet, and the companies did not provide firm release dates.Among the Silicon Valley start-ups working in the same realm, there is a common argument that the new digital financial assistants should come from outside the financial firms, so that they can link to any account a customer may have and bestow unbiased advice.Bank of America, for instance, would have little incentive to suggest that its customers sign up for a credit card with another bank, even if it is offering a lower rate.Several venture capital firms have provided backing to a start-up, Clarity Money, which was released last week and offers a range of services similar to Erica\u2019s.\u201cConsumers should have an unbiased advocate helping them navigate their financial lives,\u201d said Adam Dell, the founder of Clarity and the brother of Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell.Critics of chatbots have said that even with artificial intelligence, bots will continue to lack the intuitive and empathetic understanding that humans need when dealing with difficult problems, such as financial decisions.\u201cWe all know the technology is not there yet,\u201d said Josh Reich, the co-founder of Simple, an online bank that has not released any bot features. \u201cIt\u2019s just people picking up on a hype cycle.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Could Be Associated With a Longer Life, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byBut according to a new paper, time spent on social media could be associated with a longer life.The paper, published in the journal PNAS on Monday, asserts that the health effects of active online social lives largely mirror the benefits of busy offline social lives.\u201cWe find that people with more friends online are less likely to die than their disconnected counterparts,\u201d the paper says. \u201cThis evidence contradicts assertions that social media have had a net-negative impact on health.\u201dThe study\u2019s methods are detailed at length in the paper, and it was approved by three university and state review boards. But skeptics will note that Facebook itself was closely involved with the paper. William Hobbs, 29, a postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University, worked at Facebook as a research intern in 2013. Another of the paper's authors, Moira Burke, worked on it in her capacity as a research scientist at Facebook.Mr. Hobbs, who conducted the research while he was a doctoral student at the University of California, San Diego, said Facebook had not interfered with the results of the paper.\u201cWe had some things in writing that they couldn\u2019t interfere with the publication of the research no matter what the result was,\u201d he said. He noted, though, that some at the company had been \u201cpretty confident that we were going to find this result.\u201dA news release sent by a spokeswoman at the University of California, San Diego, drives the point home. \u201cThe research confirms what scientists have known for a long time about the offline world: People who have stronger social networks live longer,\u201d the release said.The study was based on 12 million social media profiles made available to the researchers by Facebook, as well as records from the California Department of Health.It found that \u201cmoderate use\u201d of Facebook was associated with the lowest mortality rate, and that receiving friend requests correlated with reduced mortality, but that sending friend requests did not.Mr. Hobbs and the paper\u2019s other authors matched records from California\u2019s Department of Public Health with those of California Facebook users, preserving privacy by aggregating the data before analyzing it, the release said. All of the subjects of the study were born from 1945 to 1989.The paper found that people with large or even average social networks lived longer than people who had very small social networks. It was \u201ca finding consistent with classic studies of offline relationships and longevity,\u201d the release said.The paper itself acknowledges the study\u2019s \u201cmany limitations,\u201d saying that Facebook is unique among social media websites and that its data might not be more broadly applicable. It also points out that its findings represent a correlative relationship as opposed to a causal one: There is no evidence in the paper that using Facebook has any direct effect on a person\u2019s health.James Fowler, a professor of public health and political science at the University of California, San Diego, and another of the paper\u2019s authors, said he had been surprised that requesting the friendship of others was not found to be associated with a longer life span.\u201cI had hoped we would find that reaching out to others was associated with better health,\u201d he said.The new result, Mr. Fowler explained, suggested that researchers who had previously found that people with more friends were healthier might have misunderstood the relationship between sociability and health. It may be, he said, that \u201cthe reason why people with more friends are healthier is because healthier people have more friends,\u201d which would suggest that \u201cit may be harder than we thought it was to use social networks to make people healthier.\u201dNathan Jurgenson, a sociologist and a researcher for Snapchat, said in an email that the paper provided much evidence against the idea that connections made online exist separately from the \u201creal world,\u201d as if the internet did not exist within the broader universe.But he pointed out that the study itself, even in providing evidence to support the idea that the internet is not different from \u201creal life,\u201d used language that reinforced the binary view.\u201cAll of the conceptual and linguistic back flips being done here in trying to explain that the virtual world interacts with the real world could be circumvented by instead taking for granted that digital connection is new and different but that it\u2019s also part of this one social reality,\u201d Mr.Jurgenson wrote.\u201cOn the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection,\u201d that paper said. \u201cRather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.\u201dMr. Fowler said that he had been hounding Facebook to help participate in a health study like the one detailed in the paper since 2010, and that he had hoped its findings would directly inform the evolution of the platform, which he had envisioned as potential boon to public health.He said his focus when he conceived of the study had been simple: \u201cHow can you design this platform to not only make people happier but to make them healthier?\u201dMr. Hobbs said he welcomed the scrutiny of those who would note the paper\u2019s close associations with Facebook, saying that the paper constituted a first step.\u201cAt this point, we\u2019re not making any recommendations on how people should use social media,\u201d Mr. Hobbs said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a long track record of finding these relationships again and again before we start giving recommendations.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Wall Is a Fantasy\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "OpinionA week in the borderlands with migrants and guards.Supported byNOGALES, Mexico \u2014 A few hundred feet from the American border, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Talavera contemplated his challenge with the focus, if not quite the physique, of an Olympic high jumper. A stocky coffee farmer from Honduras, he was fresh off La Bestia, or the Beast \u2014 the freight train network used by migrants to cross Mexico. Now he was preparing to vault into the United States, for the third time.His options, both of which involved days of trekking through searing deserts, were unappealing: pay thousands of dollars to a guide, or carry a rucksack filled with drugs for a cartel.Now the border loomed again, bristling with guards and cameras. This time, if caught, he faced six months in detention. He didn\u2019t care. \u201cI\u2019ll go back and try again,\u201d he said. Nothing could stop him, he said. Not even a new wall.Across the globe, walls are going up. In Europe, columns of refugees snaking over borders have sent leaders scrambling for solutions in concrete and razor wire. Hungary has erected a 108-mile-long fence to keep out Syrians; at the French port of Calais, Britain is funding a barrier to prevent Afghans and Africans slipping into the channel tunnel. Public sympathy for immigrants, once kindled by images of drowned infants washing up on European shores, has been curdled by terrorist attacks in Brussels, Paris and Nice. The defensive mood has spread to Africa, where Kenya plans to build a 440-mile-long wall along its frontier with Somalia to keep out the Shabab militia.America, the land of migrants, never seemed to need walls. It had water \u2014 vast oceans, east and west \u2014 and, since 2001, a formidable visa program. And yet this year, the dream of a grand protective barrier across the 2,000-mile frontier with Mexico catapulted Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential bid into stunning viability. \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d chanted candidate and crowd in unison at rallies this year.And yet, the closer you get to the border, the fewer people think that it might work \u2014 even among Trump supporters and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe wall is a fantasy,\u201d said Tony Estrada, the sheriff of Santa Cruz County, Ariz., a border district that is one of the busiest corridors of drugs and people smuggling in America. \u201cI don\u2019t care how big, how high or how long it is \u2014 it\u2019s not going to solve the problem.\u201dHe sighed. \u201cBut people are eating it up,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201dMr. Estrada, who is 73, knows better than most that borders are more than lines on a map. Born in Mexico, he arrived in America at the age of 1. Until the 1970s, he said, the border had an organic quality. During the Cinco de Mayo fiesta, dancers paraded from Mexico into America then back again; beauty queens from both countries sat together on a platform that straddled the border; white tourists crossed into Mexico for the bullfights, the night life and the \u201crum runs\u201d \u2014 cheap alcohol.Then the drug wars exploded, and in 1995, a fence started to rise. Crime fell sharply, but the drop exacted a cost. Tourism withered, the curio shops closed and there was a painful tear in the cross-border culture. \u201cThe dynamic changed,\u201d he said.The sheriff\u2019s nostalgia pointed to a wider truth: Walls are not just about whom a country wants to keep out; they are a mark of what it is trying to preserve, its idea of itself. With the rise of Mr. Trump, America\u2019s sense of itself is suddenly less sure. And so I spent a week in the southern borderlands, flitting between Mexico and America, trying to figure out what, in this febrile election season, that idea might be.The fence itself is a formidable sight, spanning about one-third of the 2,000-mile frontier from California to Texas, and patrolled by about 20,000 agents. One of the most tightly guarded stretches is around the city of Nogales, which straddles the border. Here, the first world abuts the third. American Nogales, orderly and somniferous, pushes up against Mexican Nogales, an unruly metropolis of 300,000 souls where the Sinaloa cartel looms large.John Lawson, a border patrol officer born in Pennsylvania, took us on a tour of the fence, a slatted metal barrier, 18 to 30 feet high, that undulates along the hills on either side of Nogales. It was built at a cost of $4 million per mile, which includes an array of military-style fortifications. We passed pole-mounted cameras, radars, vibration sensors and, in the dip of valley, a line of World War II-style Normandy barriers meant to stop any Mexican vehicle from crashing through America\u2019s front gate. The border patrol reaches into the air, too, with a fleet of drones, balloons and Blackhawk helicopters.And yet, the \u201cmigrantes\u201d and the \u201ctraficantes\u201d still slip through.Officer Lawson pulled up on a small bluff overlooking the border and pulled out his binoculars. Half a mile away, inside Mexico, three young men trudged along a ridge, then vanished behind a splash of foliage. Farther along we saw other groups: spotters, employed by the cartel, Officer Lawson said. They use their cellphones to direct traffic, telling migrants and drug smugglers when to make a run for it. Looking left and right, on the American side, I counted six patrol jeeps, parked on hillocks.Both sides sat still, watching the other, waiting for one to make a move. \u201cThe purpose of the fence is to buy time,\u201d said Officer Lawson. \u201cIt allows us to respond. But it can\u2019t stop them completely. Nothing can.\u201dBefore setting off, many migrants pass through the comedor, a tin-roof shelter within sight of the border in Nogales, Mexico. The staff of the charity offers food, legal advice, massages and small compasses to help those who might get lost in the desert. Hope mingles with heartbreak along the cramped benches where breakfast is served. Men like Mr. Talavera, plotting a way to the United States, break bread with families that have just been deported, their faces etched with dejection. Under President Obama, the United States has deported 2.5 million people \u2014 more than any other administration.The comedor is named after Eusebio Kino, an Italian Jesuit who roamed these lands in the early 18th century, and its staff members are driven by their own sense of mission. The morning we visited, a Catholic nun delivered a cautionary lecture about Jos\u00e9 Antonio Elena Rodr\u00edguez, a 16-year-old Mexican shot dead through the fence by an American patrol agent in 2010 (the agent was charged with murder this year). A priest offered a blessing and the men filed out.Walking in twos and threes for safety, they melted into the streets, biding their time to make a break for the border.In Arizona, the sweeping landscape is dotted with relics of the Old West. In the town of Tombstone, tourists pay to see a comical re-enactment of the shootout at O.K. Corral. Farther out, in Skeleton Canyon, a roadside monument marks the surrender of the great Apache warrior Geronimo in 1886 \u2014 a reminder of the Native Americans who once held sway here.To modern-day cowboys and ranchers, Mexican migrants are the new foe. Ranching families thronged to the Cochise County Fair, outside the border town of Douglas, for an archetypal show of rural Americana. Children screamed with delight at the turkey race as their parents went to the rodeo; neon-lit stalls sold corn dogs, Confederate flags and gun paraphernalia.Tony Fraze, a rancher and Trump supporter, paused to chat. Migrants were the scourge of the area, he said. They damaged fences, vandalized water systems and left trash that killed livestock. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave your door open or your keys in your truck,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do, they might take them and kill you, too.\u201d He mentioned Rob Krentz, a local rancher shot in 2010 in a traumatic case that briefly made the national news.Although he was right on the specifics, the border counties generally enjoy some of the lowest crime rates in Arizona. As Sheriff Estrada told me, smugglers don\u2019t like to court trouble. \u201cThey\u2019re businessmen, and confrontation is bad for business,\u201d he said.But to Mr. Fraze, it was about more than just the border: Weakness on immigration mirrored a broader decline of American strength. \u201cWe\u2019ve had too much wishy-washy \u2014 people trying to control it, not end it,\u201d he said of migration policy. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should have done years ago with the World Trade Center \u2014 flown over there, put it back to nature and have it done. Playin\u2019 around just don\u2019t get it done.\u201dNot everyone sees tough talk as the answer. During my border visit, I met many artists, activists and even ranchers who sought to reach across the border, not close it. Dennis Moroney, a white-bearded cowboy with a Mexican-born wife, said he understood the rage of fellow ranchers; his cattle had also died from eating plastic bags. But the Trump phenomenon, he felt, fed off darker impulses: \u201cracism and xenophobia and fear of those dark people who don\u2019t talk like us.\u201dDark clouds scudded the sky as we drove 30 miles east to see Ed Ashurst, a cowboy of craggy temperament. He is the author of three books on ranching and one on the migrant problem, titled \u201cAlligators in the Moat.\u201d \u201cImmigration is a multikazillion dollar industry,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey have scouts on every mountain and an intelligence operation better than the C.I.A.\u201dThe night before, he found a migrant snoozing in his saddle house, and promptly turned him over to the border patrol. He hates President Obama (\u201cnot a patriot\u201d) and likes Mr. Trump, but dismissed talk of a border wall as a \u201cfarce.\u201d His solution was to deploy Navy SEALs along the border, arm them with AR-15 rifles, and give them orders to shoot anyone who crossed.Later, on a walk through a field, Mr. Ashurst pointed to the detritus left by migrants \u2014 food tins in Spanish, plastic bags. I asked if he felt any compassion for the migrants\u2019 plight. His voice rose sharply. \u201cI\u2019ve helped more Mexicans than these activist types,\u201d he said. \u201cBut just because I\u2019m a Republican, and I want a closed border, I\u2019m a sorry son of a bitch.\u201dToday\u2019s illegal immigrant, however, could be tomorrow\u2019s American. In Nogales, there\u2019s a short stretch of border where the fence turns into a metal grille. At sundown one evening we watched as two women faced each other across the border, touched fingers through the grille, and wept.Gaby Jiminez, a house cleaner in Phoenix, had never dared approach the border since she slipped into the United States in 1993. Now that her papers were being legalized, she had plucked up the courage to see her sister, Trinidad, for the first time in 18 years. The two women laughed, gossiped and cried for half an hour; before leaving, Gaby pushed a $100 bill through a hole in the fence.She yearned to embrace her sister, but soon she would have her own passport, and visit her in Mexico.Beyond any single border, immigration has become an issue across the world because of a painful reckoning with globalization, said Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee Studies Center at Oxford University. \u201cTen years ago, crime, education and health were the defining policy issues,\u201d he told me. \u201cNow it\u2019s about people\u2019s sense of control over their societies and their communities.\u201dA sense of mutinous resentment among those left behind by globalization helped drive the British Brexit vote to leave the European Union in June. In such sour times, said Professor Betts, immigrants provide a handy scapegoat, and walls make for easy solutions.\u201cLiberal politics is struggling to find an answer, but the far right has an answer that resonates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a reassertion of nativism, nationalism and identity politics, and telling people that the solution to globalization is to close borders.\u201dWhile walls may divert the human flood, they cannot stop it. The proportion of the world\u2019s population who are migrants has actually been stable since 1970, said Professor Betts. The impulse to flee \u2014 for reasons of war, poverty or to simply make a better life \u2014 may be too hard to stop.Before he vanished from Nogales to make a risky border crossing, I asked Jos\u00e9 Manuel Talavera if the prize was worth the peril: thirst, violence, scorpions, actual coyotes. In response he mentioned his five children, including his 3-month-old daughter, Luna Soad. He was doing it for her.Declan Walsh is a foreign correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

Democratic strategists have worried that younger voters, turned off by the bitter tenor of the race and more challenging than older voters to turn out even in the best of times, may not bother to vote for her.\u201cShe\u2019s fought on behalf of people who really need somebody to fight for them \u2014 that should be inspiring enough,\u201d Mr. Obama told Peter Hamby, the host of Snapchat\u2019s political show, \u201cGood Luck America.\u201d (The show is accessible through the Snapchat Discover section, which will make the episode featuring Mr. Obama available for 48 hours, beginning at 6 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday.)The five-minute episode intersperses behind-the-scenes glimpses of Mr. Obama on the campaign trail narrated by Mr. Hamby \u2014 a ride in a motorcade to a campaign rally, the president backstage greeting a woman who had introduced him and autographing her opening remarks \u2014 with Mr. Obama\u2019s testimonials about Mrs. Clinton.\u201cHillary may be in a position to negotiate with certain members of the Republican Congress, as she has done in the past, on some basic things like rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our airports that in the past weren\u2019t really Republican or Democrat,\u201d Mr. Obama said when asked what Mrs. Clinton could do better than he had.At one point, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s disembodied head appears against an outer space backdrop, shooting missiles, video game-style, at the head of Donald J. Trump above the caption \u201cBarack Obama DEFENDER.\u201dSnapchat, whose political show had its debut in January, says that it has more than 60 million daily active users in the United States and Canada and that, on any given day, it reaches 41 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds. That makes it a useful outlet for reaching a demographic that is much harder to connect with through traditional media outlets like newspapers and television.Mr. Obama\u2019s first tutorial on Snapchat came from his 15-year-old daughter, Sasha, who surreptitiously recorded him expounding to the whole family at the dinner table on the platform\u2019s significance in modern society. She later sent the exchange to friends via Snapchat, Mr. Obama told Jimmy Kimmel during an interview last week. She captioned it, \u201cThis is my dad lecturing us on the meaning of social media,\u201d followed by a picture of her bored face.The segment to be released on Tuesday ends with Mr. Hamby, who declares that the president \u201cgets it\u201d when it comes to social media, showing Mr. Obama how to do his own messaging on Snapchat.\u201cPeople, this is Barack Obama,\u201d the president says, his head filling the screen, selfie-style. \u201cIf I can figure out how to Snapchat, you can figure out how to go vote.\u201dAn earlier version of this article cited incorrect information provided by Snap Inc. on the number of daily active users the service has in the United States. There are 60 million such users in the United States and Canada, not in the United States alone, according to corrected data from the company.Advertisement"}

That led him to Farms to Grow, an organization of black farmers that piqued his interest when one of its founders, Gail Myers, took him on a tour of Mr. McGill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s farm.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs she was giving us a tour, I started photographing him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Santiago said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust hearing his story I knew he was the one to do the project on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis story is important to me because people in America aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aware that black farmers are still around,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Santiago said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what their struggles are and that they are still being discriminated against. For the most part, whether they are black or white, the farmers get pushed down and end up having to sell their properties because they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get loans. Small farms are denied because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually have any collateral to get a loan. Through my research I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for stolen black land, all you have to do is follow the lynching trail. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it started to happen. Black farmers were killed for their land.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe McGill family has been farming for 90 years. After returning from Vietnam, Mr. McGill and a partner owned and managed a 320-acre farm, McGill Farms, from 1976 to 1987. They lost the property through foreclosure after being denied loans, Mr. Santiago said, and although Mr. McGill tried to enlist lawyers to regain the land or be compensated, he has been unsuccessful.Now he farms on his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s property in Bakersfield, Calif., a rural city 100 miles outside of Los Angeles. He started with 90 acres that have been whittled down to five because of foreclosure. Just last year, Mr. Santiago said, Mr. McGill had to borrow $14,000 from relatives to prevent losing what little land he had left. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a recording of Mr. McGill telling the story about how he lost his land, and every time I hear it \u2014 the pain in his voice \u2014 it always gets to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Santiago said. The history of black farming in this country has been long and, at times, painful, starting with sharecropping, which began to dominate agriculture in the South after the Civil War. Black families rented small parcels, or shares, to work themselves, and in return they would give a portion of their crop to the landowner. Some saved enough money to buy the land outright, but many more went into debt or were forced by poverty or the threat of violence to sign unfair contracts that offered little chance of improving their economic situation. Still, by 1920 African-American farmers made up approximately 14 percent of all farmers in the United States, and they owned a combined 15 million acres of land, according to United States Department of Agriculture reports. African-Americans now account for less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s farmers. For farmers like Mr. McGill, the struggle continues. Every day he rises early to feed his pigs while keeping track of items he could reuse to maintain his farm. Tires and plywood, for example, can be turned into fencing.As he makes a humble living, foreclosure is a constant threat for farmers like Mr. McGill. Even though he received compensation from a lawsuit against the Department of Agriculture that alleged racial discrimination in lending, the amount he and other farmers received was not enough considering what had been lost over the years, he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are a few white farmers who have helped me, a few white friends loaned me tractors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. McGill said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRacism isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really much different than it used to be. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the same. The K.K.K. used to burn the farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 land and houses, but now they do it with paperwork.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Still, Mr. McGill finds a certain dignity in his quest to continue farming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d find someone to help me invest and get back into farming; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little late in life, but I still want to do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop. You have to keep going. It looks real bad sometimes for black folks. Sometimes it looks like we just give up on life, but the door is not closed yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}

He is Kenneth Bone, an undecided voter in a bright red sweater.Whether that affection will last once he makes up his mind remains to be seen. In an interview with The New York Times, he revealed how he is now leaning.Mr. Bone, 34, an operator at a coal plant in Illinois, was one of the undecided voters selected to ask a question at the town hall debate broadcast live on Sunday night.He offered a contrast to the presidential candidates\u2019 combative tone when he asked a straightforward policy query near the end of the 90-minute live broadcast.\u201cWhat steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job layoffs?\u201d he asked.Judging by comments on social media, many of those who tuned in found Mr. Bone to be the most diverting thing about the debate. They were delighted with his sweater and images of him snapping pictures on a disposable camera shortly after the event.In a phone interview on Monday morning, Mr. Bone said that he had been leaning toward voting for Donald J. Trump, but that Hillary Clinton \u201creally impressed me with her composure and some of her answers last night.\u201dHe said he was \u201ca bit let down\u201d by the personal attacks that dominated the early part of the debate.Asked about which attacks he had in mind, Mr. Bone said, \u201cThere were a lot from both sides, but I feel like Mr. Trump did a lot more of the talking over and the personal attacks.\u201d\u201cI would have liked to see less of that and more on the issues,\u201d he added.Mr. Bone said that he would decide once and for all after the final debate, on Oct. 19.He also provided some insight into how undecided voters are found for such events, saying that he has been a participant in the Gallup poll for the last several years, and that he received a call about a week ago asking whether he was firmly committed to a presidential candidate.When he said he was not, he was told that he could be considered to participate. Mr. Bone said several dozen undecided voters from the St. Louis area were eventually chosen.\u201cI was excited to be a part of the political process and show people that their voices are being heard,\u201d he said.He was not nervous beforehand, even though he experienced a wardrobe malfunction earlier in the day. In an interview with CNN, Mr. Bone explained that his red sweater, the object of plenty of affection on social media, had not been his first option. He had planned to wear an olive suit.\u201cApparently I\u2019ve gained about 30 pounds,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cand when I went to get in my car the morning of the debate, I split the seat of my pants all the way open. So the red sweater is Plan B, and I\u2019m glad it worked out.\u201dIn his everyday life, Mr. Bone regularly works 12-hour shifts sitting in the control room of a coal-fired power plant. He said that while energy from coal was \u201cnear and dear to our hearts,\u201d he and his co-workers \u201crecognize the need to be environmentally responsible.\u201dWith his question, he had been hoping to \u201cspark a debate about subsidies for environmental controls for older coal\u2013fired power plants.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just glad I was able to spark the energy debate a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of getting overlooked.\u201dHe said that his fellow undecided voters were \u201call very well-educated, well-thought-out people who just haven\u2019t quite made their decision yet.\u201d\u201cI try to focus less on the negatives and more on the positives,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd there haven\u2019t been enough positives on either side for me to make a firm commitment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Max Landis Is a Hollywood Disrupter With an Attitude", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. \u2014 Last year, when the prolific screenwriter Max Landis was spending long days in script development on \u201cDirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency,\u201d the BBC America TV series he created, he decided to blow off a little steam \u2014 by writing another screenplay.In just seven hours, Mr. Landis bashed out a spec script (as unsolicited, over-the-transom screenplays are known) for a psychological horror-thriller called \u201cDeeper,\u201d about a disgraced astronaut. Almost as quickly, a bidding war broke out, and in April, \u201cDeeper\u201d sold to MGM for $2 million \u2014 a breathtaking sum in an era when most speculative screenplays sell in the low six figures.To hear Mr. Landis tell it, however, the payday pales in importance to a more existential imperative. \u201cI write scripts the way a lot of people play \u2018Angry Birds,\u2019\u201d he said, sipping a mojito poolside here at the Chateau Marmont. \u201cIn my head, I see a movie. If I don\u2019t write the script, there\u2019s no chance that movie will exist. If it doesn\u2019t exist, I feel like I\u2019m failing. I feel like this pit inside of me is rapidly growing and expanding. And I\u2019ll disappear and be nothing. So clearly I have to write something. Otherwise I\u2019ll die.\u201dSpend 90 minutes with this polarizing son of the director John Landis (\u201cAnimal House,\u201d Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d video), and you\u2019ll come to understand that a mixture of sensitivity and hyperbole is his default setting as well as a strangely beguiling asset.\u201cMax has a unique ability to open up his heart and spill it on the page,\u201d the screenwriter Drew Goddard, a friend and consigliere to Mr. Landis, said in an email. \u201cAnd Max has a tremendous amount of pathos hidden under all that rainbow hair.\u201dMr. Landis claims to have written an astonishing 98 screenplays (nearly all still unproduced) with 20 or 30 more in the \u201cthings I might finish soon\u201d category and some 200 others in various stages of completion. \u201cWithout exaggeration or braggadocio, I write more and faster than any writer I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Mr. Landis said.All the while, Mr. Landis has maintained a vibrant social media presence across Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube (111,000 subscribers) and Twitter (81,000 followers). Posting numerous times daily, he shares homemade parody videos and offers pop cultural ruminations (\u201cMacklemore Is the White Eminem\u201d). But more often, he roils his constituency with Kanye West-like pronouncements like his dismissal of the latest best picture Oscar front-runner, \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d as \u201ccinematic overkill\u201d or his description of Rey in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d as a \u201cMary Sue\u201d (genre slang for an idealized female character who triumphs only through authorial wish fulfillment).\u201cI got this fire lit in me a couple of years ago to make understanding the job of a screenwriter as visible as possible,\u201d Mr. Landis said. \u201cNot because I think screenwriters are underappreciated \u2014 even though they are. But because the way people think about this job is fundamentally wrong.\u201dTo his haters, however, Mr. Landis is a relentless self-promoter (\u201ca self-styled brat screenwriter,\u201d according The A.V. Club) offering whiny justifications for the critical drubbing and lackluster box-office returns of \u201cVictor Frankenstein\u201d and \u201cAmerican Ultra.\u201d More pointedly, some attribute his career to nepotism. He shared his first writing credit with his father, on a 2005 episode of the Showtime series \u201cMasters of Horror.\u201d\u201cI would never deny that being John Landis\u2019s son had some role in my start,\u201d Mr. Landis said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve worked in this industry, you know how many checks and balances there are. I\u2019ve had so many meetings with people who don\u2019t like John Landis \u2014 which is an even more awkward experience.\u201dWhile acknowledging Max Landis\u2019s ability to ruffle feathers, his friend and Hollywood peer Shane Black \u2014 a former wunderkind screenwriter himself (the \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d franchise) who sold several megabuck spec scripts in the \u201990s \u2014 said Mr. Landis was not driven by the pursuit of money, fame or even sympathy.\u201cIf I had an image of Max in my head,\u201d Mr. Black said, \u201cit\u2019s a guy with a stick constantly poking a hornet\u2019s nest \u2014 and just delighting to see what comes out of it. He delights in being a weirdo. He delights in curiosity and defying expectations. And he\u2019s a social success by not caring if he looks like a social misfit.\u201dAt a time when studios are reluctant to green-light movies that aren\u2019t franchises, Mr. Landis has also become something of a disrupter. Since the critical and commercial misfire of \u201cVictor Frankenstein\u201d (he said his script was significantly changed on its way to the screen), Mr. Landis has refused to sell his screenplays to the major movie distributors unless they come \u201ccompletely packaged\u201d with deals for actors, directors and budgets, effectively preventing studio executives from \u201cdisfiguring\u201d his writing.Mr. Landis had a busy afternoon ahead. He would go on to give production notes on \u201cChannel Zero,\u201d oversee dialogue replacement on \u201cDirk Gently\u201d and help make a casting decision for \u201cBright.\u201d\u201cIf people hate some of my movies, so be it,\u201d he said as he was leaving. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make things that are in and of themselves different from what you usually get. Does that come from me having a chip on my shoulder? Probably. But it also comes from frustration with the system that is feeding us sequels no one wants to see and tentpoles no one wants.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the screenwriter Max Landis misstated the Oscar status of the film \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d It was nominated for best picture of 2015, but did not win.

{"Headline": "Rise of Saudi Prince Shatters Decades of Royal Tradition", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byHe has slashed the state budget, frozen government contracts and reduced the pay of civil employees, all part of drastic austerity measures as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is buffeted by low oil prices.But last year, Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince, saw a yacht he couldn\u2019t resist.While vacationing in the south of France, Prince bin Salman spotted a 440-foot yacht floating off the coast. He dispatched an aide to buy the ship, the Serene, which was owned by Yuri Shefler, a Russian vodka tycoon. The deal was done within hours, at a price of approximately 500 million euros (roughly $550 million today), according to an associate of Mr. Shefler and a Saudi close to the royal family. The Russian moved off the yacht the same day.It is the paradox of the brash, 31-year-old Prince bin Salman: a man who is trying to overturn tradition, reinvent the economy and consolidate power \u2014 while holding tight to his royal privilege. In less than two years, he has emerged as the most dynamic royal in the Arab world\u2019s wealthiest nation, setting up a potential rivalry for the throne.His seemingly boundless ambitions have led many Saudis and foreign officials to suspect that his ultimate goal is not just to transform the kingdom, but also to shove aside the current crown prince, his 57-year-old cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, to become the next king. Such a move could further upset his relatives and \u2014 if successful \u2014 give the country what it has never seen: a young king who could rule the kingdom for many decades.Crown Prince bin Nayef, the interior minister and longtime counterterrorism czar, has deep ties to Washington and the support of many of the older royals. Deciphering the dynamics of the family can be like trying to navigate a hall of mirrors, but many Saudi and American officials say Prince bin Salman has made moves aimed at reaching into Prince bin Nayef\u2019s portfolios and weakening him.This has left officials in Washington hedging their bets by building relationships with both men, unsure who will end up on top. The White House got an early sign of the ascent of the young prince in late 2015, when \u2014 breaking protocol \u2014 Prince bin Salman delivered a soliloquy about the failures of American foreign policy during a meeting between his father, King Salman, and President Obama.Many young Saudis admire him as an energetic representative of their generation who has addressed some of the country\u2019s problems with uncommon bluntness. The kingdom\u2019s news media have built his image as a hardworking, businesslike leader less concerned than his predecessors with the trappings of royalty.Others see him as a power-hungry upstart who is risking instability by changing too much, too fast.Months of interviews with Saudi and American officials, members of the royal family and their associates, and diplomats focused on Saudi affairs reveal a portrait of a prince in a hurry to prove that he can transform Saudi Arabia. Prince bin Salman declined multiple interview requests for this article.But the question many raise \u2014 and cannot yet answer \u2014 is whether the energetic leader will succeed in charting a new path for the kingdom, or whether his impulsiveness and inexperience will destabilize the Arab world\u2019s largest economy at a time of turbulence in the Middle East.Early this year, Crown Prince bin Nayef left the kingdom for his family\u2019s villa in Algeria, a sprawling compound an hour\u2019s drive north of Algiers. Although he has long taken annual hunting vacations there, many who know him said that this year was different. He stayed away for weeks, largely incommunicado and often refusing to respond to messages from Saudi officials and close associates in Washington. Even John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director, whom he has known for decades, had difficulty reaching him.But his lengthy absence at a time of low oil prices, turmoil in the Middle East and a foundering Saudi-led war in Yemen led several American officials to conclude that the crown prince was fleeing frictions with his younger cousin and that the prince was worried his chance to ascend the throne was in jeopardy.The exact personal relationship between the two men is unclear, fueling discussion in Saudi Arabia and in foreign capitals about who is ascendant. Obscuring the picture are the stark differences in the men\u2019s public profiles. Prince bin Nayef has largely stayed in the shadows, although he did visit New York last month to address the United Nations General Assembly before heading to Turkey for a state visit.\u201cThere is no topic that is more important than succession matters, especially now,\u201d said Joseph A. Kechichian, a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, who has extensive contacts in the Saudi royal family. \u201cThis matters for monarchy, for the regional allies and for the kingdom\u2019s international partners.\u201dThe prosecution of the war by a prince with no military experience has exacerbated tensions between him and his older cousins, according to American officials and members of the royal family. Three of Saudi Arabia\u2019s main security services are run by princes. Although all agreed that the kingdom had to respond when the Houthis seized the Yemeni capital and forced the government into exile, Prince bin Salman took the lead, launching the war in March 2015 without full coordination across the security services.The head of the National Guard, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, had not been informed and was out of the country when the first strikes were carried out, according to a senior National Guard officer.The National Guard is now holding much of the Yemeni border.American officials, too, were put off when, just as the Yemen campaign was escalating, Prince bin Salman took a vacation in the Maldives, the island archipelago off the coast of India. Several American officials said Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter had trouble reaching him for days during one part of the trip.The prolonged war has also heightened tensions between Prince bin Salman and Prince bin Nayef, who won the respect of Saudis and American officials for dismantling Al Qaeda in the kingdom nearly a decade ago and now sees it taking advantage of chaos in Yemen, according to several American officials and analysts.\u201cIf Mohammed bin Nayef wanted to be seen as a big supporter of this war, he\u2019s had a year and a half to do it,\u201d said Bruce Riedel, a former Middle East analyst at the C.I.A. and a fellow at the Brookings Institution.Near the start of the war, Prince bin Salman was a forceful public advocate for the campaign and was often photographed visiting troops and meeting with military leaders. But as the campaign has stalemated, such appearances have grown rare.This is part of what analysts say is Prince bin Salman\u2019s attempt to foster a sense of Saudi national identity that has not existed since the kingdom\u2019s founding in 1932.\u201cThere has been a surge of Saudi nationalism since the campaign in Yemen began, with the sense that Saudi Arabia is taking independent collective action,\u201d said Andrew Bowen, a Saudi expert at the Wilson Center in Washington.Still, Mr. Bowen said support among younger Saudis could diminish the longer the conflict dragged on. Diplomats say the death toll for Saudi troops is higher than the government has publicly acknowledged, and a recent deadly airstrike on a funeral in the Yemeni capital has renewed calls by human rights groups and some American lawmakers to block or delay weapons sales to the kingdom.People who have met Prince bin Salman said he insisted that Saudi Arabia must be more assertive in shaping events in the Middle East and confronting Iran\u2019s influence in the region \u2014 whether in Yemen, Syria, Iraq or Lebanon.Brian Katulis, a Middle East expert at the Center for American Progress in Washington, who met the prince this year in Riyadh, said his agenda was clear.\u201cHis main message is that Saudi Arabia is a force to be reckoned with,\u201d Mr. Katulis said.Saudi Arabia is one of the world\u2019s few remaining absolute monarchies, which means that Prince bin Salman was given all of his powers by a vote of one: his own father.More important, the king decreed a new order of succession, overturning the wishes of King Abdullah and replacing his designated crown prince, Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, with Prince bin Nayef.While all previous Saudi kings and crown princes had been sons of the kingdom\u2019s founder, Prince bin Nayef was the first of the founder\u2019s grandsons to be put in line. Many hailed the move because of the prince\u2019s success at fighting Al Qaeda and because he has only daughters, leading many to hope he would choose a successor based on merit rather than paternity.The bigger surprise was that the king named Prince bin Salman deputy crown prince. He was 29 years old at the time and virtually unknown to the kingdom\u2019s closest allies.This effectively scrapped the political aspirations of his older relatives, many of whom had decades of experience in public life and in key sectors like defense and oil policy. Some are still angry \u2014 although only in private, out of deference to the 80-year-old king.Since then, Prince bin Salman has moved quickly to build his public profile and market himself to other nations as the point man for the kingdom.Read in one way, the documents are an ambitious blueprint to change the Saudi way of life. Read in another, they are a scathing indictment of how poorly the kingdom has been run by Prince bin Salman\u2019s elders.Official government development plans going back decades have called for reducing the dependence on oil and increasing Saudi employment \u2014 to little effect. And in calling for transparency and accountability, the plan acknowledges that both have been in short supply. Diplomats and economists say much about the Saudi economy remains opaque, including the cost of generous perks and stipends for members of the royal family.Many Saudis say his age and ambition are benefits at a time when old ways of thinking must be changed.\u201cHe is speaking in the language of the youth,\u201d said Hoda al-Helaissi, a member of the kingdom\u2019s advisory Shura Council, which is appointed by the king. \u201cThe country for too long has been looking through the lenses of the older generation, and we need to look at who is going to carry the torch to the next generation.\u201dOthers have been popular. After Prince bin Salman called for more entertainment options for families and young people, who often flee the country on their vacations, the cabinet passed regulations restricting the powers of the religious police. An Entertainment Authority he established has planned its first activities, which include comedy shows, pro wrestling events and monster truck rallies.Instead, he has sought the favor of younger clerics who boast millions of followers on social media. After the release of Vision 2030, Prince bin Salman held a reception for Saudi journalists and academics that included a number of younger, tech-savvy clerics who have gone forth to praise the plan.Prince bin Salman\u2019s prominence today was difficult to predict during his early years, spent largely below the radar of Western officials who keep track of young Saudi royals who might one day rule the kingdom.Several of King Salman\u2019s other sons, who studied overseas to perfect foreign languages and earn advanced degrees, built impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. One became the first Arab astronaut, another a deputy oil minister, yet another the governor of Medina Province.Prince bin Salman stayed in Saudi Arabia and does not speak fluent English, although he appears to understand it. After a private school education, he studied law at King Saud University in Riyadh, reportedly graduating fourth in his class. Another prince of the same generation said he had gotten to know him during high school, when one of their uncles hosted regular dinners for the younger princes at his palace. He recalled Prince bin Salman being one of the crowd, saying he liked to play bridge and admired Margaret Thatcher.King Salman is said to see himself in his favorite son, the latest in the lineage of a family that has ruled most of the Arabian Peninsula for eight decades.Prince bin Salman graduated from the university that year and continued to work for his father, who was named defense minister in 2011, while dabbling in real estate and business.Many members of the royal family remain wary of the young prince\u2019s projects and ultimate ambitions. Some mock him as the \u201cPrince of the Vision\u201d and complain about his army of well-paid foreign consultants and image-makers.Other are annoyed by the media cell he created inside the royal court to promote his initiatives, both foreign and domestic. Called the Center for Studies and Media Affairs, the group has focused on promoting a positive story about the Yemen war in Washington and has hired numerous Washington lobbying and public affairs firms to assist in the effort.Inside the kingdom, the government has largely succeeded in keeping criticism \u2014 and even open discussion \u2014 of the prince and his projects out of the public sphere. His family holds sway over the parent company of many Saudi newspapers, which have breathlessly covered his initiatives, and prominent Saudi editors and journalists who have accompanied him on foreign trips have been given up to $100,000 in cash, according to two people who have traveled with the prince\u2019s delegation.Meanwhile, Saudi journalists deemed too critical have been quietly silenced through phone calls informing them that they are barred from publishing, and sometimes from traveling abroad.\u201cYou can buy tens of newspapers and hundreds of journalists, but you can\u2019t buy the history that will be written about you,\u201d he wrote.He said that the prince\u2019s popularity among Saudis was based on a \u201csweeping desire for great change\u201d and that they loved him based on the hope that he would \u201cturn their dreams into reality.\u201dIn that lay the risk, Mr. Qahtani wrote: \u201cIf you fail, this love withers quickly, as if it never existed, and is replaced by a deep feeling of frustration and hatred.\u201dAs sweeping and long-term as Prince bin Salman\u2019s initiatives are, they may hang by the tenuous thread of his link to his father, who has memory lapses, according to foreign officials who have met with him. Even the prince\u2019s supporters acknowledge that they are not sure he will retain his current roles after his father dies.In the meantime, he is racing against time to establish his reputation and cement his place in the kingdom\u2019s power structure.His fast ascent, and his well-publicized foreign trips to Washington, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia, have led senior Obama administration officials to consider the prospect that he could step over Prince bin Nayef and become Saudi Arabia\u2019s next king.This has led to a balancing act for American officials who want to build a relationship with him while not being used as leverage in any rivalry with Prince bin Nayef. Obama administration officials say relations with Prince bin Salman have generally improved, but only after a rocky start when he would routinely lecture senior Americans \u2014 even the president.In November, during a Group of 20 summit meeting at a luxury resort on the Turkish coast, Prince bin Salman gave what American officials described as a lengthy speech about what he saw as the failure of American foreign policy in the Middle East \u2014 from the Obama administration\u2019s restraint in Syria to its efforts to improve relations with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s bitter enemy.Personal relationships have long been the bedrock of American-Saudi relations, yet the Obama administration has struggled to find someone to develop a rapport with the prince. The job has largely fallen to Secretary of State John Kerry, who has hosted the prince several times at his home in Georgetown. In June, the two men shared an iftar dinner, breaking the Ramadan fast. In September 2015, dinner at Mr. Kerry\u2019s house ended with Prince bin Salman playing Beethoven on the piano for the secretary of state and the other guests.His desire to reimagine the Saudi state is reflected in his admiration \u2014 some even call it envy \u2014 for the kingdom\u2019s more modern and progressive neighbor in the Persian Gulf, the United Arab Emirates.He has influential supporters in this effort, particularly the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who for more than a year has been promoting Prince bin Salman in the Middle East and in Washington.Crown Prince bin Zayed, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 de facto ruler, is a favorite among Obama administration officials, who view him as a reliable ally and a respected voice in the Sunni world. But he also has a history of personal antipathy toward Prince bin Nayef, adding a particular urgency to his support for the chief rival of the Saudi crown prince.In April of last year, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, led a small delegation of top White House officials to visit Prince bin Zayed at his home in McLean, Va. During the meeting, according to several officials who attended, the prince urged the Americans to develop a relationship with Prince bin Salman.But all questions about Prince bin Salman\u2019s future are likely to depend on how long his father lives, according to diplomats who track Saudi Arabia.If he died soon, Prince bin Nayef would become king and could dismiss his younger cousin as a gesture to his fellow royals. In fact, it was King Salman who set the precedent for such moves by dismissing the crown prince named by his predecessor.\u201cIf the king\u2019s health starts to deteriorate, Mohammed bin Salman is very likely to try to get Mohammed bin Nayef out of the picture,\u201d said Mr. Riedel, the former C.I.A. analyst.But the longer King Salman reigns, foreign officials said, the longer the young prince has to consolidate his power \u2014 or to convince Prince bin Nayef that he is worth keeping around if Prince bin Nayef becomes king.Most Saudi watchers do not expect any struggles within the family to spill into the open, as all the royals understand how much they have to lose from such fissures becoming public or destabilizing their grip on the kingdom.\u201cI am persuaded as someone who focuses on this topic that the ruling family of Saudi Arabia above all else puts the interest of the family first and foremost,\u201d said Mr. Kechichian, the analyst who knows many royals.\u201cNot a single member of the family will do anything to hurt the family.\u201dAn article on Oct. 16 about Prince Mohammed bin Salman, son of King Salman of Saudi Arabia and a potential rival with his cousin for the throne, misstated, in some editions, an achievement of another one of King Salman\u2019s sons. The son, Sultan bin Salman, was the first Arab astronaut, not the only one.Nicholas Kulish, Jo Becker and Matt Apuzzo contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Greylock, which was an early investor in Facebook and LinkedIn, now has $3.5 billion in assets under management.The influx of capital is a potential lift for start-ups that need money, but it could make it harder for venture firms to deliver high returns down the road. The report from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association notes that the number of start-ups getting funded has declined for five straight quarters, even as investors have more money to put to work. With fewer investment opportunities, venture firms may end up overpaying for pieces of private companies.Greylock tends to invest in companies early in their life cycles, a strategy that Mr. Slavet said helps investors earn higher returns when there is a lot of capital in the system.The firm is exploring new places to invest its money. Greylock is known for investments in consumer and business software companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Workday and Airbnb.

Who Deserted Donald Trump Over Lewd Tape Are Returning", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byFrom Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the only member of the Republican leadership in either chamber who had disavowed Mr. Trump, to Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey, who is in a difficult re-election fight, the lawmakers contorted themselves over Mr. Trump. Some of them would not mention him by name, preferring instead to affirm their support for the generic \u201cRepublican ticket,\u201d still grasping for a middle ground.In Alabama, Representative Bradley Byrne, who said flatly over the weekend, \u201cIt is now clear Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States,\u201d insisted to reporters on Wednesday that he had always said he would \u201cbe a supporter of the Republican ticket from top to bottom.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d Mr. Byrne said. \u201cI don\u2019t vote Democrat.\u201dMr. Thune, who also said on Saturday that Mr. Pence should be the party\u2019s nominee, \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d acknowledged that the recording of Mr. Trump boasting of grabbing women\u2019s genitals was \u201cmore offensive than anything that I had seen\u201d from the often-inflammatory Republican standard-bearer. But he said in an interview Tuesday with KELO television in Sioux Falls, S.D., that he would still cast his ballot for Mr. Trump.\u201cI intend to support the nominee of our party, and if anything should change, then I\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Mr. Thune said. \u201cBut he\u2019s got a lot of work to do, I think, if he\u2019s going to have any hope of winning this election.\u201dOf the Republicans who reversed themselves, only Mr. Garrett is in a competitive race. Mr. Byrne and Mr. Thune are expected to easily defeat their Democratic opponents, and Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska is not up for re-election until 2018.On Saturday, Ms. Fischer called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments \u201cdisgusting and totally unacceptable under any circumstance\u201d and said, \u201cIt would be wise for him to step aside and allow Mike Pence to serve as our party\u2019s nominee.\u201dBut she was almost philosophical in telling a Nebraska radio station on Tuesday why she was still backing Mr. Trump.\u201cHe decided he would not step aside. I respect his decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI support the Republican ticket, and it\u2019s a Trump-Pence ticket.\u201dIn New Jersey, Mr. Garrett also initially called for Mr. Pence to lead the party. But by Tuesday, Mr. Garrett, a seven-term lawmaker who was already facing perhaps the stiffest challenge of his career, said he would \u201cvote Trump for president if he is the party\u2019s official nominee come Election Day.\u201dThe legislators\u2019 tortuous efforts to climb down from their earlier clarion calls did not seem to placate Mr. Trump\u2019s admirers much.How the emergence of a 2005 recording of Donald J. Trump bragging about sexual assault is playing out in the tightest House and Senate races.\u201cIf you are not FOR Mr. Trump, then you must be AGAINST Mr. Trump,\u201d Lonnie Lee Mixon II, an Alabamian, wrote on Mr. Byrne\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cPlease stop dancing around this.\u201dA handful of the Republican Party\u2019s recruits also find themselves in a vise. In Nebraska, Don Bacon, who is challenging Representative Brad Ashford, a Democrat, initially issued a statement calling Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cutterly disgraceful and disqualifying.\u201d But the news release is nowhere to be found on Mr. Bacon\u2019s website, and at a debate Tuesday night in Omaha, he would not rule out voting for Mr. Trump.The specter of a civil war enveloping the party less than four weeks before Election Day left veteran Republicans deeply worried about what the elected officials who moved so quickly to abandon Mr. Trump last weekend had wrought.One former Virginia congressman, Thomas M. Davis III, said \u201cpanicked\u201d Republicans might have made the party\u2019s Trump-related problems even worse.\u201cIt discourages turnout,\u201d Mr. Davis said, noting that even as Mr. Trump sinks in the polls, he still has at least two-thirds of the party behind him. \u201cPublicly disowning and running from him just creates havoc. It hurts everybody. I understand individual decisions, but when this happens institutionally, it hurts.\u201dSensing an opportunity to rally his supporters against the wavering Republican leaders, Mr. Trump went after Mr. Ryan at a campaign rally for the first time since the speaker told House Republicans on Monday that he would no longer defend the party\u2019s nominee. Before 7,000 people in Ocala, Fla., Mr. Trump veered between dark, conspiratorial warnings and strikingly personal expressions of resentment.\u201cSo wouldn\u2019t you think that Paul Ryan would call and say good going, in front of just about the largest audience for a second-night debate in the history of the country?\u201d he complained.In a conference call Wednesday night with major donors, Mr. Ryan vented about leaks from the conference call with House Republicans on Monday in which he announced his decision to focus entirely on congressional races. He said the news media had misinterpreted his message to his colleagues \u2014 that they should not \u201cdefend the indefensible\u201d \u2014 and that Mr. Trump lacked \u201cthe discipline\u201d to resist swiping back at him, according to a donor on the call. But Mr. Ryan said that Republican candidates could \u201chelp Trump with turnout,\u201d and that he planned to use a speech on Friday to argue against Hillary Clinton.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, would not say whether Mr. Trump planned to start tailoring his intraparty attacks by region. But she pointedly emailed an automated survey of Nevada voters showing that Republicans were punishing Representative Joe Heck in his Senate campaign for withdrawing his support of Mr. Trump.One of Mr. Trump\u2019s most prominent remaining allies, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, said the nominee\u2019s blasts at other Republicans were an unnecessary diversion from targeting Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Gingrich added that Mr. Ryan had invited the opprobrium from both Mr. Trump and his admirers.\u201cRyan wants to find a middle path, but he doesn\u2019t understand that the middle path signals to his own partisans that he\u2019s not hanging tough,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you have to say if you\u2019re Ryan is, \u2018We need to beat Hillary Clinton, and I\u2019m going to help beat Hillary Clinton.\u2019\u201dMrs. Clinton herself was reveling in the Republican conflagration and, in a new sign of confidence, used a rally in Pueblo, Colo., to appeal across state lines to voters in two red states that now appear within reach.\u201dIf you\u2019ve got friends in Utah or Arizona, make sure they vote, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are competing everywhere.\u201dNick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Ocala, Fla., and Matt Flegenheimer from Pueblo, Colo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Western Myanmar, a Lockdown and Fears of More Violence", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 More than a week after attacks on police officers began a wave of bloodshed in western Myanmar, a lockdown by security forces has prevented aid workers from operating in the area, and new videos of what appear to be local Muslims calling for resistance have raised fears of more violence.A United Nations World Food Program official, Arsen Sahakyan, said Tuesday that a lockdown in the area since the Oct. 9 attacks had halted the agency\u2019s relief work in villages there, which typically reaches 70,000 people per month during the lean agricultural season from May to November. Pregnant or lactating women and young children also receive year-round food assistance under the program, he added.Now that road access has been severely curtailed, \u201cpeople report to the office, but that\u2019s it,\u201d said Mr. Sahakyan, the agency\u2019s partnerships officer in Myanmar, referring to its field office in northern Rakhine. \u201cWe cannot go to the areas where we normally distribute food.\u201dThe government has attributed the Oct. 9 attacks to organized Muslim militants, though it offered no evidence and has since appeared to backtrack somewhat from the charge. Last Friday, President Htin Kyaw\u2019s office said the attacks had been carried out by an organization called Aqa Mul Mujahidin, which it said had links to another little-known group, the Rohingya Solidarity Organization.Several analysts and activists who follow Myanmar said in interviews that they had never heard of the first group and that the second was thought to be defunct. On Monday, according to news reports, the Foreign Ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, U Kyaw Zeya, said the statement from the president\u2019s office was preliminary and should not be used to \u201cstart making accusations, much less condemnations.\u201dBut videos have circulated since the attacks that appear to show armed Rohingya men in Rakhine calling for violent jihad. One that emerged in recent days, showing four men holding military-grade weapons, has an English-language voice-over that makes several demands of the government, including returning land that it said had been taken from Rohingya.\u201cWe stand as an independent body which is free from all elements of terror in any nature but seeks fundamental but legitimate rights and justice for all Arakanese, including our innocent Rohingyas and other civilians dying from the continuous military assault,\u201d the voice-over said. Rakhine State is also known as Arakan State.But U Kyaw Min, the chairman of the Democracy and Human Rights Party, a registered political party in Myanmar whose Rohingya members are barred from running for office, said he did not believe the attacks were the work of organized militants.Mr. Kyaw Min said information he had gathered from people in Rakhine suggested the attacks had been carried out by gang members involved in drug trafficking, not terrorists with links to overseas Islamist groups. He said he believed the government had fabricated a link between armed Rohingya and foreign terrorists as a pretext for eventually forcing people in northern Rakhine to live in refugee camps.\u201cThe Rohingya are the sufferers,\u201d he said.More than 100,000 people already live in refugee camps in southern Rakhine, on the fringes of the state capital, Sittwe. Most are Rohingya, though some are Rakhine, a Buddhist ethnic minority that has also been persecuted by the Myanmar Army. All were displaced in the 2012 fighting between the Rohingya and the Rakhine, which broke out around Sittwe and killed dozens.Mr. Annan visited Sittwe in September, and the commission is expected to file a report in 2017. But analysts said the recent violence, coupled with the jihadist videos circulating online and the government\u2019s warnings about Islamist terrorism, was fueling anti-Muslim sentiment across Myanmar and making the prospect of ethnic reconciliation in Rakhine State look increasingly remote.Widney Brown, director of programs at Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group based in New York that has documented human rights violations by the authorities against both Rohingya and Rakhine people in Rakhine State, said it was imperative that the Myanmar government conduct an impartial investigation into the Oct. 9 attacks and the subsequent violence.\u201cThere needs to be accountability,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear: on both sides.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. The analyst, Jasminder Singh, is a man.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Corrosive Election and the New Abnormal", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byThe only presidential inauguration I\u2019ve attended was Bill Clinton\u2019s first, on Jan. 20, 1993. I took two spare tickets from the office, and brought my 7-year-old daughter, bundled against the cold like a little abominable snowman and old enough, I figured, for a civics lesson.That image came to mind last week during the third presidential debate. I watched the debate on a hotel television in the company of fellow participants in a conference I was attending. All were lawyers. As the debate proceeded, the group\u2019s attention occasionally drifted, and we chatted a bit. But at Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to say that he would abide by the election results, everyone snapped to attention. Someone had to break the stunned silence, so as the only one in the room with journalism experience, it fell to me to state the obvious: \u201cThat\u2019s the headline.\u201dDuring this excruciating year, I\u2019ve refrained from writing about the election, content to leave the subject to columnists for whom politics is central to their mandate. But law is central to mine, and since this is my last column before Election Day, I will use it to reflect on the challenge that this political season has posed to the rule of law.What do I mean by that phrase? The rule of law isn\u2019t readily reduced to a definition; we know it when we see it. It is both a process and an end state: the product not of a list of mandates but of ingrained habits, a collective turn of mind, shared expectations about how a civil society organizes its affairs and resolves its conflicts. We know that rules alone don\u2019t suffice to create or maintain a rule of law; some of the world\u2019s more odious governments have looked beneficent on paper.The rule of law provides confidence that what is true today will still be true tomorrow. It undergirds the resilience necessary to absorb the inevitable shocks any political system faces. Resilience takes a long time to grow. The European \u201cunity\u201d now fracturing under 21st century strain is a mid-20th century artifact. That\u2019s not very much time. In the United States, we have thought, smugly, that we have all the time in the world. Maybe we don\u2019t.Consider the Republican-controlled Senate\u2019s response to President Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, a nomination now nearly eight months old. Having vowed to prevent President Obama from filling the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, Republican senators have refused to schedule a hearing for Judge Garland, the distinguished chief judge of a major federal appeals court \u2014 or, with a few exceptions, even to meet with him and shake his hand. Ten days ago, Senator John McCain raised the stakes, vowing that Republicans would block not only this but any Supreme Court nomination made in the future by a President Hillary Clinton. \u201cI promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,\u201d the Arizona Republican declared in a radio interview.Senator McCain \u2014 or, more precisely, a staff member speaking on his behalf \u2014 quickly backed off, and Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, said in response that the Senate \u201ccan\u2019t just simply stonewall\u201d but rather had the responsibility to \u201cvet\u201d a president\u2019s nominees. I\u2019m not sure what that means. Maybe it means that the tattered thread of a norm by which the confirmation process is hanging is at least sufficient to require the Republicans to say that, of course, they won\u2019t do the very thing that they will do, if they can call it by a different name and bring it off.It\u2019s important to understand just how far from the norm the current situation has descended. Did the titanic battle that led to the defeat of Robert H. Bork, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, open the door to this kind of behavior? You often hear such a claim, but the fact is that no, it did not.The Bork battle remains the outlier, not the standard. Judge Bork, let\u2019s not forget, got a hearing, a committee vote, and a floor vote. Months after defeating the Bork nomination by a bipartisan vote of 58 opposed to 42 in favor, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 97 to 0, a month into the 1988 presidential election year, to confirm Anthony M. Kennedy to the seat Judge Bork was to have filled. President Bill Clinton\u2019s two Supreme Court nominees, Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen G. Breyer the next year, were confirmed by votes of 96 to 3 and 87 to 9. It is only by a distorted view of history that the Bork battle can be said to have ushered in or authorized flat-out obstruction of a Supreme Court nomination.Dear Bill,When I walked into this office just now, I felt the same sense of wonder and respect that I felt four years ago. I know you will feel that, too.I wish you great happiness here \u2026Your success is now our country\u2019s success. I am rooting hard for you.Good luck.GeorgeThis Election Day, good luck to us all.An earlier version of this essay misstated the chronology of nominations to the Supreme Court. The two nominees after Robert H. Bork were Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter, not Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, who were nominated later by President Bill Clinton.Advertisement"}

Yes.", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byRace/RelatedIn this issue, we explore two personal accounts of what can go wrong, and right, when you try to dress outside your background.It was a Friday and someone got on the subject of what everyone\u2019s doing for Halloween. She was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to be Dionne from \u2018Clueless.\u2019\u201dOne of the girls looked at me like, How\u2019s this going to go? She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to wear the plaid outfit or the velvet dress.\u201dThen she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get cornrows.\u2019 \u201cCareful,\u201d I said. She looked at me. \u201cWhat, I can\u2019t have braids? Wait, why is it wrong?\u2019\u201dEveryone was shaking their heads like \u2018cringe. \u2019I was thinking, What are you reading when you get home? How is this something that you don\u2019t know about?I said, \u201cI think you should get a velvet dress and a headband, but I don\u2019t think you should go there.\u201dA man said, \u201cit is cultural misappropriation.\u201d Verbatim.\u201cAlso, it\u2019s a safety issue.\u201d I said. \u201cIf you go somewhere and someone sees you it could get very tense.\u201dAnd that was it.I wish I felt more comfortable talking about such things. If I had the opportunity, I would tell her if you want to be Dionne from \u201cClueless,\u201d you can do the outfit, but as far as hairstyles and face-painting go \u2014 when I see someone dressing up as a black person, and on Halloween, which is a lot about making fun of things, I think of minstrel shows, I think of blackface, I think of things that are really upsetting.She had no idea.It also made me think about my Halloween costumes. I would be David Bowie from \u201cLabyrinth\u201d and someone would be like, \u201cYou\u2019re Lil Kim!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re Tina Turner!\u201d It\u2019s hard to picture me as anything other than a black person.

{"Headline": "Sandstorms and Broken-Down Four-by-Fours: Drone Footage in the Tengger Desert", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byI\u2019m standing next to a broken-down four-by-four in the middle of the Tengger Desert. My driver runs up the highest dune in search of a cellphone signal. He\u2019s trying to contact his friends back at the edge; the sun is starting to set, and we need another car.The scenery is breathtaking, but I feel helpless: We\u2019re a half-hour drive from where we need to be, and the sunset means that my assignment \u2014 along with the limited time left on my visa \u2014 is slipping away from me.The truth is, the drivers here aren\u2019t accustomed to journalists. Their usual customers are tourists looking for a roller-coaster ride through the dunes \u2014 which explains the death metal blasting from the radio and what seems to be a broken axle. The music should have been my first clue.But now, halfway to Moon Lake, we\u2019re watching the sun go down, and I\u2019m missing the opportunity to make the picture.Getting here wasn\u2019t easy: a 14-hour red-eye flight to Beijing, a two-hour plane ride to Yinchuan (after a series of cancellations and delays because of summer thunderstorms \u2014 along with a four-hour nap in an airport hotel), a two-hour drive to the edge of the Tengger, and a rapid price negotiation to get a dune-capable vehicle.Making the pictures hasn\u2019t proved easy, either. For traveling purposes, I had brought along a relatively small drone, and I knew it would be a trade-off: Smaller and lighter means it is more susceptible to being swept up in a windstorm, which would make the footage unusable. We also have to get very creative when launching and landing the drone to ensure minimal sand exposure. I\u2019d already ruined one in an assignment months before by getting sand in the motor. I couldn\u2019t risk having that happen so early in this trip to China.How did I end up here? We\u2019d chosen this exact spot, from back in New York, months earlier. A group of editors on the graphics desk and I had sat down with a map of the Tengger, after hearing suggestions from Edward Wong, the Beijing bureau chief. We were looking for communities along the edge that might be affected by the desert\u2019s changing footprint.Jeremy White, a graphics editor at The Times, analyzed satellite data to determine three communities where the desert seemed to be encroaching. Our challenge was to find a story there. Was desertification impacting people in these locations? If so, how?One of the ways to capture the extent of the change \u2014 and the emotional heft of these stories \u2014 was to rise above the desert with a drone.Our replacement car eventually arrives, and a new death metal song crackles out of the speakers. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve missed the light for the evening; we\u2019ll have to try again at sunrise \u2014 which means sleeping among the dunes.That light is stunning the next morning as we bounce back across the sand, and I finally have time to film what I need for the story.Up next? We\u2019re off to another part of China for the next story in the series \u2014 and for many more challenging modes of transportation.Advertisement"}

Toyzer of Wynnewood, Pa., was married Oct. 29 to Alex Geoffrey Rothberg, the son of Sheila B. Alderman and Henry B. Rothberg of Jupiter Island, Fla. Rabbi George Scott Matous officiated at the Liberty Warehouse, an event space in Brooklyn.Ms. Toyzer, 28, is keeping her name. She is an associate working in the principal investing area of Goldman Sachs in Manhattan. She graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which she received two bachelor\u2019s degrees, in economics and in management science.Mr. Rothberg, 29, is a senior scientist and software engineer at 4Catalyzer, a medical device start-up based in Guilford, Conn. He also graduated from M.I.T., and received two bachelor\u2019s degrees, in computer science and in economics.Though Ms. Toyzer and Mr. Rothberg never formally met at M.I.T., despite taking some of the same classes, she remembered him as \u201ca bit of nerd\u201d who once talked about a relationship that deeply concerned him.\u201cHe was giving a presentation demonstrating the relationship between company performance and executive stock options,\u201d Ms. Toyzer said. \u201cHe was confident and very good looking and he knew it, but I thought he was intelligent in an irritating way.\u201dAfter graduating in June 2010, Ms. Toyzer moved to Manhattan to begin working as an analyst at an investment bank. The next month, Mr. Rothberg arrived in Manhattan, having transferred from his job as a stock options trader at a Chicago firm.As it turned out, they were living a few blocks from each other in Lower Manhattan. They also shared the same gym, which is where they crossed paths during a major snowstorm in December 2010. Ms. Toyzer had just finished working out and was leaving when Mr. Rothberg and his roommate, who were just arriving, brushed past her.\u201cI turned to my roommate and said, \u201cThat was Jenn Toyzer,\u2019\u201d Mr. Rothberg said. \u201cI always thought she was a really cute, really sharp girl.\u201dThat same night, Mr. Rothberg went home and thumbed through M.I.T.\u2019s alumni directory to be sure that the woman he had seen was indeed Ms. Toyzer. The moment he saw her Manhattan address, he contacted her on Facebook.They played \u201cFacebook tag,\u201d as Mr. Rothberg called it, for about a month before Ms. Toyzer invited him to a friend\u2019s birthday celebration at a bar in Little Italy.\u201cHe showed up alone, and I went over to him, and he was so warm and friendly, we just connected,\u201d Ms. Toyzer said. \u201cThis time around, there was nothing irritating about him at all.\u201dThey spent much of the evening catching up before sharing a cab home. The next night they met at another Manhattan restaurant, with Ms. Toyzer bringing along a friend.\u201cHe ordered a really nice bottle of wine and seemed to know a lot about food,\u201d said Ms. Toyzer, who told Mr. Rothberg that she had been making a list of the restaurants she most wanted to dine at since arriving in Manhattan.They got together again the next night, this time, just the two of them.\u201cThere were no awkward moments of silence when we spoke,\u201d Mr. Rothberg said. \u201cIt was just a lot of fun, and I really got to know her that night as a woman who had a quick wit and a very strong personality, the kind of woman who lets you know what\u2019s on her mind.\u201dOn March 25, 2011, which was Ms. Toyzer\u2019s birthday, Mr. Rothberg surprised her with a choice of exclusive Manhattan restaurants at which to celebrate, Daniel or Eleven Madison Park \u2014 the top two on her restaurant wish list.Ms. Toyzer chose Daniel, then told her mother the same day of an even bigger choice she had made.\u201cI told her that this was it, this was the guy I was going to marry,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Magnate\u2019s Twin Goals: Fighting Climate Change and Electing Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byMONTAUK, N.Y. \u2014 On a sunny morning late this summer, Andrew E. Sabin was aboard his 60-foot yacht, \u201cAbove the Ground.\u201d He had begun the day in Amagansett, a well-heeled enclave near East Hampton where he maintains a lush seven-acre compound replete with a menagerie featuring peacocks and an enormous pig. Now, on the eastern tip of Long Island, Mr. Sabin pierced a clam with a hook and dropped his fishing line 120 feet to the ocean floor, hoping to land some cod.A wisecracking, boyish septuagenarian of seemingly unlimited energy, Mr. Sabin runs a privately held precious-metals recycling business that has made him enormously wealthy. The Sabin Metal Corporation processes about $1 billion worth of platinum, palladium and other metals each year. Annual revenue is less than that, but it clearly leaves plenty for a personal fortune.With that money, Mr. Sabin has emerged as a leading supporter of climate change initiatives. He has endowed the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, funds climate change prizes and professors at Yale and the University of California, Los Angeles and is a major donor to Global Wildlife Conservation. He founded a local natural history museum where he leads nature walks, and, thanks to his generous support of environmental causes, he has four species named after him \u2014 two frogs, a chameleon and a lemur.But Mr. Sabin also sharply diverges from the environmentalist stereotype: He is a strident Republican donating big sums of money in an effort to elect Donald J. Trump president.His twin passions are at odds. Many of the Republican Party\u2019s elected officials deny that humans are accelerating the warming of the planet, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence. Prominent environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, generally back Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. Yet Mr. Sabin has been a generous donor to the Republican Party for years, contributing more than $500,000 to Republican candidates, committees and other political groups this election cycle.Even within his party, Mr. Sabin is an outlier: Many other Republicans who believe in climate change have declined to support Mr. Trump. But after backing Jeb Bush early in the primaries, Mr. Sabin threw his wallet behind Mr. Trump and never looked back. He recently donated $100,000 to Trump Victory, the candidate\u2019s joint fund-raising venture with the Republican Party.To hear Mr. Sabin tell it, a Trump presidency would not be such a threat to environmental concerns. Yes, Mr. Trump has routinely suggested that global warming is not real, has vowed to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency if elected president and said he would walk away from the landmark Paris accord approved last year, in which nearly 200 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions.Mr. Sabin, however, brushes that off as election-season bluster. \u201cI don\u2019t think he believes half the things he says,\u201d he said. In meetings with Mr. Trump, he has come away convinced that the candidate is actually a reasonable, well-tempered man who is committed to clean air and clean water. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations about the E.P.A. and the Paris agreement, Mr. Sabin is dismissive, arguing that such actions wouldn\u2019t get through Congress. \u201cThere are good checks and balances,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to do whatever he wants.\u201dThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.As much as he supports the Republican ticket, Mr. Sabin is equally motivated by his loathing for Mrs. Clinton, whom he derides as untrustworthy, unethical and unfit for office. In front of his mansion, in an organic garden that features kale, blueberries and Swiss chard, Mr. Sabin has erected several \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d yard signs. Last year, after the signs disappeared in the middle of the night, Mr. Sabin placed them on stilts and surrounded them with a 6,600-volt electrified fence.\u201cYou will have a fascinating journey down the rabbit hole in trying to understand the complexity of Andy Sabin,\u201d said Susan Rockefeller, a prominent conservationist who has worked with Mr. Sabin and affectionately calls him \u201cthe eco-saint of the Hamptons.\u201dThis summer, Mr. Sabin made several trips to Washington. His mission was to persuade Republican members of Congress to acknowledge climate change in the party platform that would shape the Republican National Convention in late July.In a flurry of meetings, Mr. Sabin, who wears a uniform of Hawaiian shirts, baggy khaki pants and sneakers, visited the offices of Republican representatives including Chris Gibson of New York, Joe Wilson of South Carolina and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, as well as Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.Mr. Sabin has no doubt that greenhouse gases from human activity are warming the planet, leading to rising oceans and more severe weather. \u201cThe science is clear,\u201d he said, and inasmuch as he can, Mr. Sabin is working to minimize his own carbon dioxide emissions. At Sabin Metal Corporation\u2019s processing plants in upstate New York, North Dakota and Ontario, he says he has invested in expensive equipment to reduce emissions and minimize pollution. \u201cNot a drop of carbon comes out of my stacks,\u201d he said.Yet on Capitol Hill, he measured his words. Instead of trying to persuade Republican lawmakers that climate science is real, he talked to them about the need to minimize pollution as a way to keep people healthy. He makes the case that worse air quality leads to premature deaths, an increase in illnesses, more stillbirths and higher hospital spending. \u201cI don\u2019t discuss climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cI discuss health.\u201dMr. Sabin employs this rhetorical sleight of hand to reconcile what, to many, are inherently contradictory positions.\u201cI came to the conclusion that I needed to come up with a way to get Republicans on board about cutting carbon,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t going to convince Republicans that climate change is real, so I\u2019m trying to get them to the same place.\u201dHe has drafted a policy paper peppered with statistics from the RAND Corporation and Carnegie Mellon University that encourages lawmakers to invest in clean energy jobs and to pressure businesses to pollute less, simply for the good of public health. If embraced in earnest, Mr. Sabin says, this approach will result in reductions in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 a goal of many Democrats.But he opposes many ideas from Democrats about how to reach that goal. He is vehemently opposed to new regulation and a carbon tax, and he says the E.P.A. is guilty of overreach. Instead, Mr. Sabin says that private investments in clean coal technology, new nuclear power and renewable energy will reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to check global warming. In the meantime, Mr. Sabin supports the use of cheap and abundant natural gas.It is a position that closely mirrors that of the broader Republican Party on energy production. And Mr. Sabin claims to have the Trump campaign\u2019s ear on the issue. He says he is in regular contact with the campaign and took credit for shaping the response to a question in the second presidential debate, when Mr. Trump talked up clean coal, wind power and solar energy. \u201cThat came from me,\u201d Mr. Sabin said.Many environmentalists, however, say the policies promoted by Mr. Sabin and Mr. Trump will not do nearly enough to curb emissions.\u201cTo put the fate of our climate on clean coal and so-called next-gen nuclear is about the riskiest proposition in the world,\u201d said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. \u201cWe might as well bet on leprechauns and the Easter bunny.\u201dMr. Sabin\u2019s positions baffle even some professors he supports. Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said: \u201cAndy and I agree about some things and agree to disagree on other things. The party has gone off the rails on that side.\u201dMany Republicans in Congress reject the idea that human activity is contributing to climate change. \u201cI don\u2019t think what we do as a race is going to be the deciding factor in what happens with our environment,\u201d said Ms. Foxx, the North Carolina congresswoman. \u201cBecause I happen to believe that God is in charge.\u201dShortly after Mr. Sabin\u2019s visits to Washington, he had a private meeting with Mr. Trump at the Manhattan home of Steven Mnuchin, the candidate\u2019s national finance chairman. Mr. Trump wore his usual dark suit with a white shirt and a red tie. Mr. Sabin attended the meeting in a bright green Hawaiian shirt, wearing Buddhist prayer beads on his wrist.Mr. Sabin came away impressed. \u201cTrump knows in his heart that cutting carbon is the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cHe\u2019s very different in person. He listens.\u201dMr. Sabin, 70, grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn and still speaks with a thick New York accent reminiscent of Mr. Trump\u2019s. As a boy, he would wander over to undeveloped areas in nearby Bensonhurst and collect frogs and snakes with his bare hands. \u201cI started catching them and never grew up,\u201d he said.He joined the Army reserve in the late 1960s, he said, and then joined his father\u2019s business, which collected and sold scrap metal. In the early 1970s, Mr. Sabin started a trading house for metals and other commodities. As Wall Street went digital, Mr. Sabin left trading behind and built out his father\u2019s company into Sabin Metal Corporation.He attributes his passion for the environment to his boyhood enthusiasm. \u201cSince I started catching frogs, I\u2019ve always been interested in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the years went on I realized the importance of preserving what I was enjoying.\u201dHe has been a Republican for as long as he can remember, too, and has internalized the party\u2019s talking points about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI see corruption with the Clintons only rivaled by Nigeria, Malaysia or Indonesia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts right at the top, and it disgusts me.\u201dPerhaps one way to makes sense of Mr. Sabin is to recognize that he is much like Mr. Trump himself. Impassioned and at times charismatic, he is also quick to ignore facts, brimming with conspiracy theories, and prone to objectifying women. His girlfriend is several decades his junior. \u201cYou\u2019re only as young as the woman you\u2019re touching,\u201d he said. While watching Fox News, he complimented the appearance of the daytime host Jenna Lee. (\u201cI think she\u2019s so hot,\u201d he said.) Aboard his yacht, he openly viewed pornography on an iPad. Over the course of several months, he sent a reporter numerous emails containing X-rated images.On Thursday, Mr. Sabin said he was repulsed by Mr. Trump\u2019s recently unearthed comments about sexually assaulting women \u2014 though not enough to withdraw his support. And he is unashamed of his own libido. \u201cI\u2019m proud that at 70 years old I still have a healthy sex drive,\u201d he said.He also talks of radical transformation to the economy, while rejecting regulation as a tool to facilitate change. And on his Facebook page, Mr. Sabin traffics in the conspiracy theories of the so-called Alt Right. Stories such as \u201cMichelle Obama Vows to Confiscate All Firearms Before Leaving the White House\u201d and \u201cUnited Nations to Investigate Hillary Clinton for Election Fraud\u201d are posted alongside pictures of Mr. Sabin searching for salamanders.This complex personality is on constant display. Tooling around the Hamptons, he drives a Jeep Wrangler with his nickname, the Salamander Commander, emblazoned on the doors. On the back of the jeep are bumper stickers that say \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d and \u201cTrump 2016.\u201dAt a separate property that he owns in the Hamptons, away from his mansion, Tibetan prayer flags form a canopy over the driveway. In front of the house is a small sanctuary for injured turtles. Buddha statues are placed around the grounds and throughout the house. Inside, a piano once owned by the abstract expressionist painter Lee Krasner sits in the living room. And all around the property are National Rifle Association signs, warning trespassers that they will be shot.These days, Mr. Sabin acknowledges his candidate\u2019s shortcomings. And he said he disliked the hobbies of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s children. (\u201cI don\u2019t like hunting,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t like about Trump\u2019s kids: these pictures of them holding leopards and elephant tails.\u201d)And yet, Mr. Sabin is still supporting Mr. Trump for lack of what he sees as a better option. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep a Republican House, and Republican Senate and a conservative Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump comes with the package to do that.\u201dIt is a combustible, contradictory mix, reflecting the tensions roiling the Republican Party \u2014 and the nation \u2014 in this bizarre election season.In the run-up to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, the party\u2019s official platform was unveiled. \u201cClimate change is far from this nation\u2019s most pressing national security issue,\u201d it read. \u201cThis is the triumph of extremism over common sense, and Congress must stop it.\u201dMr. Sabin was unruffled by the snub. \u201cIt was a disappointment,\u201d Mr. Sabin said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t try it can\u2019t happen.\u201dMotoring back to the Long Island shore on his yacht, Mr. Sabin was satisfied with his haul. A dozen meaty fish were in the hold, including several cod and a handful of black sea bass. On the horizon, five towering wind turbines rose from the ocean. The first offshore wind farm in the United States, the turbines have stirred up predictable controversy in this area. But Mr. Sabin rejects the Nimbyism that has turned some wealthy locals against the project.\u201cI\u2019m a big proponent of wind energy,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people worry about the views, but it\u2019s better than more carbon.\u201dIn the cabin of the boat, Fox News played on a large flat-screen TV. It was midday, and Mr. Trump was holding forth at a news conference at his new Washington hotel, where he finally admitted that President Obama was born in the United States, after years promoting the birther conspiracy.\u201cTrump is doing really well,\u201d Mr. Sabin said enthusiastically. \u201cHillary\u2019s in trouble.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the wealthy businessman Andrew E. Sabin\u2019s contradictory stance of supporting both action to thwart climate change and the presidential aspirations of Donald J. Trump referred imprecisely to when Mr. Sabin joined the Army reserve.

{"Headline": "Snap Is Said to Pick Bankers for an I.P.O.", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The newest generation of technology darlings has signaled that it is about to come of age: Snapchat, the messaging service beloved by teenagers, is preparing to step out into the public markets.The company \u2014 born only five years ago \u2014 may end up ushering in a wave of huge tech initial public offerings at a time when Wall Street has seen few such big deals.Snapchat\u2019s parent, recently renamed Snap Inc., has hired the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, essentially firing a starting gun for a potential stock sale as soon as the first quarter of next year, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.Should Snap follow through on its plans, it would be the most prominent debut by the latest batch of \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 those private companies valued at more than $1 billion. Its class also includes Uber, the enormous ride-hailing service, and Airbnb, the home-rental start-up.Many of those companies are already awash in cash they have raised privately from mutual funds, venture capital firms and hedge funds, money that once needed to be raised on the public stock markets. But an initial offering would represent a new level of status and legitimacy, placing them on the same level as Google and Facebook.A wave of unicorns hitting the public markets would help end what has been one of the bleakest times for tech initial offerings \u2014 and I.P.O.s in general \u2014 in some time. No tech companies went public in the first three months of this year, a drought that had happened only three times since the early 1990s.Over all, just 84 companies have gone public so far this year in the United States, according to data from Renaissance Capital, down nearly 42 percent from last year.Among the problems that had bedeviled the market for new stocks was the ease with which tech companies like Uber have found cash from private investors, removing the need to go public anytime soon. The venture-backed companies that have gone public over the last 12 months have largely been smaller, lesser-known names like the communications service Twilio or the business software maker Atlassian.And public market investors like mutual funds have pushed back against the prices that start-ups have demanded, often leading to fewer of the sky-high stock debuts that Twitter and others enjoyed.But as the markets have stabilized, start-ups and their backers have again resumed discussions about splashy market debuts.\u201cIn the last three months, a number of companies have started saying that it\u2019s not all bad to be public,\u201d Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a mature company with more than $50 million in revenue, an I.P.O. is very much on your mind now.\u201dThe prospect of a huge offering has had banks racing to seize a piece of it for some time. Beyond Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, Snap has also engaged a bevy of other banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Company, Barclays and Credit Suisse \u2014 to help manage its stock sale, one of the people briefed on the matter added.At the heart of the frenzy is Snap, born in a Stanford University dorm room in 2011. The company is known for its mobile storytelling and messaging app, which lets users watch videos and send photos and messages to friends. The company also makes sunglasses called Spectacles that are equipped with a video camera.Currently, Snap would be able to file its public offering documents confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission because the company now generates less than $1 billion in annual revenue.The company may ultimately decide not to file for an offering. Yet Snap may be in a better position to go public before some other highly valued private companies because it has comparatively few regulatory concerns that would be listed as risk factors in a prospectus.Uber and Airbnb, for example, are fighting legal battles in numerous cities around the country and the world. Even though all of these battles will most likely be resolved, a long list of outstanding litigation and regulatory uncertainties could create an additional hurdle for investors.And unlike those two companies, Snap isn\u2019t based in Silicon Valley itself but in Venice, Calif., spearheading a nascent tech community in the Los Angeles area.Snap\u2019s app Snapchat was an early hit with young users who liked the fact that their messages and photos disappeared. The company was criticized for making it easier to send inappropriate photos with fewer consequences. Yet the ephemeral nature of the platform also made it seem like a more authentic way of communicating. Snapchat was an online facsimile of a casual conversation while platforms like Facebook and Instagram were the equivalent of a permanent record.Snap eventually added in tools that let users tell stories about their days and augment their selfies with stickers and masks, which the company calls filters and lenses. It also introduced channels for professionally created content from media companies like CNN and Cosmopolitan magazine.As users continued to flock to the app, a year ago Snap began to monetize its growing audience by allowing advertisers to sponsor filters and lenses and run video ads between stories produced by media companies or made up of user photos and videos.Advertisers have been keen to reach the Snapchat app\u2019s audience, which now includes 41 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 and 150 million daily users. At the moment, Snapchat is the trendiest, newest thing and advertisers want to be associated with it, Chad Stoller, executive vice president and global innovation director of IPG Mediabrands, said in an earlier interview.Snap has continued to build out content on Snapchat, the app has increasingly drawn comparisons to traditional television and is seen as an internet company that could someday draw ad dollars away from TV.This year, Snapchat is expected to generate nearly $367 million in ad revenue worldwide, according to data from the research firm eMarketer; and that figure is expected to rise to nearly $1 billion next year.For now, nearly all of Snapchat\u2019s revenue comes from the United States, according to eMarketer, but other markets should account for about a quarter of Snap\u2019s revenue by 2018.Yet for all of the service\u2019s phenomenal growth, Snapchat\u2019s parent must still demonstrate to potentially skittish stock market investors that it has a path to profitability if its offering is to soar, analysts say.\u201cInvestors aren\u2019t willing to buy growth at all costs,\u201d Kathleen Smith, a co-founder of Renaissance Capital, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cropped Out of My Own Fantasy", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byModern LoveOn my computer desktop I have a folder within a folder that\u2019s labeled (in a message to myself) \u201cDo Not Open.\u201dBig surprise: I recently opened it.It\u2019s full of adorable pictures of my ex and me that I had erased from every other location. One drew me in: a black-and-white photo of us from the trip we took to the Oregon coast for his birthday two summers earlier, just after we attended my mother\u2019s backyard wedding outside my hometown, Portland, Ore.My mouse hovered over the image, then I double-clicked to enlarge.With our elbows in the sand, we smiled as his hand caressed my left forearm, his dark hair and eyes contrasting with my light features. My right fist, mostly concealed by my black hoodie sleeve, hid half of my coy white smile.That picture had been everywhere: on Facebook (where I\u2019d made it my profile picture), in his office, on our living room wall and on his grandparents\u2019 coffee table in Iowa. It was taken about six months into our relationship, during our \u201choneymoon\u201d phase, and a lot of people had gushed to us about it, saying things like, \u201cThat\u2019s a perfect picture\u201d and \u201cYou guys are such a beautiful couple.\u201dWhat they didn\u2019t know was how ridiculously hard we had worked to get the shot right. The camera was set to timer mode, so we\u2019d press the button, rush into position and attempt to look natural for the snap. We\u2019d take one shot and then analyze the result:\u201cI look crazy.\u201d\u201cI look like an old man.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re forcing it.\u201d\u201cIs my left eye melting off my face?\u201dIt went on like that until our muscles ached from smiling and the sun went down, but with the help of some tasteful editing, the final version looked effortless and pure. And because of the timer, we may have even fooled some people into believing it wasn\u2019t a boastful selfie.I used to love telling the story of how we met. But now I don\u2019t, so I won\u2019t. What really matters is this: I failed to take seriously that he had, just a day before we began our romance, broken up with his previous long-term girlfriend.I routinely repressed thoughts that I could be the rebound girl or a placeholder for him until the real deal came along. I pushed forward, drawn to his good looks, intelligence and manners. I loved how expressive he was with his hands when he spoke.Despite the good, I always felt as if I had to prove to everyone that he and I were happy and that our relationship was legitimate, and social media helped. On Facebook, I was able to exclude the negative \u2014 a dismissive comment here, a lie there \u2014 and showcase not only how I wanted others to see us but how I wanted to see us.Sometimes he would comment on how he thought I\u2019d be happier with a \u201cPacific Northwest lumberjack type\u201d who wasn\u2019t as \u201cstrait-laced\u201d as he was. To be fair: I was the one who convinced him to grow a beard, trying, I suppose, to nudge him toward the image of the boyfriend I had imagined for myself.Almost exactly a year after the black-and-white selfie that we spent forever posing for, we got another envy-inspiring picture. This one was in color and set on a Ferris wheel on the Seattle waterfront \u2014 the Great Wheel. We road-tripped up there in August for his birthday and stayed with my cousin.We must have posed 10 times for my cousin\u2019s camera before we got the \u201cperfect\u201d photo: Puget Sound behind us in striking aquamarine, distant hills in the background. Our smiles were big and white, and my shoulder was nestled comfortably under his arm \u2014 a colorful new addition to the public exhibit of our relationship.We labored over his Facebook status to make it casual but warm, brief but heartfelt: \u201cCelebrated a great birthday week with Sage Cruser in the Seattle area!\u201d\u201cI love you, McBug,\u201d he whispered to me that night as we fell asleep.Two months later, shortly after we had moved into our second apartment, he woke up saying his stomach hurt.\u201cWas it the fajitas from last night?\u201d I asked, yawning, as I snuggled into the fluffy white covers he\u2019d thrown aside a few moments before.He sighed and sat down at the end of our bed, his head wrapped in his hands. I was grinning like an idiot with my eyes partly closed.\u201cNo.\u201dI poked my head up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d\u201cI \u2014 I can\u2019t see our future.\u201dI threw the covers back. \u201cHold on. Are we having the conversation I think we\u2019re having?\u201dHe turned to me with sad eyes and tight lips. I almost felt bad for him until I remembered that I was the one getting the boot. He was vague in his reasons for ending it, saying he\u2019d been thinking about it for six months.\u201cDid you ever love me?\u201d I asked.He paused and then stammered through an explanation. But the pause said it all.I cried from my chest in our bed, wearing an oversize T-shirt, red-faced and choking on my own spit. And then it was over.We both changed our profile pictures within two hours of the split. He changed his from a cutesy picture of us in a Portland coffee shop to a solo picture of him in a suit. I swapped out the black-and-white beach picture to one of me standing alone on the summit of a mountain in Ireland, steely-eyed, with an expression that I hoped said: \u201cI\u2019m on top of the world, and I\u2019m thriving.\u201dWith each \u201clike,\u201d I felt my ego being rebuilt, but the high wore off as I packed my things and moved into my mother\u2019s basement, which wasn\u2019t on top of anything.Family and friends were shocked. I had sharp pains in my stomach every time I thought about him. I\u2019d stare at my ceiling for hours. I was lost in confusion and feelings of betrayal and hatred. Even so, I fantasized about reconciling and having everything go back to the way it was.The following week, word got back to me that he had opened an online dating account the day after he dumped me. His profile image made my throat seize up: He had cropped me out of the Great Wheel picture, leaving his white teeth and green eyes beaming at potential future lovers and the radiant water contrasting with his dark hair. Mere inches from his head, smiling my big toothy smile, I had been sliced out of my own fantasy.Two weeks later, after the dividing of belongings, after the crying and dry-heaving and listening to Adele\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d on repeat, I received a handwritten letter from him. He included it in a package with a sports bra of mine he\u2019d discovered in the hamper, using its return as an \u201copportunity to get a few things\u201d off his chest.The letter provided the same vague explanation he\u2019d given before, confessing he still couldn\u2019t think of \u201cany specific reasons\u201d; it was \u201cjust a feeling\u201d and he still missed me \u201ca lot.\u201dI wondered what might come of a response, but I never sent one. Instead, I corrected his spelling and grammar with a red pen, finding some satisfaction in that.I wanted my perfect love to look like what I\u2019d convinced myself I had: the photos, the Facebook statuses, the beard, the narrative of our relationship I\u2019d woven in my head. I had fallen in love with the man I wanted him to be and the woman I wanted to be. I had fallen for what I thought we could be together, not the reality of who we actually were. That was a hard truth to swallow.Soon after my dive into my not-so-hidden folder, I met up with an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in over a year and a half. We took a weekend camping trip to Cannon Beach, the same place I had captured the black-and-white photo nearly two years prior.After we caught up and made a fire, she confessed she had gone through a breakup with her current boyfriend that seemed similar to my situation. Her guy had ended it abruptly when she thought everything was great, and they went a month without any communication before reconciling when he said he wanted her back.She found it uncanny that we had experienced such similar breakups but ended up in opposite spots. She raved about their newfound happiness, saying she\u2019d marry him if he were to ask.We sat quietly on the cool sand next to the crackling fire as I stared up at a yellow kite, its long tail dancing in the sky against the evening\u2019s wispy clouds.She broke our silence with a question: \u201cSay you two could be together again some day. Would you want that?\u201dI looked at her, then back up at the kite, and said, \u201cNo.\u201dTo contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Was That a Debate? Or Were the Candidates Just Trying to Go Viral?", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookA lot can change in two weeks.The session was brief, raw and surreal. People have said before that this election has hit rock bottom. This weekend, it climbed inside a steam drill, bored through the rock and headed straight for the center of the earth.You did not have to look hard to see Mr. Trump\u2019s motive. The debate took place two days after the most stunning hot-mike TV moment since Robert Durst burped out \u201cKilled them all, of course,\u201d on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Jinx.\u201dMr. Trump needed a viral moment to drown out his embarrassment from 2005. So he tried to bring back 1998.The weekend\u2019s frenzy had already recalled the first days of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Then, cable news went on red alert, political allies bolted, audiences were transfixed to see their president declaring, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d and pundits began speculating that Mr. Clinton would have to step down.Now Mr. Trump was reviving a right-wing narrative of Mrs. Clinton as enabling co-conspirator that had thrived around Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment. When a reporter asked why Mr. Trump had said he touched women without their consent, Paula Jones \u2014 whose sexual-harassment lawsuit precipitated the Lewinsky investigation \u2014 cried out: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Bill Clinton that! Go ahead and ask Hillary as well!\u201dHaving begun the weekend under fire as a man who sexually abuses women, Mr. Trump ended it accusing Mrs. Clinton of being married to one. He gave the women front-row seats at the debate \u2014 with Mr. Clinton in the crowd \u2014 counterprogramming his unscripted video scandal by staging a daytime talk-show drama.Reporters for The New York Times fact-checked the statements made by Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump during Sunday\u2019s presidential debate.That smoke-grenade overture hung a pall over the night. The candidates did not shake hands in greeting and both seemed tense. It looked as if this would be an ugly, personal debate.It was, though Mr. Trump\u2019s video and counter-accusations took up only a few minutes. To the one moderator, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, Mr. Trump denied that he had bragged about sexual assault. It was \u201clocker-room talk,\u201d he said, and anyway, ISIS was out there \u201cchopping off heads.\u201dMr. Trump mentioned his guests only briefly. Maybe they were there to rattle his opponent, maybe to rally his base. Or maybe they were a shield and a cudgel \u2014 a warning he might do anything if Mrs. Clinton brought up the video again.Mrs. Clinton was cautious-spoken, less effective than at the first debate at getting Mr. Trump to take bait and provoking him into outbursts. But she pressed attacks on his temperament and qualification when the questioners provided an opening. One asked about Islamophobia; answering another, she blamed a \u201cTrump effect\u201d for increasing bullying.Mr. Trump, meanwhile, seemed better prepared with focused answers and lines of attack. Where he spent the first debate huffing and interrupting, this time he worked in sarcastic mode and improvised, jabbing Mrs. Clinton for comparing her view of political strategy to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s: \u201cHonest Abe never lied.\u201dSome of the sharpest exchanges were with the moderators. The second moderator, Martha Raddatz of ABC, was especially assertive in keeping the candidates on time and on topic, particularly Mr. Trump. She even went beyond following up to argue with him, when he called American leaders \u201cstupid\u201d for announcing military offensives. \u201cThere are sometimes reasons the military does that,\u201d Ms. Raddatz said. \u201cPsychological warfare.\u201dNo one watching these debates needs to be reminded of psychological warfare. Last time Mrs. Clinton set up Mr. Trump by bringing up his mocking of Alicia Machado, a former winner of his Miss Universe pageant, and needled him by inviting his billionaire adversary, Mark Cuban. This time, Mr. Trump, in prosecutorial mode, showed up with his own jury box.The tactics seem driven by the same recognition: that what happens in the 90 minutes of a modern debate matters less than the conversation before and after. It\u2019s less about sustaining an argument than creating moments \u2014 generating news clips and viral memes, setting up your opponent to misstep (sometimes, as with Ms. Machado, days afterward), trying to drive the narrative.This debate offered several dark forks in the road ahead.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Least 6 Women Accuse University of Wisconsin Student of Assault", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byMADISON, Wis. \u2014 One woman told investigators that the college senior invited her this month to his apartment, where he raped her and choked her until her vision blurred.Another woman said that while she was on a second date with him in February, he pushed his fingers down her pants and into her as she tried in vain to stop him.Another woman said that after meeting him in a psychology class and chatting on Facebook, she went to his apartment, where he gripped a fistful of her hair, forced her to perform oral sex and then raped her.Only after one woman told investigators a harrowing story of hours of detainment and abuse did others contact the authorities \u2014 \u201cdozens\u201d of them, the authorities said, all \u201cwanting to speak\u201d about Mr. Cook, and apparently emboldened to do so after reading the initial accounts.According to police records, one woman told a detective, \u201cI saw the news story and was empowered by another girl being able to tell about what happened to her, that I thought I could now finally tell.\u201dProsecutors in Dane County formally charged Mr. Cook on Thursday, describing him as a serial sexual predator who targeted fellow college students for brutal assaults.Mr. Cook, who pleaded not guilty, was charged with 14 felonies and one misdemeanor. He is accused of assaulting five of the women who have come forward, from March 2015 to earlier this month. Charges include second-degree sexual assault, false imprisonment, and strangulation and suffocation.The woman who said she was assaulted on Oct. 12 and 13 filed the initial complaint, the authorities said. When the police searched Mr. Cook\u2019s apartment, they found a black leather book in a night stand drawer with a list of women\u2019s names and details about each one, including how he had met them and what he liked about them, according to the search warrant affidavit.Standing silently in a Dane County courtroom on Thursday, Mr. Cook wore a blue jail uniform, his long brown hair flowing past his shoulders.His lawyer, Christopher Van Wagner, said that the accounts were consensual or fabricated, and that Mr. Cook had been \u201cslaughtered by the social media image of him.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to support the monster that exists in the minds of all of the people of U.W.-Madison,\u201d Mr. Van Wagner said.Mr. Cook has \u201cbeen painted as the face of evil in Madison and now across the entire nation, across the globe,\u201d Mr. Van Wagner added. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can do to tell that to the D.A. and, if necessary, to a jury.\u201dJessa Nicholson Goetz, another lawyer for Mr. Cook, said she was concerned by appeals from the authorities for other sexual assault victims to come forward.The Dane County District Attorney\u2019s Office filed a criminal complaint Thursday in the case of State of Wisconsin v. Alec Cook.\u201cFor some reason,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s because the police have stepped up and said, \u2018Can we have more people come forward?\u2019 there\u2019s been this urging for people to come and put our client\u2019s face as the face of rape culture or the face of sexual assault, and that\u2019s inaccurate and unfair.\u201dBut the accounts by the women, as recorded in the criminal complaint, show that the accusers themselves were riddled with doubts about how to characterize what they had experienced.According to the complaint, several women described the attacks as following a similar pattern: an innocent introduction at a party, at a bar or during a class, followed by the exchange of texts or Facebook messages. The women said they eventually accompanied Mr. Cook to his apartment, where they said sexual encounters began as consensual but escalated to assault. According to one woman, Mr. Cook drugged her with a liquid that made her feel disoriented; another woman said he had choked her with both hands and slapped her roughly on her back and legs.After the suspected attacks, women told the police about their hesitations over pressing charges, or even identifying what had happened as assault. One woman, who did not come forward immediately, told the police that \u201cshe wanted to just forget about what had happened and just feel normal again,\u201d the complaint said.Another woman texted her brother in the immediate aftermath of her encounter with Mr. Cook, telling him that Mr. Cook had held her in a \u201cdeath grip\u201d and repeatedly yanked her backward as she tried to walk away. \u201cI dont feel like I was assaulted\u2026I dont think,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I feel very weird.\u201dOne woman said she had continued to see Mr. Cook around campus and feared him, crossing the street to avoid running into him. She \u201cexpressed regret for not coming forward earlier,\u201d the complaint said.Mr. Cook, a native of Edina, Minn., a suburb of the Twin Cities, is a student in the university\u2019s business school, majoring in real estate and land economics, and a member of a club rugby team, a spokesman for the University of Wisconsin said. He wrote in his senior biography from high school that he liked skateboards and planned to attend Wisconsin and, later, Yale University \u201cto become an astronaut.\u201d\u201cI hope to become the first man to grow AstroTurf in space,\u201d he wrote. Calls to his parents in Minnesota were not returned.Mr. Cook remains a student at the University of Wisconsin, but was placed under \u201cemergency suspension,\u201d often a precursor to additional disciplinary action, and has been barred from campus. According to his LinkedIn page, Mr. Cook was an employee at Wando\u2019s, a bar on campus known for serving mixed drinks in fishbowls.University officials said they were taking the allegations seriously. \u201cSexual violence is unacceptable in our campus and community,\u201d Lori Berquam, the dean of students, said in a statement, adding that she was committed to ensuring students\u2019 safety.Mr. Cook lived in a studio apartment in a 10-story building in downtown Madison, a block off fraternity row. According to an email sent by the landlord to other residents, he no longer lives there.Residents said he looked like a typical college student, but his behavior unnerved some who encountered him in the building and on campus.One woman, a 23-year-old psychology student, said she shared several mutual friends with Mr. Cook, who worked in a laboratory in the department. Even before the charges were filed, \u201cthere were stories going around about how bad and inappropriate his behavior was and how he was always asking women to go out,\u201d she said.Morgan Sass, 21, who lived on the same floor in his apartment building, recalled encountering him last month as she entered the elevator and he was leaving it.\u201cI felt very uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was asking, \u2018What room do you live in? I\u2019m not trying to be creepy,\u2019 but he really was being creepy.\u201d She said she had made a point of not telling Mr. Cook her apartment number.David Callender reported from Madison, and Julie Bosman from Chicago.Advertisement"}

Ochs bought The New York Times, the Ochs-Sulzberger family has controlled the newspaper. It led the company through two world wars, the publication of the Pentagon Papers, labor strife and severe financial challenges, striving to maintain the paper\u2019s importance even as new forms of media threatened to overtake it.\u201cThe Times,\u201d Arthur Hays Sulzberger said in 1963 when he named his son publisher, \u201cis a family enterprise.\u201dOn Wednesday, The Times continued that tradition, naming Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, a member of the fifth generation of the family, the deputy publisher. The appointment positions him to succeed his father as publisher and chairman of The New York Times Company.The selection of Mr. Sulzberger, 36, comes at a crucial moment for The Times, converging with a shake-up in the newsroom leadership and the impending release of the so-called 2020 Report, a blueprint for reconfiguring the company for a digital and mobile future. Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, is reviewing a draft of the report and is expected to release it in some form in a matter of weeks.At the same time, a downsizing of the newsroom looms early next year, stirring anxiety among employees, who are already being instructed to embrace changes in the pace, tone and form of The Times\u2019s journalism.The competition for the deputy publisher position was closely watched in the newsroom, and the fact that the selection came earlier than expected \u2014 the company had said it would happen by next May \u2014 will most likely be interpreted as further evidence that the pace of change is quickening.Mr. Sulzberger, the son of Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who took over as publisher in 1992, was one of three candidates, all cousins. The others were Sam Dolnick, 35, who oversees many initiatives at The Times, including some in virtual reality and podcasts; and David Perpich, 39, who works on the business side and helped put in place The Times\u2019s paywall and other subscription products.The family trustees and the Times Company\u2019s board approved the appointment after a recommendation from a seven-member committee, which was formed as part of a formal selection process. The committee met about a dozen times beginning earlier this year, and its members interviewed the candidates, each of whom submitted two written memos.In previous succession choices, there was tension in the family over the perception that sons in the Sulzberger line held an advantage, and the committee\u2019s work was intended to ensure an even playing field for all family members.Still, Mr. Sulzberger was widely considered the front-runner by employees in the newsroom, in part because he led the team that drafted The Times\u2019s \u201cinnovation report\u201d in 2014 which laid the groundwork for the company\u2019s digital transformation and was read in the industry as a guide for sweeping change.He has also been a national desk reporter and a reporter and editor on the metro desk, and has worked with leaders on the business side on newsroom strategy.He was informed of his selection Tuesday afternoon by members of the committee, including Mark Thompson, the Times Company\u2019s chief executive and a member of the board. The trustees and the board, Mr. Thompson said, came to a quick and unanimous decision on the committee\u2019s recommendation.\u201cA. G. brings a compelling combination of journalistic experience, genuine strategic insight and a sense of urgency about the need for change and development in the company,\u201d Mr. Thompson said.The company celebrated the announcement in a fashion befitting of Mr. Sulzberger, who is known in the newsroom for his reserved and measured demeanor. The most ostentatious display of congratulations was a short gathering at 4 p.m. in the newsroom when, before a spread of cupcakes, Mr. Sulzberger, dressed in a dark suit instead of his trademark jeans, quietly addressed the staff.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Sulzberger said he intended to bring a reporter\u2019s sensibility to his new role \u2014 by asking questions and listening to others.Asked how he might be different from his father, Mr. Sulzberger said, \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s worked with me knows I\u2019m very much my own man, but I think this is going to be a period of figuring out the answer to that question: What am I going to uniquely bring to this job?\u2019\u2019Mr. Dolnick and Mr. Perpich already have senior roles in the company, and Mr. Thompson said, \u201cWe see all three of these family members as having a continuing major contribution to make to the company.\u201dThe New York Times Company, with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion, is not a large public company, and the Sulzberger family controls its voting shares. But as one of the few national newspapers, it has outsize importance in shaping public discourse.It is also a company transformed. In the last several years, it has divested itself of many assets, including The Boston Globe and About.com, to focus on its core mission \u2014 The Times\u2019s journalism. More recently, it has started to pursue an aggressive global expansion to increase its digital revenue outside the United States.It has also expanded its digital repertoire, focusing more on graphics, photographs and videos, and has looked to reach a broader audience by, for example, producing live videos for Facebook.Still, as print advertising erodes and competition increases from other sources of news like Facebook, the company\u2019s challenges have become ever more pressing. The Times is scheduled to release its third-quarter earnings on Nov. 2, which investors and the media industry are likely to scrutinize to see whether new sources of revenue can offset declines in areas like print advertising.\u201cThere\u2019s no question that there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on that represents we\u2019re at a real moment and an inflection point for The New York Times,\u201d Mr. Baquet said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we\u2019re in the middle of some really thoughtful discussions about how to manage it, how to handle it.\u201dThe elder Mr. Sulzberger said the deputy publisher announcement was not tied to any single event, or a specific challenge.\u201cThis timing is designed to give us a real path so that the deputy publisher can learn and grow in that responsibility and take on new responsibilities,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cI gave myself a window that I knew was longer than the window I needed, so it wouldn\u2019t be tick, tick, tick at the last minute.\u2019\u2019It is unclear how long the younger Mr. Sulzberger will serve as deputy, and his father said there was no specific time frame for him to take over.The publisher of The Times, who oversees all editorial aspects of the company and is regarded as its guarantor and public face, has traditionally come from one line of the Sulzberger family. \u201cThe glorious thing about this family,\u201d said Alex S. Jones, a former media reporter for The New York Times and a co-author of \u201cThe Trust,\u201d about the Sulzberger family, \u201cis they really do consider themselves stewards of this enterprise.\u201dBut when Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, known as Punch, appointed his son, Arthur Jr., publisher in 1992, members from other branches of the family were frustrated by the sense that Sulzberger sons were favored in the process.That prompted a meticulous development plan this time around, one that the elder Mr. Sulzberger largely witnessed from the sidelines. He was not on the selection committee and did not review the candidates\u2019 memos. Though he was informed of the recommendation late last week, he did not tell his son over the weekend.As part of the process, the company also took pains to ensure that the candidates got a breadth of experience, and it tracked their progress closely.Carolyn Ryan, who now supervises the paper\u2019s politics coverage, recalls that as metro editor she prepared detailed reports on both Mr. Dolnick and A. G. Sulzberger when they worked for her, focusing on qualities like leadership potential. Jason Stallman, the Times sports editor, also prepared detailed reports on Mr. Dolnick when he served as the deputy department head.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that we could tell people this was a good process and it was well thought-out, it took into account the things that needed to be and it was not precooked,\u201d said Michael Golden, the vice chairman of The Times, who was on the selection committee.He added: \u201cI think we\u2019ve managed it well, and I think the family is pleased with the process.\u201dBy all accounts, the competition for the job was cordial. The cousins have known one another since childhood and their families are friendly. They grew up together professionally, huddled in glass-walled meeting rooms to discuss strategy and proceeded through the selection process with mutual respect.\u201cI really do believe that those three guys have the best interests of the place in their hearts,\u201d said Sam Sifton, The Times\u2019s food editor, who has worked with all three cousins.Editors, reporters and others who have worked with Mr. Sulzberger say he is reserved but insightful and calm under pressure.\u201cI\u2019m not someone who seeks the spotlight,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m not someone who loves the spotlight. But I\u2019m someone with strong views about what this place needs to do to succeed.\u201dHe said that he was willing \u201cto push this place when I think it needs to be pushed, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable.\u2019\u2019Because Mr. Sulzberger will be working alongside his father, also named Arthur, the company said that to avoid confusion, the son would be referred to as A. G.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump Stays Afloat", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byOpinionIn one of the most emotionally wrenching presidential races in living memory, Donald J. Trump\u2019s support is as level as a pond. In polls, it is holding steady around 41 percent, right where it was after the first debate in late September. This plateau has persisted through the second and third debates with his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and the revelation of his recorded boasts of sexual assault. Even the stunning public rebuke of Mr. Trump by the parents of the Iraq war hero Capt. Humayun Khan in late July was followed by a swing of just a few percentage points, quite small by historical standards. Why has Mr. Trump\u2019s support not collapsed further in the face of some fairly damning revelations?The answer is polarization. The same forces that propel a radical candidate to a party\u2019s nomination also provide a floor through which he is unlikely to fall. Mr. Trump\u2019s ascent is the culmination of trends that began in the 1990s, when Newt Gingrich introduced the Contract With America, and adopted tactics like government shutdowns and impeachment. More than any national figure since Sarah Palin, Mr. Trump embodies these attitudes.Madison thought that even if a faction shared common motives, physical distance would make it difficult \u201cto discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.\u201d Partisan media is not new, of course \u2014 in the 1800s, the chief funding for newspapers came from political parties \u2014 but talk radio, Fox News and Breitbart can reach like-minded voters with tremendous speed. Social media intensifies the segregation of voters by providing channels of communication tailored to specific preferences. When cable news organizations often seem unwilling to call out falsehoods, wrong information can cause tremendous damage. Technology has made Madison\u2019s vast republic virtually small.Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy has revolved almost entirely around emotionally powerful issues like race, immigration and anti-Muslim sentiment. The more you feel a decision in your gut, the less likely it is that you will change your mind. White nationalists think white nationalism is great, but others are repelled. And in a Raycom/Mason-Dixon poll of the Louisiana Senate race, supporters of the white supremacist David Duke favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton by a margin of 81 percent to 6 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Facts or Mine?", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byThe next time I opened Facebook, another Nation in Distress post showed up at the top of my news feed \u2014 this time with a story about how the size of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign plane HUMILIATED the Clinton plane. (Dr. Freud was unavailable for comment.)\u201cThe idea that it is a fact-checked story is designed to say to you that it is objective and analytically fair, and all it is a vehicle for them to do opinion journalism under the guise of fairness, which if you fall for it, gives it even more power,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh told his listeners.Daniel Dale is the Toronto Star\u2019s Washington correspondent, and since last September, he has fact-checked as many of Mr. Trump\u2019s statements as he can. It\u2019s a daunting task, what he calls \u201can unprecedented daily avalanche of falseness.\u201d\u201cShoehorning him into a normal coverage pattern conveys the impression that he is a normal political liar,\u201d he said. \u201cHe requires something different.\u201dDuring the debates, Mr. Dale fact-checked both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, and found that, over the course of the debates, Mr. Trump made 104 false claims, while Mrs. Clinton made 13 false claims.He has seen a lot of interest \u2014 his list of fact-checks, which he tweets out daily, regularly get more than 1,000 retweets \u2014 but also a lot of animosity.\u201cOn the positive side: Nothing I\u2019ve ever done has been this popular online,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the negative side: Nothing I\u2019ve ever done has so infuriated people.\u201dMany people will be doing some soul-searching after this election, but perhaps no one more than conflicted conservative talk radio hosts. Charlie Sykes, a popular radio host in Milwaukee, has been candid about conservative media\u2019s complicity in the rise of Trump.A big part of the problem is not just Republicans\u2019 willingness to say untrue things, but more of a willingness to let other people in their party say crazy and untrue things without pushing back. After Mr. Trump spread a racist lie about the first African-American president, that did not stop Mitt Romney from accepting his endorsement in his 2012 race. Conservative politicians and media personalities are stuck in a double bind now, where they are too afraid of comeuppance to tell their audience the truth.Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University, said Republican elites trapped themselves by telling their supporters not to believe mainstream outlets, even though they still relied on those outlets.\u201cWhen they preached, \u2018Don\u2019t believe the mainstream media,\u2019 they were still reading The New York Times and The Washington Post every morning and using it to set their baseline for their political reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t take the advice they gave to base voters.\u201dThis criticism was bizarre \u2014 after building his campaign on a southern border wall and a \u201cdeportation force\u201d that would round up undocumented immigrants by the millions \u2014 but it was true all the same.An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Pegida, an anti-immigrant group in Germany. It is a movement, not a formal political party.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Defiance Is Seen as \u2018Colossal Mistake\u2019 That Threatens U.S. Image", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported byIt is a scene reminiscent of other countries and other times: An angry candidate defies the will of the voters and hurls venom at the democratic process. Threats of jail are issued against political opponents. There is even loose talk of armed insurrection.Diplomats and elected officials in both parties fear that Mr. Trump, if he loses, will inflict grave trauma on the electorate and severely undermine the international reputation of an American political system known for revering the peaceful transfer of power.Though he trails Hillary Clinton by a wide margin in most polls and has been abandoned by much of his own party, Mr. Trump still commands a powerful bully pulpit that he may use to amplify his unsupported claims that American democracy is a fraudulent system.\u201cWhat many if not most foreigners admire about us, about the United States, is the durability of our democracy and the fact that we alternate power,\u201d Mr. Burns said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we are fundamentally different from Russia and China, and it gives us an enormous advantage.\u201dMr. Burns, who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton for president, called Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks a flagrant violation of American democratic traditions. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a serious national leader say that since the Confederate leaders of 1860 who refused to accept the election of Lincoln,\u201d he said.William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff who was the chairman of Al Gore\u2019s campaign during the 2000 standoff in Florida, said Mr. Trump seemed indifferent to the possibility that his words might weaken trust in the American government, at home and overseas.Mr. Daley said the Gore team had been cautious not to say anything during the Florida recount that might cripple the next president\u2019s legitimacy, to the point that other Democrats criticized them for being overly cautious. Mr. Trump, he said, was taking the opposite approach.\u201cHe really has no appreciation for our history, which most of the world looks at with great admiration, as opposed to some banana republic,\u201d Mr. Daley said. On election night, Mr. Daley said, \u201che could be tweeting at 3 in the morning and trying to undercut the new administration coming in.\u201dThe United States has endured contested election results, most recently in 2000, but historians and political experts could recall no case of a presidential nominee attacking the electoral process, with no apparent instigation or factual basis, with weeks until Election Day, as Mr. Trump is doing now.It is unclear whether Mr. Trump has a concrete plan to contest the results of the election if he loses. There is no law that forces a losing candidate to concede defeat \u2014 only a bipartisan tradition of comity. But fighting the apparent outcome of a presidential race could require elaborate litigation across numerous states, with virtually no hope of success without hard evidence of extensive fraud.Mr. Trump has presented no such evidence, instead offering sweeping denunciations of the overall political process, the news media and the judicial system. His language has seemed to conjure images from the developing world and unsteady new democracies \u2014 countries like Myanmar and Nigeria, where governments have overturned election results by fiat, and political turbulence has given rise to outbreaks of violence.In the United States, modern presidential standoffs have been tense but restrained: Mr. Gore mounted an aggressive legal challenge to election results in Florida, but he conceded swiftly once the Supreme Court ruled against him. When John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960, Nixon publicly renounced his claim to the presidency even as his supporters pressed forward with recounts on the state level.Only a few presidential elections, with painfully inconclusive results, have yielded more turbulent challenges after Election Day. Two 19th-century presidents who failed to win the popular vote, John Quincy Adams and Rutherford B. Hayes, entered office battered by opponents who said they had won through corrupt means. Neither man served a second term.In American electoral history, there is only one instance of the losing side in an election simply declining to abide by the outcome, without any substantive legal objection or mathematical uncertainty around the results. That was in 1860, when Abraham Lincoln\u2019s election prompted the secession of Southern states that refused to tolerate his opposition to slavery.Despite the heated passions of Mr. Trump\u2019s political following, he appears unlikely to steer the country into civil war. Still, he has unnerved many American political leaders through what they view as his sheer recklessness.Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a prominent Republican election lawyer who represented Mr. Bush against Mr. Gore in their 2000 impasse, said Mr. Trump was taking the country into unknown territory.\u201cWhen people see a close election and exert their rights to the fullest is what we have always considered within bounds,\u201d Mr. Ginsberg said. \u201cBut saying somehow that our elections are not going to be accurate and do not adequately convey the will of the majority is different from what we have ever seen before.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign has long attracted unusual interest, and in some cases extraordinary alarm, in foreign countries. Several foreign leaders have intervened in the American election to attack his candidacy in strikingly blunt terms; Manuel Valls, the prime minister of France, declared flatly this month that his country supported Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Trump has also been endorsed by an array of hard-right leaders across Europe, and he has campaigned alongside Nigel Farage, the nationalist politician who led the charge for Britain to leave the European Union.Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on the American electoral system quickly stirred reaction from activists preoccupied with matters of international democracy and freedom. On Facebook, Shen Tong, a former leader of the Chinese pro-democracy movement who organized protests in Tiananmen Square, wrote that Mr. Trump\u2019s comments had been jarring for anyone who expected an easy \u201cnational election and peaceful transition of power in the USA every 4 years.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s \u201csuspense on his acceptance of the election result reminds me how unique this constitutional democracy has been,\u201d Mr. Shen wrote, \u201cand how much we\u2019ve taken it for granted.\u201dSomini Sengupta contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And it may take a long time to go away.With all these complaints, only Apple seems ensnared in a traditional argument with regulators.

But that\u2019s probably not why the regulators are preoccupied with Americans.It\u2019s the nature of big online businesses to seek as much data as possible, and often engage with consumers in such a way that the users share a lot about themselves in the name of fun (Facebook) and professional advantage (LinkedIn).Creating effective methods for searching for information, for using smartphones or for building applications seems to enable companies to acquire dominance more rapidly than ever. Some of that may be because of noncompetitive behavior, but it is also because of the strong network effects that benefit these companies. It\u2019s cheap and easy to distribute software online, and if people love your product, they will share and publicize it for you.Software developers using these applications may choose among other cloud providers, but having so many popular tools in A.W.S. gives it an edge; it is also known and trusted.It\u2019s a strong model.

Rulers and scissors cover tables; sketches fill bulletin boards. Shelves brim with spools of thread and hundreds of fabric rolls. Half-clothed mannequins are strewn about.\u201cThis is what we call a sequin, versus a sew-on stone, versus a hot-fix stone, versus a bead,\u201d explained the workroom supervisor, Claire Fleming.\u201cThat\u2019s an Escamillo, and that\u2019s a Carmen,\u201d she added, pointing at outfits the shop was making for an opera.The busiest time of the year for costume shops like this one is in the spring before the Tony Awards, Ms. Fleming said.She said the challenging bits made the job exciting.\u201cFor the circus, if he\u2019s in a wheel, you have to be able to figure out what fabrics will work for him,\u201d she told us.\u201cAnd the Genie from \u2018Aladdin\u2019 has all this beading,\u201d she added, \u201cbut he picks Aladdin up and spins him around, and Aladdin doesn\u2019t have a shirt on \u2014 just a vest.

I don\u2019t know how I ever manage to get myself to the office given what a \u201cdumb ass\u201d I am \u2014 a Jew, no less, and someone who soils his pants out of fear of a Trump presidency. And if you don\u2019t believe that last bit, someone using a pseudonymous Twitter account was kind enough to provide a graphic photograph of the supposed soiling, but not his or her actual name, because it\u2019s just so much easier to hurl bile while cowering behind anonymity.There\u2019s a host of possible reasons for this, including new competition, failure to adapt to fast-changing media habits and an \u201copen mike\u201d quality that some potential users may find intimidating.But you have to wonder whether the cap on Twitter\u2019s growth is tied more to that most basic \u2014 and base \u2014 of human emotions: hatred.It\u2019s a lamentable turn that Twitter says it is urgently working to address.The back-and-forth over his candidacy, and the news media\u2019s coverage of it, have added a new cache of material to the uglier side of Twitter\u2019s oeuvre.More often than not, the venom comes from pseudonymous accounts \u2014 the white hoods of our time.Just take a gander at @Bridget62945958, who published a series of anti-Semitic posts against my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum. One message showed a series of lampshades. Its caption read: \u201cThis is your family when Trump wins. Get your Israeli passport ready.\u201dMr. Goldberg says he is torn about what Twitter should do, given that its cause \u2014 openness and free speech \u2014 is a reason he and so many other journalists are drawn to the service. \u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental problem,\u201d he told me. \u201cAt a certain point I\u2019d rather take myself off the platform where the speech has become so offensive than advocate for the suppression of that speech.\u201dAfter a user who identified herself as Kathleen posted a tweet criticizing the Trump campaign, a Twitter member going by Adorable Deplorable directed a message back at her featuring a photograph of a beheaded man \u2014 apparently an ISIS victim \u2014 and the words, \u201cYour [sic] heading for a deep hole.\u201dBut the openness of Twitter, and the sheer speed and volume of information that moves through it, present a particularly hard challenge that executives there say they are rushing to meet.\u201cEveryone on Twitter should feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs,\u201d the company said in a statement it sent me on Saturday. \u201cBut behavior that harasses, intimidates or uses fear to silence another person\u2019s voice should have no place on our platform.\u201dIn a letter to shareholders, Mr. Dorsey said the company was putting in place technology enabling it to more readily detect abusive accounts, make it easier for users to report them and even prevent them in the first place.In an interview, Mr. Johnson said he respected Twitter\u2019s right to ban patently offensive speech but argued that it needed to set a consistent, uniformly applied standard. Still, he said, \u201cthe problem of trolls\u201d might be unsolvable.\u201cIt might just be a human nature problem,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we don\u2019t like each other that much \u2014 and that\u2019s what Twitter has revealed.\u201dWe didn\u2019t need Twitter to reveal that. And in the previous two media revolutions \u2014 radio and television \u2014 the country managed to strike some sort of accommodation between the right to free speech and the greater civic good.That happened because there was an immediate national recognition that these media could have tremendous power to shape culture, politics and government for good and for ill.There was no similarly robust discussion at the start of this, the latest media revolution, and we can only hope that the political mistrust isn\u2019t so great that we can\u2019t have a constructive one now.Each new media development has served as a mirror for the society that spawned it.

The Justice Department and California\u2019s attorney general are also investigating the bank.In interviews and lawsuits, Wells Fargo employees have described in vivid detail some of the predatory practices they saw.The California Department of Justice is investigating Wells Fargo, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, over the unauthorized accounts the bank opened in its customers\u2019 names.In California, it was people with identification cards issued by Mexican consulates. The absence of a Social Security number made it simpler for Wells Fargo employees to open fraudulent accounts in those customers\u2019 names. Wells Fargo is one of the few major banks to permit accounts to be opened without Social Security numbers.And in Illinois, one former teller described watching in frustration as older customers fell prey.\u201cWe had customers of all ages, but the elderly ones would at times be targeted, because they don\u2019t ask many questions about fees and such,\u201d Brandi Baker, who worked at a branch in Galesburg, Ill., said in an interview.When Mr. Stumpf testified before members of Congress \u2014 once in the Senate and once in the House \u2014 he was pressed hard on whether any demographic group had been disproportionately affected.

Of the two million potentially unauthorized accounts the bank uncovered in its internal review, the affected customers \u201cskewed to younger people, not older people,\u201d he told the House Financial Services Committee.In the Los Angeles area, for instance, college campuses were considered prime spots for employees seeking to rack up new accounts because younger customers had a tendency to trust a banker\u2019s advice.Athena McDaniel-Watkins, a former teller who worked in and around Los Angeles, said a banker she worked with would take stacks of forms with him on campus visits and encourage busy students to sign the blank papers \u2014 he would fill them out later, he told the students.\u201cSo the customer essentially handed the banker a blank check,\u201d Ms. McDaniel-Watkins said. \u201cThe banker was then able to list as many accounts under that application as he wanted \u2014 or, in many cases, as many as he needed to hit sales goals for that day.\u201dSteven Curtis, who also worked at several Wells Fargo branches in the Los Angeles area, said that when college students showed up asking for overdraft fees to be waived, bankers would sometimes tell them they could do so only by closing their account and opening a batch of new ones.If customers complained, Wells Fargo employees advised them \u201cto ignore the unauthorized fees and letters from collection agencies because the lack of a Social Security number means the debt will not affect them,\u201d the lawsuit said.\u201cWe are confident that these important steps put us on the right path to better helping our customers,\u201d said Richele J. Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman. \u201cWe will continue to work hard to restore our customers\u2019 faith and regain the public\u2019s trust.\u201dCurrent and former Wells Fargo employees say the problems continued well into this year.Ashlie Storms, a former banker at a Wells Fargo branch in West Milford, N.J., said she quit her job in August, soon after learning that a banker at another branch had manipulated the accounts of one of Ms. Storms\u2019s regular customers, an older woman with memory issues.The woman had come to deposit a large check, only to have the banker use it to open new checking and savings accounts without her approval. The next day, the customer and her daughters arrived at Ms. Storms\u2019s branch, confused about where her money had gone and why she could not gain access to it.\u201cWhat should have been a five-minute conversation turned into a three-hour complaint to corporate from the customer about the actions this banker decided to take without the customer\u2019s consent,\u201d Ms. Storms said. \u201cThe banker was a top producer for our region, always receiving recognition from management for her sales.\u201dThe dynamics varied from branch to branch, former employees said in interviews. There was no systematic corporate policy or ethos of targeting specific groups of customers.\u201cBankers wanted the quickest, easiest sale \u2014 the low-hanging fruit,\u201d said Mr. Pham, the former Wells Fargo banker in San Jose. \u201cThe extreme pressure forced people into it.\u201dIn some places, demographic patterns created distinct openings.In the Phoenix area, managers gleefully looked forward to the days when the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community made its quarterly per capita distribution payments, said Mr. Hansen, the former branch manager in Scottsdale.Members of the Native American community would head straight to the bank with their checks, and employees would encourage them to use the money to open new accounts. Sometimes it was on the up and up: Mr. Hansen said that he looked forward to being able to open several dozen new accounts in one day but that he always tried to match customers with products that fit their needs.Others did not. Mr. Hansen learned that one enterprising branch manager had invented \u201cper capita day packages,\u201d jammed with five or more bank accounts. Customers would be told that they needed separate accounts for such purposes as traveling, grocery shopping and saving for an emergency.\u201cThey would deposit their money and get hit with fees like crazy, because they got confused about what account they were using,\u201d Mr. Hansen said. \u201cThey would use the wrong debit card and overdraw their travel account, and then when they came back three months later, they would lose hundreds of dollars from their next check paying off those fees.\u201dSome people are not waiting until then.Michael Masterson, who lives in Concord, Calif., posted on the group\u2019s Facebook page about refinancing his mortgage this week to move it away from Wells Fargo.\u201cThis was an action I took as an individual looking to sever ties with what I regard as a dishonest financial institution,\u201d he said by email.Advertisement"}

Wearing colorful dresses, the girls listened to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo speak from behind a table, flanked by his ministers.\u201cWe can imagine what they\u2019ve gone through,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much needs to be done to get them back to living a normal life after so much trauma in captivity.\u201dMr. Osinbajo described the girls as being in \u201creasonably good health considering the circumstances they\u2019ve been held in.\u201d He added that they would stay in a medical facility \u201cfor some time, until we\u2019re reasonably satisfied of their health condition.\u201dAs for the other girls held by Boko Haram, Mr. Osinbajo suggested that \u201cin the next few days, the next few months, we should be able to bring in more of these girls, along the same lines, using exactly the same negotiations.\u201dBut he warned that the government, which is waging an aggressive campaign to fight Boko Haram and regain territory seized by the group, had the fate of the nation to consider as well.\u201cWe want to ensure that we bring these girls back alive,\u201d Mr. Osinbajo said. \u201cAt the same time we, of course, balance this against the overall safety and security of the country.\u201dRelatives of the girls rejoiced, even before they knew whether their kin were among those freed.Lawan Zanna, the father of Aisha Zanna, one of the abducted girls, said by telephone that he hoped his daughter had been freed. All of the parents are \u201cvery happy hearing that they have released our daughters,\u201d he said. \u201cAll are our daughters.\u201dAnother parent, Esther Yakubu, said by telephone that she was praying that her daughter Dorcas was among those released. \u201cThey say it\u2019s only 21,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them are still out there, and we want them to come back.\u2019\u2019Manasseh Allen, a native of Chibok whose cousin was abducted, said in a phone interview that he hoped more girls could be rescued. \u201cOnce we have 21 parents now linked up with daughters, at least we have solved a good part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many will be hopeful that their daughters have been brought back.\u201dAsked if he thought a ransom was involved, he said: \u201cWhether it\u2019s a ransom, whether it\u2019s a prisoner swap, the government knows how best to get these girls back. All we are after is to get the girls back.\u201dEarlier in the day, Lai Mohammed, the minister of information and culture, denied preliminary reports that Boko Haram fighters might have been released in exchange for the girls.\u201cPlease note that this is not a swap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a release, the product of painstaking negotiations and trust on both sides. We see this as a credible first step in the eventual release of all the Chibok girls in captivity.\u201dWestern intelligence officials have said they believe the girls are scattered in small groups, another hurdle to rescuing them.The Nigerian military, with help from troops from neighboring nations and from the United States, Britain and France, has made big advances against Boko Haram in recent months. But it has had trouble holding towns once liberated from Boko Haram control, and Boko Haram fighters have also taken the fight to neighboring countries like Niger.Chris Stein reported from Lagos.

Perhaps the most ephemeral of social media channels, Snapchat, is being used to pair pop lyrics with images of centuries-old paintings or artifacts. The images last on a device for up to 10 seconds.This emoji-oriented app, aimed at millennials and teenagers, is bringing a prominent collection front and center for a new generation. \u201cOur strategy is to appeal to the younger audience to get the word out there about Lacma,\u201d Lucy Redoglia, the museum\u2019s social media manager, said, using the museum\u2019s acronym. \u201cThese are people who may not be interested in art right away, but might find a connection through something that we post.\u201d\u201cInstagram, Twitter, Snapchat are the primary way that people in my generation interact socially,\u201d Ms. Fei said, so having a presence on the channels is important in reaching them.Like those at the Los Angeles museum, in recent years social media managers at institutions around the world have been reaching out to audiences via witty posts on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. They\u2019re delivering quirky, educated content to capture new audiences with short video gallery tours led by a curator or a guest on camera on Facebook Live, or via Instagram real-time feeds, Twitter chats and more.The Los Angeles museum, however, may be the winner in seizing the imagination of a youthful demographic. It was the first major museum to join Snapchat, in 2014, and its profile has more than 220,000 followers and roughly 85,000 views per snap. Snapchat continues to skew young, with 46.8 percent of its users between the ages of 18 and 24 as of last December.The museum has a strong presence on other channels. Last year it gained 500,000 followers (it now has nearly two million across all of its platforms), reaching more than 89 million viewers, Ms. Redoglia said. On Facebook, more than one million users stop by the museum\u2019s page weekly. Some posts have reached over three million people \u2014 far exceeding the 1.4 million visitors who go to the museum each year.Reservations rolled in. For availability, a guest had to tap into Facebook, then book at Airbnb. \u201cWe made Facebook our focal point,\u201d Mr. Sexton said, \u201cand we used social media to highlight aspects of the Airbnb room that also highlighted aspects of the exhibition.\u201d It worked. More than 433,620 people came to the show, making it the most popular one in more than 15 years.But a younger audience is not the only target. \u201cInitially, we were trying to reach out to younger audiences on Facebook and other platforms, but over the years, the platforms have broadened in terms of their demographics and diversity,\u201d Mr. Sexton said. \u201cSome of our Facebook followers are easily in their 80s.\u201dThe social media learning curve is ever-changing \u2014 a good thing for museums, which have long been thought of as set in their ways and stodgy. \u201cThere\u2019s no rule book for social media, and that\u2019s exciting,\u201d Ms. Fei said.Because of an editing error, a caption last Sunday with an article about institutions that are using social media to reach younger and global audiences carried an erroneous credit for a picture of \u201cThe Bedroom\u201d by Vincent Van Gogh and for a picture of a recreation of it.

{"Headline": "Why Israel Still Refuses to Choose", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byTEL AVIV \u2014 There is agreement on very little in the fractious Holy Land, but on one issue there is near unanimity these days: A two-state resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is more distant than ever, so unimaginable that it appears little more than an illusion sustained by lazy thinking, interest in the status quo or plain exhaustion.Greater Israel is what Israelis know; the smaller Israel west of the Green Line that emerged from the 1947-49 war of independence is a fading memory. The right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with its contempt for Palestinians and dissenting voices in general, prefers things that way, as the steady expansion of settlements demonstrates. The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, has lost the legitimacy, the cohesion and the will to do much about it. The cancellation of municipal elections in the West Bank and Gaza that had been set for this month was another sign of paralyzing Palestinian infighting.\u201cTwo states are not achievable in the foreseeable future,\u201d the former Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, told me. \u201cIt has become a process about a process, and not real.\u201dThe Obama administration has reached a point of acute exasperation. The Israeli announcement this month of a new West Bank settlement was the final straw, coming just weeks after the United States concluded a $38 billion, 10-year military aid deal. Israel\u2019s explanation that the settlement was a \u201csatellite\u201d of another did not wash; its actions were viewed as egregious. Seldom has Moshe Dayan\u2019s old dictum \u2014 \u201cOur American friends offer us money, arms and advice. We take the money, we take the arms, and we decline the advice\u201d \u2014 been more vividly illustrated. Yet it\u2019s uncertain if the United States is prepared to calibrate its ironclad support in order to pressure Israel into change.Within Israel, where Netanyahu has now amassed more than a decade in power, the political and cultural drift is toward ever more assertive and intolerant nationalism. Criticism is increasingly equated with treason. Groups like B\u2019Tselem, which focuses on allegations of human rights violations against Palestinians in Israeli-occupied territories, are under withering attack. The Messianic religious Zionism that holds all the West Bank to be Israel\u2019s by biblical decree is ascendant. The left is in feeble disarray.It is sobering to note that Netanyahu probably represents the more moderate wing of his government. The most credible challenge to him may eventually come from his own spot on the political spectrum, the center-right, in the form of the telegenic Yair Lapid, who told me that Netanyahu \u201cwon\u2019t merit even a page in Israeli history books.\u201d Lapid believes he can conjure up some two-state magic, but he began his first political campaign in the large settlement of Ariel, and the notion that he can reverse the settler movement seems far-fetched.I drove down to Ramallah, through a clogged checkpoint, always a startling transition from the efficient developed-world hum of Israel to the dust and haphazardness of the West Bank. On the way, I stopped to see Walid Batrawi, the director of BBC Media Action, a charity that mentors journalists and promotes an independent press. He was despondent, describing a \u201clack of confidence and faith in anything.\u201d Palestinian statehood was \u201cmore distant than ever.\u201d Abbas was distracted, he suggested, embroiled in the conflicts of his Fatah party, worried about Hamas, providing no direction. \u201cSomething has been lost,\u201d he said. \u201cA special feeling of patriotism, of belonging, is vanishing.\u201dIn Ramallah, I heard similar sentiments, talk of a more individualistic Palestinian society, with less sense of community, where people were focused on taking care of themselves and doing the best they could with the current situation. Two states had become a bad joke. Young people had more faith in nonviolent resistance leading eventually to equal rights within a single state than in yet another aborted international peace initiative or aborted uprising.Palestinians \u2014 whether in Israel proper, where the 1.5 million Arab citizens make up about 17 percent of a population of 8.5 million, or in the West Bank, where they number about 2.6 million \u2014 are tired of the humiliations, big and small, that Israel dishes out. How, they wonder, can anything resembling a state ever be fashioned from their countless little self-administering enclaves on the West Bank broken up by Israeli settlements?In a sense, then, Israel has won. David Ben-Gurion was right when he observed in 1949 that, \u201cWhen the matter is dragged out \u2014 it brings us benefits.\u201d Policy since then has been pretty consistent: Create facts on the ground; break the Arabs\u2019 will through force; push for as much of the biblical Land of Israel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River as possible.If the maximalist camp was tempered, it was chiefly through the knowledge that with all the land came people, specifically millions more Palestinians, and a 50-50 state was not what the Zionist dream was about. Hence Israel\u2019s improvised 49-year occupation \u2014 in effect dominion over Palestinians without enfranchisement of Palestinians. Hence, too, the periodic stabs at a two-state peace, most conspicuously the Oslo accords of 1993: Running the lives of subjugated others is exhausting, corrupting and inherently violent, as well as incompatible with a true democracy.Back in Tel Aviv, I had dinner with Gil Friedlander. He\u2019s an Israeli patriot who served in the air force for many years, before creating and selling a tech company. But his country, so dynamic on the economic front, fertile soil for start-ups, finds itself at a terrible political impasse.\u201cThe great victorious war of 1967 had an impact that is eating us from the inside,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would be more than happy to get out of the West Bank and East Jerusalem and build a country with a morality I believe in. I will fight for peace, but I will not fight to maintain the status quo.\u201d He described feeling more and more confined, living in \u201csmaller and smaller areas where I find people who think like me,\u201d and feeling a stranger in the Jerusalem where he grew up.I have long been a strong advocate of a two-state outcome myself. But there is no point beating a dead horse. It is time for incremental steps instead. Israel could find lots of ways to ease humiliations and economic hardship for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, without compromising its security. It could take down some roadblocks, curtail the formalities for movement in and out of Gaza, and grant more building permits in the West Bank, as it just has in quietly authorizing some Palestinian development plans in West Bank areas under exclusive Israeli control. It could even, without saying so, stop settlement expansion.The worst thing would be for Western leaders to come up with some new \u201cpeace initiative\u201d that would offer a convenient diversion from political responsibility. Netanyahu will one day have to tell Israelis if he wants a big binational state or a smaller Jewish-majority state side by side with a Palestinian state. He is trying his best to avoid making the choice, keeping millions of Palestinians in limbo; the West helps him with a \u201cpeace process\u201d that goes nowhere. Abbas also owes his people clarity and accountability \u2014 as well as a political destination. He is marking time.After the election but before he leaves office, President Obama may present America\u2019s principles for a two-state outcome in a Security Council resolution that sets out how Israel and Palestine would look in their \u201cfinal status.\u201d Israel is strongly opposed. That is the best reason for doing it. As long as Israel has a blank check from Washington and an effective Security Council veto through the United States, nothing will change. And something has to.Israel is now a modern society. Its per capita income is higher than Spain\u2019s. But behind the sheen of economic success, the shadow of undefined borders and violence always lurks. I was a guest at a dinner on a penthouse terrace hosted by a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and attended by a former head of military intelligence, a tough Israeli lawyer and an Arab Israeli couple with a high-tech neuroscience business, among other luminaries. Tensions rose.Reem Younis, one of the Arab entrepreneurs, was saying that the father of her husband, Imad, in his will had identified property lost to Israel in 1948 that his sons might try to recover, whereupon an Israeli woman, alluding to property her family had lost in Austria in the Holocaust, said, \u201cYou have to move forward, you cannot go back.\u201d Whereupon the lawyer pressed the Younises, demanding to know if they saw themselves as Israelis, or Palestinians, or Muslims, or Arabs, or what.\u201cYou cannot force me to choose!\u201d Imad Younis exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m an Israeli. I\u2019m a Palestinian. I\u2019m an Arab. I\u2019m a Christian, as it happens. I am all of these identities. I identify with the people in what amounts to an Israeli prison in Jenin or Nablus on the West Bank.\u201dReem said, \u201cI can tell you this, on the day that I say I\u2019m an Israeli, we should all be very proud.\u201dThat solemn little sentence, with its implicit admonition to Israel to extend equal rights to all its citizens, induced a solemn little silence.A few days later, I went to see the couple at the headquarters of their company, Alpha Omega, in Nazareth. Theirs is an inspiring story \u2014 an Arab couple in Israel who sold a car and four gold coins to start a business that now employs 65 people and is a world leader in machinery and software for helping surgeons navigate the brain. Such Arab start-ups have been rare.\u201cHow can you feel equal when you are not?\u201d Reem said, mentioning that she had found it impossible to buy a house in a nearby town because she is an Arab. \u201cIsrael needs to be democratic more than Jewish.\u201dImad believes the personal trumps the political. \u201cOne state or two states? Who cares?\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat matters is human dignity and equality under the same law. Palestinian kids want to live well. That\u2019s what they want.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That star power helped make sure that the black shirts on millionaire athletes preparing for their game inside the arena would get as much notice as the black shirts on the protesters behind the police barricades outside, serving as a reminder that few places in New York could hold at a remove what was happening in the streets.I was at that game and watched James go through his warm-ups. He has never been a particularly expressive player; he mostly sets his face in a look of mild annoyance. That night in Brooklyn, he walked from spot to spot on the court, hoisting jump shots and corralling rebounds, moving with his odd mix of fidgety energy and grace, so that everything related to game play seems to unfold slowly while anything extraneous \u2014 slapping fives with teammates, drumming his feet on the floor as he sits on the bench \u2014 moves fitfully. The juxtaposition of an athlete going about his work and the confrontational clarity of \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d disproved the popular lie that a superstar can\u2019t play ball and have an opinion at the same time. A movement\u2019s slogan and a famous body had merged into a singular emblem, and when James put on a show after halftime by scoring nine points (just before the royal couple finally took their seats), there was no way to separate his athletic spectacle from his politics. He had, in effect, remade his own brand.In the nearly two months that have passed since Colin Kaepernick started kneeling for the national anthem, the method and impact of athletes\u2019 protests have evolved. Gestures, however solemn and sincere, now require an antagonistic directness that translates easily to television or social media. To hold the public\u2019s attention, it\u2019s no longer enough for the Seattle Seahawks to link arms and make a video about \u201cunity\u201d or for Cam Newton to wear a T-shirt printed with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. (\u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere\u201d) and mutter his way through a speech about the need for everyone to be accountable for themselves, regardless of race, gender or age. (Newton, who in the past rarely acknowledged the antipathy his touchdown celebrations provoked among many stodgy fans, might have finally accepted the counsel of Frank Luntz, the right-wing consultant reportedly hired by the Panthers to work with him.)You could show a photo of Kaepernick\u2019s protest to someone who has never seen a football game or heard the national anthem or has no concept of race relations in this country, and the viewer would immediately understand the dynamics at work. The person kneeling had chosen to set himself apart from the group and had done so peacefully. The pose and its meaning are easy to replicate. And now every week another football team, whether college players at the University of Nebraska, high schoolers in San Francisco, even Pee Wees in Beaumont, Tex., kneel or raise a fist during the national anthem. Over the course of two months, Kaepernick has gone from a forgotten and failing quarterback to mass-produced icon. Hundreds of Kaepernicks kneel everywhere.The images of past protests that have captivated the world \u2014 the unnamed man standing in front of the tanks in Tiananmen Square; a serene Gandhi, gaunt and hunched over during a hunger strike; Rosa Parks staring out the window of a bus in Montgomery \u2014 tend to exhibit calm, near-beatific and often solitary determination in the face of chaos and hardship. The spell Kaepernick\u2019s protest has cast over the country for the past couple of months comes in part from its fidelity to these rules of visual composition. In nearly every ceremony, whether religious or chivalrous, kneeling implies a willingness to sacrifice the body.That spirit of sacrifice might not announce itself clearly amid the overblown pageantry of a professional football field, but others who kneel with Kaepernick carry it. In late September, during a night of protests in El Cajon, Calif., following yet another police shooting of an unarmed man, two men wearing Kaepernick jerseys knelt before law-enforcement officers wearing helmets and face guards. Those earlier moments at the Barclays Center, when star athletes dressed in the clothes of protesters, became inverted, as they had in Charlotte too \u2014 the protesters now wore the athlete\u2019s shirt and copied his gesture, taking it from the playing field back onto the streets that inspired its birth.These attempts to wrangle Kaepernick back into something controlled, whose actions are considered tactically, feel ill conceived and, in the end, irrelevant. The icon of Colin Kaepernick, which now shows up on iPhone cases and T-shirts, in stadiums and protests throughout the country, has taken on its own life, one that makes the famous declaration attributed to Michael Jordan that \u201cRepublicans buy shoes, too\u201d and even LeBron James\u2019s carefully crafted entry into presidential politics feel like relics from a bygone era.Jay Caspian Kang is a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trepidation at City College in Wake of President\u2019s Abrupt Exit", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byThat was when the college\u2019s president, Lisa S. Coico, abruptly resigned, a day after The New York Times contacted officials with new questions about her administration\u2019s handling of more than $150,000 of her personal expenses \u2014 a subject that is currently being investigated by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn.Small wonder, then, that many students and faculty and staff members interviewed on campus said they felt discombobulated by the torrent of troubling news.\u201cThere\u2019s a mood of trepidation,\u201d Ruth E. Stark, a distinguished professor of chemistry, said. \u201cOn the one hand, the handling of money has to be looked at carefully, and monitored carefully. But at the same time, I think this is a great concern about the multiplying investigations that will be enveloping us.\u201dRight now, two investigations are underway. The first is being handled by the office of Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. As part of that inquiry, additional subpoenas were issued in the last few days that, among other things, zeroed in on a memo related to Ms. Coico\u2019s expenses that some college officials believe was fabricated to mislead prosecutors. CUNY, the college\u2019s parent entity, and its Research Foundation, which manages the university\u2019s research funds, were included in the new round of subpoenas.The second investigation is an internal one for CUNY being conducted by Andrew J. Levander, a former federal prosecutor.Soon, a third could be started: William C. Thompson Jr., a former New York City comptroller who is the new chairman of CUNY\u2019s Board of Trustees, has urged the state inspector general to do a systemwide investigation of \u201call of the college foundations, alumni associations or other affiliated entities including the CUNY Research Foundation.\u201d The state provides the funding for CUNY\u2019s four-year senior colleges.Ms. Coico, who has hired a lawyer, has declined to comment.Of more immediate concern at City College, though, is the leadership vacuum. For the next few weeks, the administrator in charge will be Mary E. Driscoll, the college\u2019s new interim provost. The university\u2019s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on Oct. 26 and appoint an interim president. After that, a search will begin for a permanent replacement, with the goal of having someone in place by September.To assure nervous faculty members and others, James B. Milliken, CUNY\u2019s chancellor, visited City College\u2019s Gothic campus early Tuesday morning, when its administrative offices were open, to voice his unwavering support for, and faith in, the college. In an interview, Mr. Milliken said he was encouraged by the shared belief that the college, which has produced 10 Nobel Prize winners and illustrious alumni like the former secretary of state Colin L. Powell and Andrew S. Grove, who was the chief executive and chairman of Intel Corporation, should focus on its future.\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a transition at a leadership level of an institution, particularly one that is fairly abrupt, there is a level of anxiety,\u201d Mr. Milliken said. \u201cThat was one reason I wanted to be at City College when they opened the doors, the first day back at the office. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to ensure that they have stable, talented leadership there.\u201dMany students said they did not have much contact with Ms. Coico, and rarely saw her on campus. Yelina Espinal, a 23-year-old psychology major, said the only time she saw the former president was during freshman orientation; she is now a senior.Still, Ms. Espinal was visibly disgusted with the news about Ms. Coico, as were many other students.\u201cAll the rumors about the things she\u2019s done \u2014 it\u2019s all over Facebook,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are already upset about a lot of things on campus with the roofs leaking. Now we learn the extent that the president might be stealing? It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dStephany Baez, 30, who works full time as a waitress while enrolled at the university, said she was offended by accusations that the president was pocketing extra money on top of her generous pay and benefits package, while she herself was struggling to pay for her classes. She also voiced frustration with the facilities, saying that escalators broke down routinely and that bedbugs had recently infested the library.\u201cI\u2019m so upset about this,\u201d she said. \u201cI struggle really hard. To find out that she\u2019s being so greedy and taking advantage of students who are really having a hard time is really disheartening.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementOctober 21, 2016Mara RevkinJacob OlidortThe beginning of the Mosul Offensive earlier this week poses yet another test for the adaptability of the Islamic State, or ISIS, which has downplayed or ignored a string of territorial setbacks it has suffered in Iraq and Syria over the last year. While Mosul will be the most strategically and symbolically significant of these tests \u2014 being the site where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi pronounced himself caliph, and one of the cities in which ISIS was able to realize its caliphate-state and its most significant presence in Iraq \u2014 the liberation of the city, as well as eventually of Raqqa (ISIS\u2019s capital in Syria), will not signal a final defeat for the group. Where territorial governance was indispensable in building the group\u2019s brand over the last two years, today it is dispensable precisely because it will always be a part of the group\u2019s history and narrative.The single area in which the group has proved to be exceptional is not territorial but rhetorical. In the case of the other jihadist Syrian groups, this is not for want of trying; rather it is because of their fundamentally different aim \u2014 namely of being recognized as the only solution to the Syrian conflict. By contrast, ISIS\u2019s brand of harsh punishment, mass extortion and terrorizing of society are unsustainable as long-term governance strategies \u2014 something for which we could expect ISIS leadership to have planned.To be sure, ISIS\u2019s fight for Mosul will be long and bloody. It is perhaps the most important territorial site for its brand. However, as evinced by its simultaneous propaganda activities, we should be careful not to forget that the group pioneered social media and communications space in a way that no other jihadist group did. The Islamic State, as its name suggests, has been working toward the goal of territorial sovereignty since its predecessor, Al Qaeda in Iraq (A.Q.I.), emerged in the early 2000s.  As ISIS clings to Mosul \u2014 its last urban stronghold in Iraq \u2014 and continues to lose ground in Syria and Libya, the question motivating this debate has never been more salient.  Whether or not ISIS needs territory to survive depends on our definition of \u201csurvival.\u201d  Will it survive as an organization with a command structure, or only as an ideology?  I argue that the latter scenario is more likely.Where I disagree with Jacob is on ISIS\u2019s ability to persist as an organization in the absence of the \u201cstate\u201d on which it has so explicitly staked its claim to legitimacy.  The control and governance of territory is so integral to ISIS\u2019s brand that its loss will trigger a credibility crisis from which the group may never fully recover.  To understand why statehood is so essential to ISIS\u2019s organizational identity, we must revisit its past.  Although the internet ensures that all ideas are immortal, without the territorial caliphate on which its ideology is based, ISIS will find it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain supporters.  I do not dispute Mara\u2019s presentation of the ISIS evolution from A.Q.I., as well as her basic argument of how central the Islamic State\u2019s governance of territory \u2014 its state \u2014 has been for both boosting its support and distinguishing itself from rival jihadists. Where we differ is in how central its governance is for its brand, and how capable ISIS leadership is in reshuffling its other priorities so that it remains credible as a cause and sustainable as an organization. And yet, there may well be cadres of ISIS supporters who are drawn to the group on purely ideological grounds, believing ISIS's claim to be committed to this kind of harsh and \"pure\" brand of religion and rule. Here we would do well to avoid overstating the uniformity of those who are willing to fight on behalf of ISIS or, for that matter, shape its ideology.Seen from this perspective, my variation on Mara\u2019s assessment is that many ISIS rank-and-file will indeed desert and cut deals in the face of territorial loss. But those most likely to do so will probably be motivated more by personal well-being rather than ideological disillusionment and that it was personal reasons that likely brought them to ISIS in the first place. These, however, are arguably of little concern to the Islamic State. Rather the committed believers and the fighters \u2014 those who will persist until the bitter end, and are the most effective advocates and functionaries of the Islamic State \u2014 will stick around to help the group map and execute its survival strategy.Based on its performance so far, it is possible that ISIS's core leadership \u2014 ideologues and bureaucrats \u2014 will reconstitute in some form with their most dedicated cadres, and that they will find a way for the Islamic State to survive as an organization. The questions of who will fill the ranks of this new Islamic State organization, what messaging themes they will amplify and which they will mute, and whether they will continue seeing value in its \u201cpure Islam\u201d brand will all depend on what their leadership sees as the most effective way to gain popular support within the new local conditions once Mosul and Raqqa are liberated.\nHowever, I do want to challenge the dichotomy that Jacob sets up between true believers, who wholeheartedly subscribe to ISIS\u2019s ideology and will defend it until the bitter end, and opportunists who join only for instrumental and self-serving reasons.  During this discussion, I texted a J.F.S. fighter in Aleppo province to solicit his views on our debate.  Speaking over Whatsapp, he estimated that in recent months, hundreds of ISIS fighters \u2014 Syrians as well as foreigners \u2014 have defected and joined J.F.S. in his area of Aleppo alone.  Although J.F.S. and ISIS are enemies, J.F.S. will accept ISIS deserters who agree to undergo multiweek \u201cshariah courses,\u201d where they learn the basics of J.F.S.\u2019s ideology and the \u201cemirate\u201d that it plans to establish in Syria.  When I asked why so many ISIS fighters are switching sides to J.F.S., he answered: \u201cBecause [ISIS] are deviants and [extremists], and there is a faction among them that is prone to excessive radicalism.\u201d  As a social scientist, I know that one person's story is never dispositive, but I have heard similar reports from other sources suggesting that many of the ISIS fighters now defecting to J.F.S. once considered themselves to be \u201ctrue believers\u201d in the caliphate.  As ISIS loses ground, they see J.F.S.\u2019s \u201cemirate\u201d as the next iteration of jihadist governance in Syria. As for ISIS, I agree with Jacob that its online propaganda apparatus will outlive the inevitable collapse of its physical institutions in Iraq and Syria.  The future ISIS may look more like a crowd-sourced jihadist media platform and less like an organization with a top-down command structure. We can expect ISIS to continue and even escalate its calls for homegrown terror attacks against its Western and regional allies as it tries to distract attention from territorial and military losses on its own turf.  These attacks are often perpetrated by \u201clone wolves\u201d acting without the knowledge or support of ISIS leadership, which can then retroactively ratify attacks carried out in its name. But without territory, ISIS faces two major challenges.  But will losing Mosul hurt ISIS? "}
{"Headline": "I Fight for Your Right to Vote. But I Won\u2019t Do It Myself.", "Date": "2016-10-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorTonight, like millions of Americans, I will be glued to my television, watching the third and last presidential debate. But unlike them, and millions of others, whatever I hear tonight, I won\u2019t be taking it with me into the ballot booth. I am a major in the United States Army, and I believe it is my professional duty \u2014 and that of my fellow officers, in all branches \u2014 not to vote.To be clear, I strongly believe that officers, like all citizens, should have the right to vote. But because military officers have a special responsibility to prevent politics from dividing our troops and separating us from society, it is all the more important for us to choose not to exercise that right (this is my belief, of course, and not necessarily that of the Department of Defense or the American government).Especially when our elected officials routinely make fateful decisions about where and how we are deployed, it is vital that we maintain the constitutional division between the civilians in charge and the men and women who execute their orders. Anything that erodes that division is a threat, however small, to our democracy.The military\u2019s guidelines on voting are fuzzy. Officers, we\u2019re instructed, are encouraged to \u201ccarry out the obligations of citizenship,\u201d yet we are also strongly cautioned not to \u201cengage in partisan political activity.\u201dThis ambiguity recognizes that we have two identities: I am a citizen. But I have also sworn an oath as a commissioned military officer. One came by birth and coincidence, the other by belief and commitment. In certain circumstances, my identity as a military officer should take precedence. Voting is one of them.Friends and family often tell me I\u2019m not fulfilling my \u201cpatriotic duty,\u201d that I\u2019m \u201crobbing the electorate of an educated voter.\u201d They ask why I can\u2019t just quietly walk into a voting booth, pull the lever, and silently slip back out. What\u2019s the harm in that?The trouble is I will have exercised a personal, partisan choice, committing myself to a candidate, party and set of beliefs and policies. I would like to believe that I can separate my political and professional views, but I worry that, years from now, my decision could undermine my military judgment.This is principled abstention, a silent form of speech as serious to me as the actions of those athletes who choose not to stand for the national anthem. By not voting, I am saying as loudly as I can, as quietly as I am able, that I will never make my political preference an obstacle to the best military decisions for the defense of our nation.\u201cI am in the pay of the United States government,\u201d Gen. George S. Patton once put it. \u201cIf I vote against the administration, I am voting against my commander in chief. If I vote for the administration in office I am being bought.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not just about me, or officers individually. Militaries require rigid cohesion to function amid terrifyingly violent circumstances, and they require society\u2019s trust to fill and fund critical needs. But people are inherently prone to social tribalism and political factionalism, and so the military has adopted a deliberate nonpartisan stance to support soldier solidarity and maintain the public\u2019s trust.Unfortunately, an unacceptable number of military officers who vote in this election will publicly express their political preferences and pressure others to follow. One 2010 study found that over a quarter of military officers reported that another officer tried to influence their vote; my experience suggests this figure would be even higher today \u2014 like everyone else, officers are inundated and politicized by 24-hour news and social media. To vote, and then rely upon a culture of secrecy to prevail, is not a successful strategy in the Facebook age.Political abstention is the simple solution: With no vote, there\u2019s no need to convey partisan ideas. There\u2019s no quicker way to extinguish inflammatory political small talk than to say, \u201cI\u2019m a military officer; I don\u2019t vote.\u201dBy not voting, I am countering the alarming number of retired officers who damage the traditional political neutrality of the Profession of Arms by vociferously endorsing presidential candidates and being used as campaign props. I am recording my vote of confidence in America \u2014 after all, trust must flow two ways, and purposeful restraint affirms the faith I place in my fellow citizens with the selection of our commander in chief.These giants lived in different times, but they all agreed: Military officers shouldn\u2019t vote in national elections. As a profession, we\u2019d do well to follow their lead. I know I will.M. L. Cavanaugh is a major and Army strategist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Male Nudity Breakthrough (and Also Obama)", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byStill ProcessingPopular culture is having something of a male nudity breakthrough. In the last couple of years, there has been a surprising boomlet of penises on television and at the movies. Although it begins (barely) to catch men up to decades of topless (and bottomless) women, there\u2019s still inequality at play: The penises deemed safe enough to see tend to be white ones. Seeing a black penis is rare. So is experiencing healthy black sexuality in popular culture.A rich but grim history, which reaches back to slavery, reveals a systematic, institutional degrading of black people by white people, from farmers and politicians to entertainers. You can observe the maintenance of that system not only in the national news but also in a century\u2019s worth of American pop culture, from 1915\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d to 2015\u2019s \u201cTed 2.\u201dEventually, it hurts seeing yourself degraded this way, even if you know it\u2019s nothing new.

He is an influential, if fringe, conservative figure whose radio show, videos and websites peddle conspiracy theories to an audience of millions.Here is a brief introduction.Mr. Jones is based in Texas, where he hosts The Alex Jones Show, a nationally syndicated talk show, and runs Infowars, a website he founded that offers an angry and histrionic take on the day\u2019s news. He has been called \u201cthe most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.Mr. Jones has had several bursts of mainstream attention. In 2011 he aired an interview with Charlie Sheen that led to the actor\u2019s dismissal from the sitcom \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d Two years later he started an online petition to deport the CNN host Piers Morgan, a British citizen, from the United States because of his advocacy of gun control laws.\u201cI am here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms,\u201d he yelled. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken, we will not relinquish them. Do you understand?\u201dMr. Jones has described himself as a libertarian. Many of his views mix traditional conservative critiques of government with wild-eyed delusions about globe-spanning conspiracies. His main focus is a supposed liberal plot to seize people\u2019s guns and install a tyrannical world government.Mr. Jones enthusiastically endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s positions on immigration and terrorism and at the end of the interview the Republican candidate praised the host for his integrity. \u201cYour reputation is amazing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI will not let you down.

{"Headline": "No One Is Looking at This Headline", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "You\u2019re looking at Phil Heath, the six-time Mr. Olympia, who eats a lot of tilapia and works out in a strip-mall gym.Supported byWHEAT RIDGE, Colo. \u2014 It was a few minutes before midnight when Mr. Olympia, the top bodybuilder in the world, finished his workout at a nondescript gym in a tired strip mall. He lifted one of his 22-inch biceps and flipped the light switch, tapped the alarm panel and turned the key to lock the glass front door.He hauled out a sturdy black trunk, the kind with shiny metal edges and a buckle for a latch, and opened the trunk to his white Mercedes.\u201cMr. Olympia Phil Heath Parking Only,\u201d the sign in front of the car read. \u201cAll others will be crushed.\u201dHeath is 36. He wants 10.\u201cBarring injury, I\u2019ll smash it,\u201d Heath said during a break in his workout a bit earlier. \u201cI\u2019ll get to 10. The question is: Can I continue to be a better version of myself?\u201dHeath wriggled the trophy case into his trunk. It barely fit. He shut the lid and drove the dark, empty streets toward home.Heath looked for another athletic outlet when college ended. He found it in bodybuilding magazines and the university recreation center. Heath beefed up to a chiseled 200 pounds and soon began winning regional bodybuilding competitions.He was genetically bequeathed with good bodybuilding genes: narrow joints and long attachments for proportion and big muscle bellies for bulge. That earned him a nickname, The Gift. By 2005, he was a professional bodybuilder. In 2008, he qualified for his first Mr. Olympia. In 2011, he won it. And every one since.Now Heath is a walking muscle chart, as if lifted from the wall of biology class. He competed at the last Mr. Olympia at 248 pounds, a symmetrical knot of bulges on top of bulges in places that most men never dreamed of bulging. The bundle is cinched at a 29-inch waist.When he flexes he expands, like a rippled blowfish. The front of his thighs are something a balloon artist with too many balloons might create. His arms look like gnarled oak. His relatively narrow shoulders, once a drawback, are broad knots of deltoids and trapeziuses. His back is a relief map of impenetrable terrain.\u201cI produce a three-dimensional effect that others don\u2019t have,\u201d he said.Armbrust Pro Gym, owned by a friend and open to Heath at all times, is filled with thick-limbed men and more weights than machines. Its grunginess gives it an authenticity that Heath likes.A wall is decorated with photographs and magazine covers featuring Heath. He pointed to one and noted the striations within his biceps. \u201cDetail on top of detail,\u201d he said. He pointed to his quadriceps and noted the \u201cdifferent dimensions of crevices.\u201dHeath\u2019s girlfriend, Shurie Cremona, scrolls her phone for a photograph of Heath on stage next to another competitor at Mr. Olympia. One man looks like the most muscular man in the world. The other is Heath, who is more \u2014 how to put it? \u2014 striated and creviced.People sometimes walk up and touch him, as if unsure if he is a man or a machine. What they do not realize is that beneath the stony exterior and self-assuredness is a squishy sense of anxiety and vulnerability. Heath gets nervous every time he strips to his posing trunks. He is rarely satisfied with what he sees in the mirror. He is persistently worried about imperfections others might find, too.But he often gets perfect scores at Mr. Olympia. His muscularity, combined with near-perfect symmetry, has made him unbeatable, for now, and maybe for several more years.Still, Heath is only occasionally recognized in his adopted hometown. The older and more successful he gets, the more ambition he has for something more \u2014 more titles, of course, but also a broader mainstream following. He wants a legacy beyond the record books of a niche sport.It can be hard not to compare yourself to Schwarzenegger, with his action-star movie career, his stint as a president-appointed fitness ambassador and his election as governor of California. Chang said that Heath\u2019s personality, including his charisma and outspokenness, is similar to that of Schwarzenegger, who is still omnipresent and beloved in the sport.\u201cSome say he\u2019s a little egotistic, but he\u2019s not,\u201d Chang said of Heath. \u201cHe just knows what he has done. He knows he\u2019s got the physique to back up his claims. Love him or hate him, you can\u2019t stop talking about him.\u201dHeath has keys to Armbrust and half an office in the back. On a recent night, Heath; his girlfriend, Cremona; and his agent, Mark Bryant, squeezed into the room, the floor cluttered with file cabinets, suitcases and cardboard boxes spilling T-shirts and banners.A wall had a poster of Schwarzenegger next to a framed, blown-up Flex cover of Heath. From the gym on the other side of the wall came heavy metal music and the occasional percussion of heavy metal weights crashing to the floor.Heath wore a sleeveless hoodie. Finding clothes is difficult. To accommodate his thighs, he mostly wears size 3XL Lululemon pants with a drawstring pulled tight at his narrow waist. He wears custom-made T-shirts, size 4XL, with the sides tapered.The hardest part of winning every year, he said, is having to defend it after a year of appearances and global travel. Discombobulated schedules, foreign foods, inconsistent gyms, cramped airplane seats and uncomfortable hotel beds are among the inconveniences that can alter his body, inside and out.He eats six or seven meals a day. He is divorced, but he has found in Cremona someone who will do his food shopping and meal preparation, on top of being a travel partner and business adviser. She spends $1,000 or more a week on his food, mostly at Whole Foods, and spends roughly six hours a day in the kitchen.Daily, Heath usually eats five to six pounds of protein-rich meats \u2014 filet mignon, chicken, turkey, salmon and tilapia, mostly. He consumes up to 75 grams of carbohydrates in the form of grits or oatmeal, white or brown rice, and various types of potatoes, including sweet potatoes. Mornings might bring 16 ounces of scrambled egg whites. He tries to drink two gallons of water a day. His off-season weight usually reaches 275 pounds or more, still chiseled.\u201cThe issue is how does my body assimilate to various proteins, carbs and fats?\u201d Heath said.As Heath talked in the office, Cremona presented him with steak and white rice. It was takeout, from Outback Steakhouse, because the two had just returned from a weeklong trip. Heath reached toward a bouquet of round plastic jars filled with powdered supplements. He scooped powder from one into a water bottle, shook it and drank. He compared himself to a racecar, always in need of fuel and delicate tinkering.\u201cEverybody is going to do what they do,\u201d Heath said, the only time over many hours that he was curt and declined to elaborate. \u201cBut we get tested.\u201dFans of Mr. Olympia do not seem caught up in the issue, perhaps because the sport is entirely about aesthetics, not strength or performance.Heath moved into the gym to work on his arms. Headphones on, he was given plenty of space by the 10 or so people in the gym late on a weeknight.\u201cI keep to myself, but I watch people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what that person on the treadmill is going through.\u201dHe spent an hour doing various curls, sometimes with barbells that looked small in his hands.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the weight, it\u2019s about the movement,\u201d he said.He looked at himself carefully in the mirror between sets. Sometimes, Cremona takes pictures of him from behind and underneath so that he can work on body parts that he cannot see.Heath has no gym at home, which means regular 30-minute trips to Armbrust, sometimes in the middle of the night. The police have been known to come to the glass doors shining flashlights inside, wondering who is inside the gym at 3 a.m.\u201cHe\u2019ll call me at midnight and say he\u2019s on the way to the gym,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Didn\u2019t you already work out today?\u2019 And he says, \u2018Yeah, but I didn\u2019t like the way it went.\u2019 \u201dEach day is set aside for different body parts \u2014 the back on Monday, the chest on Tuesday, the legs on Thursday and so on. After a celebratory vacation in Mexico with Cremona, Heath looked at the videos from Mr. Olympia.\u201cI look good, but I can see places I can improve,\u201d he said.He has 11 months before the next contest. From now until May is the \u201coff-season,\u201d though Heath\u2019s diet and workout routines rarely go off-script. Things get serious, and travel stops, during the four months before Mr. Olympia.In the final days before the contest, the food choices narrow and the water intake stops. There is less red meat, more fish \u2014 mostly tilapia, which Heath does not like. Carbohydrates are cut, replaced by vegetables like asparagus. Heath said he gags his food down.\u201cImagine eating a pound of food, eight times a day, with no fluid,\u201d he said.The effect of last-minute water loss is that the skin acts like shrink-wrap, showing every fiber of muscle and a maze of veins. The stress on the body and of the competition itself has sometimes left him with little memory of the two-day competition.The rest of the year is spent worrying about how he looks. For this article, Heath allowed only a few photographs to be taken as he worked out, nervous about the trolls on social media and the possible effect on sponsors seeing something other than a made-for-muscle-magazine image.That can be hard to control in the age of iPhones and Facebook, but Heath\u2019s living is entirely built on appearance. Every striation and crevice, every pimple and imperfection, will be scrutinized, praised or criticized.Heath worries that unflattering social media posts have the power to undo his image. \u201cAnd I really do want my legacy to look good,\u201d he said.It is, perhaps, not unlike a Victoria\u2019s Secret supermodel asking not to be photographed while tanning in her backyard or working out, so as not to draw comparisons to the carefully curated perfection of the catalog.Bryant, a lawyer and sports agent, opened a case of manila file folders and spread them on the desk like playing cards. Each was labeled: Phil Heath Enterprises, Sponsors, Taxes, Travel and so on. Bryant, Heath and Cremona discussed Heath\u2019s clothing line and his sponsorships. They talked about his desire for a shoe deal and a larger hyperbaric chamber at his house.A big topic was travel. There was a coming trip to Germany for Mr. Olympia Europe, where Heath would make public appearances and hand out the trophies on stage. Then it was on to Russia for more appearances and a private tour of the Kremlin. They talked about trips to India in January, Australia in March, maybe Indonesia in April.But his next trip was Wyoming. The Phil Heath Yellowstone Classic was coming up in Cheyenne, and Heath was nervous about doing an onstage exhibition.\u201cI\u2019m going to have body image issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I always do.\u201d\u201cHe still gets nervous,\u201d Cremona said. \u201cI tell him, \u2018You\u2019re the champ!\u2019 \u201d\u201cIt can be 10 people or thousands of people, I want them to see something special,\u201d Heath said. \u201cI want them to say, \u2018I saw the best in the world at something,\u2019 and maybe that will inspire them to go do something in their life with the same vigor.\u201dHe may compete only once a year, but the world is his stage.The meeting over, the workout complete, the latest meal devoured, Heath curled the bronze, two-foot Sandow trophy with a beefy arm and packed it into the foam-padded trunk.The gym was empty now, and Heath flipped the lights and locked the door and drove away, taking the trophy with him to put with all the others.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Bank Abruptly Drops Russian Network RT\u2019s Accounts", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s main English-language satellite network complained on Monday that its British bank was abruptly closing its accounts. The network, which reported on the decision, called it a British-government-sanctioned attempt to interfere with freedom of speech.NatWest\u2019s corporate parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, said in a statement on Monday that \u201cthese decisions are not taken lightly.\u201d \u201cWe are reviewing the situation and are contacting the customer to discuss this further,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe bank accounts remain open and are still operative.\u201dBritain\u2019s Treasury said the government was not involved in the bank\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is a matter for NatWest, not for the government,\u201d a spokeswoman said, speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol. \u201cWe as the U.K. government haven\u2019t changed the sanctions and obligations related to Russia since February 2015. For that reason, this is a decision that only NatWest has made, possibly based on their own risk appetite.\u201dRT\u2019s defense has been that its viewers expect alternative viewpoints.In Moscow, the management of RT said on Monday that its lawyers were dealing with the banking situation and that the network would remain in operation.Jonathan Eyal, assistant director of Russian and European security studies at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said that the bank\u2019s action might have reflected concerns over RT\u2019s links to the Kremlin. \u201cCertain questions are being raised over the corporation and its sources of funding,\u201d he said, \u201cand the bank must have been aware that this is not a happy commercial transaction.\u201dMr. Eyal noted that some financial institutions had recently faced large fines for handling questionable accounts, and he speculated that NatWest may \u201cprefer the controversy of closing the bank account over dealing with a business that may have tainted money.\u201dBeyond that, he said, the bank may be following a lead, either directly or indirectly, from the United States, which has been weighing its response to Russian hacking of American computers and servers. The bank\u2019s action could be a kind of \u201cveiled sanction,\u201d he said, aimed at \u201ctrying to convey to the propaganda sources that they are increasingly finding their life difficult in the West.\u201dRT started in 2005 as Russia Today, a television network meant to sell Russia abroad through soft features. Very few watched. In 2009, it switched tracks, becoming a snarky anti-West outlet. It changed its name to RT and erased any obvious Russian link.RT portrays itself as an independent alternative voice. It trumpets the slogan \u201cQuestion More,\u201d yet generally sticks to the same major news that CNN or the BBC is covering.The difference is less in subject matter than in tenor: On RT, the West is portrayed as grim, divided, brutal, decadent, overrun with violent immigrants and unstable. The network tends to make favorable remarks about Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president; the former CNN host Larry King, who now appears on RT, scored a rare direct interview with Mr. Trump in September.In RT\u2019s coverage, Russia seems to brim with multicultural tolerance; President Vladimir V. Putin is depicted as a modernizing leader protecting Russia\u2019s sovereignty with no dreams of empire; and the enormous civilian toll in Syria represents the unfortunate many who are caught in the crossfire as the Syrian government battles terrorists.Most analysts interviewed by RT toe the line, and any who do not are rebuked. When one analyst recently said on the air that the Kremlin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea remained an issue, the questioner quickly cut her off. \u201cCrimea is off the table,\u201d he exclaimed, echoing a Putin statement.Public accusations about a general Russian bias toward what is known as Brexit grew so loud that the Russian Embassy in London issued a statement saying that Moscow had no position on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union.Neil MacFarquhar reported from Moscow, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from London. Lincoln Pigman contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Good Neighbors, No Politics", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byNASHVILLE \u2014 A few years ago an app surfaced on Facebook that could identify how many of your friends were liberal and how many were conservative. One of my real-life friends clicked the button to see how her Facebook list stacked up and was shocked by the result. \u201cI had no idea I liked so many Republicans,\u201d she said.Maybe that\u2019s true on Facebook, but are the lines really so clear in ordinary life? People aren\u2019t simply their political opinions, not even the most deeply held and sacred ones. Surely we are all so much more than the shrill conversation online implies.Twenty-one years ago, my husband and I bought our house here, in what was Nashville\u2019s answer to Levittown \u2014 a circle of small, plain, matching houses built for young families buying their first homes thanks to the G.I. Bill. Once the original homeowners began to cash out and head to retirement communities, young families like ours moved in, and things started to look the way they surely did back in the \u201950s. Children race through the half-acre yards in half-feral packs, climbing back fences and low-branched trees as hide-and-seek gives way to flashlight tag in the failing light.With one family\u2019s oldest child best-friending another family\u2019s youngest, relationships continue to spread and deepen even as new families move in and a younger crew replaces the kids now old enough to drive. My own children are mostly grown now, and I don\u2019t know my younger neighbors as well as I know the parents of the children who grew up with mine, but I know they are still calling one another to ask: \u201cAre the kids in your yard? Did they say where they were going?\u201dThat\u2019s how friendships, not \u201cfriend\u201d-ships, are formed.Most of my children\u2019s packmates have left for college, but you\u2019ll still find me standing in the street with their mothers, or sitting with them on the porch, or carpooling with them to the closest taco place. We talk about what all longtime friends discuss: our aging parents, books and sex and movies and bras and all the ways we\u2019ve embarrassed our kids lately.What we don\u2019t ever talk about is politics. But it\u2019s not as if we don\u2019t all know where we stand. During the last election, when canvassers from the beleaguered Tennessee Democratic Party were making the rounds, several neighbors pointed them toward our house. When one of them arrived, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re the token liberals around here, I guess.\u201dWe aren\u2019t actually the only liberals here, but political leanings are beside the point on this little block. Knowing our neighbors\u2019 party affiliations would tell you nothing about which one of them makes a killer margarita, or which one volunteers at a homeless shelter, or which one secretly hung a lime-green thong on the back side of a neighbor\u2019s Christmas tree after the caroling party.For more than two decades we have fed one another\u2019s dogs and watered one another\u2019s tomatoes and seen one another through every struggle imaginable: infertility and childbirth and postpartum depression and infidelity and divorce and troubled teenagers and dying parents and medical crises and, by far the most devastating of all, the loss of a child. Is there any difference at the ballot box that could even touch what it means to clutch a friend in the street, wailing, or to text in the middle of the night, grieving in the dark?Our votes may cancel out, but we belong to one another. Years ago one of my neighbors tried to tell his wife that it would make more sense to move out than to add a second story onto the 65-year-old foundation of their house. Her response: \u201cThe only way I\u2019m leaving this neighborhood is in a box.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Brought Silicon Valley to Washington", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyThis October, the White House opened its doors to a few thousand people for South by South Lawn, a daylong event described as a \u201cfestival of ideas, art and action.\u201d Both the event and its name were a nod to South by Southwest, the annual technology-and-music festival held in Austin, Tex., where Barack and Michelle Obama showed up as surprise keynote speakers earlier this year. The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version \u2014 the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as \u201ccreator\u201d or \u201cinnovator\u201d \u2014 were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy\u2019s anthem \u201cFight the Power\u201d and Parliament\u2019s \u201cFlash Light\u201d across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon. As the sun began to set, volunteers handed out plaid blankets so people could stretch out on the ground.The event felt like the swan song of the first president who seemed to get it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the value of start-up culture. A friend in attendance that day told me that she thought Obama wanted us to feel \u201csome ownership, that tech doesn\u2019t have to be far away or out of our lives.\u201d He wants to leave behind a \u201cnation of makers,\u201d she said. Megan Rose Dickey, who covered the event for TechCrunch, wrote that it left her \u201coptimistic that maybe our country can change and learn to do the right thing.\u201dIn many ways, Obama is America\u2019s first truly digital president. His 2008 campaign relied heavily on social media to lift him out of obscurity. Those efforts were in part led by a founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who believed in the Illinois senator\u2019s campaign so much that he left the start-up to join Obama\u2019s strategy team. After he was elected, he created a trifecta of executive positions in his administration modeled on corporate best practices: chief technology officer, chief data scientist, chief performance officer. He sat for question-and-answer sessions on Reddit, released playlists of his favorite songs on Spotify and used Twitter frequently, even once making dad jokes with Bill Clinton. He stoked deep and meaningful connections with scores of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.Obama routinely pushed policy that pleased the tech-savvy, including his successful effort to keep broadband suppliers from giving preferential treatment to bigger web companies over individuals. Even his tech-specific fumbles seem unlikely to mar his permanent record: The rocky debut of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace that cost more than $600 million to build and crashed almost immediately after it went live, was later brushed off as a technical difficulty. And his administration\u2019s pressure on Silicon Valley companies to aid its cybersecurity efforts hasn\u2019t seemed to dampen their enthusiasm for him. Obama used his ties to the tech sector to foster diplomacy: Last year, he took Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, with him to Cuba as an economic endorsement of the revolutionary powers of start-ups to change the world.South by South Lawn presented an image of America as a start-up and technology as a small-batch industry, full of dreamers and inventors. I was invited to moderate a panel, \u201cHow Do We Fix Real Problems With Technology?\u201d As much as I enjoyed our conversation, the premise felt flawed. \u201cFixing\u201d problems with technology often just creates more problems, largely because technology is never developed in a neutral way: It embodies the values and biases of the people who create it. Crime-predicting software, celebrated when it was introduced in police departments around the country, turned out to reinforce discriminatory policing. Facebook was recently accused of suppressing conservative news from its trending topics. (The company denied a bias, but announced plans to train employees to neutralize political, racial, gender and age biases that could influence what it shows its user base.) Several studies have found that Airbnb has worsened the housing crises in some cities where it operates. In January, a report from the World Bank declared that tech companies were widening income inequality and wealth disparities, not improving them.For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We\u2019ve seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone. (In August, for instance, WhatsApp announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook, its parent company, and its suite of products \u2014 news that gave some Americans pause but caused German regulators to intervene on behalf on their citizens.)As Obama's presidency winds down, Silicon Valley and Washington seem to be getting closer. Just a few days after South by South Lawn, The Washington Post reported that Facebook was quietly talking to White House officials about rolling out a controversial app called Free Basics. On the surface, Free Basics sounds fantastic: It promises free mobile internet for those who can\u2019t afford expensive data plans. But only Facebook and Facebook-approved services would be available through the app, and the app can collect data on those who sign up, both to increase the company\u2019s user numbers and maintain the growth needed to impress shareholders. The same service sparked outrage when Facebook tried to introduce it in India last year; officials believed it would create an unfair marketplace and the potential for discriminatory practices. Fusion recently reported that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gave a company called Geofeedia access to information that helped law-enforcement agencies monitor and target minority activists. The close ties between our government and tech companies have led to changes that Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times technology columnist, told me \u201cwill have big effects for a long time, and we\u2019ll say they started under Obama.\u201dNone of this was mentioned at South by South Lawn. Instead, speakers heralded the power of the tech community. John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader, gave a rousing talk that implored listeners to \u201cget in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise.\u201d Clay Dumas, chief of staff for the Office of Digital Strategy at the White House, told me in an email that the event could be considered part of a legacy to inspire social change and activism through technology. \u201cIn his final months in office,\u201d he wrote, \u201cPresident Obama wants to empower the generation of people that helped launch his candidacy and whose efforts carried him into office.\u201dI left the event as the gorgeous afternoon unfurled into a balmy evening, still unsure what to make of it. But a few days later, during a speech at Carnegie Mellon, Obama seemed to reckon with his feelings about the potential \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the tech world. The White House can\u2019t be as freewheeling as a start-up, he said, because \u201cby definition, democracy is messy. And part of government\u2019s job is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\u201d But he added that he didn\u2019t want people to become \u201cdiscouraged and say, \u2018I\u2019m just not going to deal with government.\u2019\u2009\u201d Obama was the first American president to see technology as an engine to improve lives and accelerate society more quickly than any government body could. That lesson was apparent on the lawn. While I still don\u2019t believe that technology is a panacea for society\u2019s problems, I will always appreciate the first president who tried to bring what's best about Silicon Valley to Washington, even if some of the bad came with it.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Data from nine other states show that registrations rose drastically on the first day of the campaign compared with the day before.\u201cFacebook clearly moved the needle in a significant way,\u201d Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state, said in an interview on Tuesday.In California, 123,279 people registered to vote or updated their registrations on Friday, Sept. 23, the first day that Facebook users were presented with the reminder. That was the fourth-highest daily total in the history of the state\u2019s online registration site.Indiana similarly recorded its third-highest daily online registration total ever. Minnesota, meanwhile, broke its record for the most online voter registrations in a single week, thanks at least in part to the Facebook campaign, which continued through Monday, Sept. 26.In California, for example, nearly 24 percent of online voter registrations during the Facebook campaign came from residents aged 17 to 25. Nearly 30 percent more came from Californians from 26 to 35 years old.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the Facebook reminder campaign disproportionately motivated young people to register,\u201d Mr. Padilla, the secretary of state, said.The reminder \u2014 \u201cAre you registered to vote? Register now to make sure you have a voice in the election.\u201d \u2014 was presented alongside two links: one leading to a federal directory of state voter registration websites; and another allowing users to share that they had registered. Only users who would be of voting age on Election Day saw the reminder, which appeared for both desktop and mobile users.Officials greeted the effort enthusiastically.The secretaries of state in Colorado, Kentucky, Nebraska and West Virginia also credited Facebook, at least in part, for boosting registration.While the reminder was part of an inaugural national campaign for the social network, it built on a tradition of promoting civic engagement for the company.

And this year, the crowds have gotten even more epic in scale, with hordes of travelers taking to the highways, the rails and the air. (Also, of course, to tourist camels in the Gobi, horses on the Tibetan Plateau and boats on the Yangtze River.)People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, said 589 million people were expected to travel this week \u2014 almost twice the population of the United States.But \u201csustainable\u201d means different things to different people. Photographs of miles-long traffic jams on highways and oceans of people at the country\u2019s top attractions are circulating online this week.On Tuesday, the official Twitter account of People\u2019s Daily posted one such photo from the Forbidden City, in Beijing. It said the palace had sold 20,000 tickets within two hours on Sunday, or 166 tickets a minute.One photograph online showed fog and mist enveloping the mountain, and others showed many elderly tourists and women and children gathered in a cave near the mountaintop cable car station. Mount Hua, or Huashan in Mandarin, is a sacred Taoist mountain in Shaanxi Province that is about 7,067 feet tall. The West Peak, where the cable car station is, has an altitude of 6,850 feet.Air passengers that day numbered 960,000, a 6.4 percent increase over 2015.Driving was also popular because governments do not collect tolls on roads during this time, \u201cwhich led to the inevitable gridlock on the country\u2019s highways,\u201d the television network said. The same report said traffic on a six-mile stretch of road in Shanghai ground to a halt.Domestic tourism has been on the rise in China for years, with the Golden Week period generating more revenue for most tourism-related businesses than any other week of the year.Beijing has been quiet outside of the most popular tourist attractions like the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, the Temple of Heaven and the Summer Palace.

The varsity choir piped out \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d And in the bleachers at a sun-soaked football stadium here on Saturday, parents clenched their teeth in anger or raised their fists in support.\u201cYou can\u2019t continue to slap people in the face and not expect them to stand up,\u201d said Mr. Horton, a junior tight end at Aurora Central High School who is black and began kneeling during the national anthem at games in mid-September. \u201cWhen Kaepernick kneeled, he gave us an outlet. He gave us something to do.\u201dHe has also pushed that conversation onto a quintessential American stage: the high school football field.Over the weekend, three-quarters of the 44 Aurora Central Trojans football players knelt during \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d before the team crushed a rival, the Hinkley Thunderbirds, 41-6. A thousand miles away, students at Madison East and Madison West High Schools in Wisconsin dropped to their knees, too.Here in Aurora, a sprawling, highly diverse suburb of Denver, the protest has invigorated a group of young people who have never known a world without viral videos of violence.In interviews, several students took issue with critics who told them that they did not understand what they were protesting. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing; we made a conscious decision,\u201d said Jalil Grimes, 17, a senior and the team\u2019s starting quarterback. \u201cWe see police do us wrong. We see our teachers give up on us and expect us to fail. We\u2019ve always seen this. Once we saw somebody else stand up against it, we just fell in line.\u201dThe idea of kneeling came from several players, including Mr. Horton, who approached their coaches to ask permission to do so. The coaches gave their support, and the school district issued a statement saying it would respect their actions. \u201cAny time young kids can speak their minds, it\u2019s always good,\u201d said Tony Veasley, 49, a part-time coach for the Trojans who said six of his sons had graduated from Aurora Central.On Saturday, though, the stadium was a sea of hearts tied up in internal conflict.On the Hinkley side of the bleachers, near a mass of brass instruments and a cluster of exuberant cheerleaders \u2014 \u201cJam with us! Hey, hey!\u201d \u2014 Melinda Holt, 60, a white Army veteran, sat with her husband, wearing Thunderbird blue. They were there to watch a grandson play, she said.\u201cIt\u2019s ignorance,\u201d Ms. Holt said of the kneelers. \u201cYou are dishonoring our flag for the actions of a few. That\u2019s like holding every black man or every white man accountable for what somebody else has done. And that\u2019s wrong.\u201dOn the other side of the stands, a Hispanic woman named Maria Mitchell \u2014 wearing Trojan green beside her daughter T\u00e9a \u2014 said she felt conflicted over the kneeling players. She spent more than 25 years as a military wife, she said, and believes that standing for the anthem is a way to honor lives lost in war.But her children are of mixed ethnicity \u2014 black and Hispanic. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not a person of color, you don\u2019t understand any of it,\u201d she said. \u201cTo wake up every day and not know whether your kids are coming home or not, just because of their color, is ridiculous.\u201d\u201cUnless we walk in their shoes and feel what they feel on an everyday basis, we have no room to judge,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe can choose to support, or not support and be blind.\u201dFights are a problem, and last year\u2019s football game against Hinkley ended in a clash among students that forced the police to intervene.Christian Wells, 17, an offensive and defensive lineman, ended that night in police custody, after officers confused him with someone else, he said. This year at the Hinkley game, he chose to go down on one knee.\u201cI\u2019ve seen police brutality up close and personal,\u201d he said. \u201cTo family members. To friends. To myself personally. It\u2019s like, if nothing else will stop it, maybe silently protesting will do something.\u201dOn Saturday, the Trojans finished the game in a cascade of cheers, bouncing out of the stadium and onto a yellow team bus. In the parking lot, a 13-year-old Trojan fan, Damian Chavez, called the decision to kneel a \u201csign of respect for every black person in the country.\u201dA few hundred feet away, inside the empty stadium, the 81-year-old press box manager, Bob Blair, dressed in cowboy boots and Wrangler slacks, looked out onto the field.\u201cThey\u2019ve never been anywhere to see what the rest of the world hasn\u2019t got and what we have: It\u2019s called freedom,\u201d Mr. Blair said. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with it, but we can\u2019t stop it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

McAtee II, said in an interview. \u201cOur job is informing consumers what a good development this is for them.\u201dBut navigating this transaction will be a test of just how much influence AT&T has in Washington these days, especially as it tries to persuade antitrust officials at the United States Department of Justice, who will be crucial in approving the deal. The task may be particularly tricky as AT&T\u2019s lobbying team undergoes a transition after losing its longtime leader, James W. Cicconi, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush.Issues that led to the collapse of those deals seem even more prevalent now, as the nation closes out a presidential campaign that has featured candidates from both parties \u2014 most notably Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders \u2014 promising to challenge corporate power.The alarms over AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner stem from mounting frustration over high prices and the lack of competition in the telecom industry, with most Americans limited to one or two providers of broadband services. Regulators are set to focus on AT&T\u2019s powerful control over broadband and television customers since it is the nation\u2019s second-largest wireless company, after Verizon, and biggest paid television provider since its recent acquisition of DirecTV.Time Warner\u2019s marquee content from its HBO and CNN channels and movies from Warner Bros. will lead regulators to also scrutinize whether the creation of a multi-tentacled juggernaut could suppress competition in the technology, media and telecommunications industries. One way the combined company might do that, for example, is by offering unlimited streaming of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to its wireless customers or making it harder for competing streaming video services and television programs to reach AT&T subscribers.Lawmakers have already vowed a tough review of the deal, regardless of the lobbying full-court press they know will be playing out on Capitol Hill.\u201cWe are seeing increasing consolidation, especially scary consolidation, between the content side of the media and the internet provider side,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.The panel could hold a hearing on the proposal \u2014 with sworn testimony from AT&T executives \u2014 as soon as next month. \u201cWe have a duty to examine this deal,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.The merger sets up a monthslong battle in Washington with consumer advocates, smaller telecom and cable companies, and some tech companies preparing their own assault against the deal.\u201cThe American people want more competition, not less,\u201d said Chip Pickering, chief executive of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents internet companies including Netflix and Google. \u201cMegamergers are leaving them with higher prices and less choice.\u201dInstead, Mr. Ben-Zvi said, AT&T needs to be more specific and authentic to be more effective. The company must confront head-on any questions about the impact its deal would have on its competitors, for example, and make sure regulators and lawmakers understand that, with such rapid change in the tech sector, it has no choice but to pursue a deal like this.\u201cIncumbent telecommunications companies like AT&T are deeply threatened by the emergence of Silicon Valley giants that are poised to take over this space,\u201d said Mr. Ben-Zvi, who is not working on the AT&T-Time Warner deal. \u201cCompanies like Amazon, Google, Netflix \u2014 those are now some of AT&T\u2019s rivals, not just companies like Verizon.\u201dAT&T would not discuss details of its lobbying strategy, including whether it would employ tactics similar to those in previous mergers. \u201cWe are early in the process,\u201d Mr. McAtee, the AT&T general counsel, said.Mr. McAtee will help lead AT&T\u2019s merger efforts in Washington, along with Robert W. Quinn Jr., a policy insider in charge of lobbying who has been at the company for three decades.Both are new to being in charge. AT&T\u2019s storied lobbying operations were long led by Mr. Cicconi, who retired last month. Mr. Cicconi in the past worked closely with Wayne Watts, who served for decades at AT&T, including as general counsel, and retired last year.Together, Mr. Cicconi and Mr. Watts shepherded more than a half-dozen blockbuster mergers in the last two decades.The company is offering some clues about how it will position the deal. Unlike a \u201chorizontal\u201d merger, which unites competing companies in the same line of business, this transaction would not reduce the number of options for consumers, AT&T executives have said.AT&T also said it would not withhold Time Warner shows from competitors. It plans to create an advertising-based video business for mobile devices, similar to the ad business of the web giants Google and Facebook.The biggest advantage AT&T may have is the likelihood that the deal may face little scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory agency that typically gets involved if there are transfers of telecom or broadcast licenses. If Time Warner divests the one Atlanta broadcast station it owns, that would make the F.C.C.\u2019s jurisdiction moot. The merger would be reviewed under a new administration, potentially with new antitrust officials picked by the next president.Even so, it will not be easy. Michael J. Copps, a Democrat and former commissioner for the F.C.C., said that he was preparing, with consumer groups, to battle an AT&T lobbying surge.AT&T \u201chas a huge lobbying budget and the sharpest lawyers money can buy to get this deal approved,\u201d Mr. Copps said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How NBC Finished Second on the Trump Video Story", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byDays after a blockbuster video emerged capturing Donald J. Trump, then a reality television host, making vulgar remarks about aggressively kissing and groping women, a question was still reverberating around media and political circles:Why was NBC not the first to report its own story?Yet on Friday afternoon, it was The Washington Post that posted the video to its website, rocking the political world and earning the envy of journalists across the country.The delay stemmed from a combination of factors, including a legal review, intranet work fiefs and the slow-turning wheels of a sprawling corporate infrastructure, according to several people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the internal discussions.The Post reporter who obtained the tape, David Fahrenthold, received a copy late Friday morning. When NBC\u2019s news division learned that The Post was working on the story, it moved quickly: Within about 10 minutes of The Post\u2019s publishing its version, the NBC News correspondent Katy Tur went on MSNBC with a story about the video, showing the footage.Interviews show that NBC lawyers, erring on the side of caution, examined whether the network could be vulnerable to a lawsuit for airing the recording, and discussed whether it was ethical to use live-microphone audio from a private moment with Mr. Trump \u2014 who was inside a van, off-camera \u2014 that was not intended to be broadcast.Executives at NBC\u2019s news division, meanwhile, deferred to their corporate cousins at \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d giving them first crack at airing the footage that was theirs \u2014 even as the entertainment show, unaccustomed to stories of such gravity, took its time. NBC officials, believing that the footage was closely guarded, did not think it was in danger of leaking.Complicating matters was the presence in the tape of Billy Bush, one of NBC\u2019s most important on-air personalities, who can be heard discussing a woman\u2019s legs and laughing along with Mr. Trump as he jokes about kissing women, and grabbing their genitalia, without their consent.Mr. Bush, who said he was \u201cembarrassed and ashamed\u201d by his behavior, is facing an online backlash. Early in the weekend, NBC had no plans to discipline him, but on Sunday evening the network said it was suspending him indefinitely. It was unclear how long he would be away from the show.On Saturday, NBC officials said that they had acted responsibly in vetting the Trump video and that a three-day delay was a short amount of time to prepare a story of such magnitude and sensitivity.Mark Kornblau, a senior vice president for communications at NBC News, said that throughout the process the news division was always prepared to run with the news and that it applied rigorous journalistic standards in approaching the story.\u201cThe only filter we looked through this story was: Is it newsworthy? Yes,\u201d Mr. Kornblau said. \u201cAnd then how can we, as quickly and as responsibly as possible, get it to publication? We did exactly what you want and expect from a great news organization to get there.\u201dNBC employees have speculated on who might have leaked the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video to The Post, wondering if someone inside the network believed the due diligence was taking too long.The timing is unfortunate for NBC, which has faced criticism throughout the presidential campaign. The anchor Matt Lauer, for instance, was castigated for his less-than-aggressive questioning of Mr. Trump at a town hall forum last month.NBC also invited Mr. Trump to host \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d during the Republican primary; CNBC held a widely panned Republican primary debate that prompted a backlash from the party; and even Jimmy Fallon, the \u201cTonight Show\u201d host, was dinged by fellow comedians for playfully mussing Mr. Trump\u2019s hair during an interview.This latest episode began last Monday, when \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d producers read about Mr. Trump\u2019s treatment of women on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and recalled their own 2005 segment featuring Mr. Trump and a trip to a soap opera set.After unearthing the footage of Mr. Trump making crude remarks, Rob Silverstein, the executive producer of \u201cAccess Hollywood,\u201d informed NBC News executives of the discovery, according to two people familiar with the timeline.But conversations about how to handle the bombshell moved slowly, in part because of the Rosh Hashana holiday. On Tuesday, Mr. Lack found out about the tape, as two NBCUniversal lawyers, Kimberley D. Harris and Susan E. Weiner, began considering a variety of legal questions. Did NBC have the right to broadcast the tape? Could it be sued?The legal back-and-forth \u2014 and the huge corporate infrastructure at NBC, which is owned by Comcast \u2014 slowed down the process, even though everyone involved acknowledged the tape\u2019s newsworthiness, several people said.Still, a plan was put in place: Once the lawyers gave a green light, \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d would report the story first, and NBC News could quickly follow up. \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d and NBC News were not working in concert on their reports, according to several people.By Friday morning, lacking comment from some principals \u2014 including the Trump campaign \u2014 and with Hurricane Matthew dominating the news cycle, \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d producers decided to push their broadcast to Monday, after the second presidential debate.But then The Post called for comment early Friday afternoon. \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d and NBC News producers were blindsided. NBC News rushed to pull together a story. On MSNBC\u2019s initial report that afternoon, Ms. Tur described the contents of the video, but referred to The Post only once, citing a comment from the Trump campaign that the network had not yet obtained.There is unlikely to be another bombshell from \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d A spokeswoman for the show said in a statement: \u201cWe have combed through every interview we have done with Mr. Trump over the past 20 years and at this time, we have not uncovered any other footage that rises to this level.\u201dRival syndicated entertainment shows like \u201cExtra,\u201d \u201cInside Edition\u201d and \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d are searching for their own newsworthy footage of Mr. Trump, though there are no indications that they have found equally explosive material.As for Mr. Bush, his Facebook page has been flooded with critical comments, many from women, a major viewership for \u201cToday.\u201d A call to his office line at NBC headquarters on Saturday went to a voice mail message, apparently recorded by an assistant.\u201cYou\u2019ve reached Billy Bush\u2019s office,\u201d the message says. \u201cHe\u2019s busy making America great again.\u201d By Sunday evening, that message was no longer there.An article on Monday about NBC\u2019s being scooped on reporting a blockbuster video of Donald J. Trump that came from a syndicated entertainment program owned by NBCUniversal rendered the name of another syndicated entertainment show incorrectly. It is \u201cExtra,\u201d not \u201cExtra!\u201dMichael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Showing How Art Critical of Malaysian Premier Thrived During His Rule", "Date": "2016-10-08", "News": "Supported byKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 Mahathir Mohamad, who transformed this country of paddy fields and rubber plantations into a modern economy of factories, highways and skyscrapers, is known as much for his bold economic vision as for his intolerance of anybody who got in his way.While he was prime minister of Malaysia from 1981 to 2003, Dr. Mahathir detained opponents, fired top judges, controlled the news media, clipped the power of Malay royalty, fired one deputy and pushed another to resign.Yet the visual arts mostly escaped his attention.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d a show of 48 works by 28 artists that is on view at Ilham Gallery here until Nov. 20, is evidence of that inattention. Despite their critical nature, many of the pieces in the show appeared in state-funded institutions like the National Art Gallery; some won national awards.Art was seen as a concern of the urban elite, with no influence on the masses. \u201cIt was not really on his radar,\u201d said Valentine Willie, the curator of \u201cEra Mahathir\u201d and the creative director of Ilham Gallery. \u201cIn a way, it was a saving grace for us. He didn\u2019t take us seriously.\u201dDr. Mahathir\u2019s policies created a growing wealthy class whose members were looking for ways to spend their money. \u201cIf you have a million-dollar apartment, what are you going to put on the wall? Not your grandmother\u2019s portrait,\u201d Mr. Willie said.In Malaysia this year, another artist, Fahmi Reza, was charged \u2014 twice \u2014 under cybercrime laws for posting a caricature of Prime Minister Najib Razak with a clown face on Instagram and Facebook.But in Dr. Mahathir\u2019s Malaysia in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, even as art took a decidedly sociopolitical turn, galleries flourished, as did theater.\u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d which features works on loan from the national art gallery, private collections and the artists, opens with a panel by Mohd Nor Khalid, better known as Lat, whose cartoons ran in the pro-government New Straits Times.In the panel, Lee Kuan Yew, a former Singapore prime minister who died last year, is drawn clutching a newspaper and asking Dr. Mahathir why he allows cartoonists to get away with such unflattering depictions of him. \u201cLook what they do to your nose!\u201d Mr. Lee says. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Dr. Mahathir, depicted with a giant nose, agrees, \u201ctoo much freedom.\u201d It\u2019s funny, and makes a point: Even among autocrats, there are degrees of autocracy.The show also includes a politically charged work by Ahmad Fuad Osman. In 1998, the artist joined thousands in the streets protesting Dr. Mahathir\u2019s firing of his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who was later charged with corruption and sodomy \u2014 a crime in this country. Then Mr. Ahmad Fuad went home and picked up his brush.Until then, he had been known for his studied, symbolic pieces. He ended up producing four vigorous self-portraits, in oil, each over six feet tall. Three were based on the old proverb \u201cSee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,\u201d to which he added a fourth portrait, of him holding his nose.\u201cThere are times we have to scream,\u201d Mr. Ahmad Fuad said in a phone interview from his current base in Bali. \u201cWe can\u2019t whisper anymore. We have to let our voices out.\u201dMr. Ahmad Fuad\u2019s self-portraits were shown at Galeri Petronas, owned by the national oil company. One of these four pieces \u2014 titled \u201cShhh!\u201d and showing the artist with finger to lips \u2014 is included in \u201cEra Mahathir.\u201dAnother work, \u201cNEP,\u201d by Roslisham Ismail, is a wall-size collage forming the acronym for the New Economic Policy, an affirmative-action plan for the country\u2019s majority Malays that Dr. Mahathir wielded to a greater degree than any leader before him. The three giant letters are made up of posters and calling cards for loan sharks, a comment on the abuses of the policy and the growing chasm between rich and poor Malays.Liew Kung Yu\u2019s \u201cProposals for My Country\u201d features a photo montage of the Greek and Roman columns that mushroomed during the building boom, adorning everything from mansions to office buildings to wooden stilt houses \u2014 a sign of new money gone mad.Mr. Liew, in an interview, denounced Dr. Mahathir\u2019s obsession with showy construction; the Petronas Twin Towers, briefly the world\u2019s tallest buildings, were erected during his time.Kathy Rowland, a Malaysian arts researcher who wrote an essay for the show\u2019s catalog, noted that during Dr. Mahathir\u2019s time the state built a national theater, a national art gallery \u2014 both planned under earlier administrations \u2014 and a home for the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra at the base of the Petronas Twin Towers.\u201cI suppose a rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d she said.The show is running as Dr. Mahathir, 91, is starting a new political party and forging a once-unthinkable alliance with the opposition to try to oust Mr. Najib, the current prime minister, who is mired in a billion-dollar scandal involving a state fund named 1MDB. That the gallery is owned by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister and one of Dr. Mahathir\u2019s closest allies, adds to the intrigue.Mr. Willie, the curator, said that he had had the idea for the show for a while and that the timing was coincidental. Mr. Daim, a longtime art collector, provides the space for Ilham \u2014 12,000 square feet over two floors in a skyscraper he owns on the edge of the central business district.He pays Mr. Willie, who used to own five galleries across Southeast Asia, a fee to run it, but does not interfere in curatorial decisions, Mr. Willie said. Entry is free, and none of the works are for sale.Ilham\u2019s ownership has perturbed some in the arts community, who fear that artists are being co-opted in some larger political tussle. Ray Langenbach, an American who worked in Malaysia for years and is now a theater professor at the University of the Arts Helsinki, said he had rejected a request from the gallery to include his 1994 video documenting a performance piece by another artist.The piece was based on one of Dr. Mahathir\u2019s most severe crackdowns, 1987\u2019s Operation Lalang \u2014 lalang is a hardy local weed \u2014 when 106 activists, politicians, intellectuals, students and others were detained without trial, accused of stoking racial tension. \u201cAllowing criticism of his past acts makes Mahathir stronger now,\u201d Mr. Langenbach said in an email. (The gallery used news clippings about the performance piece instead.)Still, the gallery has attracted the participation of many independent voices.\u201cIt\u2019s a relevant art show, and you see a lot of anger from the time he was in power,\u201d said Jahabar Sadiq, a Malaysian journalist who wrote an essay on Dr. Mahathir\u2019s legacy for the show\u2019s catalog. In it, he described the ex- leader\u2019s biggest fault as bringing an overconcentration of power to the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201cOf course there\u2019s an agenda,\u201d Mr. Sadiq said. \u201cThe agenda is: I want you to talk about it! This is therapy for the country. The country needs this therapy.\u201dA picture caption on Oct. 9 with an article about \u201cEra Mahathir,\u201d an exhibition in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, featuring artwork that was popular during the tenure of a former Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, misstated, in some copies, the patronymic of the artist whose self-portrait \u201cShhh!\u201d is in the show. He is Ahmad Fuad Osman, not Osmand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Back Door Into the Marathon Connects Runners With a Cause", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byWhen Katie Quan received an email informing her that she had not been selected in the lottery for the 2016 New York City Marathon, she was disappointed but not surprised. After all, the competition to secure a spot in the race is always intense: This year, only about one in four runners (19,083 out of 82,172) was selected in the drawing.\u201cI had kind of decided even before the lottery that this would be the year I\u2019d run New York,\u201d said Ms. Quan, a Manhattan resident who started running about three years ago. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get picked, I\u2019d fall back on signing up for a charity.\u201dMany others have found an alternate route to the starting line. Although the exact figures for 2016 are not yet available, about 17 percent of the race\u2019s 49,617 finishers in 2015 were charity runners, meaning that they were competing for one of the 340 charitable organizations that pay for and offer coveted entry slots into the race. In return, the runners pledge to raise money for the charity.So what motivates those runners? Is it the cause, or securing a bib for New York and other hard-to-get-into marathons?\u201cWe\u2019ve had 50 runners consistently for the last decade,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had five of them actually come to Kenya to visit the hospital. So it\u2019s pretty clear they care about the cause.\u201dJeff Brown, a sport psychologist, said he believed it was possible that the runners were driven by both the desire to secure a race number and a genuine commitment to a cause.\u201cAre they going to glean something from the charity?\u201d said Dr. Brown, an assistant clinical professor at Harvard Medical School and the lead psychologist for the Boston Marathon medical team. \u201cYes, but we\u2019re still looking at altruism.\u201dThat number has stayed the same even as overall running participation, in both marathons and shorter distances, has declined in the last few years, according to Running U.S.A. Moreover, fund-raising for running events on the online fund-raising site CrowdRise is growing by 18 percent annually on average, a CrowdRise representative said, suggesting that even as the total number of runners had declined, their fund-raising impact had increased.While many run for large cause-based teams, such as the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\u2019s Team in Training program, others pursue solo fund-raising efforts.\u201cI\u2019m doing it for my family,\u201d he said, \u201cand for other families suffering through this.\u201d By the middle of October, he had raised $7,758.\u201cI\u2019m not the smartest guy in the world; I couldn\u2019t go and start a foundation,\u201d Mr. Asparro said. \u201cBut I have a high tolerance for pain, and I follow my heart. So this seemed to be the best way to make a contribution.\u201dLast year, Team for Kids members raised $5.5 million for New York Road Runners\u2019 youth running programs.In next Sunday\u2019s race, about 1,700 participants will be running for that cause \u2014 the largest single charity in the marathon. Team members like Ms. Quan have made a commitment to raise $2,620, or $100 per mile of the marathon.In return, they are provided with a training program, coaching and opportunities for group runs and clinics. But, said Michael Rodgers, vice president for development and philanthropy at Road Runners, \u201cpart of that support is to keep their motivation up and remind them of why they\u2019re doing this.\u201dTo that end, runners for Team for Kids receive encouragement in the form of brief pep talks \u2014 \u201cMission Moments\u201d \u2014 at the start of their group runs in Central Park; visits from some of the youngsters who have benefited from the running programs they are supporting; appearances by guest celebrity athletes (this year they will include the Olympians Meb Keflezighi and Molly Huddle, as well as the four-time marathon wheelchair champion Tatyana McFadden); and encouraging emails and posts on the group\u2019s Facebook page.The ultimate hope, Mr. Rodgers said, is that first-time Team for Kids runners will keep raising money or volunteering after this year\u2019s marathon.Ms. Quan said she was already considering that, as her motivations have changed. \u201cHonestly, coming into the marathon, it was just like a one-and-done, bucket-list thing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now the team really kind of sucked me in because everyone\u2019s so great. I\u2019ve definitely fallen into ranks with the cause.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Trump vs. Clinton Becomes a Family Affair", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byModern LoveEarly last year, I drove across Florida to see my sister. She didn\u2019t know I was coming. In fact, she didn\u2019t know I existed.The mother who adopted me as a baby and raised me in Baltimore had died a few years back. Then I found out my biological mother had died, too. She had been living in Florida, as if waiting for me when I moved to West Palm Beach after college two decades ago. But I didn\u2019t learn this until she was already dead. We never met.Then, through a combination of research and luck, I learned that my birth mother had a daughter five years after I was born, meaning I had a biological sister who was also in Florida, just three hours away. I couldn\u2019t let her slip away, too.As I drove past the sugar cane stalks and ragged palm trees of Florida\u2019s interior, I was so nervous I felt nauseated. I knew that I was closer than ever to a potential reunion, but that I was also closer than ever to a potential rejection.I was unnerved, too, by a vague foreboding. From online snooping, I knew we had differences. She was a registered Republican. I\u2019m a Democrat. (Facebook even labels me very liberal.) She had a son when she was a teenager, while I didn\u2019t marry or have children until my mid-30s.With wobbly legs, I walked up her suburban driveway and knocked on her door. No one answered, and I left a letter with a picture of my family and me.The next evening, my cellphone rang. She sounded suspicious but soon turned cordial.A few days later we met in a park in the middle of the state. Her warmth surprised me. She gave me a Greek \u201cevil eye,\u201d a glass trinket symbolizing our shared bloodline. All my life I had taken on the ethnicities of my adoptive parents, Irish and Polish. Now, I had an ethnicity of my own.I looked down at this strange eye in my hand. \u201cSo, does this wish evil on people?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sees evil and wards it off.\u201dShe had made Greek sandwiches for lunch and prepared a photo album for me, full of pictures of our mother. Now I knew where my older son\u2019s curly hair came from. She had even written me a poem.We each had a sibling whose life had self-destructed: hers a sister, mine a brother. And we both had a direct way of speaking that some might construe as blunt, a trait I giddily saw as a genetic puzzle piece nestling into place.But on other fundamentals, we diverged. She was not a college graduate. She had a pet pig named Link. To me, a city guy, the idea of having a pig as a pet struck me as cartoonishly rural.Our conversation touched on politics, and she referred to Barack Obama as \u201cour Muslim president.\u201d The comment hit me like a punch in the gut. I told her, in the most noncombative way I could, that he wasn\u2019t. She conceded nothing. We dropped it.We had someone take a picture of us: me with my short dark hair and geeky glasses, her with her dark untamed curls and shades. In the photo, her smile is toothy and bright, her happiness made plain. My teeth are hidden, my smile inscrutable. Later, she would let on that this smile disappointed her.But in the following weeks, our bond of new siblinghood drowned out our differences. We texted like addicted teenagers. She made my family homemade Greek food on a visit to her home. When she called me her \u201cshiny new brother,\u201d I swooned.Then one day she texted me a jarring image of a bumper sticker slogan: \u201c9MM beats 9-1-1 every time.\u201dI blinked at my screen. \u201cAre you a gun person btw?\u201d I asked. \u201cMight as well know that now lol.\u201dShe said she was licensed to carry, then asked if I had ever been \u201cdown to go to a gun range.\u201dI pondered this. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of necessary in certain contexts,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut in the context of me holding one, I think that\u2019s a bad context for a gun lol.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s seriously not a big deal!\u201d she said.I can\u2019t stand guns. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart to keep a gun in a home for self-defense, and not only because my boys are 5 and 2. I don\u2019t understand why someone would want to shoot a weapon for fun. To me, they\u2019re emblematic of brutishness.Our text blizzard tapered to a flurry, just occasional photos of enticing dinners mid-simmer and selfies with our children and spouses. She kept coaching me to smile bigger. I said I would try harder. As the presidential primary season grew increasingly ugly, we steered clear of politics.Six months ago, she told me she and her husband were buying a manufactured home on eight acres in a little town in north Florida, an even more conservative part of the state than where they had been living.She had always wanted more land, and I was happy for her. But I also saw this as a widening of our rift, a rejection of the urban melting-pot lifestyle I had always embraced. At the same time, I longed to see her more, and now she would be two hours farther away. The news broke my heart.I poked fun in a thinly veiled attempt to get her to reconsider, saying that it would be so quiet there she would \u201cbe able to hear a mouse fart five miles away.\u201dBut, move she did.Then, as hate-laced rhetoric and angry political rallies dominated the news, I began to worry anew: Does my sister support this?I could stay silent no longer. \u201cElection getting crazy,\u201d I texted. \u201cI gotta ask. Are you supporting Trump?\u201dThe response came quickly: \u201cYou and I will not discuss politics brother dear.\u201d\u201cA chilling response, indeed.\u201dA red heart emoji appeared in reply.\u201cWell whatever you do, I hope you\u2019re really, really paying attention.\u201d\u201cDitto,\u201d she replied. Another red heart.I told her that if we discussed it, maybe we could end up learning something about each other. For now, I said, I would have to assume she was supporting Trump.She told me not to assume but didn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown on me in this last year,\u201d she typed. \u201cI shall not ruin it xo.\u201d Another red heart.I didn\u2019t dare bring up politics again. But I couldn\u2019t help dwelling on it. I feared that a connection I had longed to make my entire life, my only link to my maternal roots, was now under political siege.Was I really going to allow stereotypes shaped by polarized political debates to sabotage my relationship with my own sister, who feeds me like a doting mother and protects me with a Greek evil eye? What did her views of the world matter when her view of me produced nothing but generosity and warmth?We went silent for five days. Then she sent me a picture of a cat wearing glasses.\u201cLol it\u2019s the cat me!\u201d I replied.Later that month, I drove on rolling country roads past patches of fiery red wildflowers and a business flying a Confederate flag, until I rumbled along a dirt lane and arrived at her secluded home.I was greeted, as always, with a tight embrace. I handed her my usual flowers. She showed me an herb garden they had started with their daughter and took me into their pig\u2019s new, spacious pen. As I petted him, he bit my foot. It was harmless but I was spooked and jumped away, which we both found hilarious.She gave me a tour of the rest of the woodsy property. From the road, the trees had looked dense. But once among them, I was surprised to find there was plenty of room to walk around. I found the quiet not isolating but soothing.\u201cI can see why you love it here,\u201d I told her.All along, I had wanted a sibling soul mate. I got, instead, a sibling who holds opposite views and whose \u201cMuslim president\u201d remark appalls me to this day. But I also got a sibling who has been nothing but kind and generous to me over the nearly two years since we met, and I love her.With family, you can\u2019t always resolve your differences. You can only be grateful for the good and try to hold on to it.Her son, 20, arrived that evening. He looks more like me than anyone I\u2019ve ever met, including my own sons. He had asked that I wear the same colors as he would be wearing for a picture of us, to maximize our similarities.As my sister held up her camera, I smiled a wide, toothy smile. I hoped it was bright enough, this time, to match hers.To contact Modern Love, email modernlove@nytimes.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Matthew Blows Away Couples\u2019 Wedding Plans", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byWhen Jessica Lewis, 32, and Jas Jeet Singh, 36, were tracking the early weather forecasts for Sunday, the day their wedding was to take place on Jekyll Island, Ga., they were disappointed to see that it was supposed to be 81 degrees and partly sunny.For their outdoor ceremony, they joked, 79 degrees would be ideal.\u201cWe kept telling people, \u2018Look, we\u2019re going to be there,\u2019\u201d Mr. Singh said in an interview on Friday.On Wednesday, as the door was closing on their plane from Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington to Jacksonville International Airport in Florida, they learned that the island, which is about 75 miles north of Jacksonville, was under a voluntary evacuation order.By Thursday, that order had become mandatory and the venue said it would be unable to host the ceremony because it could not receive food shipments.On Friday the couple decided to tentatively reschedule their wedding for Thanksgiving weekend in Virginia.They were not alone in having to rearrange their wedding plans because of the hurricane. Jessica McClellan, 28, and Mark Kennedy, 29, had planned to get married on Saturday afternoon in McClellanville, S.C., which is near the coast and about 40 miles northeast of Charleston, S.C.When it became clear that the hurricane would force the evacuation of the community, the couple hastily rescheduled their wedding to Thursday evening.For Ms. Lewis and Mr. Singh, the disruption was bad enough, but for their 140 guests \u2014 some of whom were coming from India, Japan and Nigeria \u2014 it meant the expense of canceling or changing travel plans at the last minute. Mr. Singh and Ms. Lewis said they felt bad about upending the plans but were grateful that none of their loved ones were hurt in the storm.They said their losses were less than $10,000 because the venue and vendors had been \u201cextremely helpful\u201d and accommodating; some declined to charge anything after the wedding was canceled.They had been planning their wedding since February; it was to feature a Sikh religious ceremony in the morning and a civil ceremony in the evening.Mr. Singh, who is known as JJ, was familiar with the island through his position as the treasurer of Leon N. Weiner & Associates, a residential and commercial real estate developer in Wilmington, Del.\u201cI fell in love with the place,\u201d said Ms. Lewis, an energy and infrastructure issues analyst at the Government Accountability Office in Washington. \u201cIt was just one of the most romantic places to have a wedding I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dThe couple arrived on the island on Wednesday night, but evacuated on Thursday and relocated to Brunswick, Ga. They later had to evacuate a second time, to Hilliard, Fla., about 30 miles northwest of Jacksonville.Ms. Lewis said they were \u201ca little bit in mourning\u201d after the delay in their plans, which Mr. Singh had meticulously plotted down to the minute. Still, they remained chipper.\u201cIt gives me a chance to lose five more pounds,\u201d he said, to which Ms. Lewis chimed in: \u201cI hear that!\u201dFor the wedding of Ms. McClellan and Mr. Kennedy, frantic phone calls were made, and vendors and caterers were quick to accommodate the last-minute change of plans. Half of the 200 invitees were able to attend, including two of the groom\u2019s aunts and an uncle, who drove 16 hours from Canada and arrived at the ceremony an hour before it started.The celebration lasted until about 1 a.m. Friday, \u201cliving the dream, having a hurricane party, wedding-style,\u201d Ms. Kennedy-McClellan said.

{"Headline": "The Stakes Are Rising in Google\u2019s Antitrust Fight With Europe", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byGoogle is locked in a six-year battle with Europe's antitrust officials. And the stakes for both sides are getting higher.\u201cFor the European Commission, it\u2019s a case of Russian roulette,\u201d said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cIf they lose or merely settle the case, they will look weak. They have to be seen as doing something to stop Google.\u201dThe latest twist in this episode is expected to begin on Thursday, when Google officially starts responding to European charges that it has hamstrung competitors and limited consumer choice.The separate but closely linked rebuttals to European claims are expected to be submitted to competition authorities in Brussels in quick succession over the next few weeks.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.While each response will be couched in legalese, Google\u2019s main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the region\u2019s tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europe\u2019s more than 500 million consumers.Not surprisingly, the company\u2019s detractors \u2014 small European start-ups, some local politicians and American heavy hitters like Oracle \u2014 do not agree.\u201cGoogle has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that it\u2019s still on the right track,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, a group representing the Google rivals that have filed complaints against the company\u2019s perceived dominance.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But that\u2019s what other previously dominant companies thought, too,\u201d he added.Whatever happens, Google\u2019s battle in Europe will not end overnight.European officials must first review the company\u2019s rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest.If found to have breached the region\u2019s rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process.Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.Google may face tougher competition in the smartphone world if Europe forces the company to open up Android to rivals, a possibility if the search giant loses its antitrust case in the region.\u201cNo matter what happens, antitrust is part of the picture for Google for many more years,\u201d said Ioannis Lianos, a professor of global competition law and public policy at University College London. \u201cEven if Google wins, the fact that they are spending resources on this will affect their commercial thinking.\u201dThe search giant has become a boogeyman for many in Europe. In part, that is because of Google\u2019s dominance over many of the digital services \u2014 like online search and smartphones \u2014 that have become essential to people\u2019s daily lives.Advertisement"}

So far no injuries have been reported, though the police said anti-clown patrols had been increased in some areas.Professor Griffiths favors the copycat explanation for the sudden proliferation of fake \u201ckiller clowns\u201d in Britain. He said the pranks were tapping into a fear of clowns fueled by popular culture, from Jack Nicholson\u2019s depiction of the Joker in \u201cBatman\u201d to graphic comic books.\u201cThere is an evil clown trope running through popular culture,\u201d he said. \u201cWith their exaggerated features, big feet, hands and noses, white makeup and wildfire hair, clowns are scary because they are caricatures. Like mannequins or androids, they are human but something is not quite right and this can make people feel uncomfortable.\u201dA fear of clowns, never mind one wielding a fake machete, is no laughing matter. Clowns have a centuries-long history of delighting Britons, but \u201ccoulrophobia,\u201d a fear of the jesters, can also cause panic, difficulty in breathing and sweating.The police warned that the clown pranks were disturbing the peace, taking up valuable police resources and, in some cases, breaking the law.On Sunday, the police in the Thames Valley, which covers the areas of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, said they had received calls about 14 scary clowns intimidating people across the region over the previous 24-hour period.Chief Superintendent Andy Boyd, the head of neighborhood policing at Thames Valley police, said that while he did not want to ruin anyone\u2019s fun, there was nothing amusing about scaring someone half to death.\u201cWhile we do not want to be accused of stopping people enjoying themselves, we would also ask those same people to think of the impact of their behavior on others and themselves,\u201d he said.\u201cTheir actions can cause fear and anxiety,\u201d he added, noting that intimidation and threats could lead to public order offenses.\u201cIt is easy to scare people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is harder to communicate and bring pleasure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

We play with words, we play with grids; in fact, Robyn Weintraub has done just that. In order to keep herself motivated to build puzzles, she changed things up a bit, and that sort of creativity and willingness to experiment is to be encouraged.I liked her grid the moment I saw it. She calls it \u201cswoopy,\u201d and the cascade of white space does swoop back and forth, like a leaf fluttering from a tree. Whatever you see in the grid \u2014 they\u2019re like clouds, so everyone will see something different \u2014 I think you\u2019ll find that Ms. Weintraub\u2019s 70-worder will fall for you with just enough resistance to make this a really enjoyable start to your solving weekend.In particular, I liked the stacks of 10 in the NW and SE. JEDI MASTER went in right away, and I also like ALOHA STATE, CHORUS LINE, DO ME A FAVOR, SHALLOW END and, best of all, the debut of MIRACLE MAX, a fabulous character played by Billy Crystal in \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d:Beyond the stacks, there are many delicious words and phrases in this grid: JURASSIC, I\u2019M GAME, ELIXIR, I HATE IT, ANACONDA, LOGJAM, HANGOVER, CASE LAW, MAKE DO, MOREL and SNERD, just for the sound if it.There were two places where Ms. Weintraub\u2019s puzzle pushed back at me. The first was at 24A, \u201cHow garden vegetables may be planted\u201d: My first try was IN SOIL, then IN ROWS, neither of which worked. The answer is IN A ROW. The second place was at 49D, \u201cInterest of a mycologist.\u201d On this one, I went broad and filled in FUNGI. The answer, MOREL, was much more specific.Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this one and hope to see more from Ms. Weintraub soon.\u2022 11A: A \u201cCommunication problem?\u201d is not merely of the \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d variety. Email counts as communication, and today, SPAM is the problem.\u2022 19A: Think opposites here. \u201cIt\u2019s not a welcome sign\u201d can mean an outcome that is not good news, or it could be much more simple than that. If it\u2019s not a welcome sign, it\u2019s probably an EXIT sign.\u2022 20A and 22A: These two similar clues rely on the confusion some people have between a WEBSITE and an APP. Facebook is both a WEBSITE and an APP.\u2022 61A: Even if you are not an architecture buff, you might want to learn the names of two prominent architects who come up fairly regularly in crossword puzzles: EERO Saarinen and I. M. Pei.\u2022 13D: \u201cWrapper that\u2019s hard to remove?\u201d is not gift-wrapping today. It\u2019s an ANACONDA, which wraps itself around its victims and doesn\u2019t let go until dinner is ready.\u2022 31D: \u201cLab report?\u201d is not the results of a blood test. She is not a Labrador retriever, but my dog, the Extremely Spunky Border Terrier, reports on everything going on in the neighborhood by BARKing.\u2022 32D: Another common crossword trick! The word \u201ctermination\u201d is your clue here. \u201cPay termination?\u201d sounds like someone\u2019s been fired, but today it means a possible suffix that might go at the end of the word \u201cpay.\u201d And that suffix is -OLA, as in \u201cpayOLA.\u201dAs for the fill, one would think I was a big \u201cStar Wars\u201d fan, starting with 1A JEDI MASTER, plus the cameo appearance of an EWOK at 53A. Truth be told, I\u2019ve never seen a single one of those movies. However, I do adore MIRACLE MAX from \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d so I\u2019m glad he has finally made an appearance in the New York Times crossword.Hope you enjoy this puzzle, and have fun storming the castle!Thank you, Ms. Weintraub.

{"Headline": "First Christian Borle Gets Serious. Then He\u2019ll Be Wonka.", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byThe actor Christian Borle needs to apologize to his neighbors.The sound of weeping that bleeds from his apartment most weekends may be troubling some of the other residents. \u201cMy neighbors are, I think, confused by what I\u2019m going through in life,\u201d he said.\u201cSo yeah,\u201d he explained on a recent walk through Central Park, \u201cI\u2019ve been pretty sad for the last month or so, but also incredibly happy to be doing it.\u201dIncredibly happy and incredibly busy. Not long after he leaves \u201cFalsettos,\u201d on Jan. 8, he\u2019ll begin rehearsals for the Broadway production of \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d in which he\u2019ll play the impish confectioner Willy Wonka.Mr. Borle had dressed for the walk in unfussy attire \u2014 a thermal undershirt, gray jeans, scuffed boots, a scurf of razor burn \u2014 a far cry from Wonka\u2019s plum-colored finery. He was dryly funny and unnervingly charming. To talk with him is to be held in a tractor beam of pure charisma. Yet he also radiated a Marvin-like sense of something kept private beneath the magnetism, a gravity beyond the jokes. He spent the whole of the long stroll masked behind a pair of aviator sunglasses. Maybe his eyes were puffy from crying.This is not to say that Marvin is an exact fit for the rest of him, though the two men share an ineptitude at baseball. (The walk skirted the Central Park ball fields, where a scene from \u201cFalsettos\u201d is set. The fields were closed. Mr. Borle did not seem disappointed.) But Mr. Borle is not gay or Jewish. He doesn\u2019t entirely identify as a New Yorker, having spent the first 21 years of his life in Pittsburgh, a city he loves. He isn\u2019t even especially neurotic, though he\u2019ll admit to having a therapist.He has a distinctive face, with a nose that sallies forth, a chin that hangs back and a daredevil grin in between. He refers to his bright, brazen singing voice as \u201cthe horn.\u201d There\u2019s discipline in his work, but also something less predictable, an impetuous electrical current that powers his performances.\u201cHe\u2019s a scientist of comedy,\u201d Mr. Elice said, \u201cand he wants to know what the formula is.\u201dBut was this inventiveness enough for Mr. Lapine, the director of the \u201cFalsettos\u201d revival? Had hiring a straight man named Christian to play a quintessential gay Jew given him any pause?\u201cOh God, no. No. Not at all,\u201d he said during a break from rehearsals. He had championed Mr. Borle for the part even with the knowledge that his commitment to the big-budget \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d would prevent him from appearing in any extension. \u201cHe is just a lot of fun to be with, and doesn\u2019t appear to suffer for his art,\u201d Mr. Lapine said. (Apparently no one has told him about the sobbing.)It might seem a challenge for Mr. Borle to take on this more realistic role. It is. It\u2019s been nearly a decade since he last played even a remotely regular guy, Emmett Forrest, in that apex of stage naturalism \u201cLegally Blonde.\u201d His subsequent parts have depended on his emphatically extravagant comedy. Ben Brantley recently described him as \u201ca master of carefully stylized excess.\u201dThese qualities make his casting as Willy Wonka a walkover. Douglas Hodge had originated the role, to mixed reviews, in London, but Jack O\u2019Brien, the director of the New York production, wanted a different star for Broadway. He auditioned other actors. Only Mr. Borle had the right mix of \u201cinnocence and menace and mystery and charm\u201d that echoed the work of Gene Wilder, Mr. O\u2019Brien said. For his part, Mr. Borle said he hopes to emphasize the \u201chumanity and sweetness\u201d of the role rather than its more sinister, eccentric qualities.Mr. Borle works hard in rehearsal and possibly harder at home. He typically labors alone for three or four hours at night, \u201cjust thinking and pacing,\u201d he said. But he had trouble sleeping without the help of marijuana, so he\u2019s shifted these sessions to the morning, \u201ctackling the sung-through score, drilling lyrics and notes,\u201d he said.He has learned from directors like Mr. Rees and Mike Nichols to dial back some of his excess. For Marvin he\u2019s taking that reticence further, trying to find his cruelty, his petulance, his spite. This is a character who can sing, \u201cSo, I\u2019ll cheat, Whizzer, and I\u2019ll shove, and I\u2019ll kill for that thrill of first love.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s meaner than I am,\u201d Mr. Borle said, \u201cwhich has been fascinating to explore.\u201dYet Mr. Borle\u2019s allure has a way of softening and brightening Marvin. As Andrew Rannells, who plays Whizzer, explained, Mr. Borle helps to make sense of a character everyone seems to adore, even as he acts in manipulative ways. \u201cChristian brings this real likability, a sensitivity, to this guy,\u201d Mr. Rannells said. \u201cI understand why I\u2019m in love with him now.\u201dIn Central Park, Mr. Borle was still a few days away from the first preview of \u201cFalsettos.\u201d He was looking forward to finding his preshow routines \u2014 when to leave for the theater, when to eat, how much coffee to have. \u201cWhich is a lot,\u201d he said. Repetition and the schedule comfort him, as does punctuality. \u201cIt\u2019s the Swiss in me,\u201d he said.He had yet to play the show all the way through and to take his curtain call. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d feel then, but he imagined those feelings would be pretty extreme. Those in adjoining dressing rooms should probably prepare for some bawling. Mr. Borle guessed that after that he would \u201cprobably get rid of all the tears and snot and then have a bourbon on the rocks.\u201d And then get ready, happily, to do it all again the next day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Letters to the Editor", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byWhat Happened at YaltaTo the Editor:Olson writes of Stalin: \u201cHis only concession was language in the Yalta agreement promising early elections in Poland and a government that included a few non-Communist members. In their roseate statement about the conference\u2019s results, the three leaders misleadingly proclaimed a \u2018common desire to see established a strong, free, independent and democratic Poland.\u2019\u201cWithin days of Roosevelt\u2019s return to Washington, Stalin had already begun to renege on what little he had promised. In addition to postponing Polish elections and rejecting the names of non-Communist Polish leaders proposed for the new government, he ordered the arrest and imprisonment of thousands of Poles.\u201dWhile the Yalta accord did call for elections in Poland, it contained no means to assure their fairness, nor even any firm date by which they might be held. And while, in his main concession to Roosevelt, Stalin did agree to sign the American \u201cJoint Declaration for a Liberated Europe,\u201d in which the three powers announced their \u201cdetermination to build in cooperation with other peace-loving nations a world order under law, dedicated to peace, security, freedom and general well-being of all mankind,\u201d this too was meaningless rhetoric designed for American domestic consumption. Nowhere were any of these terms defined.Within the upper reaches of the American government, this was widely understood. For instance, Admiral Leahy, the president\u2019s chief of staff, complained to Roosevelt upon departing from Yalta that the agreement\u2019s language on Poland was \u201cso elastic that the Russians can stretch it all the way from Yalta to Washington without ever technically breaking it.\u201d \u201cI know, Bill,\u201d Roosevelt responded. \u201cBut it is the best I can do for Poland at this time.\u201d Moreover, American negotiators were not at all surprised by this turn of events. Writing from the embassy in Moscow, the young diplomat and budding Sovietologist George F. Kennan recommended to Roosevelt before his departure that the United States \u201cshould drop all thoughts of free elections in Poland and Eastern Europe because it would be impossible to achieve this when the Russian armies entered the area, and it would only irritate Moscow unnecessarily.\u201dNo one would argue that the Soviets held to the \u201cspirit\u201d of the Yalta accords with their brutal behavior in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. But even allowing for some misunderstanding and ambiguity on the American side regarding Poland, it was the United States that undertook the first indisputable repudiation of the agreement\u2019s letter. Roosevelt and Stalin had agreed there that only countries that had declared war on Nazi Germany by March 1 would be admitted to the General Assembly. But once the U.N. talks got underway in San Francisco, the United States went back on its word and voted to seat Argentina, which had failed to meet that rather generous deadline \u2014 a decision promoted by Nelson Rockefeller, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. The pro-Soviet Polish government arrested 16 prominent anti-Communist Poles on trumped-up charges shortly thereafter.ERIC ALTERMANNEW YORKThe writer is a professor of English and journalism at Brooklyn College.\u2b25Looking Backward To the Editor:This implies that Stephen Hawking\u2019s 1992 article \u201cThe Chronology Protection Conjecture\u201d was the definitive answer to the question of pastward time travel, denying its possibility and putting the question to rest. But if anything, Hawking\u2019s conjecture served to reinvigorate the debate. Some theoretical physicists suggested that the difficulties Hawking posited were exaggerated; others suggested means by which they might be circumvented. One physicist \u2014 Igor Novikov \u2014 found that pastward time travel need not violate cause and effect or introduce the causal paradoxes that bedevil philosophers, and might be circumscribed by a \u201cprinciple of self-consistency\u201d in which one can travel to the past but cannot change it. In a co-authored 1998 paper, Hawking gave some ground, replacing the mechanism by which chronology would be protected with a mathematical improbability, concluding that the chance that appropriately curved space might be turned into a time machine was real, although infinitesimally small.By the end of the 1990s, most physicists working in the area agreed that the mechanism that protected chronology, if it existed, lay at the \u201cchronology horizon,\u201d the boundary separating the region in which pastward time travel is impossible from the region in which it may be possible. This happened to be a place where the semiclassical Einstein equations with which physicists explain and understand our universe simply do not work. There was no way to know what was going on at the horizon other than through the as yet undiscovered \u201ctheory of everything\u201d that promises the unification of all physical laws. Until physicists have such a theory they cannot understand the chronology horizon, and until they understand it, they cannot know whether pastward time travel is impossible \u2014 or possible.DAVID TOOMEYAMHERST, MASS.The writer, a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is the author of \u201cThe New Time Travelers: A Journey to the Frontiers of Physics.\u201d\u2b25Letters may be edited for length and clarity.

European powers that wanted to populate their New World possessions, as well as Canada and the United States in their youth, gave land to anyone who would settle on it and make improvements.All of that was far from mind when Jim and Ferne Austin decided to turn their store over to their daughters this year. For the two women, Ms. MacLean and Heather Austin Coulombe, the most immediate concern was where to find employees.\u201cWe were in a panic, we were so short staffed,\u201d Ms. Coulombe said.The Austins opened the business, the Farmer\u2019s Daughter Country Market, in 1992 in Whycocomagh, Nova Scotia, after a life spent dairy farming. The combination bakery, produce market, ice cream parlor, fudge factory and gift shop now occupies a collection of barn-red buildings along the side of the road on a quiet stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway.Mr. Austin\u2019s father, also a dairy farmer, had amassed more than 600 acres; after sell-offs, about 200 acres remain. The land that is left is mostly mountain woodland \u2014 pretty to see, but not of much value unless it were logged. No one in the family wants to shave the hillsides for that.By the end of this summer, the country market was down by three full-time workers, making it difficult to meet a local grocery chain\u2019s demand for baked goods from the Farmer\u2019s Daughter. The baking business helps the operation stay afloat in the bleak winter months.Ms. MacLean and Ms. Coulombe tried hiring locally, but said capable and dependable hands were not available. The visa process for foreign workers was too cumbersome, too.That was when they came up with the idea of giving away land.The women put together a questionnaire that emphasized commitment and values and made it clear that the land they were giving away was remote and well off the grid.In about 500 words they offered a job, community and two acres of land to anyone who would come and work at the market for five years. They have since raised the offer to three acres to allow for a septic system.By morning, the appeal had been shared 200 times. By afternoon, a local radio station had called for an interview. Soon national radio and television stations were calling and the land offer was the top trending news story on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s website. When the report was picked up around the world, the floodgates opened.The sisters had already zeroed in on several candidates well before their appeal went viral. Within a week of the original post, they had interviewed the people they eventually hired.The newcomers consist of three families: the Andersens, the Walkinses and the Taits, who arrived in time for Canada\u2019s Thanksgiving on Oct. 10. The Austins, the parents of the sisters who are taking over the store, invited them all to their home for a traditional feast, the biggest Thanksgiving dinner they had ever put on, they said.Over plates of turkey and turnips and local condiments like the Farmer\u2019s Daughter Cape Breton chow (a relish made with green tomatoes), the families appeared to blend effortlessly.All three families said that it was the promise of community in a simpler, beautiful place that was the biggest attraction. Each parcel of land is worth only a few thousand Canadian dollars, and Cape Breton has plenty of land for sale.\u201cI never even asked about the land,\u201d said Sonja Andersen, a mortgage broker who drove nine days across the country from Vancouver, British Columbia, with her 10-year-old daughter and two dogs.Micah Tait said that he and his wife, Trish, had long dreamed of making such a move. \u201cEverything was exactly what we were hoping to work toward, and we just took a sort of shortcut,\u201d he said.Both said they missed the \u201cfeeling of belonging\u201d in their life in Vancouver, where they worked as security guards.When Brett Walkins lost his job in British Columbia as a project manager building wastewater treatment plants, he and his wife, Kerry, sold their house, bought a truck and a camper-trailer, and headed down the North American coast.Months later, having traversed the continent with two children and two dogs, they were on Prince Edward Island, west of Cape Breton, biting their nails over bidding on a new house.\u201cAn hour after we found out someone else had bought the house, I saw the Farmer\u2019s Daughter post,\u201d Ms. Walkins said. Mr. Walkins emailed that day under the subject line \u201ccommunity opportunity.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what spoke to me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be welcomed into what we could tell was a close-knit family.\u201dMr. Walkins has already walked on the land, accessible by a muddy logging road, looking for a building site, while his wife has taken up her duties baking pies and making fudge. The couple plan to construct a solar-powered, self-sustaining home.The new arrivals have challenges ahead. They arrived in the midst of Cape Breton\u2019s beautiful fall foliage display, but a long frigid winter and then the region\u2019s famous black fly season await.Along with an uptick in business, the publicity has had other consequences for the Farmer\u2019s Daughter. A local couple have offered the sisters 42 acres they do not use. Television producers have called to talk about a possible reality show or, more to the sisters\u2019 tastes, a documentary series tracking the newcomers\u2019 integration into the community and their development of the land.The Whycocomagh Journal article on Oct. 21, about a land-rich family on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, who had an overwhelming response to their offer of free land to anyone who would work at their country store for five years, misspelled the surname of one of the families who took the offer. They are the Andersens, not the Andersons. The same error appeared in a picture caption with the article. Because of an editing error, the article also misstated the occupation of Sonja Andersen, one of the arrivals. She is a mortgage broker, not a former mortgage banker.Advertisement"}

Forgotten now for this and other good deeds, Allen was the sort of strong, clearsighted, effective individual that seems lacking at ground zero.The new, smaller World Trade Center footprint is a place of surprising rebirth, including, for example, the intersection of Greenwich and Dey Streets, which disappeared under the original footprint. At that intersection on a January day in 1810, a mother helped her child take water from a public well; the scene was exquisitely painted in watercolor by a French exile who lived across the street. After an absence of several decades, that intersection is back. The well is long gone, of course, but the location conveys a sense that even a place of sudden trauma like ground zero contains history that is not evident but perpetually informs its existence.GERARD KOEPPELNEW YORKThe writer is the author, most recently, of \u201cCity on a Grid: How New York Became New York.\u201d\u2b25Black RepublicansTo the Editor:The second group espoused a philosophy indistinguishable from the right wing of the Republican Party and included the likes of Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams and others.

Mr. Trump, who was 59 at the time he made the remarks, went on to disparage the woman, whom he did not name, saying, \u201cI did try and fuck her. She was married,\u201d and saying, \u201cShe\u2019s now got the big phony tits and everything.\u201dHours before his video apology, Mr. Trump released a statement on Friday afternoon expressing regret \u201cif anyone was offended\u201d by his comments, but he tried to play down the tape as a snippet of \u201clocker room banter.\u201dHis running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, brushed off the banter at a rally in Rossford, Ohio. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, this time we got him,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cThis time we got another thing, another issue that\u2019s come forward. Then they turn on the next television the next morning, and Donald Trump is still standing stronger than ever before and fighting for the American people.\u201dBut Mr. Pence also telephoned Mr. Trump on Friday night and urged him to show humility, according to an adviser to the nominee who requested anonymity to reveal a private conversation. (Mr. Trump had already decided to apologize when Mr. Pence called, the adviser noted.)How the two top Republicans in Congress have responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments.Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, issued a statement late Friday night calling on Mr. Trump to express contrition \u2014 and possibly offering other Senate Republicans cover to disavow the nominee if he refused to apologize.\u201cAs the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.While neither Mr. Ryan nor Mr. McConnell immediately withdrew formal support for Mr. Trump, Republican leaders in Washington held anguished discussions throughout the evening about how the party should proceed with a badly wounded and potentially toxic nominee. They cannot remove their nominee from the ticket, but some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to step down voluntarily, including Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, who previously said he would not support Mr. Trump, and Representatives Mike Coffman of Colorado and Barbara Comstock of Virginia.Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly attacked and mocked Mrs. Clinton\u2019s marriage in recent weeks, also sought to implicate Bill Clinton in his coarse conduct.And in his video apology later, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve said some foolish things. But there\u2019s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.\u201dMr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Mrs. Clinton over her husband\u2019s affairs and how she responded to them.The disclosure of the recording comes at the end of a punishing two weeks, during which Mr. Trump has faced intense backlash over his treatment of women and intensifying scrutiny of his personal finances and views on national security.Which statements caused Republicans to bail on Donald Trump.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign condemned Mr. Trump forcefully for the comments captured on the recording. Her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said in response to the remarks, \u201cIt makes me sick to my stomach.\u201d\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s statements are beyond offensive & despicable,\u201d Mr. Herbert wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhile I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump.\u201dMr. Trump had already been on the defensive on Friday after telling CNN that he still believed the exonerated defendants known as the Central Park Five were guilty of a 1989 rape of a female jogger despite DNA evidence to the contrary that later overturned their convictions. Earlier in the day, he also asserted, again without evidence, that the Obama administration was allowing illegal immigrants to enter the country in order to vote in November.For Republicans on the ballot this fall, the uproar over Mr. Trump\u2019s past statements about women touched off an agonizing political cycle, marked by partial denunciations of Mr. Trump \u2014 and demands from Democrats that their denunciations go further. Republican candidates for the House and Senate, and for governorships across the country, chastised Mr. Trump sternly but stopped short of renouncing him as their choice for the presidency.One Republican senator seeking re-election, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was criticized this week when she called Mr. Trump a role model for children, said his comments were \u201ctotally inappropriate and offensive.\u201dMs. Ayotte, one of the most prominent women in the party, was facing immense pressure Friday night from other Republicans to disavow Mr. Trump entirely, and was said to be considering it. In an illustration of the Democratic onslaught, her opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, called Mr. Trump\u2019s comments inexcusable.\u201cIt is beyond comprehension how Senator Ayotte could continue to support this man for the highest office in the land, let alone call him a role model,\u201d Ms. Hassan said.Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, said, \u201cThere are no excuses for Donald Trump\u2019s offensive and demeaning comments.\u201d He was clearly worried about how they might affect his own re-election campaign, adding, \u201cHe alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences.\u201d\u201cIn a campaign cycle that has been nothing but a race to the bottom \u2014 at such a critical moment for our nation \u2014 and with so many who have tried to be respectful of a record primary vote, the time has come for Governor Pence to lead the ticket,\u201d Mr. Huntsman told the newspaper.Temple Taggart, Miss Utah in 1997, was uncomfortable with how forward Mr. Trump was with young contestants like her in his first year as the owner of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner.\u201cHe kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, \u2018Oh, my God. Gross.\u2019 He was married to Marla Maples at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s inappropriate.\u201dDawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, suggested Mr. Trump had discussed committing a violent crime in his 2005 conversation with Mr. Bush.\u201cWhat Trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault,\u201d said Ms. Laguens. \u201cTrump\u2019s behavior is disgusting and unacceptable in any context, and it is disqualifying for a man who is running for president of this country.\u201dThe recording of Mr. Trump talking to Mr. Bush was made as they sat on a bus on the set of a soap opera where Mr. Trump was making a cameo appearance. The conversation was recorded after he had married Melania Trump, his third and current wife. At one point, the conversation in the video was interrupted when an actress arrived to take Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush to the set.

It is possible because of growing inequality and existential dread, especially among the white losers from globalization who know minorities will be the majority in the United States by midcentury.

It is possible because the Clinton family has been in the White House and cozy with the rich and close to the summit of a discredited political establishment for a quarter-century now and, to people who want change or bridle at dynastic privilege, that makes Hillary Clinton an unattractive candidate.

He had been staying at a hostel in Mandalay on Sept. 23 when a nearby Buddhist center began broadcasting the recitations of religious devotees.\u201cI was really tired that night and woke up to the noise,\u201d Mr. Haijtema told the court during a hearing last week. \u201cI was very angry and assumed that children were playing music. I told them to lower the volume of the loudspeakers before I unplugged the amplifier, and they didn\u2019t understand me. That\u2019s why I unplugged it.\u201dMr. Haijtema wept after the prison sentence was announced. He was also fined the equivalent of $80 for violating the terms of his entry visa, which require visitors to obey Myanmar\u2019s laws and customs. Myanmar is a predominantly Buddhist country, and Mandalay is a relatively conservative city.Mr. Haijtema\u2019s lawyer, U Hla Ko, said that he would file an appeal and that the Dutch Embassy should ask for Mr. Haijtema\u2019s release. Attempts to contact an embassy representative on Thursday afternoon were unsuccessful.Buddhist organizations in Myanmar often use loudspeakers at high volume to broadcast sermons, perform rituals or solicit donations, and many social media users took Mr. Haijtema\u2019s side after his arrest was reported.Two lawyers not involved with the case said the Buddhist center, or dharma community hall, that woke Mr. Haijtema appeared to have violated the law by using loudspeakers after 9 p.m. The law also bans their use before 6 a.m. and requires a permit.\u201cThe one that broke the law is the dharma community hall, not the Dutch man,\u201d said one lawyer, U Zaw Win.The leader of the Buddhist center, U Kyaw San, said in court last week that Mr. Haijtema had worn his shoes into the center, which Buddhists consider an offense in a sacred place. Mr. Haijtema said that he was unaware that the building had a religious purpose and that he had seen no signs telling people to remove their shoes.A resident who lives near the center, Ko Hla Myo Aung, said that there were six others in his ward and that all of them broadcast chants at high volume late at night and early in the morning.\u201cIf the Buddha were still alive, he would go deaf from the noise from the loudspeakers,\u201d Mr. Hla Myo Aung said.Advertisement"}

Just not so much when the future is a few weeks away.Mr. Thiel, a gay, self-made billionaire immigrant libertarian, also spoke at the Republican convention in July.

This is real.\u2019\u201dRid of the pastor, the government soon began a wider crackdown on social media.It raised prices on cellphone data, immediately curtailing the ability of opposition parties and activists to organize via social media applications like WhatsApp.And it is pressing ahead with comprehensive legislation that would allow the police to intercept data, seize electronic equipment and arrest people on loosely defined charges of \u201cinsurgency\u201d and \u201cterrorism.\u201dZimbabwe has joined a growing list of African nations that have curbed social media in the last year.Fearing the power that social media gives to rivals, activists and ordinary citizens, governments in Gabon, the Republic of Congo, Chad, Uganda, Burundi and Ethiopia have switched off access to the internet for days or weeks, including during elections. Even Ghana, a standard-bearer for democracy on the continent, is considering restricting social media in elections next month.The pushback comes as the use of social media continues to spread across the continent and tech companies increasingly look to sub-Saharan Africa for growth. With many Africans still offline, Africa has a large, untapped market, and is the continent with the world\u2019s fastest-growing population.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, paid his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa in August even as Zimbabwe and other African nations were moving to curb their citizens\u2019 use of social media. Facebook and WhatsApp, which is also controlled by Mr. Zuckerberg, have become the favorite tools of many political activists.Supa Mandiwanzira, Zimbabwe\u2019s information technology minister, said the government\u2019s proposed legislation, the Computer Crime and Cyber Crime Bill, was not meant to control people\u2019s use of social media.\u201cThe problem comes when you use social media to promote anarchy and civil disorder,\u201d Mr. Mandiwanzira said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal, and legal consequences will naturally follow.\u201dBut Nelson Chamisa, who served as the information technology minister during a coalition government between 2009 and 2013, said Mr. Mugabe\u2019s government had shown little interest in the bill until the recent protests. Now, he said, the government is rushing ahead with a \u201creactionary, panic bill.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bill meant to try to curtail social media, which is a new flank, a new war zone,\u201d said Mr. Chamisa, now a vice president of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.It was during Mr. Chamisa\u2019s tenure, when his party oversaw the telecom industry, that the use of mobile access to the internet skyrocketed in Zimbabwe.Chris Musonza, an independent technology expert, said SIM cards had sold for up to $180 before the changes carried out during the coalition government. Under Mr. Chamisa, the price of SIM cards dropped to 50 cents, and the use of cellphones spread quickly thanks to the removal of import duties and other policy changes.In 2010, fewer than 5 percent of Zimbabweans had access to the internet, according to the government. In early 2016, nearly 50 percent did, with most people connecting to the internet through their cellphones.That increase has profoundly altered the political dynamics. Social media made possible rapid and very cheap dissemination of information in Zimbabwe, where there is only one television network, the state-owned ZBC. More important, it allowed many Zimbabweans to freely express political opinions in a state where Mr. Mugabe\u2019s ZANU-PF party has a long history of violently crushing any critics.Zimbabweans first began using Facebook for those purposes around 2012. But it was the increasing popularity of WhatsApp in 2015, and its explosive growth this year, that brought social media\u2019s power to the government\u2019s attention. According to government figures, in late 2015, WhatsApp data bundles accounted for 34 percent of all mobile data used, with Facebook coming in second, with 3 percent.Zimbabwean activists attribute the popularity of WhatsApp to the anonymity it gives its users. WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in 2014 and has more than a billion users worldwide, strengthened privacy for users in April with full end-to-end encryption, though many technology experts expressed worries last month after WhatsApp announced that it would start sharing data with Facebook.\u201cWhatsApp was a big game-changer \u2014 not even us users knew what it was doing in the beginning,\u201d Mr. Mawarire, the pastor, said. He explained that the information shared in a single WhatsApp chat group tended to spread exponentially. \u201cWhen I thought I was talking to a circle of friends, there was a huge, huge network of other people that fed off each of my friends,\u201d he said.The political parties seized on it as a way to organize.\u201cSocial media platforms have made communication easier and cheaper for our party youths in organizing meetings at all levels,\u201d said Mphehlabayo Malinga, ZANU-PF\u2019s youth secretary for foreign affairs, accusing opposition parties of using social media \u201cto fan violence and divisions in the country as they denigrate national leadership.\u201dLovemore Chinoputsa, the secretary general for the Movement for Democratic Change\u2019s youth wing, said Facebook remained popular in the cities where support for the opposition was strongest. But because WhatsApp requires less bandwidth, it is also used by people in rural areas \u2014 Mr. Mugabe\u2019s traditional strongholds.\u201cThanks to WhatsApp, we\u2019ve been able to reach more and more people in rural areas,\u201d Mr. Chinoputsa said. \u201cIt started last year, but the dividends are beginning to be realized now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an internet of dirty and filthy language,\u201d he said. \u201cI just hear these things as I am told by others. I have no perception nor any interest of wanting to have direct links with the internet.\u201dBut in the following months \u2014 as Mr. Mawarire exploded onto the political scene and opposition parties organized protests through social media \u2014 the Zimbabwean government responded. On July 6, as the capital became a ghost town in the biggest day of protest in a decade, access to social media was interrupted for several hours.The government, which denied cutting service, warned that people using social media to spread \u201csubversive\u201d messages would be arrested. A month later, without any explanation, the government suspended data bundles, making it more expensive for people to use WhatsApp and other social media on their phones.\u201cWe noticed the change immediately,\u201d Mr. Chinoputsa, the opposition official, said. He estimated that communication with supporters has gone down about 20 percent.The crackdown on Mr. Mawarire and social media has had a chilling effect, activists said. Ordinary Zimbabweans, who participated in the protest on July 6, have stopped joining protests since then, lessening the pressure on the government. Recent protests have been led by a few hundred activists and opposition party supporters.\u201cWhat we can do on social media is vent our anger and displeasure,\u201d said Patson Dzamara, 30, a prominent activist whose brother, Itai, also an activist, has been missing for the last year. \u201cBut that\u2019s not enough. We have to take the fight into the streets and tell the government, \u2018Bring it on.\u2019\u201dMr. Mugabe, ever the survivor, has awakened to social media\u2019s political promise.\u201cOur youths,\u201d Mr. Mugabe told a ZANU-PF youth group in September, \u201cshould use social media to defend the party and promote the party.\u201dJeffrey Moyo reported from Harare, and Norimitsu Onishi from Johannesburg.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vast Group of New Video Games and Hardware Jostle for Holiday Attention", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byFiguring out what to get for your video gamer friends and relatives this holiday season is about to become a lot more complicated.Over the next two months, the game industry is pushing out one of the more crowded product lineups of recent years. What\u2019s different is the sheer amount of stuff: not just blockbuster titles for gaming consoles, but also new hardware, independent games and a bigger emphasis on virtual reality.They are all jostling for attention during the end of the year, which is when around 40 percent of the industry\u2019s sales take place, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.\u201cThe lineup of hardware and software this holiday will look to some to be an evil conspiracy specifically designed to drain the wallets of hard-core gamers,\u201d Mr. Pachter said.The choices might be made even more complicated by the question of whether to buy a game title or just rent it. NPD Group, a research firm that tracks retail sales in the United States, is projecting an increase in spending on rental games from services like GameFly and Redbox, as more people opt to try titles before they purchase.The wealth of options underlines how console makers and game publishers have to work harder to keep people interested in games, especially with more entertainment options than ever. As a result, the game industry has embraced new technology like virtual reality, as well as new approaches to current products.The appearance of new consoles, for example, is notable because the hardware is coming partway through a typical five-to-seven-year cycle for new consoles.Here is more about what gamers can expect this holiday season:Seasoned gamers may opt for the Xbox One S or the PlayStation 4 Pro, both of which promise more power and a better visual experience. Nintendo\u2019s NES Classic Edition seems aimed at those who value nostalgia \u2014 the low price suggests this may be the better option for those who simply want to rediscover the joy of their gaming youth with something easy to plug in and play.So what games are set to be big this holiday season? The answer: Shooter games. Again.That category of games, where people take on the character of someone doing the shooting, has long been popular for its first-person perspective. This month, the video game publisher Electronic Arts released two shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. Activision is making its latest Call of Duty war game \u2014 this one is titled Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare \u2014 available in November.Many of these games have long lineages (the Battlefield series has been around since 2002), reflecting how unlikely it is that gamers will ever tire of shooters. Most of the games have multiplayer modes, meaning people can play with their friends. Also, there are essentially no consequences for being killed, since when you die in one of these games, you simply respawn immediately and carry on.Other games that are expected to do well this holiday season also have shooting elements. Those include a third-person shooter game, Gears of War 4 (published by Microsoft); the action adventure game Mafia III (published by Take-Two); and Watch Dogs 2, an open-world adventure game set in a fictionalized version of San Francisco (from Ubisoft).With the increased use, the quality of mobile and independent games is also improving, especially in graphics and design. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more indie titles with greater polish and the feel of a major game title,\u201d said Kate Edwards, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, a trade group.Ms. Edwards said the independent games that are getting buzz for the holiday season are Cuphead, a run-and-gun platform game drawn in the style of 1930s cartoons and inspired by the work of cartoonists like Max Fleischer (made by Studio MDHR for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One); and Overland, a survival strategy game set in post-apocalyptic North America (made by Finji for PC; $20).Others include Gang Beasts, a melee party video game (made by Boneloaf for PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 VR; $20); Hand of Fate 2, an action role-playing game (made by Defiant Development for PC and Xbox One); and Cryptark, a 2-D science-fiction shooter (made by Alientrap for PC, Mac, Linux and PlayStation 4; $15). That\u2019s right, shooter games again.Still, the games will have to work to stand out from the crowd. An average of about 500 gaming apps are released for Apple iOS devices every day, according to Pocket Gamer, a site that tracks apps offered in the App Store.\u201cMajor studios and indies alike are all creating in V.R., which means even the most jaded gamer is likely to be surprised by what comes out later this year and beyond,\u201d said Jason Rubin, head of content at Oculus, which is owned by Facebook.Interest in virtual reality games appears to be increasing, according to Mr. Rubin. Samsung Gear VR, a headset that runs on Oculus software, reported more than a million unique users for the last few months, he said.Some virtual reality games that consumers can look forward to include Rock Band VR by Harmonix, a rhythm game that lets players bust out a guitar solo in front of a bustling crowd; The Unspoken, made by Insomniac Games, which allows people to cast spells at rival magicians; and a game called Wilson\u2019s Heart, from the studio Twisted Pixel, in which players must try to escape an abandoned hospital.There will be more to come. Mr. Rubin said developers would continue to experiment with new types of virtual reality experiences, especially in multiplayer games that will plunge several people at once into the same immersive virtual environments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to stop your period", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byFor many women, periods are just a monthly nuisance. But for some of us, periods are painful and disabling, causing us to miss out on school and work and life.For the majority of my teenage years, my monthly period triggered a migraine and cramps so severe I might throw up or even blackout. I spent a lot of time lying in bed with a heating pad and popping prescription ibuprofen.I was in my early 20s before a doctor finally told me that I could stop my period altogether. It\u2019s called menstrual suppression and typically involves continuous use of birth control pills. The hormones trick the body into acting like it\u2019s pregnant, and periods stop. My quality of life improved within two months.And there are women like me, who do it to avoid painful periods, and others who simply want the better quality of life that comes from not having a monthly period. Dr. Shari Lawson, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said that \u201clooking at this continuously as a lifestyle is often the next step up\u201d from occasional period suppression.But one of the reasons many women don\u2019t try period suppression is that they\u2019ve been conditioned to believe that a monthly period is a sign of good health. In the A.R.H.P. survey, 89 percent of women said they worried that there might be long-term health effects, and 66 percent said that period suppression just didn\u2019t feel natural.It\u2019s true that women who don\u2019t have regular periods should see a doctor. But many women don\u2019t realize that if they are using a hormonal form of birth control, their monthly period is already artificially induced by stopping the hormones for seven days a month.Other women worry that suppressing their period might lead to an unnatural buildup of the uterine lining. Dr. Erin Saleeby, the chairwoman of OB-GYN at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center, said that using continuous birth control prevents that from happening.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a proliferation of that tissue,\u201d Dr. Saleeby said, \u201cand it\u2019s just not there at the same level that you would quote-unquote \u2018need to bleed.\u2019\u201dA woman who wants to suppress her periods should talk to her doctor about her options. One method involves standard oral contraceptives, which are still the most popular method of birth control. To skip a period, a woman can just skip the placebo week and start a new pack without a break. Since this will require using 17 packs a year instead of 12, Dr. Lawson said that doctors can write the prescription in a certain way to make sure the extra pills are covered by insurance.Dr. Lawson added that one birth control brand, Seasonale, is designed for period suppression \u2014 this method is designed to produce about four periods a year \u2014 and doesn\u2019t require extra packs.Other options include NuvaRing, a vaginal ring that releases a low dose of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, and can be used continuously to stop periods. Similarly, the Mirena intrauterine device releases progestin and helps lighten the uterine lining. Dr. Lawson said this is a method she often recommends because women can leave it in for years without worrying about pregnancy or heavy periods. She said about 25 percent of women who use this method will experience induced amenorrhea \u2014 or the absence of menstruation \u2014 after one year, and 50 percent after two years.Depo-Provera is an injectable form of birth control that contains a time-release dose of progestin to prevent pregnancy, but also lowers the frequency of periods.But regardless of the method, making the choice to stop a period doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the transition will be perfect: Breakthrough bleeding or spotting can be common, Dr. Saleeby said. As far as risks, Dr. Saleeby said that there are no known risks for using birth control continuously beyond the side effect profile that already exists for the drug.Hoping to hear more about the secrets of period suppression, I conducted an informal poll among my Facebook friends. I heard from a dozen women, from co-workers to my oldest friends, who all told me that they had suppressed their periods either occasionally or for a matter of years.Abi Wood, a 32-year-old law student who lives in St. Louis, told me that she opted for Mirena three years ago, after trying pills and the NuvaRing, to cope with an irregular and painful period.\u201cI would get terrible mood swings, cramps, night sweats,\u201d she said. \u201cI basically felt like I was going through early menopause in my late 20s.\u201dBefore Ms. Wood started Mirena, she dreaded school exams and going to work during her period. After about a year of using the device, her period stopped.\u201cEveryone is different, but honestly, it just lifted a lot of stress off me not to worry about it,\u201d she said.I also heard from women who are still trying to find the method that is right for them. One friend told me that she\u2019d tried period suppression, but birth control pills made her feel too depressed. Another said she occasionally suppresses her period when she has work trips. And another friend, Suzy Piper, a 31-year-old who works in communications and lives in St. Paul, told me that she\u2019s been trying different types of oral contraception to suppress her periods because of monthly migraines. The results, she said, have been mixed.Ms. Piper said she has \u201cstuck with the pill because I\u2019ve always taken it.\u201d She said the pills have resulted in lighter periods and less cramping, but monthly headaches are still an issue.In my informal survey, I found that period suppression can be a complicated process that requires some research and testing, but one that ultimately outweighs the more negative symptoms that can be associated with having a period.Dr. Lawson said the key to successful period suppression begins with telling your doctor that you\u2019re interested in safely stopping menstruation. Then, keep working together until you find a method that feels right for you. You might also be interested in:Advertisement"}

Riad Abdullah, a former imam known for his extremist views, was arrested and charged with premeditated murder. Mr. Hattar\u2019s family is outraged, saying the government failed to protect the writer, despite being alerted of multiple death threats.The cartoon, which depicted a bearded man, presumably in heaven, in bed with two women asking God to bring him wine and cashews, provoked an uproar in Jordan, where many saw the image as blasphemous. Though Mr. Hattar quickly removed the cartoon, deactivated his Facebook account and apologized, Jordanian authorities charged him with the crimes of \u201cinciting sectarian strife\u201d and insulting \u201cother people\u2019s religious feelings.\u201dThese charges further inflamed reactions against Mr. Hattar\u2019s cartoon. \u201cBy detaining him and taking him to court, they criminalized his action, putting him in the cross hairs, and legitimized the space needed for the crazies to respond,\u201d wrote Naseem Tarawnah, a Jordanian blogger.

{"Headline": "At a Loss for Meds, Venezuela\u2019s Mentally Ill Spiral Downward", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byMARACAY, Venezuela \u2014 The voices tormenting Accel Simeone kept getting louder.The country\u2019s last supplies of antipsychotic medication were vanishing, and Mr. Simeone had gone weeks without the drug that controls his schizophrenia.Reality was disintegrating with each passing day. The sounds in his head soon became people, with names. They were growing in number, crowding the tiny home he shared with his family, yelling obscenities into his ears.Now the voices demanded that he kill his brother.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d recalled Mr. Simeone, 25.He took an electric grinder from the family\u2019s garage. He switched it on.But then, to spare his brother, he attacked himself instead, slicing into his own arm until his father raced in and grabbed the grinder from his bloody hands.Now, thousands of mental health patients \u2014 many of whom had been living relatively normal lives under medication \u2014 are drifting into despair and psychosis because the country has run out of the vast majority of psychiatric medicines, leaving families and doctors powerless to help them, medical experts say.Food shortages had left one older schizophrenic man emaciated, like a walking skeleton in a concentration camp. An epileptic man bereft of medication fell into repeated seizures, while another untreated patient lay strapped to a bed, bound at the ankles. An older woman with no drugs to control her schizophrenia crawled across the floor, past a hungry patient eating fruit that had fallen into a pool of open sewage.But most patients around the country are in the hands of families like the Simeones, doctors say. Family members must choose between going to work and watching over their loved ones. It is a life of searching for increasingly rare drugs, desperately hoping their relatives do not harm themselves, or others, the moment someone looks away.\u201cWhen I heard that he could hurt his brother, that broke me,\u201d said Evelin de Simeone, Accel\u2019s mother, recounting the day in June her son grabbed the electric grinder.The consequence: About 85 percent of psychiatric medicines are now unavailable in Venezuela, according to the country\u2019s top pharmaceutical trade group.For some, the lack of drugs has brought tragedy. On June 30, Yolanda Sayago, a 63-year-old with severe depression, went to the ninth floor of a building in the city of San Crist\u00f3bal and climbed onto a ledge. In her last moments, captured in a video that now circulates on YouTube, Ms. Sayago looks down once, leans forward and, with her arms spread, leaps to her death.She had spent months unable to find antidepressants, said her son, Jes\u00fas Guill\u00e9n, 43, who works for the state electricity company. She fell into a depressive relapse that pushed her toward suicide, he said.\u201cShe was always saying medicines were impossible to find here,\u201d Mr. Guill\u00e9n said.Hobbled by such shortages, Venezuela\u2019s mental institutions now care for only a small portion of the patients they did a few years ago. In 2013, there were 23,630 long-term psychiatric patients in public hospitals, but only 5,558 last year, according to a report from the Health Ministry.Publicly, the Venezuelan government denies that its hospitals are suffering, and has refused multiple offers of international medical aid.But at the invitation of doctors, journalists from The New York Times visited six psychiatric wards across the country. All reported shortages not only of medicines, but of food.In El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n Hospital, the converted mansion of a former Venezuelan dictator in Caracas, the capital, only two patients remained, despite a capacity for 40. Doctors were turning away anyone hoping to be admitted because food had not arrived regularly in months.In Dr. Jos\u00e9 Ortega Dur\u00e1n Psychiatric Hospital in Valencia, an 18-year-old schizophrenic man was tied to a metal chair. Hospital workers said it was necessary because they had no medications to treat him.In El Pampero Hospital, Jusmar Torres ran out of medication for a mood disorder and depression weeks ago. Now she was sitting behind bars in solitary confinement. She had been there, naked, for four days. Hospital staff members had stripped her because they feared she would hang herself.Weeks later, a paranoid schizophrenic who ran out of medication threw herself on top of a bunkmate at night and bit off the woman\u2019s nose.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me, I did not do it,\u201d said the schizophrenic patient, pacing a dank solitary confinement cell with bars as nurses kept their distance.Down the hall, the victim sat with her face covered in bandages, writhing in pain. All the nurses could offer her was an anti-inflammatory medicine similar to ibuprofen. A mosquito net blocked the swarms of flies drawn to her wound. Dogs and cats roamed the halls. The smell of urine hung in the air.\u201cThis is too hard,\u201d said the victim\u2019s sister, Doris Villegas, gasping at the injury. \u201cI look for her medicines, but I can\u2019t find them now.\u201dThe screams of Emiliana Rodr\u00edguez, another schizophrenic patient, echoed. She had little food and no medication for her glaucoma, leaving her hardly able to see. She could barely acknowledge those around her, but for a moment focused.\u201cI\u2019m not crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201dEvila Garc\u00eda, the head nurse, looked up in anguish at the patients who had been left at the hospital.\u201cNo one wants a crazy person at their house,\u201d she said.That is not the case for Accel Simeone, the young man whose visions urged him to kill his brother. The family\u2019s cinder-block home in the tropical city of Maracay remains a refuge, even after he took to his arm with a grinder.Soon after, a psychiatrist prescribed a different medication \u2014 one that could be found, at least that month \u2014 and the voices haunting Accel grew quieter.It might have brought calm to the household if Gerardo Simeone, Accel\u2019s brother, were not schizophrenic, too.Soon it was Gerardo who was out of medication.The Simeones were true believers in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and his Socialist-inspired revolution.Mario Simeone, the father, was the son of a refugee from World War II Italy who had married in Venezuela, but the hard work of his parents did little to raise his prospects. When he and Evelin married in the late 1980s, their first home, in a run-down barrio, had neither a table nor a bed.Mrs. Simeone finished a law degree at a free, state-funded university and began a practice specializing in lawsuits and wills. Her husband, a curious tinkerer, opened a garage to fix vehicles. In 2005, the two bought a new home and filled it with appliances: four televisions, two laptops, and a washer and dryer.\u201cOur refrigerator was always full,\u201d Mrs. Simeone said.But something was wrong with Accel. The affable young man, nicknamed El Gordo, or the Fat Man, had turned 18 and was starting to feel anxious, with a constant sense of being pursued. Voices told him that he was gay, or that they wanted to kill him for his money.At 19, Accel attacked his father with a stick. A psychiatrist in Caracas immediately recognized the symptoms of schizophrenia and prescribed a number of drugs, then easy to obtain.\u201cMedication was the only way to win,\u201d Mrs. Simeone said.But the battle was only beginning. Accel\u2019s younger brother, Gerardo, had long been the more talkative one, a raconteur and joke teller who broke into long discourses about the history he learned at school. Then El Negro, as his family called him for his dark features, suddenly fell silent.\u201cWhat surprises life gives you,\u201d Mario Simeone said of Gerardo\u2019s schizophrenia. \u201cWho would have known it would have hit the two boys?\u201dIn many respects, life remained the same. The medication calmed the brothers\u2019 paranoia on all but a few days, allowing Evelin to continue working and Mario to fix cars in the garage. Accel even started working as Mario\u2019s assistant.Still, Accel and Gerardo, once pictured in photos as boys hugging each other with wide grins, now barely spoke. Accel took an interest in writing hip-hop lyrics and in cooking. Gerardo remained quiet.\u201cHe was so kind and loving,\u201d Mrs. Simeone said, remembering Gerardo before he became ill. \u201cHe had such an amazing lexicon.\u201dOutside the home, other changes were afoot. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who had cancer, died in 2013, leaving a lesser-known successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The next year, oil prices began to decline drastically. The country found itself unable to pay for goods, services and imports.\u201cI said, \u2018My God, neither of them will have any soon,\u2019\u201d she recalled.When the drug ran out in May, Accel felt it first.The voices that had haunted him surged forward again. Specters adopting the names of hip-hop artists like Nicki Minaj and \u00d1engo Flow, a Puerto Rican singer, pelted him with insults. The dead did, too. Time and again, they told Accel that he was gay and should be punished.Days before he attacked himself, Accel wrote a series of Facebook messages to his mother. The voices, he explained, were making absurd demands, asking her to make large purchases and threatening Accel if she didn\u2019t. Frustrated, Evelin told him to go help his father in the garage and think of other things. Accel warned that the voices were becoming violent.\u201cThey even throw grenades at me,\u201d he wrote on May 30.On June 4, Evelin and Mario went to a relative\u2019s house, leaving the brothers alone. That was when Accel\u2019s voices told him to kill Gerardo.\u201cThey came and told me to do it, to do it, to do it,\u201d Accel recalled as his brother looked on. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was alive or dead.\u201dTorn between the voices and his conscience, Accel left his brother and headed to a shed where his father kept tools. The voices continued, urging him on.\u201cI felt the need to take a screwdriver and put it in my chest, just where my heart is,\u201d he said.Accel settled on a grinder on the floor. He plugged it in, switched it on.\u201cThey said I needed to keep sawing until I had cut off my arm,\u201d Accel said.He had just started when Mario returned home and wrestled the grinder from his son\u2019s hands.\u201cHe was just standing there, like it was normal and nothing happened,\u201d Mario said.The wounds did not hit any arteries or veins. The large gashes in his arms are now scarring.But the costs from the day the family now refers to as \u201cthe crisis\u201d are still adding up.Evelin, who had hardly been able to work in order to watch over the brothers, has quit work entirely. Mario fixes cars to pay for medication for his sons, when it can be found, lamenting how far the family\u2019s fortunes have fallen.He recalled when they bought their home in 2005. The price was 45 million bol\u00edvars, an amount that soon dropped to 45,000 after the government replaced the currency with a new devalued one in 2008. Now inflation has made that figure seem laughable.\u201cThe price of our house is barely enough for a cellphone,\u201d he said.He wanted someone to blame.\u201cThis is a fanatic state,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you really love a country, how could you leave it without food, work or medicine?\u201dUnlike his brother, Gerardo wasn\u2019t prone to violence when his pills ran out. By July, when most of his medications were gone, he drifted into his own world, standing calmly in a corner for long spells as the rest of the family sat in the living room, watching television. He would look up and answer a question now and then, but it was as if he were dreaming elsewhere.\u201cWe call him our Swiss Guard,\u201d Mario said wryly.Waiting in line and scrounging for medicines are not the only daily struggles for the Simeone family. The real trial is holding the strained, at times violent, household together.Accel still hears voices in his head, which now tell him that he can no longer sleep in his bed. He has moved to his parents\u2019 room. Mario and Evelin\u2019s grown son spends the night with them.Guilt haunts Evelin. She is troubled that she has not searched as hard as she can for medicine for Gerardo.\u201cI am tired,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is too much sometimes.\u201dShe began to cry and walked away. Accel looked up, sensing something was wrong.\u201cIt\u2019s allergies again,\u201d she told him.The tiny house feels cramped, with a sense of cabin fever. When there is enough medicine to clear his mind, Accel takes to writing new hip-hop lyrics. One is about his relationship with Gerardo. Another, called \u201cThe Lights Are Out,\u201d tells of the constant blackouts in his neighborhood.Accel opened his bedroom door and pointed at lyrics written on the wall. Every inch has been covered by his frenetic writing.Mario spends most of his days tinkering in the garage, muttering about parts that are no longer found in Venezuela. Gerardo\u2019s silence now frustrates him.\u201cThere are times I get mad at him,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s behaving like that. I tell him: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you? Don\u2019t act like a stupid person!\u2019\u201dGerardo looked on, stone-faced and silent.Mario looked ashamed, then ran across the room, grabbing his son, lifting him a few inches and twirling him around.When he let go, Gerardo was still expressionless.Then his eyes grew wide. A smile cracked across his face. The whole family started to laugh.Gerardo looked at the floor and started laughing, too.Ana Vanessa Herrero contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I, and all of us, learned the hard way in 2000 and beyond that we become too busy putting out the \u201cfires\u201d caused by a dangerous administration to be able to focus on the activism that really matters to us.Please think of voting for Clinton as an unpleasant civic duty \u2014 like jury duty \u2014 and then join me on the front lines of protest and of Bernie Sanders\u2019 continued political revolution the day after we use our vote for the one thing it is good for this time around: helping to soundly defeat the monumental danger that is currently well within striking distance of the presidency, and helping to delegitimize all of the violent ideology that surrounds it by making the margin of defeat that much wider.This comment received more than 1,600 reader recommendations.As an independent voter, I guess it comes down to who might improve a country that has many issues.

Perhaps the neural pathways that allowed me to derive pleasure from comics and cycling were simply too well-worn to let me think about anything else.That\u2019s maybe a good reason not to cut arts and phys ed in the schools?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emboldened Taliban Overrun Parts of Kunduz and Taunt Afghan Forces", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Taliban overran central neighborhoods in the critical Afghan provincial capital of Kunduz on Monday, planting their flag in the city\u2019s main roundabout and shaking the Afghan government in a repeat of the insurgents\u2019 assault on the city a year ago.Fighting in the city continued into the night, and American officials said that aircraft were there to help and that other \u201cassets\u201d were moving in.But on social media, the Taliban taunted the struggling Afghan forces and their American allies, providing a blow-by-blow account of their assault even as senior Afghan leaders traveled to Brussels for an international conference where they were to present a status report and ask for sustained international funding.Gen. Qasim Jangalbagh, the provincial police chief, acknowledged on Monday that the Taliban had taken parts of Kunduz, but he said that additional troops had arrived. Before midnight, a post on his Facebook page claimed that the main square had been cleared of Taliban fighters, though residents reported heavy clashes continuing in a broader area of the city.After an initial statement playing down reports that the city might be under \u201csignificant attack,\u201d Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, the spokesman for the international military coalition, later said that international forces would become more closely involved. \u201cWe already have enablers there, including strike aircrafts in the air, and we are moving additional assets into the area,\u201d he said.Sher Mohammad Sharq, the commander of a local police unit in Aliabad District, which is essentially a suburb of the city, acknowledged problems in previous assaults when some Afghan forces surrendered quickly or fled. He said the district\u2019s police leaders had met and all vowed to take stern measures against desertion.\u201cI told the police chief that if anyone runs away from the fighting, I am going to shoot him first,\u201d Mr. Sharq said.The coordinated Taliban attack, coming from four directions, began before dawn on Monday, according to Mahfozullah Akbari, a spokesman for the regional police. Shops remained closed and residents tried to flee as fighting continued across several parts of the city. Helicopter gunships were also seen targeting Taliban areas, some less than a mile from the governor\u2019s compound.\u201cTaliban captured the central square of Kunduz city and all other government offices, except for the intelligence office, the Police Headquarters and the governor\u2019s office,\u201d said Sayed Assadullah Sadat, a member of the Kunduz provincial council. \u201cIf Taliban capture Kunduz city completely, they will gain enough ammunition and equipment for next year to fight with government forces, and they will destroy the lives of the people in Kunduz.\u201dCivilians were caught in the line of fire, as residents reported that both the Taliban and Afghan forces used their homes to attack the other side.Sardar Murady, who lives close to the highway leading to the district of Chardara, said the Taliban were using some civilian homes for fighting. \u201cThey told us not to lock the gates to our houses,\u201d he said.Though the Taliban have gained territory in large areas of the country, Afghan and Western officials have said that they are concentrating forces to defend strategic population centers. Yet the insurgents repeatedly test these forces in Kunduz and southern Helmand Province, areas where both the Afghan government and NATO have focused their resources.On Monday, fighting also raged in Helmand, where insurgents overran the district of Nawa, just south of the provincial capital, and killed the district\u2019s police chief in an overnight attack. The district\u2019s fall on Sunday night added pressure from an additional direction on the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, which has long remained surrounded by the Taliban.A Taliban assault on Nawa in August was barely headed off, as delegations of senior generals shuttled back and forth from Kabul to help focus the security forces\u2019 defense. Still, the district\u2019s defenses had not been planned properly after the previous assault, said Nawa\u2019s governor, Aqa Muhammad Takra.\u201cThe government helped break the previous siege, but did not hold the area permanently by installing check posts on the main road and putting more forces in the district,\u201d Mr. Takra said. \u201cIt became the focus of the Taliban again, and we haven\u2019t seen any reinforcement to protect the district from falling.\u201dNawa\u2019s police chief, Col. Ahmad Shah Salem, who was central to the district\u2019s defense during the assault in August, was killed in the attack on Sunday night, said his brother Abdul Wadud, a member of Parliament.Nader Nadery, a senior adviser to the Afghan president, said that figure included some civilians, as well.\u201cIn August, the Taliban\u2019s mobilization of all resources was unprecedented, and it was beyond their capacity,\u201d Mr. Nadery said. \u201cThis is no longer an undeclared war \u2014 this is a declared war, and the Taliban had full-fledged support not seen before,\u201d he added, referring to a long-held belief by Afghan and Western officials that the military in neighboring Pakistan is aiding the Afghan insurgents.An earlier version of this article included an incorrect dateline.

{"Headline": "Trump Versus Twitter", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Donald Trump and his advisors have spent much of the last week peddling weak excuses for Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offensive comments about women on a 2005 tape. But defenses of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s descriptions of sexual assault have fueled more outrage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and inspired inventive social-media responses.Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York and now a Trump adviser, accused Hillary Clinton of hypocrisy for denouncing Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments when she enjoys music with foul language.Appearing on CNN Monday, Ms. McCaughey read an example from her notes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI came to slay, bitch. When he F me good I take his ass to Red Lobster.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThese words, Ms. McCaughey explained, came from Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfavorite performer, whom she says she idolizes and would like to imitate\u00e2\u0080\u009d: Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9.Of course, Ms. McCaughey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument is nonsensical. Mr. Trump is a presidential candidate, and Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 is a pop star. Mr. Trump was boasting about assaulting women, and Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0099s album \u00e2\u0080\u009cLemonade,\u00e2\u0080\u009d from which the lyrics come, focuses on female empowerment in relationships and women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength in a culture that objectifies their bodies.Like Ms. Oxford, Ms. Taylor received numerous responses to her tweet. For some users responding to the tweet, it was the first time they\u00c2\u00a0were talking about their assaults.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSocial media allows you to move without permission, to move on your own volition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Taylor said in an interview. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why she was able to tell her story on Twitter even though she had never told her family, her partner or her friends. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout social media,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that I ever would have told my stories publicly.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn the less than 24 hours since her tweet, she has been overwhelmed by the deluge of responses, unable to sleep on Wednesday night until she had acknowledged all the people who shared their traumas with her. She woke to thousands more stories in her inbox and her Twitter mentions. Talking about her experience, she explained, was her way of telling strangers on social media, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me give you some shelter. Let me give you some cover to share your story.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Trump and his surrogates can try to frame his deeply misogynist bragging as mere \u00e2\u0080\u009clocker room talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his\u00c2\u00a0accusers\u00c2\u00a0as opportunistic women. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2016, and whenever they mangle the truth, millions of social media users stand ready to set them straight.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung\u2019s Response to Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Draws Criticism", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byAfter Samsung Electronics halted production of its high-end smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, it posted a statement on its website telling owners of the phone to power it down immediately and contact the outlet they bought it from to obtain a refund or an exchange.For some who work in crisis management, it was a baffling and overly passive way for the South Korean electronics giant to deal with a prominent problem that has worsened in the last month.\u201cThat ought to be more visible \u2014 this is pretty serious,\u201d Andrew Gilman, the chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group, said of the warning on Samsung\u2019s home page. The brand has \u201cto show they care and are concerned\u201d through consistent communication on their home page, Twitter, Facebook and other social channels, he said.\u201cThis is a phone that can literally catch fire and burn your house down with you in it,\u201d said Dean Crutchfield, an independent brand consultant in New York. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s being highlighted enough.\u201dThe brand, which has been offering refunds or replacement Note 7 devices to consumers in the last few weeks, now faces the unpleasant task of pulling the newer smartphones as well. All of this has grown into an international crisis for Samsung, which is not accustomed to dealing with such public scrutiny. Samsung is South Korea\u2019s most important company, accounting for about 17 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. As a result, government regulators there are not as quick to call it to task as regulators in other countries.Adding a layer of complexity is the fact that many consumers interact with the Samsung brand through carriers like Verizon and AT&T or retail outlets like Best Buy.\u201cWhat these carriers are battling with is making sure their brand image is not sullied by this,\u201d Mr. Crutchfield said. \u201cThey want total responsibility reflected on Samsung.\u201dAT&T, for example, sent a text to consumers on Sept. 20 notifying them that new Note 7 phones would be available on Sept. 21 for exchanges. The carrier said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that \u201canother customer communication is in progress\u201d based on the latest news.\u201cOver all, as a company, they have an enormous amount of products and customer loyalty to those products, and they have to bank on that leverage and work on it in the near and distant future in order to continue that,\u201d Andrew Frank, the founder and president of KARV Communications, who has worked on recalls involving companies like Continental Tire, said of Samsung.Thus far, communication out of Samsung has been overly \u201cbureaucratic,\u201d Mr. Crutchfield said. He said he would put the company\u2019s executives in front of consumers, noting \u201cpeople want to see people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes.com.Moving to a new city may be a logical step when the ink on your diploma dries. You may be following a job lead, taking the next step with your significant other or simply seeking adventure. But it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll move for a friend.\u201cFriendship is viewed as discretionary,\u201d said Irene S. Levine, Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and a friendship expert. \u201cIt takes a lesser priority in people\u2019s minds than work or family.\u201dEven so, professional life and personal life are often intertwined. \u201cFriendships make you a better worker, lover and partner,\u201d Dr. Levine said.Maintaining faraway friendships can seem just as daunting as starting fresh in a new place. But there are plenty of ways to cope with the challenges of distance \u2014 and even use them to your benefit.\u201cWe have more tools at our fingertips than ever to stay in touch,\u201d said Max Marder, 27, who moved to Gaziantep, Turkey, just over two years ago to pursue an internship with a Syrian civil society organization. He had just earned his master\u2019s degree from the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and was seeking full-time employment.\u201cIt was a race to find a job before I was overstaying my visa,\u201d he said.Despite the stress of settling into a new country and looking for work, Mr. Marder\u2019s relationship with his best friend, Sam Jinishian, remained close. In fact, the seven-hour time difference between Gaziantep and New York worked in their favor; Ms. Jinishian was often on Google Chat at work around the same time Mr. Marder was wrapping up his day at home.Will Lefferts, 25, who is pursuing a master\u2019s in communication at Sciences Po in Paris, has also found that living in a different time zone has its social advantages.\u201cRight now, I\u2019m in that weird place of my life where a lot of my close friends are in graduate school as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have work responsibilities in the same way, so we can talk.\u201dThat\u2019s true for Mr. Lefferts\u2019s friends on the East Coast, at least. \u201cThe six-hour difference isn\u2019t that big, but the West Coast is a nightmare,\u201d he said.When friends\u2019 schedules don\u2019t line up quite so serendipitously, setting call dates can ensure more regular communication.When people are trying to talk across time zones, some methods may work better than others. Mr. Marder said he keeps in closest contact with his friends who have the messaging app WhatsApp or use iMessage to text.Alexa Wybraniec, 22, studied at Sciences Po during her junior year at Rutgers University, before she had an iPhone. With that constraint, she found herself using Facebook as her primary means of contacting people. Her best friend, a Facebook abstainer, joined the network for the year just to keep in touch.\u201cThe biggest game-changer for me was when I got my first iPhone,\u201d said Ms. Wybraniec, who moved back to Paris after graduation. \u201cIMessage changed everything.\u201d The price of connection, though, was distraction: Before she switched phones, she said, she \u201cwasn\u2019t Snapchatting the whole city.\u201dThough disappearing messages are the bread and butter of Snapchat, some of the app\u2019s functions may allow a more lasting connection.Mr. Marder has a friend in New York whom he called \u201cthe king of Snapchat stories\u201d \u2014 photos and videos that users broadcast to all of their friends, rather than just a handful. \u201cHe\u2019s very skilled at tracing these narratives,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll go to a friend\u2019s wedding and interview people, or document the antics of birthday parties.\u201d The unedited, often funny footage helps Mr. Marder feel connected to his friends back home.Janan Dave, 24, who recently moved to Bangalore, India, to pursue a 10-month fellowship in public health, felt the same way about the app. \u201cWhen my internet\u2019s strong enough to look at people\u2019s Snap stories, that actually kind of helps me feel like I know what\u2019s going on in people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said.\u201cYou need to find new ways to relate to each other that are satisfying,\u201d Dr. Levine said. \u201cA friendship can\u2019t just exist on the past.\u201d\u201cI have a pact with a group of friends: If we\u2019re ever in the same country, and if it\u2019s at all reasonable, we have to try for it,\u201d Mr. Lefferts said. Last summer one of his friends got married in Michigan, and everyone in the group made it to the party. Soon they\u2019ll unite again, for Mr. Lefferts\u2019s Halloween party in Paris.Shriya Samavai and Clare Drummond have been friends since they were toddlers. When they graduated from high school in 2011, Ms. Samavai moved to New York from Indiana to study at Columbia University, while Ms. Drummond stayed in their home state to attend Purdue University. It was the first time the 23-year-old best friends had to consider what it might be like to live apart. As longtime collaborators \u2014 on photo shoots, illustrations and songs \u2014 they believed art could be the answer to their long-distance problem.\u201cAfter I moved, we started sending each other stuff in the mail,\u201d Ms. Samavai said. \u201cWe\u2019d make art and scan it by email. Then we started writing these songs for each other.\u201dIn addition to keeping their creative partnership alive, Ms. Samavai and Ms. Drummond have used distance as an excuse to visit each other often and travel to new places together.\u201cWe\u2019re always discussing, \u2018When\u2019s the next time you can take off, and where do you want to go?\u2019\u201d Ms. Samavai said.In their absence, Ms. Brashares said, it\u2019s essential to create new situations in which friendship might thrive, whether it\u2019s starting a book club, going on vacation together or sharing a pair of jeans, as the characters in her \u201cSisterhood of the Traveling Pants\u201d series do.\u201cAs I get older, I\u2019m more and more convinced of the importance of the concrete,\u201d Ms. Brashares said. When she was writing the \u201cSisterhood\u201d series, she was looking for a physical representation of her characters\u2019 relationships that honored the past while continuing to change in the present. The jeans were a perfect fit.When Ms. Wybraniec first left for Paris, she packed reminders of her two closest friends: sketches that her friend Nora drew in high school, and a necklace her friend Natasha made that bears a rock pendant from a mountain in their hometown. They provided her with \u201csomething physical and tangible to hold onto from home.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t want something matching, but we wanted two things that kind of completed each other,\u201d Ms. Samavai said.She and Ms. Drummond first considered inking themselves with a watering can and a houseplant, respectively, then revised the vision in favor of a bergamot plant and a teapot filled with Earl Grey, a drink they often shared at each other\u2019s houses growing up.\u201cWhen we stand side by side, you see the teapot pour into the plant,\u201d Ms. Samavai said of the tattoos, which Ms. Drummond drew. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but Earl Grey has been a central force in our friendship.\u201dAnyone who has recently uprooted is likely to be \u201cconsumed with the challenges of finding their place in a new community,\u201d Dr. Levine said. They could be living alone, or with strangers. There may be a job lined up, or there may be stress over a seemingly endless search for work. Even simple things like figuring out where to buy groceries can be difficult.The mundanity of moving shouldn\u2019t be a barrier to bonding. Dr. Levine recommended that rather than withholding the details of a transition from friends, you should \u201cmake them part of the journey with you.\u201d\u201cI keep Sam pretty in the loop about even the most banal things in my life,\u201d Mr. Marder said.But living near the Turkey-Syria border has meant that some of his conversations with friends revolve around more pressing issues, like his safety. When Gaziantep was bombed in August 2016, he was \u201cmarked safe\u201d on Facebook.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know it had happened until I started getting messages from people in America about it,\u201d he said.Mr. Lefferts had a similar experience in Paris during the November 2015 attacks.\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything had happened until after my mom texted me asking if I was O.K.,\u201d he said. In the days that followed, he received concerned messages from Facebook friends, some of whom he had not spoken to in a long time.\u201cI really appreciated it,\u201d he said.Friends \u201ccan be a life preserver or a buoy in your next environment,\u201d Dr. Levine said. With a strong foundation and the right tools, it\u2019s possible to live apart, support each other and grow together.Want more? You might also like:Advertisement"}

I\u2019m sorry for Anita Raja, who will now be forced into celebrity.\u201dRunning through the conversation was the notion that Mr. Gatti\u2019s expos\u00e9 was a sexist violation \u2014 yet another example, critics said, at a moment of intense debate over gender inequality, of how successful women find themselves bullied and demeaned by men.\u201cPeople really went there very quickly,\u201d Elaine Showalter, a retired professor at Princeton University and the author of numerous works of feminist criticism, said of the charge of sexism against Mr. Gatti.\u201cHere\u2019s a woman who is not only extremely successful but explores women\u2019s lives in a way that doesn\u2019t depict men very favorably,\u201d Ms. Showalter continued. People may be seeing Mr. Gatti\u2019s unmasking of the author, she added, \u201cas a kind of revenge.\u201dMr. Gatti said in an interview that he did not understand the strong reactions.\u201cI wasn\u2019t going after a woman, I was going after a mystery,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to ask the people who didn\u2019t want to know, \u2018Explain what work of art in the history of art has been ruined or damaged by knowing who the artist is?\u2019 I can name many, many cases where the art is enhanced.\u201dHugh Eakin, editor of The New York Review\u2019s blog, which published the English-language version of Mr. Gatti\u2019s report, said the occasion for the piece was the forthcoming English-language release of an expanded version of a book of Ms. Ferrante\u2019s nonfiction writings, in which the author says she grew up in Naples as the daughter of a seamstress.\u201cNow that an expanded version is about to be published in English, it seemed there was a legitimate occasion to inquire about the relation between the book and its author,\u201d Mr. Eakin wrote.Mr. Eakin added of Mr. Gatti\u2019s reporting, \u201cThough it amasses considerable evidence it\u2019s also worth noting the article does not make a conclusive statement.\u201d(Mr. Gatti had approached The New York Times several weeks ago about possibly publishing his research, but the newspaper decided not to pursue the arrangement, which would have involved coordinating with multiple journalistic partners.)Over the years, there have been other attempts to unmask authors, such as Joe Klein, who wrote \u201cPrimary Colors,\u201d a roman \u00e0 clef about Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, or Anne Desclos, who used a pseudonym when she wrote the 1954 erotic classic \u201cThe Story of O.\u201d But the effort to unveil Ms. Ferrante seemed to hit a deeper chord, perhaps because she has said in interviews that anonymity was crucial to her writing process.And it seemed to reveal a clash of sensibilities \u2014 between the journalistic and the literary, between those who believe anyone who publishes is fair game and those who believe some secrets should be kept. In short, a clash between the world of data-driven reporting and the emotional truths of fiction.Salman Rushdie took to Facebook. \u201cI am Elena Ferrante,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the spirit of \u2018I am Spartacus,\u2019 in the wake of the New York Review of Books\u2019 tawdry \u2018expos\u00e9\u2019 of her identity, every writer in the world should do this now.\u201dNot all writers shared that position. The critic Marco Roth said that Mr. Gatti\u2019s reporting was valuable, even inevitable. \u201cConditions change for all writers once they\u2019ve been published and it\u2019s na\u00efve to assume that Ferrante\u2019s pseudonymity (had it been protected) would have allowed her to flower forever in the brilliant vein of \u2018My Brilliant Friend,\u2019\u201d Mr. Roth wrote on Facebook, referring to the first of Ms. Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels.\u201cAnita Raja will now have to work this new twist in her life into the next stage of her work, whatever that may be. No writer can control or really has the right to control the conditions of her reception,\u201d Mr. Roth added.\u201cWe are as invested in her anonymity \u2014 and her autonomy \u2014 as she is,\u201d she added. \u201cIt is a compact: she won\u2019t tell us, we won\u2019t ask, and she won\u2019t change her mind and tell us anyway.

A hashtag had materialized: \u201c#notokay.\u201d The Twitter posts continued to pour in through the weekend. And by Monday afternoon, nearly 27 million people had responded or visited Ms. Oxford\u2019s Twitter page.A social media movement was born as multitudes of women came forward to share their stories. The result has been a kind of collective, nationwide purge of painful, often long-buried memories.Facebook pages and Twitter feeds filled with comments and multiplying threads from women who recalled being groped by doctors, by piano teachers, by photography instructors, by perfect strangers. They told stories of being flashed on the bus by masturbators, of having male colleagues rub up against them at the copy machine in their office, of dates and bosses demanding sex.This is scarcely the first protest movement to emerge in response to violence against women: The 1970s gave rise to the first Take Back the Night candlelight marches.Nor is Mr. Trump the first public figure whose sexual behavior has been scrutinized. It seems fair to wonder if Bill Clinton could be elected today, given what is now known about his extramarital history. And, of course, there was Anthony Weiner, with his penchant for sending lewd social media messages and photos.But to many victims of sexual assault, Mr. Trump\u2019s words struck a particular nerve. It was not simply that he is the Republican presidential nominee, and that a hot microphone had captured him speaking unguardedly. It was his casual tone, the manner in which he and the television personality Billy Bush appeared to be speaking a common language, many women said, that gave Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts a special resonance.What he said and how he said it seemed to say as much about the broader environment toward women \u2014 an environment that had kept many of these women silent for so long \u2014 as they did about the candidate. And Mr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of his actions as \u201clocker room talk\u201d only underscored the point.That locker room talk also seemed to create its own momentum online.Laura Sabransky was one of many women who added to Ms. Oppenheimer\u2019s thread, writing that she had been given date-rape drugs three times between high school and college. \u201cI call Trump a walking trigger alert,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cHe is triggering anxiety and PTSD-like reactions in women, me included.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad when you see it as, \u2018My behavior is not as bad as another man\u2019s behavior,\u2019\u201d said Sonia Ossorio, the president of the National Organization for Women of New York. \u201cThe irony for me is, in a campaign short on any concrete policies, Donald Trump has accidentally shed light on a very serious issue.\u201dAmy Richards, a co-founder of the Third Wave Foundation, a group for young feminists, said that many sexual abuse victims who unburdened themselves after Mr. Trump\u2019s video did not want his comments to be seen as anomalous. \u201cSome of it was so that we automatically didn\u2019t go to this place of having this one instance be an exception and therefore more excusable,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, this is women speaking up, but it\u2019s speaking up to all of the Donald Trumps in our lives.\u201dAnd there appear to be many.Nick Corasaniti, Yamiche Alcindor and Ari Isaacman Bevacqua contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Subpoenas and Gag Orders Show Government Overreach, Tech Companies Argue", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It has been six months since the Justice Department backed off on demands that Apple help the F.B.I. break the security of a locked iPhone.But the government has not given up the fight with the tech industry. Open Whisper Systems, a maker of a widely used encryption app called Signal, received a subpoena in the first half of the year for subscriber information and other details associated with two phone numbers that came up in a federal grand jury investigation in Virginia.The subpoena arrived with a court order that said Open Whisper Systems was not allowed to tell anyone about the information request for one year.Technology companies contend that court-imposed gag orders are being used too often by law enforcement and that they violate the Bill of Rights. The companies also complain that law enforcement officials are casting a wide net over online communications \u2014 often too wide \u2014 in their investigations.Justice Department officials, for their part, argue that these gag orders are necessary to protect developing cases and to avoid tipping off potential targets. The officials say that they are simply following leads where they take them.Through a spokesman, the Justice Department declined to comment on the case.The information request made of Open Whisper Systems is particularly sensitive, since its encryption app is used around the world, and it is often recommended to journalists and human rights activists.Microsoft also complained that the orders often came without time limits, unlike the Open Whisper Systems order. Dozens of other technology, media and civil liberties groups filed briefs supporting Microsoft last month, and the case is pending.Part of the gag order on Open Whisper Systems was lifted after a court challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union, and redacted versions of documents related to the information request were made public last week. But the small San Francisco company was still not allowed to tell specific account holders about the investigation.The documents made public show that the government asked Open Whisper Systems to turn over data associated with two telephone numbers, including web browsing histories and data stored in the tracking \u201ccookies\u201d of the web browsers attached to those accounts. But one of Signal\u2019s biggest draws is that it does not collect most of that information.\u201cThe Signal service was designed to minimize the data we retain,\u201d said Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems. Mr. Marlinspike said Signal uses a technology called end-to-end encryption that kept the service from gaining access to the contents of its users\u2019 messages. The company also does not store information on those with whom its users are communicating.Civil liberties lawyers argue the Justice Department request fell well outside the bounds of what is typically covered by a subpoena, including basic subscriber information. Additional information, such as computer logs or content, would require a search warrant under the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\u201cThe Justice Department is pushing the envelope,\u201d said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society. Big companies like Apple and Microsoft have the wherewithal to push back, she said. But smaller companies may cave, rather than risk an expensive fight.The Justice Department came to Open Whisper Systems with a menu of information needs, including subscriber details, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses and method of payment. The request went on to demand information on internet addresses, browsers and internet providers that the account holders could have used, according to court records.One of the phone numbers the government was investigating was not a Signal user after all. For the other phone number, Open Whisper Systems turned over the only pieces of data it could: the time the user\u2019s account had been created and the last time it had connected to the service \u2014 far less than the government sought.The government did not make that request of Open Whisper Systems. \u201cThey need to pick those cases carefully,\u201d Ms. Granick said. \u201cThey are only picking cases where they think they\u2019re going to have the people on their side.\u201dThe Justice Department and F.B.I. tried to force Apple to break its own software security in the case of an iPhone used by a gunman in last year\u2019s San Bernardino terrorist attacks, she said.\u201cGag orders should be used in exceptional cases,\u201d said Brett M. Kaufman, the staff attorney with the A.C.L.U. who represented Open Whisper Systems. \u201cThis one demonstrates that the exception has become the rule in routine proceedings.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Fight for Aleppo, Tangled Alliances in Syria Add to Chaos", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 The Syrian civil war, and the intense new ground battle in the divided city of Aleppo, is often seen as a contest between a chaotic array of rebel groups and the Russian-backed government of President Bashar al-Assad. But the reality is that Mr. Assad\u2019s side is increasingly just as fragmented as its opponents, a panoply of forces aligned partly along sectarian lines but with often-competing approaches and interests.There are Iraqi Shiite militiamen cheering for clerics who liken the enemy to foes from seventh-century battles. There are Iranian Revolutionary Guards fighting on behalf of a Shiite theocracy. There are Afghan refugees hoping to gain citizenship in Iran, and Hezbollah militants whose leaders have long vowed to fight \u201cwherever needed.\u201dThe Syrians themselves are in a few elite units from an army steeped in a nominally socialist, Arab nationalist ideology, exhausted after five years of war, as well as pro-government militias that pay better salaries. And, yes, overhead there are the Russian pilots who have relentlessly bombed the rebel-held eastern side of Aleppo \u2014 trained to see the battle as supporting a secular government against Islamist extremist terrorists.While Washington and Moscow say preservation of Syrian state institutions is a priority, a look at the fight for Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, shows that those structures are already atrophying.At least one elite Syrian Army unit has been filmed seizing positions in Aleppo, but the bulk of the pro-government force is made up militiamen trained and financed by Iran, the Shiite theocracy that is the Syrian government\u2019s closest ally, according to experts, diplomats, regional officials and fighters battling for and against the government.The government\u2019s Aleppo offensive has moved aggressively in the past week, worsening an epic humanitarian crisis. Syrian or Russian airstrikes have hit seven hospitals and killed hundreds of civilians, in what Moscow and Damascus describe as preparation for a final battle for the city.The Syrian military has dropped leaflets urging rebels to surrender and civilians to leave, but the United Nations says that pro-government forces have not allowed access to the escape routes, and that residents are afraid of arrest if they head to the government side.Pro-government ground forces have taken bites out of rebel territory from several directions, but have faced tough resistance in street fighting from insurgents who in many cases are defending their own neighborhoods.To the north, the Quds Brigade, made up mostly of Palestinians living in Aleppo, seized the Handarat Palestinian refugee camp, lost it to rebels, and seized it again. To the south, Iraqi militias and other fighters have battled rebels for crucial territory close to a water pumping center. Syrian Army forces, meanwhile, seized a neighborhood in central Aleppo near the ancient citadel.As rebel groups called for a general mobilization, residents on their side have stockpiled equipment for digging wells, fuel for generators and seeds to grow food, in preparation for a lengthy siege.There is no precedent in the Syrian war for ground forces\u2019 quickly rolling into an area that rebels have held for years. The disjointed forces, many with no local connections, are not strong enough to take fortified urban rebel positions in a frontal assault.Rather, airstrikes, artillery and starvation sieges have typically been used to force rebels to surrender in exchange for safe passage \u2014 a process that has taken months or years in places far smaller and less strategically vital than Aleppo. But it could go quicker if pro-government forces managed to take control of the water distribution plant and shut off water to the rebel side, or if thousands of Russian soldiers and veterans now working for private security contractors joined the ground battle.The Russian opposition-leaning newspaper RBK, citing a security service source, said that private Russian military companies had 1,000 to 2,500 employees in Aleppo and in one other Syrian city, Latakia, under the de facto command of Russian military intelligence officers. Russian special forces are also on the ground in Syria.The messy mosaic of ground fighters on both sides has challenged Washington\u2019s tangled allegiances. The United States is effectively allied with Iraqi Shiite militias to thwart the Islamic State in Iraq, but in Syria, some of those same militias are fighting on the side of the Assad government, which the United States opposes, and against a mix of rebel groups, some of them backed by the Obama administration.The front lines around Aleppo, as seen on video and described by witnesses, in some ways resemble those around Tikrit and Falluja in Iraq: In both countries, Shiite militia flags fly alongside, or sometimes instead of, those of a shaky national army and government.In Iraq, militias have often acted as the tip of the spear, the first ground forces to enter after Iraqi government \u2014 and sometimes American \u2014 airstrikes. Similar scenes unfolded in northern Aleppo Province in February: After heavy Russian and Syrian airstrikes drove most people from villages, fighters from the Iraqi militia Harakat al-Nujabaa \u2014 the Noble Ones \u2014 Hezbollah and others fought rebel holdouts. Afterward, Syrian troops planted flags.The pro-government forces now mobilized around Aleppo include several thousand fighters from Iranian-backed Iraqi Shiite militias known as the Popular Mobilization committees, which formed to fight the Islamic State in Iraq after it swept into large parts of that country in 2014.South of Aleppo, Iraqi clerics have given rousing speeches to militiamen in fatigues urging them to fight in the name of faith and Islamic law. The Nujabaa fighters and their supporters have circulated an Arabic hashtag on social media, #AleppoOurNextVictoryInSyria.Also fighting are Iranian troops and recruits from Iran\u2019s sizable Afghan refugee population. The Iranian government has been increasingly open about the fact that these are not only advisers, as they were long portrayed.At least 400 Iranians and Afghans from Iran have died \u201cdefending the shrines\u201d in Iraq and Syria, as the government describes it. In June, at least a dozen members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps \u2014 some of them high-ranking \u2014 died in battles near Aleppo, and around that time some regular Iranian Army troops headed for Syria.Around Aleppo, sectarian battle cries can be heard on both sides. Some Sunni insurgents use slurs against the Shiites who lead their archenemy \u2014 Iran \u2014 and against the Alawites, the sect Mr. Assad belongs to. And some foreign Shiite militiamen call their enemies by the names of foes from the seventh-century battle of Karbala that split Sunnis from Shiites.There is more cultural affinity between Russia and senior Syrian Army officers \u2014 steeped in secular Baathist ideology and often trained in the Soviet Union \u2014 than between Syria\u2019s formal military and Iran and Hezbollah. But militarily, they are all interdependent.Mr. Assad needs the ground forces provided by Iran and Hezbollah, which in turn need Russian air power. At the same time, Iranian and Hezbollah officials have said that their fighters provide intelligence from the ground for targeting airstrikes.Before the war began in 2011, Syria had one of the largest and most professional armies in the region. But it has been eroded by tens of thousands of casualties, by untold numbers of men fleeing the country to avoid conscription, and by the practice of keeping many soldiers from the nation\u2019s Sunni majority away from the front lines amid questions about loyalty.Some Syrian officers and government officials grumble about Iran and Hezbollah impinging on their sovereignty, complaining that their fighters earn more than the Syrians and blow past road checkpoints with the flash of a badge. Damascus residents complain about the foreign fighters with semiautomatic rifles making stands in neighborhoods once visited by tourists from all over the world, like the shrine of Sayeda Zeinab, and the Christian quarters of the Old City.In turn, both Russians and the foreign Shiite fighters have complained about a lack of discipline among Syrian conscripts. But while many Syrian soldiers are weary after years of war, the foreign militia ranks seem to have buoyant morale.The leader of the Iraqi Harakat al-Nujabaa, for example, can be seen in a video the group posted on Facebook telling his men to keep up the battle against extremists backed by the United States, the \u201cZionist entity\u201d and \u201carrogant, colonial forces,\u201d then offering \u201cthe secret of our victory.\u201d\u201cWe are with God,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won us the big victories.\u201dOn the video\u2019s soundtrack, a singer then declared that when they see the militia\u2019s fighters, \u201cThe people of Aleppo are happy.\u201dReporting was contributed by Maher Samaan from Paris; Hwaida Saad from Beirut; an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria; Falih Hassan and Omar Al-Jawoshy from Baghdad; Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran; and Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Tech Companies Expect Free High-Speed Internet for Poorer Americans to Pay Off Later", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 There is an axiom in technology: New products typically go to wealthy customers first, before prices eventually fall to reach the masses.With broadband now classified like a utility, telecom and tech companies, including Sprint, Comcast and Facebook, are increasingly working to make high-speed internet accessible to every American, not just a luxury. The companies are among those that have set their sights on bringing free or cheap high-speed internet service to low-income and rural populations in the United States, spurred by philanthropy and, for some, the hope of turning Americans who are not online today into full-paying customers in the future.Those goals were on display Tuesday, when Sprint announced that it planned to give one million low-income high school students a free device and a free high-speed data plan until graduation. Facebook is also working to bring to the United States a service known as Free Basics, which gives people free access to certain websites, including Facebook. Comcast recently loosened requirements for its low-cost broadband service, expanding it to anyone in public housing.\u201cThe private sector has as much responsibility as the public sector to make devices and broadband available to millions of young Americans,\u201d said Broderick Johnson, President Obama\u2019s cabinet secretary and chairman of a White House task force that worked with Sprint on its new program.Free and low-cost broadband programs have been around for a while, with Comcast rolling out one called Internet Essentials in 2011, Google offering free broadband in public housing, and Dell and Microsoft providing free or discounted devices to schools. But the new initiatives could reach much larger populations and are directed toward specific digital divide problems, such as the struggle for children without broadband at home to complete their homework.Yet while telecom and web companies cite altruism as propelling free or low-cost broadband programs, what is often left unsaid are the benefits the services bring to the companies. It\u2019s part of a textbook business strategy known as \u201closs leader,\u201d when a company provides discounted or free goods to get customers to buy more once they are in the store.The strategy is increasingly important for the telecom industry, where growth has slowed and new broadband customers are harder to find.Some of the companies acknowledged the business strategy involved in providing low-income products. But Sprint\u2019s chief executive, Marcelo Claure, said the priority had been to work on a problem that telecom firms are best positioned to help solve. \u201cThe internet is one of the few things that doesn\u2019t discriminate, but the one thing that does discriminate is who can get online and who can\u2019t,\u201d he said.Sprint, the fourth-largest mobile carrier in the United States, typically charges customers about $60 a month for high-speed internet service. In the last six months, Mr. Claure, who emigrated from Bolivia as a college student, has made the digital divide an issue within the firm and assembled tech and nonprofit partners around the effort.The mobile carrier is particularly focused on bridging the \u201chomework gap\u201d that exists for students without broadband, which Mr. Claure said particularly hurts low-income African-American and Hispanic children. \u201cBeing a Hispanic C.E.O., this bothers me,\u201d he said.The program will be rolled out in seven to 10 cities, including Kansas City, Mo., early next year, before becoming more widely available in the 2017-18 school year. Nonprofits including My Brother\u2019s Keeper Alliance and EveryoneOn will recruit students for the nine-year program, and Sprint will use its stores and customer service representatives to sign up and serve the students.The new program\u2019s cost to Sprint is minimal because it doesn\u2019t require additional network upgrades; instead, it would be the equivalent of adding more cars to a highway, the company said. And there is social value for Sprint in doing this.\u201cPeople will look at Sprint as a good guy,\u201d Mr. Claure said. \u201cBrands that create social value by making a meaningful difference in people\u2019s lives are in a stronger position to attract new customers.\u201dDavid L. Cohen, senior executive vice president of Comcast, said in a statement, \u201cThe purpose of the program is not to convert Internet Essentials customers into paying customers.\u201dFacebook did not offer a timeline for a rollout of Free Basics in the United States.\u201cWhile we have nothing to announce, Facebook\u2019s mission is to connect the world, and we\u2019re always exploring ways to do that, including in the United States,\u201d the company said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Ownership of Both the Information and the Superhighway", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byMediatorOn the face of it, there is something Strangelovian about the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner.Like a lot of news consumers, I\u2019ve been struggling to get my head around this deal, which would give AT&T control of the Warner Bros. movie studio and cable networks including CNN, HBO and TBS. It would be gargantuan, carrying an $85 billion price tag. And it would further concentrate media ownership into a few powerful hands, playing to fears of a big corporate media takeover of the wild and woolly web, which has been so central to this year\u2019s great political upheaval. But it\u2019s all very fuzzy.What is it about this proposed merger that has both the left and the right, on the presidential trail and on Capitol Hill, so suspicious of it, if not downright opposed? Are the stakes really so high and the potential damage so great?\u201cI think you\u2019re being alarmist,\u201d he told me.\u201cThis is AT&T, which owns DirecTV, so that\u2019s a large pay-TV provider,\u201d Mr. Franken said. \u201cAlso, they\u2019re the second biggest in mobile broadband. And they\u2019re trying to buy this content company, Time Warner, which has Warner Bros. and all this very desirable TV content.\u201cWhen the company that controls the pipes, so to speak, owns this very, very large content provider, it can cause a whole bunch of different horribles for consumers,\u201d he said.First and foremost, Mr. Franken said, there\u2019s the dual threat of less choice and higher prices.On paper at least, AT&T could hoard some of its most popular movies or channels, making them more readily available to DirecTV, to promote DirecTV subscriptions, while pushing competitors off DirecTV or into the deep wilderness of the DirecTV channel guide. Or, Mr. Franken said, the new company could charge competitors like Comcast and Cox more for its most popular channels, price increases that would no doubt be passed on to the consumer.Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the Time Warner chief executive, dismissed those fears when we spoke Friday, saying that they don\u2019t jibe with the company\u2019s business imperatives: to offer the most channels for the best price, and to have its own channels as widely distributed as possible.AT&T and Time Warner executives say they are prepared to abide by the conditions government regulators are certain to impose, including prohibitions against using the new company\u2019s power to discriminate against rivals.But Mr. Franken said he was doubtful about the effectiveness of such restrictions, calling them \u201cvery hard to enforce.\u201dHe pointed to the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger of a few years ago, in which Comcast promised Washington regulators that it would not punish rival networks on its cable systems.Then again, the old, familiar cable guide is yesterday\u2019s battlefield, as video content moves to streaming services on your smartphone, tablet or television.And, in that new media sphere, with about 131 million wireless subscribers, AT&T would presumably again have incentive to favor its own programming over that of its competitors, by making it download faster \u2014 on a national scale.But I asked him whether AT&T\u2019s involvement in the suit didn\u2019t indicate that the company would create an internet class system if it won in court, especially should its takeover of Time Warner win approval.The lawsuit, he said, was related to what AT&T viewed as government overreach, not the provisions prohibiting tiered internet service. \u201cWe have always stood behind the core principles of net neutrality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not creating fast lanes and slow lanes.\u201dThe company says DirecTV is formally paying AT&T for its customers\u2019 use charges upfront, so the customers never see them. Other streaming services, it says, are welcome to make similar deals. (The Federal Communications Commission is looking into whether such arrangements should be considered a violation of net neutrality rules.)It\u2019s really dense stuff played out in complicated minutiae. But that\u2019s where the future of the internet, and therefore, the free flow of information, is going to be decided.Mr. Bewkes says if the public takes a look at the facts, it will see that the deal will not harm internet freedom. If anything, he argues, it will add a powerful new competitor to the Silicon Valley behemoths Facebook and Google, which appear to be swallowing the online advertising market whole.But he acknowledged the deal is up against an overwhelming public sense that \u201cthe big tower of government or the corporation is bad and it\u2019s not serving me.\u201dDonald J. Trump has said outright he would block the merger, and Hillary Clinton has said the merger raises \u201cconcerns.\u201dThis deal, however, will be decided long after the campaign is over. As Mr. Franken pointed out, the fight against the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger took some 14 months.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Is a Shot in the Dark", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAT&T is a telecom company that offers wireless service in a saturated market, while Time Warner is a content company whose primary assets, networks like CNN and HBO, face tougher times in a cord-cutting world. This merger is presented as a solution \u2014 a bigger company with more options will inherently be better suited to weather the enormous changes now shattering the TV business. Together, they\u2019ll have more leverage and can build new stuff faster.If all this sounds a bit speculative, that\u2019s because it is. What this deal actually symbolizes is that the future of television is increasingly going to be built on lots of bold, possibly speculative experiments.For instance, it does not make sense for Time Warner to offer most of its content exclusively to AT&T\u2019s customers. Not only would that destroy its profitability (Comcast\u2019s customers pay a lot for CNN and HBO, so why would Time Warner want to kill that business?), but it would also be out of step with the future. The notion of content tied to specific distribution lines is exactly what consumers are moving away from when they choose services like Netflix over cable bundles.We are witnessing the emergence of a new order in the TV business. In five or 10 years\u2019 time, that order may become clear. There\u2019s a good chance it will involve some current players \u2014 Comcast, Disney and a merged AT&T and Time Warner will all play a role in the entertainment business of tomorrow. But these behemoths\u2019 size and influence will almost certainly be diminished by new tech-powered players, whose pocketbooks and ambitions seem limitless \u2014 companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and possibly Twitter and Snap.So among the questions now plaguing the industry: Do people still want to pay for TV, and if so, how much? Do people want to watch live stuff, or scripted stuff, or do they instead want to watch whatever is on their Facebook feed? Which kind of company is the most valuable player in the future of the entertainment business?That is where all the experimenting comes in. William Goldman, the screenwriter, once said that in Hollywood, \u201cnobody knows anything.\u201d This applies well to the entertainment business of today, and the AT&T and Time Warner deal is perhaps the watershed example: Every move is a guess, and if you are lucky, an educated one.\u201cI think we\u2019re all trying to figure this out \u2014 how technology and the consumer is going to change, and who are the winners and losers in this future,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, who studies the telecommunications industry at the research firm BTIG.The best argument for the deal, Mr. Piecyk said, is that it diversifies AT&T\u2019s offerings \u2014 now a single company combines content and distribution, rather than just one or the other. When you face an uncertain future, diversity isn\u2019t a bad weapon. If it turns out that in the future, content becomes more valuable than distribution, the new AT&T will have that; if the opposite happens, it\u2019s covered there, too.In conference calls with reporters and investors over the weekend, Randall Stephenson and Jeffrey Bewkes, the chairmen and chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner, added another dimension to this argument: Bigger, they said, is faster.The future of TV, they argued, will depend on a lot of new ideas that are tested and deployed very quickly. These might include new business models for paying for shows, new ways to distribute and market that content, and new technologies and industrywide standards to make sure it all works.Fragmentation led to delays, and delays contribute to consumer dissatisfaction \u2014 but in a world in which Time Warner and AT&T worked together, new products would come along faster, which would in turn push new ideas from competitors, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cThis appears to be about empire sustenance rather than economic efficiency,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group.Craig Moffett, of MoffettNathanson, was blunter: \u201cAT&T faces the twin pressures of a huge debt load and huge dividend that consumes the vast majority of their cash,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIt is clear that they had to do SOMETHING.\u201dBig media mergers are always risky. They rarely work out. But it\u2019s striking how much more things are uncertain today than in the past. So even if AT&T and Time Warner together do not make much obvious sense, well, it\u2019s something.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Palantir Faults Labor Dept.\u2019s Data in Discrimination Suit", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byIn a filing on Friday, the company said a government audit initiated in 2010 looked at 18 months of employment data, and found discrimination against Asians in three of 44 job titles. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs erred in weighing all r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, including unsolicited applications from sites like Craigslist, as if they were from people with the relatively demanding skills required at a place like Palantir, the company argued.The filing also said that Palantir had hired outside experts who reviewed its practices and found no discrimination, and noted that several members of its senior leadership, as well as hiring managers, were themselves Asian.Palantir, based in Palo Alto, Calif., specializes in sophisticated pattern-finding software, and counted the federal government among its first customers. Originally specializing in matters like profiling terrorist organizations and tracing money laundering, the company has since built practices in areas like selling distressed mortgages and maximizing retail sales of candy.The Labor Department sued Palantir in late September after what both sides characterized as years of private negotiations to settle the case. The department asked that, should its suit succeed, the government cancel all its contracts with Palantir.As a federal contractor, the company is obligated to have a place on its applications for people to indicate their race, which is most likely how the government determined the number of Asians applying for work at Palantir.Diversity and discrimination issues have dogged many Silicon Valley companies in recent years, though usually in cases involving gender, Latinos or African-Americans. In disclosures over the last two years, companies like Google and Facebook have displayed work forces made up disproportionately of white men.An earlier version of this article misstated when a government audit was initiated.

For women, the clich\u00e9 is .\u2008.\u2008. um .\u2008.\u2008. let\u2019s see. .\u2008.\u2008. Why can\u2019t I think of it? Maybe because once women reach menopause, they, like their crises, become invisible.Well, not anymore.In Cathi Hanauer\u2019s anthology \u201cThe Bitch Is Back: Older, Wiser, and (Getting) Happier,\u201d 25 women from their late 30s to their 60s give voice \u2014 loudly, boldly and without apology \u2014 to the issues they face in Phase 2 of their lives, and what it all means in a postfeminist world.About 15 years ago, Hanauer was a working married mother of young children when she found herself, like her peers raised on \u00adassumptions of domestic and professional equality, consumed by anger. As she explains it, \u201cWe were exhausted, disillusioned, resentful and angry at our husbands.\u201d The resulting essay collection, aptly titled \u201cThe Bitch in the House: 26 Women Tell the Truth About Sex, Solitude, Work, Motherhood, and Marriage,\u201d laid bare those frustrations. (Her husband, Daniel Jones, edited a companion volume, \u201cThe Bastard on the Couch,\u201d and currently edits the Modern Love column for The Times.) Since then, a lot changed for Hanauer and her cohort: Children grew up, priorities shifted and identities emerged. Most notably, the searing anger had mellowed, and \u201cwe\u2019d adjusted our lives and expectations accordingly.\u201dOf course, these adjustments looked different for different women, and now nine of the original contributors and 16 new ones explain, sometimes in excruciatingly intimate detail, how they\u2019re navigating \u201cenlightened middle age.\u201dThe women in \u201cBitch 2,\u201d as Hanauer calls it, grapple with companionship, widowhood, infidelity (including their own), appearance, cancer, their pasts, their parents, empty nests and finding love a second or third time, sometimes with men a decade or two younger. They talk about shame and loss, tolerance and compromise, their insecurities as well as their hypocrisy. In other words, they talk about the hard stuff, the gritty stuff, the stuff you aren\u2019t likely to find on their Facebook pages. And that\u2019s exactly what makes this collection at once thrilling and reassuring. It\u2019s the discomfort of the topics that provides comfort, a sense that however knotty our lives have turned out, they\u2019re far more normal than we think.Take the issue of sex. There\u2019s a marketing and sales executive who considers ending her otherwise \u201cenviable\u201d marriage because she\u2019s not getting any sex from her faithful and avowedly heterosexual but unwilling husband. Meanwhile, a financial adviser ponders the opposite quandary. To keep her beloved husband from leaving, should she force herself to have sex with him once a week?Out in the postdivorce world, the publisher Sarah Crichton, in a tour de force of comedy and poignancy, describes the travails of dating again at almost 60. Discovering that her anatomy, once \u201cas inviting as Gauguin\u2019s Tahiti,\u201d has changed, she enlists the aid of Vagifem and a vibrator. Even so, after having sex with her handsome boyfriend, she wakes up \u201con fire \u2014 not with lust, but with searing pain.\u201d (She\u2019s struck with sciatica; he, with palpitations.) But she also reveals a deeper, starker pain: \u201cThe vulnerability and the ultimate intimacy of sex is even more profound when you\u2019ve lost more than you ever thought you could lose, and at this age, we have all lost too much.\u201d Susanna Sonnenberg, too, strikes a bittersweet chord when, happily in love after the end of her long marriage, she notes the challenges of trying to know and be known anew at midlife: \u201cI have not locked eyes in the delivery room with David. I haven\u2019t met his mother.\u201dOther contributors re-examine their values. In one of the most affecting essays, Anna March writes about her hard-won \u00adbattle to distance herself from her difficult mother, even after her mother\u2019s stroke. What do we owe our parents, she asks, not just the good or even the mediocre ones, but one who\u2019s a \u201csolid F\u201d with \u201ca mental health issue\u201d? At what point, she wonders, are we finally free to live our lives? On a seemingly lighter but equally complicated topic, Debora Spar, the president of Barnard College, tries to reconcile \u201cnipping and tucking and suctioning and hormoning\u201d \u2014 some of which she cops to \u2014 while also being a role model for young women. And Hope Edelman surprises herself when, in contrast to her previously ardent insistence on financial equality in marriage, she feels an \u201cundeniable sense of relief\u201d from not having to support herself.\u201cBitch 2\u201d has a more mature and existential feel to it than \u201cBitch 1,\u201d which makes it all the more jarring when a few of the essays come to trite conclusions. But in the stronger pieces, which often pop with subversive wit, the anger of the previous book has been replaced by a graceful reckoning and the welcome realization that if we\u2019re trapped at all, it\u2019s only within the confines of certain realities. Instead of the problem being men or society, this time the grievances are with the human condition and the propensity to chase an illusory ideal. When Jennifer Finney Boylan, who is content despite her tricky marriage, is asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you want more, sometimes?\u201d she remembers a line from a friend\u2019s movie: \u201cWell, no one ever wants less.\u201dMost of the essayists are professional writers, and despite their differences in temperament, race and sexual orientation, their concerns do fall into a similar bucket. So at first it feels surprising when the story of Kathy Thomas \u2014 a cleaning lady who dramatically flees from an abusive partner \u2014 appears, as if it landed in the wrong book. But near the end of that piece, Thomas says \u00adsomething that magnificently ties together these women\u2019s experiences. Reflecting on her situation, she tells Hanauer: \u201cI\u2019m not angry, though. Or sad. Or happy, for that matter. It\u2019s just life.\u201d Gaining that awareness, it seems, is the real gift of middle age. I can just see the rest of the Bitches raising their glasses to that.Lori Gottlieb, a contributing editor at The Atlantic, is the author of \u201cMarry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Pepe the Frog and Nasty Woman Are Shaping the Election", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byPepe the Frog, Nasty Woman, #NeverTrump.He spoke from his office in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, about how memes have become a dog whistle of this election cycle, and their impact on Election Day.Q. When did memes become a force in American politics? The general message was: Barack Obama is good for you, he is in tune with the social media generation.Were Republicans able to counter with memes of their own? In 2008, memes were simply a P.R. nightmare for the Republican Party. Most of them were satires of Sarah Palin. She was one of the first major candidates to be perceived as a loose cannon and as a sound-bite generator that ultimately worked against the party.So surely the G.O.P. learned its lesson by 2012? As far as memes go, 2012 was an even bigger nightmare for the Republicans. Obama had a comfortable lead for most of the way, and Occupy Wall Street was a grass-roots movement that really saturated social media and aligned sentiment against rich guys in general.What\u2019s new this year? From what we\u2019ve observed so far, memes are no longer treated as nuisances, although they still can be. We\u2019ve seen memes play a vital role in crafting a powerful cult of personalities for Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump.Sanders seemed to come out of nowhere this year. Were memes a factor? If I had to pick one thing that was the most unique this year, it was the idolization of Bernie Sanders through meme caricatures.Ultimately, they helped provide him an exceptionally large online following, in comparison with his actual delegate count.What about with Donald Trump? Donald Trump himself has been a major factor. No other candidate in modern U.S. election history has had such an openly antagonistic relationship with the news media and a high level of disregard for Beltway conventions. Memes have been his way to take his message straight to the people.Pepe is an internet symbol that has been around for years. He was a character in the comic \u201cBoy\u2019s Club\u201d by Matt Furie, and he used to be known as \u201cFeels Bad Man,\u201d because he looked so sad.Feels Bad Man frog inspired many spinoffs over the years, but until 2015, he was a symbol of sad-sack, beta-male singledom for users of 4chan. That site is widely described as the \u201ccesspool\u201d of the internet. It is basically a locker room full of a bunch of single dudes commiserating over their social awkwardness.So how did Pepe become a Trump symbol?You have to consider social media\u2019s political climate leading up to 2016, which has been heavily marked by the gender war and identity politics. These things led to the emergence of a reactionary movement, namely the alt-right, and Trump was kind of the natural poster boy for that.Pepe plugged into the ideology of the alt-right because it was a reaction against the people they call \u201cnormies.\u201d Pepe had been a symbol of the disenfranchised, social outcasts. It was Trump\u2019s natural audience.No meme has ever been denounced by a presidential candidate. In a way, Pepe serves as a social media dog whistle for Trump followers to echo their implicit support of ultraconservative beliefs in public forums without risking the invitation of backlash.Is there a meme shared by supporters of both major party candidates? This is how many American voters feel about the state of affairs in this year\u2019s election. They think the world is ending.This interview has been edited and condensed.Advertisement"}

My oldest, Kholud, who is 15, wrote:We, the children of Yemen, want to achieve our hopes: to study and play and achieve our goals. We sleep afraid, we wake up afraid and leave our homes afraid.When the bombs are close enough, the shock waves shake the house badly, blowing open doors and windows. It feels as if the explosions are inside your ears. My son and youngest daughter \u2014 Haneen is 12 \u2014 wake up screaming, running in all directions through dark rooms.This video, taken by a friend, shows a bombing last month that was so close it threw us out of our beds.My wife and I have agreed on a division of roles. She takes care of our little boy, who sleeps in our room. I take care of the girls in the room next door. The first words we tell them are: \u201cYou are fine. We are all fine. The blast is far from our house. Don\u2019t panic. We are all O.K. You are O.K.\u201dI gather them all together and we make a group hug. If the night is particularly bad, we all sleep together.Way back when the war started, I explained to my daughters what this is all about: who is fighting whom and why. They understand that we are not a direct target for any of the fighting parties, but could be collateral damage should we happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.So we limit our movements. My children call this being \u201cunder house arrest.\u201dSchool is the one place I feel they should go, despite all my fears. Simply, I am a strong believer that education is the gateway to a safer future.Asma, who is 14, is the first to spend money and the last to save it. She loves children and her friends. I cried when I read what she had written for the Facebook post.We are afraid of catastrophe, as it is painful when a person kills others; mothers, fathers and children. It is as though the people\u2019s consciousness are like stones. And every person with authority does what he wants.Haneen, the 12-year-old, is outspoken and creative. She is always asking what things have not yet been invented because she says she wants to invent something that will benefit everyone.Once, when I apologized for being late because I was at work helping the children of Yemen, she confronted me: \u201cWe are also the children of Yemen.\u201d Here is an excerpt from her Facebook essay:The situation is getting worse daily. Our studies have stopped, playing is forbidden. They cut off the water and electricity on all the residents. Every day, the noises get louder and louder next to us.However, I have two questions that are confusing me: How will our future be beautiful if they have destroyed Yemen? When will this war end and Yemen will be liberated and the future will be beautiful, God willing?My children learned about the attack hours later, once they had finished all their homework.They always have questions. They asked if any of my friends had been killed.I told them one: the mayor of Sana. They were in a state of shock. I checked their homework to keep busy. But as soon as they went to bed, an airstrike rocked our house. Two more followed. I moved from their room to the middle of the house. They sleep next to each other on the same mattress, where I can hug them all if an airstrike hits the area.This is life in a war zone. Every day, you wake up to an unpleasant surprise: the death or injury of a friend or a family member. You witness the destruction of your childhood neighborhood, school and the little shop where you once bought candy.You have to live without electricity, water, fuel and social services. You don\u2019t want to live a life where your utmost achievement is surviving another day and your ultimate pleasure is having an uninterrupted internet connection.Wars are destructive not only to towns and cities, but also to souls.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Individualized Ads on TV Could Be One Result of AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byViewers, with new subscription options, could enjoy fewer interruptions and see ads for \u201cthe products you\u2019re interested in, not the ones you don\u2019t need to see,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. National advertisers would presumably pay more to reach them and have an alternative to spending on Google and Facebook.Targeted advertising has become commonplace on streaming services like Hulu or platforms like YouTube, where, for example, women in their 20s may see ads for birth control, pregnancy tests or certain movie trailers. Advertisers hope things could potentially move even beyond that on TV, with people seeing ads based on, for instance, their location or individual interests, much like what happens on the internet. Still, skepticism over whether the AT&T-Time Warner merger will normalize the practice for traditional TV is rife within the ad industry.\u201cAs to the question of whether this is a new route for advertising and another opportunity for targeted addressable TV advertising, the answer is it\u2019s going to take a significant period of time,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, pointing to the risks around regulation and combining the two companies. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but implementing it is not going to be easy.\u201dTailored advertising is a generally accepted part of the internet experience \u2014 consumers see it daily on Facebook or through banner ads, where it has become common for a specific shirt or bag placed in an online shopping cart to haunt a person for weeks, even after it has been purchased. But traditional TV has largely continued to advertise in broad swaths, showing ads to demographics like 18- to 49-year-old men.\u201cThe reality of it is, we\u2019re moving into a world where consumers are turning against advertising,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said.Stephen B. Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, speaking on Comcast\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, said that the TV group has been working to developing advanced advertising products but that the process was difficult.\u201cBut it\u2019s clear what advertisers want,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to combine the data intensity of internet advertising with the clear value and ability to change peoples\u2019 perceptions that you get with a television ad.\u201dOthers see great potential for advertising in the merger, which would marry AT&T\u2019s more than 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and DirecTV properties, with Time Warner\u2019s offerings, which include CNN, TBS, Cartoon Network, the website Bleacher Report, HBO and Warner Bros. Pictures. On Tuesday at WSJD, a technology conference organized by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Stephenson said that, starting next month, the company would offer a 100-channel internet-based premium television service that would cost $35 a month and allow people to watch video on their mobile phones and other devices.Rob Norman, chief digital officer of WPP\u2019s GroupM, a major media investment group, said the success of targeted advertising would hinge on cost. He offered the example of a home improvement business advertising grass seed in places like Arizona and Montana, which have significantly different climates. That advertising could be further tailored for whether viewers lived in a condominium versus a suburban home with a lawn, he said.\u201cIf you believe in a future where the very, very fine targeting of households or individuals with specific messaging makes economic sense to do at scale, what this merger does is enable that by making more audience available to target in that way,\u201d Mr. Norman said. \u201cThe question will be: What is the premium for addressability for that level of targeting that the advertiser is willing to pay?\u201dThe biggest change is that television \u201chas evolved to being more fluid and digital-like,\u201d as it appears on devices like phones and tablets and streams through accessories like Roku and Apple TV, Mr. Hanlon said.\u201cThis is clearly one of the significant envisioned benefits of this tie-up, which is the next generation of video advertising in a much more robust, targetable and data-rich manner,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the realm of digital advertising has been a dress rehearsal for the medium of television, which is now essentially getting ready for its full-fledged digital transformation.\u201dDave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads, said a combined AT&T and Time Warner could narrow the average price gap between cable ads and more expensive digital video ads by establishing a uniquely \u201chigh degree of coordination\u201d between a distributor, programmer and sales systems for digital and traditional video.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a magic silver bullet, but I do think a combination like this is going to accelerate better, more data-driven TV ads,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. Outside of targeting, he said, that could also mean frequency capping, so that people do not see the same ads over and over again, better retargeting and improved measurement.Mr. Sorrell predicted, \u201cAll of this is going to happen, but it\u2019s a question of how long it\u2019s going to take.\u201dAT&T AdWorks, the company\u2019s advertising division, said it did not use its mobile location and other mobile data for products out of that unit. The company declined to say whether that would change.Mr. Stephenson said in Monday\u2019s call that the combined company planned to use \u201crobust viewership insights\u201d from its television, mobile and broadband subscribers to advise what content it created, tailored to where and when certain demographics watched. Those insights will also \u201cexpand the market for addressable advertising,\u201d he said, describing it as \u201cfar more effective and more valuable both to the advertisers and to our customer.\u201dJeffrey Chester, the executive director for the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer advocacy group, said the deal made it clear that the \u201cinitial era of big data driven television is here.\u201d\u201cThe people who benefit here aside from AT&T shareholders are the big brands and advertisers across the country that are going to have a more effective vehicle for continually targeting consumers with interactive advertising and services,\u201d he said. \u201cTelevision, instead of the boob tube, is going to be \u2018I know you\u2019 tube.\u201dNick Wingfield contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Bol\u00edvar Symphony Opens Carnegie Season", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookCan music do anything when there\u2019s nothing to be done?The Bol\u00edvars are the latest iteration of what was once the marquee youth orchestra of El Sistema, the publicly financed Venezuelan arts education monolith that has been praised for helping raise thousands of children out of poverty. For all the good El Sistema does, its closeness to the government has made many wonder whether it and the Bol\u00edvars are inextricable from \u2014 or even function as a kind of propaganda mission for \u2014 a regime that has dragged its people to disaster. And concertgoers might even ask how they should approach listening to this orchestra at this particular fraught moment.Thursday\u2019s performance did not feature a group quite fit to stand in that exalted company: This was a feel-good, sound-good-not-great concert. The Bol\u00edvars may no longer be a youth orchestra, but they play with the fervent blandness of child prodigies. This was colorful music \u2014 Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse,\u201d Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d and a closing assortment of dance-themed bonbons, some more tightly executed than others \u2014 that here often lacked color. (And why is the roster so overwhelmingly male?)But the musicians were visibly having the time of their lives. You would not know \u2014 sitting among the gown- and tuxedo-clad crowd \u2014 that these artists\u2019 home country is grievously suffering. In brief remarks from the stage that focused on his and the players\u2019 love of, and joy in, music, Mr. Dudamel dropped an oblique reference to \u201cthe troubling times we are living in,\u201d and that was that.But is that enough? It is a question that has dogged Mr. Dudamel\u2019s career. The smiling international face of El Sistema, he has come under criticism for remaining a largely silent (and therefore acquiescent) beneficiary of government support.There are no easy answers, either for Mr. Dudamel or for us, to these kinds of ethical quandaries. And this is hardly the first time we\u2019ve had to check our moral compasses as classical listeners. Mr. Dudamel has strained to remain above the partisan fray. But what are we to make of the more overt, unapologetic political activity of the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a very public booster for Vladimir V. Putin, who was advocating anti-gay laws and squeezing any political dissent as he remains a crucial ally of Mr. Gergiev\u2019s Mariinsky Theater?When Soviet artists toured America during the Cold War, were they thawing a conflict, or were they whitewashing human-rights violations? Even if a repressive government is far different from a powerful individual, many have objected to the policy positions and political actions of the industrialist David H. Koch. Should these people\u2019s feelings about Mr. Koch affect their enjoyment of New York City Ballet, which performs at the David H. Koch Theater?But there is no disentangling the performance of classical music from a state of political affairs that many object to. If we want art \u2014 and we should \u2014 we need to realize that purity in this regard is impossible.So I don\u2019t think it makes sense, for example, to boycott City Ballet to avoid the Koch Theater. But neither should its name be ignored. If you want to cheer the Bol\u00edvars\u2019 signature spirited rendition of \u201cMambo,\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d I would say that it is your responsibility also to learn about \u2014 and in some way keep in mind as they play \u2014 the situation facing their countrymen.When you go to the symphony, study the list of donors in the playbill and Google their professional activities. If these days we insist on knowing the farm our restaurant chicken comes from, why shouldn\u2019t we know the doings of the private-equity firms supporting our orchestras?The key for contemporary listeners is to keep not just our ears open, but also our eyes. There is no such thing as apolitical culture \u2014 Ravel\u2019s \u201cLa Valse,\u201d for one thing, lurches like the nauseating World War I hangover that it is. And there should be no such thing as apolitical culture consumers.\u201cIn El Sistema\u2019s orchestras,\u201d Mr. Dudamel wrote last year, \u201cthe son of an opposition leader and the daughter of a government minister may sit next to each other creating beautiful music. In that moment, they know no politics.\u201dWe in the audience should not grant ourselves the same luxury.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Fate: Marc Benioff of Salesforce Addresses Acquisition Talk", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, showed up onstage on Wednesday afternoon at his biggest customer event of the year to talk up his business technology company\u2019s products and strategy.But what was arguably the higher-stakes meeting was held later that day. At the plush St. Regis San Francisco Hotel, Mr. Benioff presided over a gathering with Wall Street analysts and investors. His aim: to assuage their concerns about his plan to buy Twitter, the struggling social media company.\u201cWe look at a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Benioff told the room, without directly mentioning Twitter. \u201cThe number we acquire is very few.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cit gives us ideas\u201d to look at companies.At first glance, the two companies could not be more different. Twitter is where celebrities, politicians and countless other individuals broadcast their thoughts in 140-character messages. Salesforce, on the other hand, makes online software for salespeople and marketers.Yet Twitter would fit into a vision that Mr. Benioff has had for Salesforce, which he founded in 1999, as a company that can help enterprises with all of their customer needs. Twitter, in Mr. Benioff\u2019s eyes, is already a powerful customer service tool that airlines, restaurants, banks and many other companies use to field consumer complaints and requests. Companies can also use what people post on Twitter to glean consumer habits.\u201cThis is a huge messaging and communications service,\u201d Mr. Benioff, who turned 52 last month, said on Wednesday in an interview on his way to the St. Regis. He added, \u201cI use mergers and acquisition activity to think about the market.\u201dMr. Benioff faces a battery of challenges in buying Twitter. Skeptical investors have pushed Salesforce stock down about 5 percent since news broke that the company was considering bidding for the social media company. Behind the scenes, investors have been grousing about a potential purchase. Any deal would very likely be Salesforce\u2019s largest, with Twitter valued at about $14 billion. Salesforce, which is unprofitable, has a market capitalization of about $48 billion.Twitter investors appear dubious, too. The company\u2019s stock dropped more than 20 percent on Thursday as speculation about other suitors seemed to dissipate.\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMr. Benioff acknowledged that Salesforce would face difficulties in taking over Twitter, given that Salesforce sells software to businesses while Twitter is a consumer technology company. The chief executive, who is an activist in areas like gay rights and gender equality, also said he was troubled by the amount of hate speech on Twitter.But it is not unusual for Mr. Benioff to go against the grain. A San Francisco native, he worked at Oracle, the business software company, for years before founding Salesforce as an online software firm in 1999, when online software was still unproven.\u201cMarc wants to be well thought of, to feel like he\u2019s doing things the right way,\u201d said Adam Bosworth, a Salesforce executive who left in August to work at Amazon. Mr. Bosworth recalled once disagreeing with Mr. Benioff on a management issue and sending him an email with the subject line, \u201cYou are not being a mensch.\u201d\u201cIt was the fastest response I ever got from him,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.Much of the data that Salesforce is gaining through acquisitions can help power artificial intelligence, which Mr. Benioff says will soon be everywhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought about a dozen A.I. companies, built whole new teams,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Without LinkedIn, Mr. Benioff turned his sights to Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to rev up its growth.Mr. Benioff, who is himself a power user of Twitter, said on Wednesday that while it was essential that Salesforce be in A.I., there was more to Twitter than that.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge customer-service platform,\u201d used by companies like Dell, Apple and Bank of America, he said in the interview on the way to the St. Regis. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reason to buy it, but it\u2019s a reason to look at it. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m buying it, but I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not buying it.\u201dLater, at the investor meeting where analysts shied from mentioning the name Twitter, Mr. Benioff tried to explain where he was coming from. \u201cI see things in a different kind of way,\u201d he told them. \u201cI hope someday to sit down and say how I think about that which shall not be named.\u201dEventually, though, Mr. Benioff could not resist a more direct reference to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. \u201cI wish Jack well with his company,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at the end of the investor meeting.Advertisement"}

Colonial-era buildings and decrepit homes claimed by squatters stand near new hotels in a neighborhood where trendiness and exclusivity portend gentrification. But the tug between the present and the past could just as easily apply to the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s young gang members torn between old and new ways of survival while wondering if the remade district will have any room for them.The idea is to offer members of the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four gangs \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who have been responsible for drug dealing, robberies and violence against rival members \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with counseling, job training and the chance to either work at one of the hotels or restaurants in Casco or start their own business.\u00e2\u0080\u009cReintegration programs are expensive and a lot of people are against investing in men with criminal pasts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Hardin told Mr. Ornitz in an interview for his continuing project. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany people just see things in terms of crime and punishment. They don\u2019t realize that there is a cycle of poverty that can eventually turn an entire country upside down. That cycle can only be broken by attacking a number of links at the same time, and young men, whether at risk or already in gangs, are one of the key links.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Ornitz, 31, was predisposed to see the situation through that lens: In New York, he had been a volunteer at Rikers Island, where he taught meditation to inmates. That led him to follow Esperanza\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third class of young men who had enrolled in the program.\u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of using general labels about good and bad, we need to understand the complexity, causes and circumstances that lead people to certain actions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ornitz said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a complex reality that surrounds at-risk youths in this vulnerable population. We have to see each other as fundamentally wanting the same things. When we get caught up in concepts of good and bad, we fail to see the commonalities between us.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe was more concerned about the potential he saw in each of his subjects. Juan, for example, started his own seafood business, while Gerald has taken a hotel job. One started a D.J. business, and another group offers tours of the historic area. It is honest work, even though some participants return to old ways.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can be tempting to go back when you can\u2019t pay for your kid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s school and just doing the old job can earn you more money in one day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ornitz said.All of this is playing out against a backdrop of a rapidly changing urban landscape, where these young men still have to go home to run-down buildings that house dozens of squatters. Those makeshift havens are vanishing, as people are steadily being pushed out. Mr. Ornitz said the program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s backers had turned their attention to bringing affordable housing to the area. And while gang violence may be down, Mr. Ornitz said, tense relations with the police persist. During one birthday party Mr. Ornitz attended \u2014 where no illegal activity was happening \u2014 the police burst in with a battering ram to raid the place. While they no longer have to worry about whether they will be alive in a year, the young men have new worries about whether they can earn enough to maintain a family. Yet to see many of them stick to their new path offers some encouragement.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see a group of people who thought they could only relate to society in one way: in a gang,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ornitz said. \u201cI now see them realize their own potential to be a constructive member of society and do something that gives them dignity, makes them feel proud and supports their family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Broadband Providers Will Need Permission to Collect Private Data", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byBy a 3-to-2 vote, the Federal Communications Commission clearly took the side of consumers. The new rules require broadband providers to obtain permission from subscribers to gather and give out data on their web browsing, app use, location and financial information. Currently, broadband providers can track users unless those individuals tell them to stop.It was the first time the F.C.C. has passed such online protections. The agency made privacy rules for phones and cable television in the past, but high-speed internet providers, including AT&T and Verizon Communications, were not held to any privacy restrictions, even though those behemoth companies have arguably one of the most expansive views of the habits of web users.Privacy groups applauded the new rules, which they said brought the United States more in line with European nations that have moved aggressively to protect their citizens\u2019 online privacy.\u201cFor the first time, the public will be guaranteed that when they use broadband to connect to the internet, whether on a mobile device or personal computer, they will have the ability to decide whether and how much of their information can be gathered,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy.The outcry from industries that depend on online user data was also swift. Cable lobbying groups called the rules a result of \u201cregulatory opportunism,\u201d while the Association of National Advertisers labeled the regulations \u201cunprecedented, misguided, counterproductive, and potentially extremely harmful.\u201dEven with the new rules, online privacy remains tricky. Many people have been lackadaisical about what information they give up online when they register for websites or digital services. The convenience of free services like maps also appeals to people, even though they give companies access to personal information. And some people unknowingly forgo their privacy when allowing apps or other services to track their location or follow their browsing across websites.The F.C.C. rules also have their limits. Online ad juggernauts, including Google, Facebook and other web companies, are not subject to the new regulations. The F.C.C. does not have jurisdiction over web companies. Those companies are instead required to follow general consumer protection rules enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. That means Google does not have to explicitly ask people permission first to gather web browsing habits, for example.AT&T, Verizon and Comcast will also still be able to gather consumers\u2019 digital data, though not as easily as before. The F.C.C. rules apply only to their broadband businesses. That would mean data from the habits of AT&T\u2019s wireless and home broadband customers would be subject to the regulations, but not data about AT&T\u2019s DirecTV users or users of the HBO Now app, which would come with the merger with Time Warner, for example.The companies also have other ways to collect information about people, including the purchase of data from brokers.AT&T, which has criticized the privacy regulations for internet service providers, would not comment on how the rules would affect its proposed purchase of Time Warner. But it emphasized the benefits of ads that allow for free and cheaper web services.\u201cAt the end of the day, consumers desire services which shift costs away from them and toward advertisers,\u201d said Robert W. Quinn Jr., AT&T\u2019s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs. \u201cWe will look at the specifics of today\u2019s action, but it would appear on its face to inhibit that shift of lower costs for consumers by imposing a different set of rules on\u201d internet service providers.Comcast said that the rules were not needed and that the F.C.C. did not prove that broadband providers were hurting consumers.For over two decades, internet service providers \u201cand all other internet companies have operated under the F.T.C.\u2019s privacy regime and, during that time, the internet thrived; consumer privacy was protected,\u201d said David L. Cohen, Comcast\u2019s senior executive vice president.Major broadband providers will have about one year to make the changes required by the new rules; the companies must notify users of their new privacy options in ways like email or dialogue boxes on websites. After the rules are in effect, broadband providers will immediately stop collecting what the F.C.C. deems sensitive data, including Social Security numbers and health data, unless a customer gives permission.Even some web companies protested the proposed rules. Google said in comments filed to the F.C.C. this month that the regulations should not include web browsing, because that does not necessarily include sensitive personal information.\u201cConsumers benefit from responsible online advertising, individualized content, and product improvements based on browsing information,\u201d wrote Austin Schlick, Google\u2019s director of communications law.In the end, the objections had little effect on the F.C.C.\u201cHopefully, this is the end of what has been the race to the bottom for online privacy, and hopefully the beginning of a race to the top,\u201d said Harold Feld, senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit public interest group.Advertisement"}

Jerry Brown, who argues that it would give prisoners more incentive to rehabilitate while in custody and offer them a second chance.The measure would allow thousands of inmates convicted of \u201cnonviolent\u201d felonies to apply for parole and give prison officials the ability to give those inmates more credit for time spent in rehabilitation and education programs.The opposition comes from the Republican Party and most of the district attorneys in the state. They argue that the measure will increase crime, as other early release measure have done \u2014 property crimes and violent crime rates have each increased by about 7 percent.The measure would also require judges, instead of prosecutors, to decide whether juveniles as young as 14 should be tried as adults and sent to prison.\u2014 Jennifer Medina, Los Angeles-based correspondentCalifornia Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "For some, the thought of Newark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s housing projects conjure up images of crowded brick high-rises with tight hallways and dangerous, dimly lighted corners. But Akintola Hanif sees a very different scene when he photographs there \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a place where children play and people love and live their lives as a large community.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese people are mothers, fathers and students,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho have jobs and beautiful spirits. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving and loving and honorable people.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor him, the projects had been \u00e2\u0080\u009ca warm and fuzzy place\u00e2\u0080\u009d where adults looked after everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children while they played outside. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because his earliest memories were of visiting his cousins, aunts and uncles in the Arcadian Gardens projects in East Orange, just over the Newark city line. Mr. Hanif has been documenting life in nine housing projects in the Newark area since 2003. He has seen Arcadian Gardens, also known as Little City, change as crack and gangs  \u00e2\u0080\u009crocked the black community,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. But even then, the residents \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreated each other as family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Mr. Hanif immersed himself in the complex where his relatives had lived and befriended its residents. There were, he said, occasional disputes and drug dealing, but he never saw violence. He had \u00e2\u0080\u009cseen drug dealing in Washington Square Park and on Wall Street too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere have been people from the housing projects who have done violent things in other places but almost never where they live,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOutsiders can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really come there and start any trouble. When I was inside Arcadian Gardens, I felt as safe as a baby in his mother\u2019s arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After Arcadian Gardens was demolished in 2004, Mr. Hanif learned that Newark officials intended to knock down other projects, prompting him to photograph nine others before they vanished. Three of them have already been demolished, and two more are abandoned.Many of the former residents of Arcadian Gardens were given Section 8 housing vouchers, which allowed them to rent apartments elsewhere if the landlord accepted the payments. Most residents who Mr. Hanif knew stayed nearby. Many miss being around their extended family.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey just moved on to other things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are annual reunions and a Facebook page, and many still hang out with their longtime friends from the projects.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Hanif, who grew up in Brooklyn Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant, was home-schooled by his mother, who was a paralegal and, later, a reflexologist. His father was a professor at Hunter College. His childhood combined \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best of both worlds\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meeting Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Fab 5 Freddy at gallery openings and hanging out on street corners. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not looking to make money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just want the world to see these people as just as dynamic and layered as all of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington features three of his photographs as well as part of the actual exterior of Newark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Baxter Terrace Houses.Many of the stories of Newark\u2019s projects have gone untold, Mr. Hanif said, because \u00e2\u0080\u009cother people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he wants his work to allow the heart of these communities to live on after the brick and mortar vanish in a cloud of dust.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all about showing another side of my people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe beauty I see in them and the love I receive from them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d "}

Instead, they say much more about the way the American dream has evolved to fit a postrecession economic reality.The company\u2019s new \u201cWe Help You Make It\u201d campaign eschews the aspirational gloss of master suites and two-story foyers in favor of embracing Americans \u2014 and their furniture needs \u2014 where they are today.Ikea\u2019s website promises, \u201cNo matter who you are, what you do, or how much you make, you can still make the dream yours.\u201d It\u2019s an inclusive message that, in this fraught political climate, could be a campaign slogan just as easily as a pitch for floor lamps and futons.\u201cSociety itself is quite ripe for this message because it is something people are thinking about,\u201d said Christine Whitehawk, Ikea\u2019s external communications manager for the United States, adding that the examples shown in the ads reflect the way many Americans live today.\u201cThat\u2019s the reality for many people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt resonates with people when you do speak to their life situation.\u201dLeslie Stone, director of strategic services at Ogilvy & Mather, Ikea\u2019s agency partner, said the goal was to show \u201creal people in real living situations that anyone could relate to.\u201d\u201cThe scene with the family who have given the bedroom over to the baby and the mom and dad are sleeping in the living room \u2014 people loved that we were being so empathetic,\u201d she said.Aside from the TV ads, which will be broadcast on local channels and cable outlets like HGTV and the Food Network, the \u201cWe Help You Make It\u201d campaign includes print ads in magazines like Architectural Digest, People en Espa\u00f1ol and Real Simple. Ikea is also sponsoring the first Home & Design special issue of InStyle magazine.Ikea, which is based in Sweden, is using its website, online ads and social media channels to promote the campaign as well. \u201cFacebook and Instagram are two of the platforms that work really well for us,\u201d Ms. Whitehawk said.Ikea plans to use Twitter to share data from research it commissioned from the Economist Intelligence Unit to find out about Americans\u2019 aspirations and concerns in terms of the economy, education and financial benchmarks like homeownership.\u201cWe started finding information that was suggesting to us that, postrecession, people\u2019s opinions on what it means to make it had changed,\u201d Ms. Whitehawk said, referring to a \u201cnew normal\u201d in which possessions take a back seat to experiences.The ads reflect this, said Kevin Lane Keller, a professor of marketing at the Dartmouth College Tuck School of Business.\u201cThis is the reality. They\u2019re not trying to romanticize any of this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of taking this more democratic view, this more down-to-earth view, talking about where people are,\u201d rather than possibly alienating potential customers by depicting an affluent lifestyle that many people feel is unattainable.\u201cThe idea really isn\u2019t selling you a dream of what your life should look like, but the dream you\u2019re living,\u201d Ms. Stone of Ogilvy & Mather said. \u201cPrice and accessibility kind of go hand in hand. We looked at this as a story of democratizing the American dream, and the fact that Ikea is so affordable was something we had never put into context.\u201dPart of that means emphasizing a panoply of ages, ethnicities and family living situations: A middle-aged woman makes a face when she opens up a compost bin in her kitchen; a bride flings herself onto a sectional sofa and digs into a carton of ice cream; a mixed-race same-sex couple cuddle up on the couch to watch TV.\u201cI think the diversity thing is clearly an angle they\u2019re bringing out,\u201d Mr. Keller said. \u201cThat\u2019s modern life. People have lots of different things they care about, but basically everybody needs chairs and sofas.\u201dMiguel Sahagun, assistant professor of marketing at High Point University, said highlighting diversity and family bonding over consumerism was an especially smart way for Ikea to target younger people. \u201cThe messages they\u2019re using, they perfectly align with the way millennials, and some Generation X people, think about furniture and goods,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the experience.\u201dBecause of this, advertisements that play down the actual products can be surprisingly effective, he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the appropriate way to go if you\u2019re targeting that generation,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on the technical aspects of the product.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2 Kentucky Police Officers Win Pregnancy Discrimination Case", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byDuring her first pregnancy, Lyndi J. Trischler switched from her arduous duties as a police officer patrolling Florence, Ky., to a desk job. After she became pregnant again in 2014, she learned that the city had a new policy, and that there would be no \u201clight duty\u201d: She could keep working the streets or take time off.The prospect of unpaid leave and losing her health insurance terrified her \u2014 all the more so after she learned that the boy she was carrying had a severe abnormality, which would take his life hours after he was born. So she kept at her usual job for as long as she could, as did a fellow officer, Samantha J. Riley, who became pregnant soon after her.\u201cI was on patrol on the road until I was about five and a half months pregnant, and the equipment, the type of work we have to do, is not conducive to being pregnant,\u201d Officer Trischler said. \u201cEven putting the equipment on \u2014 the gun belt, the bulletproof vest \u2014 I was in a lot of pain every day.\u201dOn Wednesday, the Justice Department announced that Florence had agreed to adopt a new policy allowing modified duty for pregnant employees, and to pay a total of $135,000 in damages and lawyers\u2019 fees to Officer Trischler, 32, and Officer Riley, 31, though the settlement requires a federal judge\u2019s approval. It was the first pregnancy discrimination case the Justice Department had intervened in since the Supreme Court handed down an important ruling on the subject last year.Complaints of pregnancy discrimination to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have risen sharply, from about 4,000 a year in the 1990s to more than 6,000 per year, but most are unsuccessful. And very few have involved women in law enforcement, a physically demanding, dangerous profession that has long been considered a male stronghold.Officers Riley and Trischler charged that Florence\u2019s policy violated two federal laws: the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled in their favor and referred the case to the Justice Department.\u201cThere are so few women in uniform, and this is a great step forward,\u201d said Dina Bakst, one of the presidents of A Better Balance, an advocacy group that represented the two officers in Florence. \u201cThe culture is so male-dominated, and just to survive in this workplace is often really difficult.\u201dBut in a sign of changing times, Officers Riley and Trischler said they had received only support and encouragement from their co-workers and superiors, even after they filed a complaint against the city. Other officers tried to take the toughest cases when the two women were pregnant, and donated unused vacation time to them to keep their paychecks coming.\u201cEverybody knows each other, everybody really does take care of each other, and people were excited to see my baby,\u201d Officer Riley said. \u201cI love my job. I love the people that I work with. This is the career that I chose, and this is what I want to do until I retire.\u201dThey also got support from strangers, telling them they were not alone. \u201cPeople sent me messages through Facebook, other pregnant officers dealing with the same thing,\u201d Officer Trischler said.Many pregnant women face similar discrimination but are unaware of the unequal treatment, or do not realize that they can fight it, Ms. Bakst said.Officer Trischler said that when she was carrying her daughter, who is now 3, she was the first pregnant officer the city had ever had. The second time around, she was told she could use her accumulated vacation and sick time and then go on unpaid leave, which would have meant losing her health coverage. She and the children\u2019s father, who is an officer in another police department, were not married, and she could not fall back on his insurance.But with the time off donated by her co-workers, followed by a short-term disability program that paid part of her salary and an agreement by the city to let her health plan continue if she paid the premiums, she was able to get by. She took a hit financially, but the blow was not as severe as it might have been.She had the added burden of learning midway through the pregnancy that her son would die shortly after birth. Now, she wants to have more children, she said, but \u201cit\u2019s kind of a nerve-racking thing, because what we went through was so traumatic.\u201dThings went better for Officer Riley, whose son is now almost 2. She had accumulated more paid time off, but as a result, she gave up months of vacation time.By the time she became pregnant again, the city had reverted to its earlier practice, and Officer Riley, whose second son is due in three months, has been on light duty the past six weeks.In an earlier era, an unwelcoming atmosphere might have pushed the officers to quit the force, but instead, both returned to it after giving birth.\u201cI definitely think women in law enforcement is essential,\u201d Officer Trischler said. \u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s almost like a calling. I can\u2019t imagine a life other than this one, honestly.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Some of the biggest names in the fashion industry, especially in e-commerce \u2014 such as Asos, Farfetch, Lyst and Yoox Net-a-Porter \u2014 have headquarters in the British capital.And while the fashion community has stayed relatively silent on the subject, there is little doubt that businesses have been mulling their options as European capitals on the Continent position themselves as worthy alternatives. Venture capital investments in Britain plummeted 40 percent in the second quarter this year compared with the first quarter, as uncertainty before the vote held investors back, according to data published this week by CB Insights.Although a majority of London\u2019s technology headquarters are in the east of the city, Alex Alexander, chief information officer of Yoox Net-a-Porter, said the company wished to stay in the west to be close to its other operational base, above the Westfield shopping center. Other big names in the local creative sphere said to be setting up offices in the White City development include the fashion label Stella McCartney and the Royal College of Art.\u201cWe were keen to show our commitment to the U.K.,\u201d Mr. Alexander said by telephone from New York, \u201cand felt that bringing all of our technology talent into a single hub was an important step in terms of bringing our five-year plan, which is based on outpacing our competition on mobile, to fruition.\u201dHe brushed off suggestions that London\u2019s reputation had been tarnished by the country\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\u201cWe continue to have real confidence in London, regardless of the decision to leave the E.U., and see this investment as an opportunity to reaffirm that,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see any side effects in terms of talent being drawn here. We are expecting to see a steady flow continue and think the city will remain a world-leading tech hub.\u201dFashion companies are not alone in doubling down on the British capital. Facebook and Google, among other American tech giants, also have plans to expand their London operations, investing in development and sales teams to fuel their European activities.Predictably, signs of major technology and fashion companies taking steps to expand its presence in London was met with open arms.\u201cI am delighted that there will be yet more new tech jobs coming to the capital,\u201d said Rajesh Agrawal, London\u2019s deputy mayor for business and enterprise. \u201cThis highlights once again that London is open for business, new investment and global talent.\u201dFor now, the signs for Britain are encouraging. Of Europe\u2019s technology unicorns \u2014 private companies with a valuation of more than $1 billion \u2014 almost 40 percent are based in the country. Nearly a third of all European venture capital funding comes to Britain.But it is still early. There is no certainty that Europeans working in Britain will be forced to leave once the withdrawal from the bloc is final, and a report by Balderton Capital shows that while engineers in Berlin or Paris earned on average almost 18 percent less than their London counterparts do, the devaluation of the pound was fast closing that gap.Whether entrepreneurs looking to start the next billion-dollar fashion technology business might favor Berlin, Dublin or Stockholm \u2014 which have established technology sectors and benefit from the European Union\u2019s free flow of labor \u2014 remains to be seen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Featured Paula Jones and 2 Other Women Who Accused Bill Clinton of Sexual Assault", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump held a surprise news conference shortly before the second presidential debate on Sunday with three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or sexual harassment in the past.The four women were Paula Jones, Kathy Shelton, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey. Here is a brief guide to the accusations each woman has made against Bill and Hillary Clinton.Ms. Jones is a former Arkansas state employee who sued Mr. Clinton for sexual harassment in 1994. She claimed that he exposed himself to her and propositioned her in a hotel room in 1991 when he was governor.Ms. Jones\u2019s lawsuit led to Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998 because it was during a deposition in that case that he first denied having had sexual relations with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky.On Sunday, Ms. Jones responded angrily to a reporter who asked Mr. Trump if his star power entitled him to grope women without their consent. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Bill Clinton that?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go ask Bill Clinton that? Why don\u2019t you ask Hillary as well?\u201dHere\u2019s how we analyzed in real time the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.When she was 12, Ms. Shelton alleged that she had been raped by Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old man. Mrs. Clinton defended Mr. Taylor in his 1975 trial when she was a professor and a lawyer with the University of Arkansas Law School Legal Aid Clinic.On Sunday, Ms. Shelton said that \u201cat 12 years old, Hillary put me through something that you would never put a 12-year-old through\u201d and accused her of \u201claughing on tape saying she knows they did it.\u201dMs. Broaddrick repeated her accusations against the Clintons at Mr. Trump\u2019s hastily arranged news conference on Sunday night, defending him against the maelstrom of criticism caused by the release of a recording on which he could be heard talking about women in vulgar sexual terms.\u201cI tweeted recently, and Mr. Trump retweeted it, that actions speak louder than words,\u201d Ms. Broaddrick said. \u201cMr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me.

She then filed an official complaint with the airline on Tuesday and received a general reply that the airline was investigating and did not discriminate.An airline representative also left her a voice mail message to speak with her, Dr. Cross said, but she had been unable to return the call because of her operation-room and medical schedule.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byIn the 1990s, art found a new medium. Anarchic and unconstrained, the World Wide Web attracted an oddball collection of people ready to do almost anything and call it art. Often their work looked weird and amateurish, with pixelated graphics, tinny chiptune music and garish colors. But what it lacked aesthetically it made up for in conviction.In Australia, four women who styled themselves VNS Matrix posted a \u201cCyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century,\u201d followed by a vagina-framed poster in which they joyously proclaimed themselves \u201csaboteurs of big daddy mainframe.\u201d In Moscow, a young woman named Olia Lialina created \u201cMy Boyfriend Came Back From the War,\u201d a forking narrative, poignant and oblique, that combined text with grainy black-and-white imagery. An anonymous woman in Amsterdam, eventually identified as Martine Neddam, built a brightly colored site that purported to be the home page of a 13-year-old named Mouchette, after the girl in the 1967 Robert Bresson film who finds a life of torment and abuse too much to bear.In addition to salvaging the past, the aim is to tell the story of Internet-based art in an online gallery that serves much the same narrative function as the galleries in the Museum of Modern Art. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of amnesia about the history these things have,\u201d Michael Connor, Rhizome\u2019s artistic director, said as he sat in the New Museum\u2019s ground-floor cafe. \u201cThis is an opportunity to really be rigorous.\u201dBroadly speaking, the story Rhizome is telling can be divided into two parts, with the dot-com collapse of 2000-1 as the inflection point. The post-bubble side looks relatively familiar, facilitated as it is by high-speed, always-on connections and characterized by rapid commercialization and the emergence of social media and streaming video platforms like Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005) and Tumblr (2007).But before the bubble in internet stocks burst, before Google took over and Netscape collapsed and Apple was resurrected from near-death, the web was \u201can entirely new world,\u201d as Mr. Arcangel, 38, put it in a telephone interview from his home in Norway. \u201cSometimes it was not even clear what you were looking at \u2014 was it an artwork or a web server that was broken?\u201d Even so, he knew something exciting was happening.Net Art\u2019s political posture was characteristic of the feverish, techno-utopian excitement shared by netheads in general. \u201cThere was this radical idea that the internet was going to change the way art is made and shared,\u201d said Lauren Cornell, who was Rhizome\u2019s executive director from 2005 to 2012 and who has since moved to the New Museum as a curator and associate director of technology initiatives. \u201cThat it might even do away with traditional institutions and gatekeepers\u201d \u2014 that is, museums and curators.Preserving this work is not just a matter of uploading old computer files. \u201cThe files don\u2019t mean anything without the browser,\u201d Mr. Connor, 38, said. \u201cAnd the browser doesn\u2019t mean anything without the computer\u201d it runs on. Yet browsers from 15 or 20 years ago won\u2019t work on today\u2019s computers, and computers from that era are hard to come by and even harder to keep working.Dragan Espenschied, Rhizome\u2019s preservation director, has been working with the University of Freiburg in Germany to develop a sophisticated software framework that emulates outdated computing environments on current machines.\u201cVVEBCAM\u201d was provocative, and it got a strong response. \u201cPeople were really nasty,\u201d she said, \u201cand my policy was always to respond in a way that was equal to or greater than the comments they made.\u201d Rhizome intends to embed the video in a reconstructed YouTube player, but there\u2019s no way to recreate the reaction the video provoked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you were taking screen shots,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.\u201dWhich could be said for Net Art itself. \u201cNet Art is not over,\u201d Mr. Tribe said, \u201cbut it is over as an avant-garde art movement.\u201d In its place is art posted to the internet not by art world renegades but by professionals for whom the internet is one medium among many \u2014 people like Ms. Cortright or Mr. Trecartin, whose deliriously disjointed videos are equally at home on YouTube and at the Saatchi Gallery in London.The term that\u2019s being used is Post-Internet Art \u2014 not \u201cpost\u201d in the sense that the internet is over, but that it\u2019s ubiquitous. In the post-internet era, the internet is simply assumed.\u201cIt\u2019s different, now that everybody\u2019s online,\u201d said Ms. Cortright, 30. \u201cEven 10 years ago, it was not as much a part of people\u2019s lives as it is today.\u201d She considers it \u201cadmirable\u201d that Rhizome has committed itself to preserving artifacts from a past that\u2019s so recent and yet so distant, \u201cOtherwise, they really would be lost.\u201dAnd yet, she added, \u201cyou can\u2019t be too attached to something that\u2019s completely fleeting.

A hand-painted banner hung in front of one frat house read, \u201cGrab Mizzou by the TIGER.\u201dLast Friday, Stafford Jones, the chairman of the Alachua County Republicans, sat in a Gainesville volunteer office while his small dog snuffled around his desk.

At a rally at an airport in Lakeland, Fla., last Wednesday, the crowd of Trump fans walked back to their cars in a light drizzle.

The women, who are African-American, said they felt that they stood out in the largely white crowd. They weren\u2019t Trump supporters; they were just there to experience the scene for themselves.\u201cA lot of people here, they kept touching us and saying, \u2018Congratulations, you guys are making the right choice,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Mombrun said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell people that I wasn\u2019t a supporter because I didn\u2019t want to get attacked or something.\u201dNearby, Alexandra Holland, an 18-year-old high school student, was standing with her younger brother, who said he would vote for Mr. Trump if he was old enough. When I asked her about the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, which has helped turn the 2016 election into a lesson in consent, she shrugged.\u201cIn my opinion, we don\u2019t need somebody nice, we need somebody intelligent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all said things we\u2019ve regretted. It was one tiny thing, and I was a little bit offended to start out with, but then I just kind of put it behind me because the good overtakes the bad.\u201dBree Molnar and Caitlyn Morsch, students at nearby Southeastern University, a Christian liberal arts college, were also at the rally and seemed to share Ms. Trump\u2019s inclination to play down the importance of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Ms. Molnar was wearing a Hillary for Prison T-shirt she\u2019d bought at the rally. A man walked up to the two young women, holding out his phone.\u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d he said. \u201cFor my Facebook, I need another Hillary for Prison shirt.\u201d Ms. Molnar obliged and posed for a photo with him.I asked them about the Trump tape, and the women lit up; they\u2019d spent the car ride to the rally talking about it.\u201cI honestly think it\u2019s ridiculous. It was years ago. How many times have women let men talk to them that way?\u201d Ms. Molnar said.Among Florida\u2019s actual frat boys, it is clear that the election has divided them just as it has divided pretty much everyone else. On fraternity row at the University of Florida, almost every member I talked to had reluctantly made up his mind to vote for Trump or Clinton. Many of them had considered voting for Gary Johnson at one point, before deciding it would be a waste.Cade Jarrard, a freshman pledge, sat on one of the many couches that filled his fraternity\u2019s common room. In the background, a flat-screen TV showed an old episode of \u201cSouth Park.\u201d Mr. Jarrard is a registered Republican, but he said he would be \u201creluctantly\u201d voting for Mrs. Clinton this year to keep Mr. Trump out of office.\u201cI just think he would be an awful president and an awful role model for the country,\u201d he said.Jonathan Acosta, a sophomore, was relaxing in the same fraternity house as Mr. Jarrard. Before Mr. Trump announced his presidential run, Mr. Acosta used one of his quotes (\u201csomething about dreaming big\u201d) in his high school yearbook. But this year, he\u2019ll vote for Mrs. Clinton without hesitation. He said Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t understand how hard it already is for people like his parents \u2014 who immigrated to the United States from Colombia \u2014 to make it here.\u201cAs soon as he started his presidential campaign, one of the first things he said was the thing about Mexicans being drug criminals and stuff like that, and then\u201d \u2014 he snapped his fingers \u2014 \u201cright away I was turned off.\u201dWill Thomasson, a junior accounting major, will be voting for Mr. Trump. He and his parents rooted for Marco Rubio in the primary, but he thinks Mr. Trump is more trustworthy than Mrs. Clinton, and his tax plan is \u201cmore realistic.\u201dHe added that the coverage of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2005 remarks, and the ensuing allegations from women saying Mr. Trump groped them, has been \u201ca little harsh.\u201d\u201cI think the media is kind of overblowing it,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, he said something vulgar, but he just happened to be recorded in that time. People say vulgar things all the time.\u201dCullen Powers, barefoot, sporting shaggy hair and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, was sitting on the stoop of Kappa Alpha, a historically Christian conservative fraternity with a few of his brothers.He said he supported Mr. Trump in the Republican primary. He argued that Democrats have tricked minorities into voting for them over the past 60 years by offering handouts, calling it \u201cnew-age racism.\u201d\u201cThey have less jobs, less job opportunities, and it\u2019s because they\u2019ve been given all of these subsidies,\u201d he said.\u201cBeing able to manipulate the tax code is the sign of a great businessman,\u201d he said.In front of a house farther up fraternity row, Jordan Roth and Shehzad Maniar were blissfully throwing a football around before pausing to oblige a reporter with election talk.Both men said they supported Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary, and while Mr. Maniar has settled on voting for Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Roth\u2019s mind seems to change every day.\u201cI was going to vote for Gary Johnson, most likely, and then I just did some more research and realized that he\u2019s an idiot, too,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cI\u2019ll either vote for Hillary or write in Ken Bone.\u201dAfter the election is over, men \u2014 liberal and conservative \u2014 might use this as an opportunity not just to pat themselves on the back for not being Mr. Trump, but to wonder when, at one time in their lives, they have played the role of Billy Bush.Mr. Roth, the undecided voter, said that if conversations he and his fraternity brothers had were recorded, it would be probably sound worse than the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.\u201cYou\u2019re right. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not running for president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Maniar, his fraternity brother, responded.\u201cIf someone were to scroll through our group chat \u2014\u201d\u201cIt would be bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should We See Everything a Cop Sees?", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "FeatureBody cameras have been promoted as a solution to police misconduct. But the strange two-year saga of Seattle shows just how complicated total transparency can be.Supported byO\u2019Toole\u2019s eighth-floor conference room, which has views of City Hall and Elliott Bay and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains, was packed with top police and city officials. All eyes were on a lawyer from the city attorney\u2019s office named Mary Perry. A former naval officer in her 60s, Perry was small and soft-spoken and favored pearls, and she was the city\u2019s unrivaled expert in the seemingly mundane intricacies of the state\u2019s Public Records Act. She was briefing the room on the potential fallout from a landmark case she had just argued and lost before the Washington State Supreme Court. The case stemmed from a series of public-records requests by a reporter for the local television station KOMO, Tracy Vedder, who began filing them after the same high-profile incidents that would lead to the consent decree. She asked for user manuals to the department\u2019s new system of in-car dashboard cameras, then for lists of dashcam recordings, then for some of the recordings themselves. After the department denied every one of them, Vedder sued it for violating the Public Records Act.The act, which dates to 1972, when governments ran on paper and our modern torrent of electronic data was unimaginable, is one of the strongest in the country. Washington State agencies cannot deny requests for records because the requester is anonymous or the request is too broad, nor can they deny requests simply in order to protect an individual\u2019s privacy; instead, agencies must redact only the details deemed sensitive under state code \u2014 for example, some addresses, sometimes the face of a minor \u2014 and disclose the rest. Before the court, Perry had argued that a different law, the state\u2019s Privacy Act, which allows departments to withhold recordings until related criminal or civil cases are resolved, should take precedent and the Seattle Police should be allowed to broadly deny Vedder\u2019s requests until the relevant statute of limitations ran out. The court disagreed.As Perry now told Wagers and the officials gathered in the chief\u2019s conference room, Seattle and other departments across the state were operating in a new reality. Only in cases under actual, pending litigation could the police withhold video footage from the people. This presented several problems. The first was logistical and financial: Seattle Police were sitting on more than 1.5 million individual dashcam and surveillance videos, or about 300,000 hours and 350 terabytes total. Before releasing any footage, someone in the department had to review and redact it in accordance with the specific privacy exemptions the state code did have. The process was manual, a painstaking, frame-by-frame ordeal. By one estimate, 169 people would have to work for a year just to fulfill the department\u2019s existing video requests, and the department added 2,000 new video clips daily. Perry feared that the new flood of data, especially but not exclusively video, could bankrupt Seattle if someone requested it all. \u201cIt\u2019s like being on the Titanic,\u201d she later told me, \u201cand you\u2019ve got a teaspoon to bail.\u201dThe second problem was privacy. Dashcam videos were already a concern, but Seattle had also been considering using body cameras. In fact, the Police Department was now preparing a small pilot program involving a dozen officers from a single precinct to test the hardware. Any footage that bodycams gathered, Perry warned, would also be subject to the Public Records Act. The department would have even more video to manage and release, but most worrisome was how fundamentally different, and more intrusive, this video would be. Unlike dashcams, bodycams, which are attached to an officer\u2019s uniform or purpose-built glasses, can go into homes and hotel rooms. Unlike dashcams, their default view during an arrest, or during a simple conversation with a victim or witness or informant, is an intimate close-up. Many people think of body cameras as a tool for police accountability, but the primary subject of their surveillance isn\u2019t the police \u2014 it\u2019s the public.\u201cI believe in open government, I really do,\u201d Perry told me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think people have really wrapped their heads around all the implications.\u201d If the bodycam pilot was deemed a success, and the city expanded the program to the rest of its 850 front-line officers, all of them now walking surveillance cameras, what then?Wagers left the meeting stunned. \u201cI like to think I can walk into a room, take a complex problem and break it down into its component parts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meeting, I walked out thinking: Wow, this is complicated. This is messy.\u201dClemans lived with his parents in a small, suburban house south of Seattle, sleeping in a bedroom decorated with a picture of the Space Shuttle and a free calendar from a local Chinese buffet. His bed was a mattress on the floor, and his electronic devices \u2014 computers, radios, keyboards \u2014 dominated the room. Clemans, who has sandy blond hair and wide blue eyes and walks with the stooped gait of someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer, taught himself to code HTML at age 8. Home-schooled as a teenager to escape bullying, he was editing web pages for a hospital, where a friend from his parents\u2019 church worked, by 14. He taught himself basic JavaScript and CSS, and he learned the programming language Python after he showed up at a mathematics lab at the University of Washington and offered to volunteer in exchange for high-school credit. \u201cI just went there,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m very impulsive, and I don\u2019t like rules.\u201dDay 1 of his record attempt was a fluke. He was in the vicinity of the Space Needle and bored, so he took the elevator to the top. Something about being able to see the whole city at once captivated him. The next day, Clemans bought a $50 season pass. He learned of the previous record \u2014 60 consecutive days \u2014 and vowed to beat it. He came daily by bus and foot, an hourlong commute, often arriving early and staying late into the night.The Space Needle blooms out of the grounds of the 1962 World\u2019s Fair, a site north of downtown that is now known as Seattle Center. It is 605 feet tall. You enter through a plaza choked with Korean tourists and Andean flute musicians and Marine marching bands, then shuffle up a ramp to the east, above the gift shop and not far from a lineup of idling tour buses. Before handing over your ticket, you are asked to pose for a photo, then board one of three external elevators. When the elevator starts its ascent and the city comes into view, the people inside either fall silent or gasp out loud.From the observation deck, you can see mountains in four directions, water in two and, just to the south, a forest of skyscrapers. You also see a tangle of cranes; a city increasingly built by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates is booming. There are parks, markets, hidden gardens, tiny houses, tiny cars. Bulk carriers glide into port. Seaplanes land and take off. Helicopters float by. The lights of the radio towers on adjacent Queen Anne Hill, a seeming stone\u2019s throw away, blink on and off. Inside, a giant digital wall displays a shifting collage of visitor selfies, along with tourists\u2019 names and cities of origins. A joystick controls a high-definition camera mounted somewhere on the tower, allowing anyone to pan and zoom in on the unsuspecting people below, like a drone operator.The Space Needle became Clemans\u2019s office and his sanctuary. He brought his laptop, stuffing it into his backpack along with a toothbrush and toothpaste and self-help and business books, and got online with a wireless card. He exercised by walking laps around the outer deck. He offered to take tourists\u2019 photos, posed with them and answered their questions. He wrote code and blog entries. He stared at the city. It made sense from up there. It had patterns. Even its famously chaotic traffic had a predictable ebb and flow.\u201cThe sun is shining!\u201d reads one blog entry. \u201cI can see Rainier. People are happy. It doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d When he claimed the record on Day 61, he appeared on the evening news. He said he would keep going for a full year, then announced on his blog that he would go for even longer \u2014 1,825 days in a row. He began wearing a black jacket emblazoned with the words \u201cRecord Holder\u201d in block letters and spending more of his time talking to tourists, meeting people from all over the world. \u201cIt was an enjoyable eight-hour visit,\u201d he wrote in another entry. \u201cI finished reading \u2018Personal MBA\u2019 and memorized the five parts of a business and the 12 ways to create value.\u201dSome days he wrote about his attempts to stick to a routine. Others he dreamed up fanciful lists. \u201cWhen I own the Space Needle in 2034,\u201d he wrote on Day 107, \u201cI will do the following twenty things.\u201d One: \u201cI will sell tickets for $200 to the very top ... for $600 you can also hang off the side.\u201d Two: \u201cEach day the Space Needle will fly a flag. Most days the flag will be the photo of a random lucky guest.\u201d Four: \u201cFor $500 you and your spouse can sleep in an elevator.\u201d Sixteen: \u201cI will pay French Spider Man Alain Robert $10 million to climb a leg of the Space Needle once every day for a year.\u201d Eighteen: \u201cI will give the security bag checkers X-ray vision glasses.\u201d Nineteen: \u201cI will personally lead a walking tour for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.\u201d\u201cThis post is for me,\u201d reads the next day\u2019s entry. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to meet my goals like reading and writing computer code four hours a day. However, I\u2019m really good at meeting this one particular goal, going to the Space Needle every day. I\u2019ve been able to do so for 108 days straight for one simple reason: Going to the Space Needle everyday is more important than anything else. I have to do it. So when I\u2019m trying to achieve a goal, I just have to remember it\u2019s more important than anything else.\u201dAfter almost 160 days, Clemans had an altercation with a Space Needle employee. Before he could get on the elevator, she asked him to pose for a photo in the booth at the top of the ramp, just like the tourists. He had been asked to do it a hundred times. It was senseless, and it enraged him. \u201cI blew up at her,\u201d he says. Just like that, the world-record holder was banned from the Space Needle for life.Adrift, he disappeared from public view. He worked on code, dabbled in robotics and considered a career as a paramedic. He was pulled over for reckless driving and hired a lawyer known for his successful dashcam requests and, he claims, the video didn\u2019t entirely match the police report, so the court reduced the charges. He met a woman on OKCupid, getting her attention by suggesting that they go build sand castles together.One day in September 2014, Clemans was with his girlfriend when he read on his laptop that KOMO had prevailed over Seattle in the state\u2019s Supreme Court in June: Police video had to be released on demand. The Justice Department had just started its investigation of Ferguson, but Clemans\u2019s concerns were closer to home. KOMO posted only snippets. \u201cI was just mad that they were getting all this video but not making it all available,\u201d he recalls. He turned to his girlfriend and told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do police data as a hobby.\u201dSome police departments started sending videos immediately, some proposed installment plans and some announced they were delaying their bodycam programs. In Poulsbo, a town of 9,500 people across the Puget Sound from Seattle, the mayor desperately emailed her local state legislator and asked him to do something about the cameras and the Public Records Act.Unlike its smaller counterparts, the Seattle department did not give its unknown nemesis any footage. Clemans responded by programming a bot. It scraped the department\u2019s website for new case numbers, then automatically requested the corresponding police reports, firing off emails 10 times a day. The more the authorities denied him, the more his appetite grew. He asked the University of Washington for all its records dating back to \u201cthe formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.\u201d He filed requests with another 60 state agencies, demanding every email they had ever sent \u2014 600 million messages in all, according to a state estimate. The Department of Agriculture informed Clemans it would need 132 years to complete the job.Wagers decided to try a different approach. At Rutgers, he had been schooled in the reformist ideals of community policing. Like the longtime New York City police commissioner William J. Bratton \u2014 whose work when he led the Los Angeles Police Department was the subject of Wagers\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation and who, as it happened, was Chief O\u2019Toole\u2019s boss when he led the Massachusetts Metropolitan District Commission Police \u2014 Wagers liked to quote Sir Robert Peel, the founder of London\u2019s bobbies, who in the early 19th century established an Anglo-Saxon tradition of policing distinct from the militaristic us-versus-them Continental model. Peel taught that good policing was about building and holding public trust. \u201cIt\u2019s about engagement,\u201d Wagers told me. \u201cWe respond. We engage. It sounds kind of trite, but it\u2019s a different way of thinking.\u201d His new plan for dealing with Clemans, he says, \u201cwas like any other response to the community: We engage.\u201dOn Twitter, Wagers followed @PoliceVideo, an account that then belonged to the still-anonymous requester. The next day, the account tweeted at Wagers, asking him why the department was giving PowerPoint presentations to city leaders about the coming bodycam pilot program but not sharing the slides with the public. \u201cScrew it,\u201d @PoliceVideo tweeted when Wagers was too slow to respond. \u201cPutting in the request now. Wish you guys would just publish this stuff.\u201dBut Wagers offered to \u201cdo you one better,\u201d and he tweeted a phone number. \u201cHere\u2019s my cell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI give it out to everyone. Call me & happy to answer questions.\u201d It was 6:57 p.m. One minute later, Wagers\u2019s phone rang. It was Clemans. He still didn\u2019t give his real name \u2014 he had been overwhelmed by media interest in his transparency fight \u2014 but readily accepted when Wagers invited him to lunch.The next day, Clemans met Wagers and Mary Perry at Police Headquarters. They ordered a pizza. Perry tried to explain that it was technically impossible for the department to release all its archived video anytime soon. Clemans countered with an idea he had. He called it \u201coverredaction.\u201d If the system was paralyzed by the need for frame-by-frame redactions, he wondered, why not automatically redact everything? That is, instead of jockeying with requesters, painstakingly reviewing each video, blurring out the protected parts and burning the results onto DVD after DVD, the department could just use software to lightly blur everything, then proactively publish each blurred video online. Push, not pull. Viewers would be able to make out enough to know if footage merited a specific records request and a more precise manual redaction, and they would presumably ask for only the segments they thought they needed; and no longer would the department be buried under its own video. He agreed to drop his mass requests if the department would try it out.In fact, Clemans said, he had stayed up all night writing a very rough version of the overredaction code and printed it out. He showed them what he had done.The cameras that Seattle planned to use in its pilot program \u2014 which would be worn on patrol by a dozen officers in its East Precinct, their video uploaded to a server at the end of every shift \u2014 were from two local companies: Vievu, which was founded by a former Seattle SWAT officer, Steve Ward, in 2007, and its main rival, Axon, a division of Taser that is responsible for the reliable spike in the parent company\u2019s stock after major police shootings. Together the two companies dominate a market that analysts believe will soon be worth a billion dollars a year, with much of the value coming from software and storage. Both Vievu and Axon offered bundles that paired their cameras with editing programs that ran in the cloud, processing them on computers maintained by Amazon Web Services or Microsoft\u2019s Azure, which are also Seattle-area companies.But neither bundle came cheap. The millions of dollars that major police departments were beginning to spend on bodycam contracts were millions they weren\u2019t spending on better training or new officers, and neither company had come close to perfecting automated redaction, without which Seattle Police would simply be collecting more footage without any better way to share it with requesters. Seattle needed an end-to-end software fix, Wagers realized, and Seattle was also a city full of programmers. So the day before the pilot program started, he also tried another experiment: With help from Clemans, he held the department\u2019s first-ever hackathon.The overflow crowd of 80 people was \u201cstraight out of central casting,\u201d Wagers says. \u201cSkinny jeans. Hoodies. People who had sued the department. People I know I\u2019d seen on the protest line the previous week.\u201d Clemans demonstrated his overredaction program: the world as if filmed through a beer glass, fuzzy but familiar, in which it was still possible (too possible, some worried) to tell who was tall and who was short and who was male and who was female and who was black and who was white and who was running and who was chasing. It was well received, and several programmers in the room offered to help Clemans improve the algorithm. But Clemans, volunteering his time and his skills, would be the linchpin. The pilot would run for six months, and if it went well, 12 officers would soon become 850.The next day, on Dec. 20, as TV stations aired reports on the department\u2019s innovative approach to transparency, the bodycam pilot began. Clemans and the department soon developed a rhythm: Some of the videos coming in from the East Precinct were saved to U.S.B. sticks, and Clemans, unpaid and on food stamps at the time, came downtown by bus to pick them up. He processed them on his bedroom computer, tweaking the overredaction program as he went, trying to code in the right balance of concealment and transparency.I watched more than a dozen hours of the video. There were no shootings. Most of it was routine police work, which may be why it was so disturbing to see online. In one set of videos that Clemans posted, a well-dressed white mother of two is pulled over late on a Friday night. She is composed until she fails a sobriety test. Then she pleads for a chance to call the babysitter \u2014 according to Facebook, where I found her because the video also revealed her name, she has a young daughter and younger son \u2014 before breaking down in loud screams and sobs in the back of a patrol car.Elsewhere in the state, also on YouTube, a body camera captures the inside of a woman\u2019s home as she explains how her accused stalker has been ignoring a restraining order. A father pleads with two officers to check in on his adult daughter, who he says has intellectual disabilities and has become involved with a man he believes is dangerous. Two college roommates accuse each other of theft and intimidation in their living room. A white woman apparently overdosing on meth, who cries out that she\u2019s pregnant, is restrained and given medical attention. A middle-aged black man opens his apartment door for a group of officers who inform him that he has been screaming all night. Slurring his words, he admits he\u2019s suffering from PTSD and that he has a history of heroin use. He refuses to let them take him to the hospital. He refuses even when an officer reminds him that he has been screaming like this off and on for a month. But now you can hear the fear in his voice. \u201cAm I screaming right now?\u201d he wonders.One of the first bodycam videos that Clemans uploaded shows a young black woman sitting on a bed in a hotel room. The officer wearing the camera is a disembodied voice but for a fleeting glimpse of his face and torso in a mirror. His manner is professional and sympathetic, and he says he doesn\u2019t want to arrest her. \u201cWill I be charged?\u201d she asks. \u201cLet\u2019s get to that later,\u201d he says. He asks her if she would be willing to talk to a counselor. \u201cSo you can get some other kind of job so you don\u2019t have to do this anymore, O.K.?\u201d he says. \u201cOur ultimate goal is that there is no prostitution, O.K.?\u201dHe begins filling out a form \u2014 Escort Face Sheet \u2014 on a clipboard. She answers every question, sharing the intimate details of her life. She tells him about her relationship with her boyfriend, her clashes with her strict father, her time as a runaway, her drift from strip clubs to Backpage.com escort ads, her few regular johns. She claims she\u2019s new to this work. She explains that she charges per hour or half-hour. She has a dog, she says. She can rely on her parents in times of need, she says. She gives him their street address. She gives him her full name. She shares her private email address and phone number. She shares all this with the camera too.When the interview is done, she asks about it. Is the image clear? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear, yeah,\u201d the officer says, but \u201cif the press wanted it, we can redact faces \u2014 can blur out the faces and whatnot.\u201d Body cameras are new to his city, and he doesn\u2019t know that what he just told her isn\u2019t entirely true. A lawyer will decide that the video is in no part exempt from the Public Records Act, and the officer will later be shocked to see it on YouTube. He will try and fail to have it taken down. The woman in the video is easy to find in her other internet life. She\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, where she chats with friends and posts images of dresses and animals and nail polish. You can visit her parents\u2019 house on Google Street View.Body cameras can be knocked loose when the police rush a suspect, as the world learned in July when Alton Sterling was killed in Baton Rouge, La. Officers can likewise forget or claim to forget to turn the cameras on in time to record an incident in full, as protesters saw after they forced the police to release the inconclusive, partial bodycam footage of Keith Lamont Scott\u2019s shooting in Charlotte, N.C. But for slow-moving scenes like this one, in the hotel room with the young woman who seems to trust the officer with her privacy, the technology works almost too well. Bryce Newell, an information-science researcher now at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who did his fieldwork in Washington, interviewing Clemans and Wagers and riding along with officers as they tested their new bodycams, gave a clever name to the problem they posed in a society demanding transparency: \u201ccollateral visibility.\u201dOne of the first people revealed to the public by Clemans\u2019s transparency quest was Clemans himself. His mass records requests had drawn the interest of local reporters, who started filing requests of their own to the Police Department, seeking his identity. After they got his phone number, Clemans pre-emptively outed himself, embracing the role of tech seer. He published a letter in January 2015 explaining his mission on the website of the Seattle Privacy Coalition. \u201cI pushed the envelope,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso we as a society can once and for all address accurately recording of the truth, who should have access to the truth and what we are to do with the truth.\u201d He told the local news site Crosscut that the Public Records Act did need to be amended. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change until it becomes a massive problem,\u201d he said. He told Seattle Weekly that his experience with police videos had convinced him that certain things shouldn\u2019t be made public. He left the footage on YouTube precisely to make that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to deal with this until they have an emotional reaction,\u201d he said.Wagers stood before the crowd, about a hundred people in all, and gave a brief technical overview of the pilot program. Then an officer from East Precinct demonstrated how the bodycam worked, briefly filming the crowd as he did so. After that, one commissioner, David Keenan, a local lawyer, asked a group of waiting panelists to state, one after the other, when, exactly, the cameras should be on, and to answer a simple question about the evidence they create: Why do we want it? That is, whom does it serve? \u201cShould it only be used if there\u2019s an accusation against a police officer?\u201d he asked. \u201cShould it be used by criminal investigators and by defendants and by prosecutors?\u201dThe growing national welter of contradictory state laws and department policies signals that there is no settled answer. Some allow officers to view it before writing their reports. (That was the central issue earlier this month in Portland, Ore., that caused protesters to storm its City Hall, where police officers met them with bursts of pepper spray.) Some do not. Some treat all bodycam videos as public records; some limit their release. Some mandate a quick deletion of police video; some have no requirements to delete it at all. Some restrict the use of facial recognition software; most allow it. A technology meant for one purpose, once unleashed, is soon used for many others.One commissioner, Jay Hollingsworth of the Mohegan tribe, the chairman of the John T. Williams Organizing Committee, named for a hard-of-hearing Native American whose 2010 shooting was partly captured on dashcam, answered Keenan\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d question simply: Bodycams should always be on. To his right, another commissioner, Jennifer Shaw, the deputy director of the A.C.L.U. of Washington, said that she agreed in theory but that her organization supported the cameras only if they were used exclusively for police accountability. Next, Ron Smith, a detective who then headed the Seattle Police Officers\u2019 Guild, said that he was also in favor of bodycams because he believed they would exonerate officers from complaints. But the cameras went into homes and on lunch and bathroom breaks, and officers absolutely had to be able to switch them on and off.At the end of the table were two activists, Marissa Johnson and Dan Bash. Johnson later became nationally known for leaping onstage at a Bernie Sanders rally, claiming the candidate\u2019s microphone and telling him he needed to do more to acknowledge the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThis conversation about bodycams is a complete and utter farce,\u201d she said. Forget the policy details. She did not consent to being recorded at all. She did not trust the police to do the right thing with the footage. Most of all, she did not trust prosecutors to use it to prosecute officers. \u201cWhy do I need a home video of my abuse that\u2019s going to be filmed by my oppressor?\u201d she asked.An uncomfortable silence filled the room. Then Hollingsworth announced that the other panelists had made him change his mind, leaving the two employees of the Police Department, Wagers and Smith, two white men, the only people onstage who clearly supported bodycams. The mood became tense, and members of the crowd interrupted the next speaker and soon assumed control of the room, taking turns denouncing police brutality and glaring at Smith, who was eventually escorted to his car by another officer.Three weeks later, the commission, the voice of the people, called for Seattle to delay full deployment of bodycams until the state law could be rewritten. \u201cThis is a new technology,\u201d the commission said in a news release, \u201cwhich may have unintended consequences.\u201dIn an essay published shortly after the White House announced its $75 million in bodycam funding in 2014, two authors of the study, Barak Ariel and Alex Sutherland, hypothesized that it was not cameras alone that drove the positive results; it was the fact that before every interaction with a citizen, officers in the trial were required to announce that they were recording. There may have been a \u201cself-awareness effect\u201d: Both parties were reminded at the moment of contact that they were under surveillance and that they should behave accordingly. One question was whether the effect would hold up if officers did not announce the cameras\u2019 presence. Another was whether it would hold up when the cameras lost their novelty.Ariel and Sutherland also worried about anyone basing decisions on a single study, which, no matter how rigorous, could well be a fluke, \u201cthe statistical equivalent of \u2018luck,\u2019\u2009\u201d they wrote. The Rialto sample was small. The notable drop in citizen complaints, for instance, was from 28 in the yearlong period before the study to 3 while it was underway. At least 40 reasonably scientific studies have followed Rialto, but many, according to a recent survey carried out by George Mason University, have yet to be published.Rialto suggests a drop in the use of force. A study from Arizona suggests a drop in arrests but a rise in citations. A separate Arizona study, along with one from London, suggests a rise in arrests. When Temple University researchers recently sifted through a Washington Post database of 986 deadly shootings of civilians by police in 2015, they found that when officers wore body cameras, civilians were 3.64 percent more likely to die. The increase was more pronounced, 3.75 percent, in the deaths of African-Americans and Hispanics and a barely measurable 0.67 percent in the deaths of Caucasians and Asians. They hypothesized that a different kind of self-awareness was at work: Officers, aware of their bodycams and more certain their use of deadly force would be seen as justified, were less likely to hesitate.After Rialto, Ariel and Sutherland set out to replicate their influential study on a much larger scale, collaborating with eight large and small police departments covering two million citizens in the United States and Britain. Their resulting analysis of 2.2 million officer hours, published this May, seems to validate their concerns that Rialto offered an incomplete picture. It found that police use of force actually went up by an astonishing 71 percent when officers could turn their cameras on and off at will and went down (by 37 percent) only when they recorded nearly every interaction with the public from start to finish. A second analysis of the same data, published late last month, supports Rialto\u2019s finding that citizen complaints drop significantly, almost to zero, when bodycams are present, while underscoring the authors\u2019 warning that more research is needed to understand how and why and under what conditions. \u201cIt may be that in some places it\u2019s a bad idea to use body-worn cameras,\u201d Ariel said in announcing the May results, \u201cand the only way you can find that out is to keep doing these tests in different kinds of places.\u201dThe videos didn\u2019t shake the local opposition to bodycams, and they didn\u2019t meet the standards of the state Public Records Act \u2014 if asked, Seattle would have to provide more precisely redacted versions \u2014 but they met a national need for positive news about the police. The YouTube channel was featured on the \u201cToday Show,\u201d and the department\u2019s innovation was the subject of coverage, some skeptical and some not, by The Guardian, Vice News, \u201cMarketplace,\u201d \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and The New York Times. The tech press couldn\u2019t get enough. One well-reported article in the online publication Backchannel called Clemans \u201cthe body-cam hacker who schooled the police.\u201dWagers began receiving calls and email from departments around the country. The future of policing, he saw, was now more than ever reliant on what technology the police could afford to buy from companies like those that built modern Seattle. He pledged that Clemans\u2019s code, once completed, would be open-source and freely shared so that smaller agencies, which didn\u2019t have the staff to handle video-records requests, let alone the money for bundled bodycam contracts, could stay on the cutting edge. In one overredaction test, the department processed 2,400 videos in three hours on rented Amazon Web Services computers in the cloud, a task that would have gummed up the public-disclosure unit of the Seattle Police for weeks had the files been redacted manually. The computer rental cost the department $1.20 \u2014 40 cents an hour \u2014 Wagers marveled. To meet the demands of the Public Records Act, all Clemans needed to do was get his algorithm to redact only faces and other private details, rather than the full frame.Clemans was now an employee: The department had offered him a six-month contract at $22.60 an hour. But when the pilot program ended in July, and the question of whether to expand it loomed, he still had not perfected his code. He was trying to solve a problem, mostly by himself, that teams of professional engineers at Taser and its rivals have yet to fully crack. Distracted, he noticed other inefficiencies at Police Headquarters and he felt increasingly compelled to fix them. After visiting the understaffed 911 center, then in the news for its slow response times, he came up with a new idea: a program that automatically highlighted the most pressing calls, allowing dispatchers to be more efficient. But the captain in charge of the 911 center didn\u2019t welcome his intrusion, and he belittled the idea at a tense late-August meeting brokered by their superiors. Clemans, by his own admission, \u201cgot really mad.\u201d He swore at the captain. He yelled until he had to be escorted from the building. And just like that, in an echo of his Space Needle blowup, he was exiled from headquarters. He made a threat on his way out: \u201cI\u2019m going to P.D.R.\u201d \u2014 public-disclosure request \u2014 \u201cthe [expletive] out of you,\u201d he shouted.In September 2015, when Seattle won a $600,000 Justice Department grant to expand the bodycam program to the rest of the police force, which the mayor pledged to more than match, Clemans wasn\u2019t there to help celebrate. He was working remotely, back in his bedroom or hunched over a laptop at the Starbucks he now frequented on the 40th floor of Columbia Center, the tallest building in town, where the views were stunning and free.Days after the grant announcement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch came to Seattle to declare it a national model for police reform. The federal monitor overseeing the consent decree, who had previously lauded the overredaction experiment when calling for rapid deployment of bodycams, now praised the department\u2019s systematic approach to investigating any use of force \u2014 a significant change from the cursory reporting of the past. Wagers, meanwhile, was helping Chief O\u2019Toole to select his replacement. He had by then been in Seattle and away from his wife and children for more than a year.On Oct. 29, 2015, a week after Wagers announced he was leaving the department, Clemans texted in his own resignation. He no longer believed the department could ever truly be transparent on its own, he told me. His time inside the department, far from co-opting him, had weaponized him after his blowup with the 911 captain: He knew even better which records to request. He wrote a new bot capable of sending the department up to 10,000 requests in 24 hours. He asked for 911 records, \u201ctables & columns of all databases,\u201d all front-facing dashcam video from 2014 and \u201call computer codes written by Tim Clemans.\u201d Over the next few days, he piled on, requesting \u201call roll-call notes,\u201d text records from the department\u2019s license-plate scanners, the source codes of key department software and \u201call Outlook calendars of supervisors, managers & command staff.\u201d He also started building a website where he would publish it all, which he called the People\u2019s NSA. He expanded his demands to include every public record in every format \u2014 paper, tape or digital \u2014 the City of Seattle had. He soon asked 39 neighboring cities for the same. By the end of 2015, according to a study on public-records requests he obtained via a public-records request, Clemans had filed 2,272 requests to the Seattle Police Department alone, making him again its No. 1 antagonist. One day at her office, Mary Perry showed me a printout of the latest ones, five pages long. \u201cWe\u2019re being crippled,\u201d she said. Wagers was on his way home, Clemans was making more demands than ever and she was back where she started.Searching for blurred video of a crime down your block may someday be as easy as searching for a restaurant on Google Maps. But a new state law making footage harder to request in bulk \u2014 the Tim Clemans Act, his friends called it \u2014 had just gone into effect thanks to the efforts of Poulsbo, the small town that had contacted its state representative. Clemans had also been studying YouTube\u2019s privacy policy, and he would soon decide to remove the videos he posted there from public view. For now, though, he wore his own D.I.Y. bodycam, a cellphone strapped to a chest harness, and was streaming live to the internet as he followed the protesters and the police on a borrowed bicycle.The protesters gathered outside the department\u2019s East Precinct. An old man, homeless, busking below a mural, quickly collected his things before any violence could break out. But none did. According to the judge who would preside over the latest consent-decree hearing a few weeks later, notably saying the words \u201cblack lives matter\u201d from the bench, the department was making steady strides toward an exit from federal oversight: Its de-escalation tactics were a national model, he said, and its use of force was substantially down.

No loitering is allowed in the polling place and the sheriff also checks outside the polling place for any irregularities.Simply put, if Donald Trump thinks this system is vulnerable to fraud, he\u2019s stupider than he has shown thus far in his rapidly dying campaign.This comment received more than 1,900 reader recommendations and more than 20 reader responses.The foundation of a national election is the individual vote. If that is not controlled and protected, then everything that comes after it can be/will be suspect.The simplest solution is voter identification. I know all of the stories that are out there saying voter identification is biased against minorities. I wholeheartedly disagree with that premise.But if voter ID is not acceptable, then every voter should have to place their thumb in an inkwell of purple ink after they vote to prevent duplicate voting. This wouldn\u2019t prevent dead people from voting, but it\u2019s simple, very accurate, and unbiased.This comment received more than 70 reader responses.But what about the sizable portion of the population that supported him?I hope Hillary Clinton will be committed to their needs and, in that way, heal the painful divide in our country.This comment received more than 2,400 reader recommendations.Remember the outrage when he showed how he identified with Henry Louis Gates when the professor was arrested in his own home in Cambridge, and then later when he said that if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon Martin? His opponents went crazy.Hillary is under the same kind of pressure: she needs to show that she is concerned about and will champion women and children, but also be the president for everyone. The kind of personal vulnerability you\u2019re hoping she could show would be nothing less than political suicide.While waiting for the results, premature contractions led to a cerclage [ring] to hold this precious pregnancy inside and bedrest for weeks, only to be given the devastating news that the baby whose kicking and rolling was the most astonishing and wonderful experience of my life would suffer excruciating pain upon delivery with absolutely no hope of survival beyond a day or two.Our decision was clear.You see, Meredith, I have walked in your shoes and know without a doubt that the government has absolutely no right to interfere in this most personal and profound decision, and that anyone who thinks that a woman climbs onto that surgical table with a light heart is an idiot.So in my world it\u2019s pretty simple: politicians are vetted first on their abortion position, and then we can talk.This comment received more than 200 reader recommendations.I am not religious \u2014 it simply sickens me that children are terminated before there is certainty if they will survive or not. I cannot change the law, I cannot convince anyone pro-choice not to get an abortion, all I can do is plead that if you are considering late-term abortion do so only under the most dire circumstances.Do not get an abortion just because a child would be an inconvenience to you or your family. This is a situation where I do not agree with the mother\u2019s decision, but I do understand why it was made. I am now fully functioning and healthy; I just hope that the mothers considering late-term abortions realize who, not what, is inside them.This comment received more than 300 likes.People ask for a Mr. Fix-It, a dictator, when their voices are not heard, when executive action is the rule and elected officials in Congress are marginalized and sabotaged by executive action on immigration and racial animosity fostered for political gains.This comment received more than 40 reader responses.You win as a team and you lose as a team. You don\u2019t rub it in your opponent\u2019s face when you win. You are humble in victory. You do your job and you get on with your life.

{"Headline": "Strangers on a Strange Election", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 U.S. presidential campaign as experienced by four writers originally from somewhere else.The first thing I noticed about Americans when I moved to the United States eight years ago was the passion they bring to politics. People I\u2019d meet would both worship and hate their politicians, as though they were celebrity athletes. At the same time, as the clich\u00e9 goes, Americans want their representatives to be people they\u2019d like to have a beer with. In Finland, where I come from, most voters like their representatives to be people they\u2019d never want to have a beer with, mainly because of the risk of slow death by boredom. The more dull and engineer-like the politician, the better. That could be the Finnish motto. Don\u2019t kiss my baby. Go fix my health care.From my Nordic point of view, however, what is most surprising about American politics is that the issue that elicits more passion than just about any other, except perhaps sex, is a rather unsexy one: taxes.In the United States it is almost a patriotic duty for citizens to despise taxes with a vengeance. This presents American voters right now with a problem: what to make of a flamboyantly wealthy presidential candidate who may have escaped paying federal income taxes for nearly two decades? Is he a hero or a villain?A good number of Americans seem furious at this injustice. But a good number also seem to applaud Donald J. Trump\u2019s prowess at tax avoidance, proof that he is a true red-blooded American. There is another peculiarly American twist, too: the excitement over actually trying to find out what Mr. Trump paid or didn\u2019t pay in taxes in the first place.Is this an invasion of privacy? Some Finns certainly think so. But most think it is a way to secure the fundamental social contract that underlies all Western democracies and that helps prevent us from becoming corrupt banana republics: Everyone contributes. Not just that, but everyone contributes fairly, which means in proportion to ability and according to the same rules. If the actual amounts that the wealthy pay can\u2019t be known, no trust in fairness can be had.With instant access to tax data, Finns can go to town celebrating the successful rich who pay. In 2013, the heroes of the day were the founders of the phenomenally successful Finnish mobile game company Supercell, maker of Clash of Clans and Hay Day. Supercell\u2019s founders earned more taxable income that year in Finland than anyone else. The chief executive of the company, Ilkka Paananen, pulled in $231 million in wages and capital gains. He paid out $74 million in taxes \u2014 32 percent. He also made a public statement. He was happy, he said, to be able to pay back to the society that had made his success possible.It\u2019s the turn of my American friends to be bewildered when they hear all this. Why are Finns so willing to pay taxes, they ask. I always have the same answer: It\u2019s not what you pay, it\u2019s what you get in return. Finns get real value for their taxes: about a year of paid parental leave, affordable high-quality day care, top-notch K-12 education, free college, universal health care and last but not least, a reasonably simple and fair tax code, a smoothly working tax agency and easy-to-use online services and tax forms. It\u2019s amazing what taxes can buy you if your country puts its mind to it \u2014 and when the wealthy pay their share.This year will be the first time I\u2019m eligible to vote in the American presidential election, since I\u2019m now an American citizen. I will do my best to fill inside the lines of that little oval on the voting sheet, even though everyone else in this election seems to be coloring outside all the lines I\u2019ve ever known.Anu Partanen is the author of \u201cThe Nordic Theory of Everything: In Search of a Better Life.\u201dCHAMPAIGN, Ill. \u2014 \u201cDad,\u201d my daughter said to me a few weeks ago, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my biology teacher thinks I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Why?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. At the beginning of the year when he asked me where I was from, I said Jerusalem. He must have assumed I was Jewish, because once he asked if my being vegetarian has to do with keeping kosher, and this month he wished me happy Rosh Hashana.\u201d\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t correct him? You have to!\u201d\u201cBut why? I didn\u2019t say anything wrong, why should I start apologizing? Anyway, it\u2019s too complicated to try and explain about Palestinian Israelis.\u201dSince my daughter adamantly refused to correct her teacher\u2019s mistake, I decided \u2014 over her protestations and threats to boycott homework \u2014 that I would go see him and explain that we\u2019re Muslim citizens of Israel.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d my wife asked, before I left for the meeting. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you wait until after the elections?\u201dOn the way to school, I looked out for election signs on the immaculately mowed lawns. Based on what I saw, I predict that Re/Max is going to win. Apart from one giant sign made of wooden planks nailed together to form the letters T-R-U-M-P, I saw no evidence of the impending elections.\u201cIt\u2019s unusual,\u201d a friend from the university who has lived here for decades told me. \u201cUsually, at this stage of the campaign, there are signs and bumper stickers everywhere, and people voice support for their candidate.\u201dThe town is considered conservative and has a Republican majority. This time, perhaps because of the sensitive situation, most residents prefer not to publicly proclaim support for their nominee. After all, there is a large community of foreigners and immigrants in this college town, and supporting a candidate who openly condemns that community could be considered antagonistic. Clinton supporters, conversely, might be hesitant to put up signs for fear of provoking anger in the opposing camp.There is cause for concern among the foreign population, and when it comes to Muslims, like us, there is genuine dread about what might be in store. The fear is so intense that I\u2019m no longer sure which result we should be hoping for.Would a Trump victory actually placate his more extreme supporters? Would his loss be a signal to racists to take action against those he accuses of having stolen their country? Or should we prefer a Democratic administration, which would safeguard diversity and the basic values of the Constitution?The destructive force embodied in incitement against foreigners and minorities is a frightening thing. Perhaps my daughter is right and we should be hiding our identity until we see how things turn out. We do, after all, have Israeli passports that we can brandish if things get bad.\u201cOh, come on,\u201d I found myself saying to assuage my fears while driving to school: Am I really going to claim I\u2019m Jewish because a presidential candidate marks me as an enemy? It\u2019s absurd to think that Jewishness, which has endured the harshest suffering because of xenophobia, could protect us from that very same sentiment.How cruel these elections are, bringing such deep-seated fears to the surface, leading me to be suspicious of my neighbors, of my children\u2019s teachers, of patrons at the local bar, people I laugh with and watch baseball games with (although I never understand the rules). It made me feel sad and guilty to realize that I had begun to question the integrity of the people I live among. I hated myself for accepting the rules of the game dictated by politicians \u2014 rules that set up racial divisions and turn innocent people into potential enemies.I live in a wonderful place, I reminded myself on my way to the staff room.\u201cShalom!\u201d the biology teacher exclaimed with a grin \u2014 yet more evidence of the locals\u2019 kindheartedness.\u201cShalom,\u201d I answered. And then we had a pleasant conversation about my daughter\u2019s academic accomplishments and acclimatizing.Even so, just to be on the safe side, I didn\u2019t say a word about us being Muslims. When we said goodbye, I shook his hand and wished him \u201cShabbat Shalom,\u201d even though it was a Monday.Sayed Kashua is a visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the author, most recently, of \u201cNative: Dispatches From an Israeli-Palestinian Life.\u201d This essay was translated by Jessica Cohen from the Hebrew.LINCOLN, Neb. \u2014 As my country, Nigeria, unravels \u2014 thanks to what only die-hard optimists and the news media euphemistically refer to as a \u201crecession\u201d \u2014 I find myself living in America, witnessing what might be the most vicious election in the country\u2019s history.I began following American politics closely in 2008, when Barack Obama, considered at the time by most Nigerians as our African brother, became president. As a strong proponent of restoring black people\u2019s dignity by action not just grievance, I was moved to tears by that milestone. Then came the 2012 elections just two months after I arrived in the United States, and Mr. Obama won me over again when he stood against Mitt Romney.Now that four years have passed, and I have studied, lived and worked in the United States, my views about the nation\u2019s politics have changed. I now believe America\u2019s greatest problem today is its political polarization.In Nigeria, and across most of black Africa, what divides us is mostly tribalism and religion. We are not, as yet, divided by ideology. But here, the left-right ideological divide is tearing the country apart. Ideology can generate the same amount of hatred as religion and tribalism, and as is the case with places where the other two dominate, it is dangerous when a group acquires any appearance of absolute power. As American culture lurches toward the liberal left, I fear that it may be seeking such power.The left has developed a potent strategy against which the right simply cannot contend: characterizing those who do not embrace liberal values as morally bankrupt, using labels like \u201cbigot,\u201d among the worst of insults to Americans. I have observed that the default dynamic of public interaction here is for people to try to parse the group\u2019s consensus, and for everyone \u2014 every single person \u2014 to navigate toward that. Most people will not say what they truly feel. This is what has confounded me most about America in the time I have been here: The fear of being labeled with a disparaging term \u2014 often simply for articulating a perspective that does not align with liberal political values \u2014 causes many to remain silent. Freedom of speech is being severely curtailed throughout the country.I am even more troubled because I can trace the unraveling of my country to a similar type of authoritarianism. In the past, the West designated Africans as \u201cbarbaric,\u201d \u201cuncivilized\u201d and \u201ccrude,\u201d among other terms. It did not matter, for example, that the Igbo tribe in West Africa practiced a leaderless egalitarian system while Britain was governed by monarchs; the labels stuck nevertheless, and they helped lead to the slave trade and colonialism, among other negative practices that African people are still recovering from today.Here in Nebraska, I have talked with quite a number of people who will vote for Donald J. Trump because they see him resisting the rising authoritarianism of the far left. Many people who support Mr. Trump have principled arguments for making this decision, but many on the left often simply label Trump supporters as evil or bigots \u2014 without even trying to understand their perspectives \u2014 in that way further alienating them, and deepening the divide.So bad has this state of affairs become that President Obama has urged students on college campuses to be open to those who may not share their views and to maintain a culture of civil engagement. Western democracy is sustainable only when a balance is preserved between two polar opposites. Americans should vote for the candidate who might best strike this balance.Chigozie Obioma is a professor of literature and creative writing at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the author of the novel \u201cThe Fishermen.\u201dOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 I moved from China to the United States in 1996, arriving in Iowa when signs for Clinton-Gore and Dole-Kemp dotted people\u2019s lawns. I remember being surprised that Americans would announce their political views without fear.Subsequent elections all remained memorable in one way or another, but one thing has not changed: the narrative about China, that perennial target.I was a scientist before I became a writer. For both professions, questioning is essential, conviction dangerous. Questions beget questions. Convictions beget convictions, posing as indisputable truths.In Chinese social media, Mr. Trump is called manly, earthy, charismatic and honest. He is compared fondly to stinky tofu, a kind of fermented tofu with such an unbearable odor that it can\u2019t be consumed indoors (think of the funkiest French cheese). And enough with the British prime minister, Theresa May, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel: America needs a man.\u201cThe Democratic Party is the enemy of China. Trump is the enemy of the Democratic Party. Ergo, he is our friend,\u201d said a commenter on Zhihu, under the thread \u201cWhy become a Chinese fan of Donald Trump?\u201dAfter a long history of natural and political disasters, states another person on Zhihu under the same thread, China has nothing to rely on but utilitarianism; Mr. Trump, a profit-chasing businessman, shares this utilitarianism. \u201cPerhaps we all see our own selves in Donald Trump. He\u2019s a soul mate for every lonely Chinese heart.\u201dAlso shared on many Chinese forums is this view: \u201cIf Trump is bad, don\u2019t we want him to win so he can lead America downhill more quickly?\u201d Rational, yet most ominous.Yiyun Li\u2019s is the author of the forthcoming \u201cDear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life,\u201d which will be published in February.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Telecoms\u2019 Ambitions on Targeted Ads Seen Curbed by F.C.C.\u2019s New Privacy Rules", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byIn recent years, companies like Verizon and AT&T have made no secret of their ambitions to build online advertising businesses that can take on the behemoths of Silicon Valley.\u201cThe challenge for Verizon and AT&T is that both companies have made big acquisitions that hinge largely on their ability to monetize advertising inventory more effectively, and the way they plan to do that is by targeting it better,\u201d said Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cIf their hands are tied by the new F.C.C. rules, then that\u2019s a very, very big deal.\u201dCurrently, broadband providers can track users unless individuals specifically ask them to stop. The F.C.C. decision, set to take effect in about a year for major providers, has been hotly contested, in part because the rules apply only to internet service providers, or I.S.P.\u2019s. They do not extend to online ad juggernauts like Google and Facebook \u2014 web companies that the F.C.C. does not regulate \u2014 which has spurred complaints of a double standard.Companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T are only a small portion of the targeted-ad industry, but are seen as having great potential because of their broad view of online habits. Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C., has contended, however, that while consumers may choose not to go on Facebook or use Google, they need I.S.P.s to get access to the internet, a view in line with the agency\u2019s classification of broadband providers as utilitylike services.Innovation in the advertising industry is currently centered on understanding consumer behavior across devices to better place, track and measure ads, said David Cohen, president of North America at Magna Global, a major ad-buying firm.\u201cGetting a single view of you or me as I go from PC to tablet to mobile to television \u2014 that\u2019s a real hot area in the marketing space,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThe ones who have the best visibility into that today are the big walled gardens, and that\u2019s primarily Google and Facebook.\u201dVerizon has been trying within the last six months to leverage some nonpersonally identifiable information for improved targeting across AOL\u2019s properties, which include MapQuest, The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, according to Mr. Cohen.\u201cOn paper, what they\u2019re telling the ad community is they will be able to use Verizon data to inform our ability to buy across devices,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cThis will impede that.\u201dStill, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a death knell for the advertising or marketing industry, as we have other ways around to get similar kinds of data.\u201dVerizon said it already sought permission from its broadband customers for certain data, like browsing and location history.\u201cWe believe that the standards the F.C.C. announced on Thursday are consistent with Verizon\u2019s longstanding privacy practices,\u201d said Karen Zacharia, Verizon\u2019s chief privacy officer.Critics of the ruling include broadband provider advocates, advertising trade groups and some web firms. Christopher Yoo, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania who spoke to the F.C.C. about the technical implications of the rules, said in an interview that he told the agency \u201cthe most expansive interpretation would cause the internet to break.\u201d\u201cRight now, it\u2019s limited to the I.S.P.s, but what it will do is open up the issue of whether the rest of the digital universe and mobile universe should remain on the current model,\u201d said Dick O\u2019Brien, executive vice president of government relations at the American Association of Advertising Agencies, a trade group.The move could be challenged in court. Companies can sue to overturn the privacy regulation, though AT&T, Comcast and Verizon said they were still reviewing the details of the rules and did not say whether they would pursue a legal challenge.\u201cAt the end of the day, consumers desire services that shift costs away from them and towards advertisers,\u201d AT&T said in a statement. \u201cAlthough the F.C.C.\u2019s decision inhibits the ability of I.S.P.s (and I.S.P.s alone) to bring those services to consumers, we anticipated the F.C.C.\u2019s decision and continue to expect that targeted advertising will be a growth area for us.\u201dComcast declined to comment.The effect on consumers is not yet clear. Carriers could charge more for blocking data collection, though the F.C.C. said it would monitor \u201cpay for privacy\u201d offers. Mr. O\u2019Brien warned that consumers could be bombarded with annoying \u201copt-in\u201d requests from I.S.P.s. Mr. Yoo said the complexity created within companies, where Yahoo may not be able to share certain information with Verizon, will stifle innovation.The decision has had the unusual effect of casting major telecommunications companies as victims in a world dominated by Silicon Valley firms. AT&T and Verizon, for example, each make more than $100 billion in revenue a year, while Comcast\u2019s annual sales top $70 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opera Fan\u2019s Last Wish Led to Terror Scare at the Met", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byNo one had seemed more excited for the pair of Rossini operas at the Metropolitan Opera on Saturday than Roger Kaiser, a Texas opera buff who, the police believe, inadvertently created a terrorism scare that forced the Met to cut its matinee short and cancel its evening performance.But his Facebook page also describes a more unusual operagoing ritual, which investigators now say led to the events that stopped the show at the Met: dispersing the ashes of a friend, whom he described as an \u201copera mentor,\u201d at opera houses around the country.\u201cIt was just part of our deal that I would leave bits of him in all the houses I visit,\u201d reads a message attributed to Mr. Kaiser in a Facebook post last month about a trip he had taken during the summer to a Colorado opera house. \u201cThe MET is next, late next month.\u201dIt was during the second intermission at Saturday\u2019s matinee of \u201cGuillaume Tell\u201d that a man was spotted sprinkling a white powdery substance into the Met\u2019s orchestra pit, around the timpani and the conductor\u2019s podium, before walking out. Musicians reported it, and, amid fears that the powder could have been a dangerous substance such as anthrax, the remainder of the opera was canceled so the police could investigate. As the investigation continued, the Met\u2019s Saturday night performance, of Rossini\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri,\u201d was canceled as well.Several thousand operagoers, some of whom had traveled great distances, were disappointed, and a city where some people are still jittery after last month\u2019s bombing on West 23d Street was briefly on edge again.Then a new theory of the case emerged. On Saturday night, the police announced that they were investigating whether the powdery substance was in fact human remains being scattered at the Met. John J. Miller, the deputy police commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said at a news conference on Saturday night that the police had identified a man who had spoken about sprinkling ashes there, and that they were trying to contact him. Mr. Miller said that the act may have violated the city\u2019s health code, but that there was no criminal intent.Mr. Miller did not name the man, but law enforcement officials later said it was Mr. Kaiser, who had been found and interviewed Saturday night. Mr. Kaiser did not immediately respond to emails, Facebook messages, a text message or a phone call seeking comment.If the opera that was cut short in the afternoon, \u201cGuillaume Tell,\u201d is a weighty epic, \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri,\u201d the opera canceled in the evening, is lighter fare. The police investigation appeared to follow a similar trajectory, as a potential terrorism inquiry evolved into an exploration of a highly unusual way of expressing devotion to opera.As the Met audience was sent home before the final act of \u201cTell,\u201d the police who had descended on the opera house ultimately did a field test that determined the substance was not dangerous, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.The police also learned from an audience member about a man \u2014 Mr. Kaiser it turned out \u2014 who had mentioned spreading the ashes of a friend at opera houses around the country, the official said. The police determined where Mr. Kaiser had been sitting, got his name and cellphone number through the box office and tracked him down, the official said. After running Mr. Kaiser\u2019s name through a terrorism database and finding no matches, the police interviewed him at a bed-and-breakfast in Manhattan, the official said.There, Mr. Kaiser told them that he had scattered the ashes of a friend who had died several years ago.\u201cThis guy is not a bad guy,\u201d the police official said. \u201cHe\u2019s really just a friend who lost his friend and is following out his wishes.\u201dInvestigators said that Mr. Kaiser told them that he tries to scatter the ashes discreetly so as not to cause alarm. He had walked out of the opera house gone to dinner, and hoped to return for the evening performance, the official said.The police, in consultation with the Met, decided not to charge Mr. Kaiser with a crime.As a precaution, the substance was sent to a lab for further testing to confirm that it was human remains.Peter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, said in an interview that the company \u201cis constantly assessing and reassessing how it handles security.\u201d He said that while the Met was happy to welcome opera lovers, he hopes that they will not bring ashes with them in the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bronx Science Student Arrested After Threat Over \u2018Fight Club\u2019 Article", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byIt was a classic Daily News story.Students at the Bronx High School of Science, an elite New York City public school known for churning out winners of national science prizes, were holding public fights in a park near the school, where crowds would cheer on their peers. Videos of the brawls were shared in a Facebook group with some 1,500 members. One unnamed mother was quoted saying she took her son out of the school over what the article called a \u201cfight club.\u201d Another said that she had told the school\u2019s administration, but that it said it could do nothing because the fights were not on its campus.Bronx Science students were not happy, with either the article or the taunt. After the article ran, one of the reporters, Ben Chapman, received dozens of vulgar and, in some cases, threatening phone calls, voice mail messages and Facebook messages from people who identified themselves as students, he said in a follow-up article. The school\u2019s principal, Jean Donahue, ultimately apologized to Mr. Chapman for the threats, saying they were \u201cnot representative of the respectful and inclusive environment we promote.\u201dNow, one of the students who The News said had sent a threatening message to Mr. Chapman is facing possible criminal charges.The student, Wataru Takada, 16, was arrested on Wednesday evening at the 81st Precinct station house in Brooklyn on charges of aggravated harassment in the second degree, a misdemeanor, according to the police. He was given a desk appearance ticket and will be required to appear in court on Dec. 9. At that point the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office, which is handling the case, will determine whether to move forward with it, the authorities said.The News posted a picture of a Facebook message that the newspaper said Mr. Takada had sent to Mr. Chapman. \u201cI really liked your article about nerds who fight,\u201d the message read. \u201cI think you should drop by for an interview at Bronx Science. Bring your mouthguard, bulletproof vest and great life insurance.\u201dBy Friday, it appeared that Mr. Takada no longer had a Facebook account.Through an Education Department spokeswoman, Dr. Donahue declined to comment. In an email sent to parents last week, she said that the school took the reports of the organized fights \u201cvery seriously,\u201d had notified the police, and was also conducting its own investigation of the fights \u201cto ensure they are addressed appropriately at the school level.\u201d\u201cYour cooperation is essential, and we ask any student or parent with information about these allegations to contact an administrator or school dean,\u201d the principal wrote.An earlier version of this article misstated the status of Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School and Brooklyn Technical High School. They are among the most selective of New York City\u2019s so-called specialized high schools, not the three most selective.Advertisement"}

Trump on Monday disparaged the latest woman to accuse him of touching her inappropriately, dismissing her as a \u201cporn star\u201d and saying sarcastically, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s never been grabbed before.\u201dThe comment was a response to the accuser, Jessica Drake, who over the weekend accused Mr. Trump of groping and kissing her without her permission in 2006. He also, she said, offered her $10,000 to go to his hotel room.Mr. Trump has called all of the allegations lies and has said that he does not know the women.But in a radio interview on WGIR\u2019s \u201cNew Hampshire Today,\u201d it was clear that Mr. Trump was aware of Ms. Drake.He added, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s never been grabbed before.\u201dThe Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly lashed out at the women who have accused him of misconduct, suggesting in some cases that they were not attractive enough to warrant his attention. He has also suggested that his accusers were seeking fame and working in conjunction with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump vowed to sue those who have come forward.The accusations are part of a \u201crigged\u201d system, he said, that includes a \u201cdishonest\u201d news media and \u201cphony polls\u201d that show him well behind Mrs. Clinton.The Clinton campaign has denied colluding with Mr. Trump\u2019s accusers. Gloria Allred, the lawyer representing several of the women, has said that she expects more to come forward publicly with their stories.Mr. Trump did not mention his accusers during campaign events on Monday in Florida, but he did focus his attention on another enemy: polls.But from his perch onstage in St. Augustine, soaking in the screaming cheers of thousands of fervent supporters, Mr. Trump saw a different reality.\u201cJust in case you haven\u2019t heard, we\u2019re winning, not only Florida, but we\u2019re winning everywhere,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd.He also shared the victorious sentiment at a farmers\u2019 round-table discussion earlier in the day in Boynton Beach, Fla., telling the dozens of attendants that he was leading.Numerous polls show Mr. Trump\u2019s path to victory drawing narrower, and he trails Mrs. Clinton in several swing states. But, in Twitter posts and stump speeches, the national polls have become the latest component of the \u201crigged\u201d system that Mr. Trump has been railing against in the final month of his campaign.In St. Augustine, he blamed the \u201cthieves and crooks\u201d in the news media for reporting on the polling and said the polls themselves were biased, all of it, he said, amounting to voter suppression.\u201cIt\u2019s called voter suppression because people will say, \u2018Oh, gee, Trump\u2019s down,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd, before reminding it, \u201cWell, folks, we\u2019re winning.\u201d\u201cSo the man that was investigating her from the F.B.I., his wife runs for office, and they give her more than $675,000 to run,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mrs. Clinton, as the crowd began to boo. \u201cAnd it just came out. They just figured it out.\u201dIt is evidence the whole system is geared against him, Mr. Trump said, and any polls showing him behind, he told his supporters, are not to be believed.\u201cWhat they do is they show these phony polls where they look at Democrats, and it\u2019s heavily weighted with Democrats, and then they\u2019ll put on a poll where we\u2019re not winning, and everybody says, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re not winning,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said at the round-table event Monday morning.His anti-polling and anti-news media message is quickly catching on with his supporters.\u201cThere\u2019s no way any of those polls are real,\u201d said Bill Stelling, 44, a real estate agent from Jacksonville, Fla. \u201cIf you\u2019ve gone around throughout the country and seen what\u2019s going on, you go through any neighborhood and see how many Trump signs there are and how many Hillary signs there are, and I guarantee you it\u2019s not even going to be close. It\u2019s not even going to be close.\u201dIt is a message that Mr. Trump has been highlighting at his rallies, repeatedly predicting victory and encouraging his supporters to embrace early voting, which began in some Florida counties on Monday.On Monday, he even cited a poll to make his case.\u201cSeventy-five percent of the American people, based on all polls, think our country is headed on the wrong track,\u201d he said, after telling the crowd to go to \u201cCity Hall and the supervisor of elections office\u201d to cast an early ballot in Florida. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to fix it,\u201d he said.Nick Corasaniti reported from St. Augustine, and Alan Rappeport from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Intimacy for the Avoidant", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byOver the past generation there seems to have been a decline in the number of high-quality friendships.In 1985, most Americans told pollsters that they had about three confidants, people with whom they could share everything. Today, the majority of people say they have about two. In 1985, 10 percent of Americans said they had no one to fully confide in, but by the start of this century 25 percent of Americans said that.All of this has left people wondering if technology is making us lonelier. Instead of going over to the neighbor\u2019s house, are we sitting at home depressingly surfing everybody else\u2019s perfect lives on Facebook?Over the past decade, the best research has suggested that no, technology and social media are not making us lonelier. These things are tools. It\u2019s what you bring to Facebook that matters. Socially engaged people use it to further engage; lonely people use it to mask loneliness.But recently, people\u2019s views of social media have grown a bit darker. That\u2019s because we seem to be hitting some sort of saturation level. Being online isn\u2019t just something we do. It has become who we are, transforming the very nature of the self.A decade ago almost no one had a smartphone. Now the average American spends five and half hours a day with digital media, and the young spend far more time. A study of female students at Baylor University found that they spent 10 hours a day on their phones.A lot of this traffic is driven by the fear of missing out. Somebody may be posting something on Snapchat that you\u2019d like to know about, so you\u2019d better constantly be checking. The traffic is also driven by what the industry executives call \u201ccaptology.\u201d The apps generate small habitual behaviors, like swiping right or liking a post, that generate ephemeral dopamine bursts. Any second that you\u2019re feeling bored, lonely or anxious, you feel this deep hunger to open an app and get that burst.\u201cBy rapidly substituting virtual reality for reality,\u201d Sullivan wrote, \u201cwe are diminishing the scope of [intimate] interaction even as we multiply the number of people with whom we interact. We remove or drastically filter all the information we might get by being with another person. We reduce them to some outlines \u2014 a Facebook \u2018friend,\u2019 an Instagram photo, a text message \u2014 in a controlled and sequestered world that exists largely free of the sudden eruptions or encumbrances of actual human interaction. We become each other\u2019s \u2018contacts,\u2019 efficient shadows of ourselves.\u201dAt saturation level, social media reduces the amount of time people spend in uninterrupted solitude, the time when people can excavate and process their internal states. It encourages social multitasking: You\u2019re with the people you\u2019re with, but you\u2019re also monitoring the six billion other people who might be communicating something more interesting from far away. It flattens the range of emotional experiences.Perhaps phone addiction is making it harder to be the sort of person who is good at deep friendship. In lives that are already crowded and stressful, it\u2019s easier to let banter crowd out emotional presence. There are a thousand ways online to divert with a joke or a happy face emoticon. You can have a day of happy touch points without any of the scary revelations, or the boring, awkward or uncontrollable moments that constitute actual intimacy.When Montaigne was describing the accumulating intimacy he enjoyed with his best friend, he described an emotional interaction that was full and progressive: \u201cIt was not one special consideration, nor two, nor three, nor four, nor a thousand; it was some mysterious quintessence of all this mixture which possessed itself of my will and led it to plunge and lose itself in his; which possessed his whole will and led it, with a similar hunger, and a like impulse, to plunge and lose itself in mine.\u201dWhen we\u2019re addicted to online life, every moment is fun and diverting, but the whole thing is profoundly unsatisfying. I guess a modern version of heroism is regaining control of social impulses, saying no to a thousand shallow contacts for the sake of a few daring plunges.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Los Angeles Police Release Video of Fatal Shooting; Say Man Had Gun", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported byAfter two days of protests and speculation surrounding a police shooting that killed an 18-year-old black man this weekend, the Los Angeles Police Department on Tuesday released video surveillance footage Tuesday it said proved that the man, Carnell Snell Jr., had been carrying a handgun.In a statement on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Police Department said that releasing the surveillance video while criminal and administrative investigations were pending went against its practice, but that the move was a matter of public safety.In the 45-second video, Mr. Snell can be seen running into the parking lot of a small strip mall, darting in front of businesses and hiding behind a car. He tucks what appears to be a black handgun into the waistband of his pants before running the length of the strip mall and turning a corner. A police officer can be seen chasing him.The video, which has no sound, does not appear to show the shooting. Information on the races or ethnicities of the officers involved was not immediately available.In a news conference on Monday, Police Chief Charlie Beck said that officers had tried to stop the vehicle in which Mr. Snell was traveling because its license plates were covered by paper. He said this was often a calling card of people who have committed drive-by shootings and have attempted to conceal the ownership of a vehicle.After officers pursued the vehicle, Mr. Snell was one of two black men who ran. He was the only one caught. In the confrontation that followed, Chief Beck said, six shots were fired and Mr. Snell was hit twice, once in the torso and once in the knee. He was pronounced dead at the scene.A loaded semiautomatic handgun was recovered about five feet from where Mr. Snell fell.Mr. Snell was the first of two men to be fatally shot by police officers over the weekend. On Sunday, a Hispanic man was shot after he pointed what appeared to be a handgun at police officers, officials said.Chief Beck appeared to try and divorce the police shootings in Los Angeles from the shootings of unarmed black men, often caught on video, that have roiled the nation. He said that the encounter with Mr. Snell took place in a neighborhood where there had been about 450 shootings so far this year, and that his officers often found themselves in situations in which they had to defend themselves.This is a collection of the viral footage that has prompted a national conversation about race and policing.\u201cWe are doing our absolute best to take guns out of the hands of those that would use them against others,\u201d Chief Beck told reporters. \u201cAnd certainly in both of these instances these officers feared for their lives because of the actions of the individuals that they were pursuing.\u201dHe also addressed the demand for video footage: \u201cVideo is part of the truth, but is not the totality of the truth. It has to be tempered with all of the evidence.\u201dMs. Hobbs added: \u201cWitnesses say that his hands were up when he was shot in the back. He will always be more than what the L.A.P.D. considers as disposable.\u201dIn the case of the second shooting this weekend, Chief Beck said on Monday that the gun held by the man had, in fact, been a replica but that the orange band that is used to differentiate it from real guns had removed or concealed. He said there was police body-camera footage of that shooting.Officer Norma Eisenman, a spokeswoman for the department, said on Tuesday that the dead man had not yet been identified.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Divorce, My Father, My Mistake", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byLivesI told my father about my divorce after midnight on a bus from Chicago to Iowa City. There was no sense postponing it; he was calling from Isfahan, Iran, and we spoke only every few months. He struggled for a response, his deep voice faltering. \u201cWill you be O.K.?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you have money?\u201d In Iran, a divorced woman in her 30s might never marry again, and if she does, she may not do as well. She probably won\u2019t have children, and if she already does, they are legally her husband\u2019s. Her property might vanish. The notion of the happy divorced woman just doesn\u2019t compute.He quoted Rumi, telling me I would be happy again. I could almost hear the little clicks of his green counting beads as he rotated them between thumb and forefinger. This chain, which he carries everywhere, contains 33 beads \u2014 the number of arches under Isfahan\u2019s Si-o-Seh Bridge; the age of the inhabitants of heaven, according to some Muslims; and my age at the time of my divorce.I\u2019ve seen my father only four times since my mother, brother and I escaped from Iran in 1987. He has a thick mustache, a cane with a silvery animal head and a deep admiration for Mevlevi verse. He is a dentist and a pleasure-seeker, but a villager nonetheless, and set in his ways; he can barely travel outside Iran with his rusty English and inability to stomach anything other than Persian kebabs. (Though on one visit, he did develop a weird affection for Caesar salads.)After that conversation on the bus, he stopped calling. I blamed his village attitude toward divorce. Other members of my conservative family also stopped talking to me around then, and for two years, while I was marooned in Iowa for graduate school, my only family was my mother, who phoned and wrote me from her stint in Thailand every chance she got.Years later, I fell in love again. And I became pregnant. My partner and I weren\u2019t married, but we were delighted to become parents. We were both divorced and nomadic and had long shed any programmed notions of success and happiness. But judgment came from unexpected places. Some Western women chastised and lectured me. Stunned, I didn\u2019t tell anyone in Iran.A month later my mother sent me an email titled, \u201cYour Dad.\u201d It began: \u201cI just talked to your dad himself after four years or more.\u201d She told me that I had misunderstood something important years before and that my father wanted to explain on the phone.When I called, he sounded older, wearier, but happy to hear from me. I hesitated to share my news. I asked him why he hadn\u2019t called me all these years, why he had judged me for my divorce. \u201cDivorce?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat century do you think this is? You can live how you want. But don\u2019t tell your father he has to learn.\u201dI struggled to understand. When did I say that? He reminded me of that old incident on Facebook. He said that when I scolded him for his lack of knowledge, he threw his computer across the room and broke it.\u201cIt was a very important incident,\u201d he joked. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a computer since.\u201dI told him that I was pregnant, and he burst out with joy: \u201cA grandchild!\u201d He quoted Rumi verse on life and love and unexpected things. He asked me to call again after the gender scan so he could give me Iranian literary names.When I found out I was having a girl, he called with a list of names that he assured me were \u201cvery easy for Westerners too.\u201d As he read them, I struggled not to giggle. \u201cMehrandokht?\u201d he suggested. \u201cVery nice ancient name. Or what about Houravash?\u201dI jotted them down without correcting his assumptions about the Western ear for names. We didn\u2019t have time for another mix-up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Virtual Gathering of Feminist Artists", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byThe Art of CollectingLONDON \u2014 The phrase \u201cartists collective\u201d conjures a mental picture of people sharing materials and studio space to work on their creative projects.The word \u201cbunny\u201d sounds soft, cute and harmless.But challenging old modes is precisely what Bunny Collective is about. Founded in 2013 by Samantha Conlon, then an art-school student in Cork, Ireland, the group is making a name for itself with its collaborative working style, its focus on women\u2019s issues, and its outreach to local communities.\u201cThe Bunny Collective is at the forefront of Internet-based art collectives, where young emerging female artists come together and support each other,\u201d the Norwegian artist Lotte Karlsen, the founder of the feminist art collective Alexandra Arts, wrote in an email. \u201cThey are unique in the sense that they are an art collective that manages to function successfully, despite being spread all across the globe.\u201dThe members of Bunny Collective range in age from 20 to 30 and live in Ireland, Britain and the United States. Most of their exchanges are through Facebook, Skype and Google Docs.Working in cyberspace \u201cis very natural,\u201d Ms. Conlon said during an interview over Skype. \u201cIt was always seamless because it was part of everyone\u2019s practice anyway, part of an everyday thing, so it never felt like anything that held us back.\u201dFeminism is central to much of the collective\u2019s work. Last year, 10 of the artists from Bunny Collective, along with members of Finland\u2019s Areole Collective, participated in a well-received show at Helsinki\u2019s Aalto University. The exhibition, \u201cSugar,\u201d examined female identity through the prism of gender, body image and stereotypes.Coming off a successful artist residency last spring in Manchester, England, where a number of members met each other for the first time, the group will be starting an online magazine this winter. The theme for the inaugural issue will be the 20th century political theorist Hannah Arendt\u2019s ideas on labor.The idea of starting a global collective came to Ms. Conlon while she was on an exchange program from Cork at Finland\u2019s Tampere University of Applied Sciences in 2013. She got to know members of the Areole Collective who were also studying there.\u201cI was looking at all the collectives online and a lot of them were based in North America,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that is was pretty unrealistic to meet up with these people and collaborate with them in real life.\u201dSo she and two art school friends, Louise Adelaide McKeown and Aoife O\u2019Dwyer, put together an informational pack on what they hoped to achieve as a collective, and put it out on Tumblr along with an open call for applications.They also invited female artists working online who they thought might fit well with the group\u2019s cyberspace model and interest in feminism.The name Bunny Collective is ironic. \u201cIt was a cute name, and we knew we were going to subvert that,\u201d Ms. Conlon said.The Manchester residency was in some ways a pivotal moment for the group, bringing together many of the threads that now form their core focus.The 10 members who participated in the residency also made it a priority to interact with the local community. They held workshops with a local teenage girls\u2019 group on photography and producing webzines and hosted a talk with Sarah Gavron, director of the film \u201cSuffragette.\u201dKathryn O\u2019Regan, a feminist art historian who serves as the collective\u2019s curator and chief writer, said that the exciting thing about the residency was taking the ideas of feminism and art into the community.\u201cThere is a lot of interest in feminism and art with the feminist angles but it is often one-dimensional, tied to the body,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Regan said. \u201cThe residency for Bunny Collective brought it home: what a collective can do, that it should be something that can help the community and people can learn from it.\u201dOver the last three years the collective\u2019s members have also learned how to manage their own community democratically to work collaboratively on projects.Discussions of new work start with a theme and \u201cpeople throwing out ideas\u201d via Skype, Facebook or group emails, Ms. O\u2019Dwyer said. \u201cVery rarely do we come up against disagreements because we have similar interests.\u201dMembers then sit down, virtually, with Ms. O\u2019Regan, who helps to develop the structure of a project.\u201cYou do not have to be in the same place at the same time to have a similar outlook,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Regan said. \u201cProbably a lot of artists are reading the same things on the internet, they are aware of the same artists. Without having to meet in person, the ethos and the aesthetic can be quite similar.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Thirty years ago, I moved to the Harlem block where I still live with my wife, Meg, and daughter, Coco. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come from Southern California. As an active street photographer, I spent days roaming my new neighborhood making landscapes and portraits along the avenues and parks. It was a rugged time during the 1980s, with blocks of abandoned buildings as a backdrop to the virulent crack wave that left a trail of human and physical devastation in its wake.Those days, I made my exhibition prints at the darkroom of a friend, the brilliant photographer Hilton Braithwaite, which he had downtown in the basement of A Different Light bookstore on Hudson Street. One day while going over my prints, Hilton counseled me in his melodic, old-school black Boston accent, with that northeastern drawl where every noun and pause is stretched out for emphasis,Not long after that, David House, of House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Barber Shop, which was on my block, asked me if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come in and photograph his shop. It was 1986, and he worried that he might be losing his lease. His father, Jesse House, had founded the shop after he had returned from World War II. He passed it on to his son David, who ran it until his own retirement in 2004. With Hilton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words echoing in my head, I took David House up on his offer, and for the next five years I regularly visited the shop to make photographs. There I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sit, always with my camera, a couple of days every week. I was the invited house guest \u00e2\u0080\u0094  except I was the one who never leaves.  The editing and sequencing process he had was extremely hands on, which made for a great collaboration. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lived so many years with these images, and had edited so many exhibitions, made so many prints of the work, that it was hard to have fresh eyes.In many ways, for photographers working in the documentary tradition, their photographs stand together as very episodic memoirs. Each photograph or series of images is like a poem or a chapter in the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life. Looking back through these images, I pulled ones I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never brought out, building the visual narrative that reconstructed a chapter of my life about the first years I lived here in Harlem. In the essay from the book I wrote:My camera at the time was a big 500C/M Hasselblad film camera, which always presents what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in front of the lens backward, in its square waist-level viewfinder. Many days, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be seated in this crowded shop, on an old banquet bench, or a random Naugahyde dining chair. Looking down through the viewfinder with its reverse perspective, I watched the barbers: David House, Mr. Ben, Terry, and Jerry Love, with scissors, clippers and straight razors, as they precisely groomed the men and boys of my neighborhood. It was a much more intimate, yet public experience, than I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever done as a photographer.In the daytime, from the shop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s west side, Harlem life of the 1980s streamed past, through the broad storefront windows on Seventh Avenue, like an old movie screen illuminating a 12-foot-wide theater. As the sun would set, the soft light of the fluorescent fixtures gave an intimate cool glow, filling the place with soft light from the shop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high ceilings, and bouncing back off the room\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mirrored surfaces. Most often jazz would be playing on the radio, accompanied by the soft scraping sound of straight razors sliding across necks, scissors sharply snipping across heads, and electric clippers buzzing fine lines on napes and beards. Men of all ages were there, getting groomed in styles that spanned generations. From an occasional pungent Conk, the straightened 1950s-style, to the flattop Afros and pattern cut designs so popular in the 1980s and 90s.Today, so many years later, the shop has been gone for over a decade. Sadly, Mr. House himself died this year just as I was finishing the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s text. We had talked about the book, so I went to his home to show him the first edit and text. His wife answered the door and told me had died the day before. His old storefront on Seventh Avenue is now a 24-hour T-shirt and tube-sock store that mostly caters to the recent West African immigrants who have moved in to the area. But hopefully these photographs will give people a look back at the Harlem of the 1980s, and of House\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Barber Shop, a place whose mirrors reflected the styles, stories and memories from a community that has always represented a vital intersection of the traditions of masculinity and the cultural history of black people in America."}

It is forcing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to balance the demands of his conservative coalition partners, the state\u2019s judicial authorities and world leaders, who overwhelmingly view the settlements as violations of international law.The Obama administration on Wednesday condemned Israel\u2019s plan to build 98 housing units east of Shilo, a settlement a few miles north of Amona, which are meant to accommodate the outpost\u2019s evacuees. In an unusually sharp statement, the State Department said the plan, which Israel described as a new neighborhood of Shilo, was \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and would \u201ccreate a significant new settlement deep in the West Bank.\u201dIn the years since the bloody 2006 confrontation in Amona, the West Bank settler population has grown to nearly 400,000 from about 250,000. Support for removing settlements as a route to peace has dropped among an Israeli Jewish public jaded by failed negotiations with the Palestinians, recurring violence and the widespread perception that withdrawing from the Gaza Strip in 2005 only fomented terrorism.\u201cIt puts the government in a very uncomfortable spot,\u201d said Yoaz Hendel, a former aide to Mr. Netanyahu who put the current impasse down to the inertia of successive right-wing governments on the issue.Amona sits at the top of a narrow asphalt road winding up from Ofra, a vibrant settlement of about 3,300 religious Jews near Ramallah, the Palestinian administrative capital. The outpost is strategically perched 3,000 feet above sea level, with commanding views of the central West Bank, which the Palestinians envision as the heart of their future state.Mr. Buaron, who came as a student in his early 20s, said Amona\u2019s founding residents were told at the time that the government wanted to set up a new neighborhood of Ofra. \u201cWe did not come as thieves in the night,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe were pioneers.\u201dMr. Buaron married and had seven children in Amona, where his home has a slightly unkempt garden and a view of a picturesque Palestinian village in the rolling hills beyond. Now he is leading the campaign to save it. Leafing through a bound folio of maps, photographs and documents from the outpost\u2019s early years, Mr. Buaron pointed out how the state helped provide its infrastructure: a high-voltage power line, Housing Ministry plans to prepare 40 plots for permanent homes, a road.If there are legal flaws in Amona\u2019s location, he argued, it is up to the state to find a solution that would allow its residents \u2014 lawyers, teachers, a computer programmer and farmers who grow raspberries, olives and grapes or who raise sheep \u2014 to remain in place.The settlers are pushing for legislation that would force Palestinian owners to accept compensation rather than get their land back, arguing that the current legal strictures could be applied to thousands of settler homes beyond Amona. The attorney general has already ruled out that option, but 25 of the 30 Parliament members from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud Party nonetheless signed a petition backing it last month.The prime minister\u2019s office declined to comment on the options for Amona. Israel\u2019s hard-line defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman \u2014 a settler himself \u2014 has said that the outpost cannot remain where it stands.Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the settlers\u2019 Yesha Council, said he still hoped the government and the residents could \u201cfind the middle ground.\u201dThey have had plenty of time. The Supreme Court ruling, which followed more than a decade of legal wrangling, came in December 2014.The Palestinians who petitioned the court are now watching from the towns and villages in the surrounding hills.Atallah Abd al-Hafez Hamed, 63, a resident of the Palestinian town of Silwad, said that he and his three siblings inherited an eight-acre plot on the edge of Amona from his father. \u201cIt was all grapevines,\u201d he recalled.The family has not worked the land, where a single settler home sits, since the 1980s. Mr. Hamed said that was because the only access to it was through Ofra and, in any case, the grapes went bad from disease. Accusing settlers of setting fire to his fields soon after the blight, he said, \u201cWithin 10 minutes everything was black.\u201dIf Amona is removed, as the court has mandated, Mr. Hamed said, \u201cI am going to plant it all again with apples and almonds.\u201d\u201cNot grapes,\u201d he added, as if the vines would be somehow cursed.Mr. Buaron, the Amona leader, said there was nothing stopping Palestinians from coming to work their land, but Mr. Hamed\u2019s wife, Nihad, 56, expressed a widely held fear.In a feverish search for a compromise, Israel\u2019s attorney general has been examining the possibility of leasing to the settlers plots adjacent to Amona whose Palestinian owners appear to have abandoned. The Israeli military\u2019s custodian of abandoned West Bank lands placed an advertisement in mid-August in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds, along with a map, asking anybody claiming ownership to submit objections within 30 days.The United States State Department denounced that approach, saying it \u201cwould represent an unprecedented and troubling step that\u2019s inconsistent with prior Israeli legal opinions and counter to longstanding Israeli policy to not seize private Palestinian land for Israeli settlements.\u201dMichael Sfard, an Israeli lawyer who represented the Palestinian landowners in the Amona case on behalf of the Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din, said this was an inversion of the Military Order of 1967, when the occupation began, meant to protect abandoned property until its owners returned.\u201cIf the army has a duty to preserve abandoned property,\u201d he said, \u201cis this the best way it can think of, giving it to people who are not ready to leave it and who have already shown that they have no problem with violating the property rights of others?\u201dAbdallah Abu Rahmeh, a Palestinian Authority official who focuses on settlements, saw the Israeli debate as hairsplitting that obscures the depth of the occupation. \u201cIt is not up to Israel to determine where each piece of land is going to go in our own country,\u201d he said.In any case, Yesh Din, the Israeli rights group assisting the Palestinian landowners, said objections had been submitted regarding the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the plots.One is from Maryam Hassan Abd al-Karim Hamad, 81, of Silwad, whose husband, now dead, passed his property on to their six children.\u201cThe lawyer once told us they wanted to give us alternative land,\u201d Ms. Hamad said, sitting in a domed room in her family\u2019s compound, where chickens were running around in the yard. \u201cWe refused. We were raised there,\u201d she said, reminiscing how her family would plant grains one year and vegetables \u2014 tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, okra \u2014 the next. \u201cWe put the blood of our hearts into our land.\u201dRivka Nizri, who was born in Amona 18 years ago and was married late last month, has set up her home in a trailer that she and her new husband renovated in the outpost. She said she was trying not to think much about the possibility of being ousted before the end of the year.\u201cI won\u2019t go easily,\u201d Ms. Nizri said of the impending evacuation. \u201cThey will have to take me.\u201dA map on Oct. 7 with an article about the Israeli settler outpost of Amona in the West Bank, which is readying to battle a court order that the outpost be dismantled by Dec. 25, misstated the scale.

While so many young celebrities use social media to portray a vanilla image in pursuit of mainstream success, Ms. Blanchard is doing the opposite. She relies on social media to showcase herself as quirky, politically aware and a feminist.On Instagram she posts about #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, L.G.B.T. rights, domestic violence and books she is reading: \u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem,\u201d \u201cThe Girls,\u201d \u201cTo Be Young, Gifted and Black.\u201dAt New York Fashion Week, she sat in the front row of Coach\u2019s show and had been invited to attend Rodarte\u2019s.

{"Headline": "Revelation Surrounding Novelist Elena Ferrante Exposes Cultural Differences", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byIn the United States and Britain, the investigation into Ms. Ferrante\u2019s true identity has been viewed by a vocal contingent through the lens of gender. Critics have accused the journalist who conducted it and the publications where his findings appeared of sexism. But in continental Europe, the criticisms have focused on invasion of privacy issues.Ms. Ferrante\u2019s series of four Neapolitan novels, which traces the complex friendship of two women against the backdrop of Italian postwar history, came out in Italian and English from 2012 to 2015 and has resonated deeply with readers, especially women. There are 2.6 million copies in print in English, and the books have been published in 40 countries.In a report published simultaneously on Oct. 2 on The New York Review of Books website, as well as in French, German and Italian publications, Claudio Gatti, an investigative reporter for the Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore, said financial and real estate records led him to conclude that Anita Raja, a recently retired public librarian, literary translator and consultant at Ms. Ferrante\u2019s Rome-based publishing house, Edizioni E/O, was actually Ms. Ferrante. Particularly convincing for him: Payments from the publishing house to Ms. Raja rose sharply in 2014 and 2015, when the Neapolitan novels became international best sellers.In France, revealing Ms. Ferrante\u2019s identity was generally seen as rude, not sexist.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit as if a GoPro camera had been installed in Salinger\u2019s garden at his house in Cornish, New Hampshire, to show us the recluse while he watered his geraniums,\u201d the French daily Lib\u00e9ration wrote of that reclusive novelist. In France, where two of the four Neapolitan novels have been released since last year and became best sellers, people are strong believers in the idea of a \u201cjardin secret\u201d (a secret garden), or private lives.\u201cIt would be interesting if it were somebody very well known who was hiding behind Elena Ferrante, but if it\u2019s an unknown person like Anita Raja, so what?\u201d said Florence Noiville, the editor of foreign fiction for Le Monde des Livres, the book supplement of the French daily Le Monde.(Ms. Noiville said that Mr. Gatti had approached Le Monde with his report, but editors there declined to publish it. The New York Times also declined to publish the report, which would have involved coordinating with multiple journalistic partners.)The responses were also about privacy in Italy, where Ms. Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, although best sellers, have had a mixed critical reception, and where Ms. Raja\u2019s name has been mentioned for years as possibly being behind Ms. Ferrante.\u201cI am already nostalgic for the unnamed Elena Ferrante,\u201d the commentator Michele Serra wrote in La Repubblica.\u201cThe response to Gatti\u2019s report was more heated in the States, where feminist media is mainstream and developed, celebrity narratives are politicized to a fever pitch in order to excuse our obsession with them, and the clamor of the election has served as a constant, excruciating reminder of the persistence of sexism \u2014 that even the worst man is allowed to do a thousand things that a decent woman can\u2019t,\u201d she wrote in an email.Sarah Churchwell, a literature professor at the School of Advanced Study at the University of London, said the question of whether women were held to a double standard was \u201cvery live\u201d in Anglo-American culture. \u201cIt\u2019s on people\u2019s minds, for very good reason, and they\u2019re primed to interpret hostile actions against women in gendered terms,\u201d she said in an email.\u201cThe question is whether a man would have been treated to the same malice, and for myself I think that\u2019s an open question,\u201d she added.In an interview, Mr. Gatti said he was an investigative journalist, not a misogynist, and had wanted to solve one of the biggest literary mysteries in the world. \u201cIt turned out that she was a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have easily turned out that it was a man.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a critic who, in New York Magazine, defended Claudio Gatti\u2019s reporting.

{"Headline": "Galaxy Note 7 Is Not Samsung\u2019s Only Problematic Product", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byThe South Korean manufacturer, which makes an array of consumer electronics, including kitchen appliances and television sets, is in the middle of juggling other safety problems. Those include a recall in Australia for more than 144,000 Samsung washing machines that were prone to causing fires, and a potential recall of defective laundry units in the United States.Ed O\u2019Rourke, a resident of Boston, said that over the span of four years, Samsung replaced his malfunctioning induction range three times before the fourth one\u2019s glass cooktop exploded in 2013. After that, Samsung declined to issue a refund until 2015, after his wife fought the company in small-claims court and won. The couple now uses an Electrolux range.\u201cI thought, why doesn\u2019t this happen to Apple or G.E.? And is Samsung playing it a little too cute in pushing things to limits that other companies aren\u2019t pushing in terms of engineering-safety ratio?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said.Product recalls are common among consumer electronics companies, so given the large portfolio of Samsung products and the size of the company, some problems to its lineup are to be expected.A Samsung spokeswoman pointed to an earlier statement about its washing machines in Australia, in which the company said thousands of refunds and replacements had been made and that customer safety was its top priority.The revised profit for the third quarter showed a 29.6 percent drop from the same quarter last year. Shares of Samsung fell 0.65 percent on Wednesday after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.\u201cSamsung has not been communicative with consumers, regulators or the media as clearly as it should have during this recall, especially for a hazard as dangerous as this one where your phone can catch on fire, damage your property and harm your family,\u201d said William Wallace, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.The smartphone recall is most likely unrelated to other Samsung product recalls that are now unfolding, like the one for the washing machines. That is because consumer electronics like TVs and kitchen appliances are made by a different Samsung division than the mobility group that is responsible for the smartphones.In Australia, Samsung is in the process of a recall it started three years ago for top-loading washing machines that were prone to catching fire as a result of an internal electrical defect. Samsung said that as of last month, it had resolved the problem in 81 percent of the affected washers.Yet many owners of the troubled Samsung washing machines contend their problems are far from resolved. For the recall in Australia, Samsung repaired the machines by fitting plastic bags over some connectors. A Facebook group with more than 4,000 owners of the recalled machines crowdfunded money to hire forensic experts to analyze the fix. The forensic reports concluded that the plastic bag was ineffective because it did not prevent moisture penetration of the connectors.\u201cC.P.S.C. is advising consumers to only use the delicate cycle\u201d with those items, the agency said late last month. \u201cThe lower spin speed in the delicate cycle lessens the risk of impact injuries or property damage due to the washing machine becoming dislodged.\u201dCecilia Kang contributed reporting and Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

She is blocking dump trucks, an act of civil disobedience to protest unfair hiring practices at a hospital construction site.The 1963 image by Bob Adelman appears to be a typical civil rights photograph. But it is not. The solitary woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s act of defiance was far from the Deep South: It took place at Brooklyn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Downstate Medical Center. A continuing exploration of the relationship of race to photographic portrayals of race by the professor and curator Maurice Berger.The most widely published and acclaimed photographs of the period typically documented extreme incidents of violence, murder and civil disobedience in the South, events that spurred such reforms as the Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education or the passage of the Civil Rights Act a decade later. Ultimately, this narrative concentrated on harsh oppression, black and white resistance, and political triumph. But the story of racism and its confrontation was more complex. The discrimination African-Americans experienced \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially outside of the South in supposedly more liberal Northern climes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was sometimes de facto or indirect. During the civil rights movement, some photographs helped make visible that which many Americans refused to see or acknowledge, allowing individuals and groups to demonstrate the pervasiveness of racial prejudice as well as combat stereotypes and shape their public image.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA small, frequently reproduced selection of the era\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most vivid photographs has since become iconic and is considered by many to represent the entire movement. These widely recognized images from the South tell a powerful and compelling story, but \u2026 it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the whole story,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Speltz wrote. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u2026 Cast by the media at the time as sporadic and less significant than the heroic, nonviolent protests in the South, the local activism that took place in the North, West and Midwest is all but absent in the way we characterize, teach, and remember the civil rights era.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe book surveys a range of photographers, including Ruth-Marion Baruch, Don Hogan Charles, Diana Davies, Jack Delano, Leonard Freed and Charles (Teenie) Harris, among others, whose images remind us that the struggle took place not just in Selma, Birmingham and Little Rock, but in cities and towns across the United States.Although black Americans sought safer and freer lives as they moved northward and westward during the Great Migration between 1910 and the end of the 1970s, they were followed by the prejudice they fled. Mr. Speltz documents the reality: covenants that prevented the sale, lease or rental of houses to black people; African-American communities bulldozed and replaced by highways and urban renewal projects; segregated and inferior schools and public accommodations, from swimming pools to restaurants; widespread employment discrimination; and police brutality, surveillance and unrest. The photographs in \u00e2\u0080\u009cNorth of Dixie\u00e2\u0080\u009d portray a range of activities and places: a demonstration in front of the segregated White City Roller Rink in Chicago; a boy with his hands in the air as National Guard troops in Newark march behind him; a portrait of the African-American actress Fredi Washington wearing an anti-lynching armband; a boy trying on a coat at the Black Panthers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 free clothing program in Toledo, Ohio; a black family admiring a house in a whites-only neighborhood in Philadelphia; jeering counter-protesters in Chicago waving a Confederate flag; and activists waging a sit-in and hunger strike outside the Los Angeles Board of Education. These photographs did more than dispute the idea of racism and segregation as a singularly Southern problem. They also disrupted the self-image of white Northerners as racially benevolent, in contrast to the ferocious bigotry of their Southern counterparts that was depicted in the news media. During the period of the civil rights movement, mainstream newspapers and magazines \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which earlier, in contrast with the African-American press, had rarely covered issues of racism, segregation and black activism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 usually depicted these problems through a Southern lens, relying on sensationalist images of violence and murder to arouse the interest of readers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistorical photographs of northern struggles remain less familiar today for a variety of reasons, but primarily because the uncomfortable truths they contain complicate a celebratory civil rights narrative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Speltz wrote.In the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s epilogue, Mr. Speltz recognizes that the struggle continues, and with it greater recognition of the geographical breadth of the problem. During a time when some question the legitimacy of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first black president and African-Americans protest police shootings from Baltimore to Ferguson, Mo., and New York to Tulsa, Okla., the camera remains a reliable and powerful force. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese resonant pictures and their recurring themes should remind us that racism and concerted efforts to roll back hard-won civil rights gains persists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Speltz wrote about the photographs in \u00e2\u0080\u009cNorth of Dixie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ongoing and constantly evolving struggle against police brutality and militarism, entrenched poverty, institutionalized racism, and everyday microaggressions suggests that photographs will continue to play a crucial role in documenting the struggle and advancing the much needed dialogue around it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maurice Berger is a research professor and the chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}

She traveled widely throughout her career, and worked on books with her husband, the playwright Arthur Miller. She was a poetic photographer, but she had a way with language, too: She spoke seven languages in addition to her native German.Ms. Miller suspects that her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humanistic approach to her subjects gave her an advantage when photographing certain people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe would just make people feel at home and soft inside, and so they were able to kind of let go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.One of those people was the designer Crist\u00c3\u00b3bal Balenciaga. Ms. Morath began wearing Balenciaga after the Magnum photographer Robert Capa suggested that she begin dressing \u00e2\u0080\u009clike a lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A decade later, she photographed the fiercely private couturier at his home near Paris.

The shirts were lost in a fire, but some of the Balenciaga pieces went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a 1973 retrospective on the designer.Despite her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own fashion sense \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and her years spent photographing those in the limelight \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ms. Morath didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live a notably lavish lifestyle, her daughter said.

{"Headline": "Populist Wave Likely to Lift Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party", "Date": "2016-10-29", "News": "Supported byREYKJAVIK, Iceland \u2014 Spain has Podemos. Italy has its Five Star Movement, and Greece its Syriza. Now, the populist insurgency sweeping through Europe is finding a foothold in Iceland, where the Pirate Party, with its pirate flag logo and anarchist leanings, is poised to make big gains in a general election on Saturday.Iceland is one of the most prosperous, equitable and accountable democracies in the world, and has recovered strongly from the 2008 financial crisis. Even so, the nation\u2019s political elite has been far from immune to public anger. Many voters are willing to risk it all by choosing the Pirate Party, which has spectacularly captured a chunk of the Icelandic electorate despite its niche origins as a hacktivist group.\u201cWhen I think about politics in Iceland, it makes me want to vomit,\u201d Sigmundur Knutsson, 62, said in a deli as he ate fermented shark, an Icelandic delicacy. \u201cIt\u2019s all about corruption among a very small elite,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something that is not right. Something smells bad.\u201dThe Pirate Party, best known for its activism over copyright law and the protection of civil liberties, is expected to gain significantly in Saturday\u2019s election. It is riding on a wave of anti-establishment fervor spreading across Europe and the United States, upending traditional politics and fracturing mainstream parties.For the first time in Iceland\u2019s long political history \u2014 its Parliament was founded in 930 \u2014 a dozen parties were jostling for power over this frozen volcanic landmass. Iceland, which is the size of Kentucky, has an electorate of about 260,000, barely enough people to fill three football stadiums.Although support for the Pirates had since fallen by half, opinion polls conducted by Gallup in the run-up to the election showed that they remained the second most popular group after the mainstream, center-right Independence Party, which was in power when Iceland\u2019s economy collapsed in 2008.The Pirate Party is unlikely to win an outright majority, but could still gain enough seats to form part of a coalition in the horse-trading that is likely to follow the election.About 40 percent of Pirate supporters are under 30, and they were pinning their hopes on a party that has promised to install a more inclusive, transparent government.The Pirates have pledged to enhance direct democracy by passing the world\u2019s first \u201ccrowd-sourced constitution,\u201d drafted by Icelandic civilians rather than politicians. Parliament blocked the document in 2013.\u201cWe want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics,\u201d Birgitta Jonsdottir, 49, the leader of the Pirate Party and a former WikiLeaks activist, said in an interview the day before the election.Sporting sharp black bangs that sliced across her pale brow,Ms. Jonsdottir wore a black dress and black Doc Martens embroidered with red roses, fitting her self-description as an anarchist \u201cpoetician.\u201d (At age 14, she published her first poem, \u201cBlack Roses,\u201d about a nuclear holocaust.)\u201cWe need to reboot politics,\u201d she said in her parliamentary office, next to a strip club on a narrow street. She worked on a laptop covered with a sticker that read: \u201cNational Security Agency Monitored Device.\u201dHer party has granted citizenship to Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who stole a trove of highly classified documents after he became disillusioned with the agency\u2019s reach into the lives of millions of Americans.In Iceland, a nation where internet penetration is among the highest in the world but social media is still a relatively new political tool, a strategist who once worked to help elect Senator Bernie Sanders president of the United States was helping push the Pirate Party\u2019s message through Facebook and Twitter.Winnie Wong, who created the viral political hashtag #FeelTheBern, spent a few months training the Pirates\u2019 tiny media team on how to create viral content, and working with party leaders to improve their media presence. (She said her Icelandic was not good enough to create a Nordic equivalent of the Sanders campaign\u2019s famous hashtag.)\u201cThey needed a bit of structure, and we gave them an intensive training on the mechanisms of what it takes to stage a successful insurgent campaign,\u201d Ms. Wong said in a coffee shop near Hallgrimskirkja, a silvery Lutheran church shaped like a gigantic rocket ship.Soon, videos the party posted on Facebook gathered on average 26,000 views each, she said, equivalent to about 10 percent of Iceland\u2019s voting population.\u201cWe really want them to win,\u201d she said, partly so that the next generation of American lawmakers can draw inspiration from Iceland for a better type of government.Opponents had criticized the Pirate Party as political lightweights with little experience governing. The party focuses on more abstract, esoteric issues like the crowd-sourced constitution, critics say, when most voters are interested in more pressing topics like rising housing prices, student debt, pensions and the effects of climate change.Still, those critics, like Birgir Armannsson, a member of the Independence Party, recognize that the political class shares part of the blame for such strong anti-establishment feeling. His party has been in power since 2013, and it was in the governing coalition in the run-up to the 2008 crisis.\u201cPeople lost confidence in traditional politics, institutions, society,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople are still shocked. It\u2019s kind of like post-traumatic stress.\u201dWhen the crisis hit, Icelanders were plunged into debt and banks racked up losses of $100 billion, which amounted to roughly $330,000 for every Icelandic man, woman and child, according to Michael Lewis, the author of \u201cThe Big Short.\u201dSince then, Iceland has rebuilt its economy, thanks in part to booming tourism, becoming something of a model of recovery for crisis-hit countries.\u201cThe economy has been recovering,\u201d Mr. Armannsson said, adding that Iceland has low unemployment, low inflation, low inequality and healthy growth.\u201cYou could say we are well off and our outlook is quite good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut part of the population is still not satisfied.\u201dDespite efforts to remedy past mistakes and improve governance, \u201cwe are still in a political storm in the aftermath of the financial crisis,\u201d Mr. Armannsson said, sounding genuinely puzzled.\u201cThis is a little bit extraordinary.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Once a paralegal in his hometown, San Antonio, Vasquez says he started using drugs about 16 years ago after helping to negotiate bail for a dealer \u2014 and receiving a half-pound of heroin as a \u201cthank you.\u201d A father of three young children, he moved to Seattle in the mid-2000s to be closer to his own dad and farther from the people who got him hooked. But his cravings soon overwhelmed him, and he resigned himself to cycling between jail and the streets.On this occasion, however, the police didn\u2019t arrest Vasquez. Instead, they handed him off to a social worker. Eventually, he began meeting regularly with a case manager who helped him stick to his methadone treatment, find stable housing, and secure a spot in a culinary-training program. Today, Vasquez, who says he has been drug-free for nearly two years, works the early shift at a Seattle cafe and recently re-established relationships with his father and children.\u201cWe\u2019ve assigned the criminal justice system the responsibility for dealing with issues that are primarily about behavioral health, or poverty or addiction,\u201d says Gabriel Sayegh, whose organization, the Katal Center for Health, Equity, and Justice, is helping to expand the use of LEAD. He calls the program an \u201cimportant transitional vehicle\u201d toward a public-health-oriented response to drug abuse.While Daugaard was winning in the courts, those legal victories weren\u2019t changing the behavior of the police on Seattle\u2019s streets. Then, a forward-thinking narcotics captain named Steve Brown challenged Daugaard\u2019s group to identify what a more equitable approach to policing might look like. From those conversations, LEAD emerged.\u201cWe keep working with people knowing that many, if not most of them, are going to continue to use drugs and may continue to commit crimes related to their drug use for some period of time,\u201d says Daugaard. \u201cAnd it\u2019s still effective to work with them within the harm reduction framework, and it still reduces the damage they\u2019re doing to themselves and to other people over time.\u201dThis was the case for Vasquez. After his diversion into LEAD, he kept using; \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to change,\u201d he says. He refused help from his case manager, hid from the police, and briefly returned to Texas to comply with an outstanding arrest warrant. It wasn\u2019t until many months later, after he developed an abscess from injecting heroin, that Vasquez returned to LEAD. He began to bond with his case manager, who helped him get a cellphone, new clothes, and a Metro card. But his experience suggests other difficulties that LEAD faces, as well. For example, Vasquez initially assumed LEAD was a police tool for recruiting informants. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good program,\u201d he says, \u201cbut on the street it was considered a snitch program, because the officers were running it.\u201dIn Albany, all 332 officers have received training in harm reduction and avoiding implicit bias. Brendan Cox, the city\u2019s police chief, hopes that LEAD can trim the time officers spend booking people, chasing them down after they miss court appointments, and rearresting the same individuals month after month. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep arresting our way out of problems,\u201d he says. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the definition of insanity \u2014 that you continue to do the same thing over and over and expect a different result?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Survivor of Connecticut Plane Crash Tells of Argument in Cockpit", "Date": "2016-10-12", "News": "Supported byIn the moments before a Piper PA-34 Seneca twin-engine plane plunged into a street in a suburban Connecticut town, tearing through power lines and narrowly avoiding people on the ground, the two men on board had a heated exchange, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.Only one of the men, Arian Prevalla, a flight instructor, survived the crash on Tuesday, crawling from the wreckage, badly burned and bruised, just before the aircraft burst into flames on Main Street in East Hartford.His account of what took place in those final moments has led investigators to believe that the aircraft was intentionally driven into the ground \u2014 although the motive remains unclear.The crash took place near the gates of one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of jet engines, Pratt & Whitney, so federal agents were called to the scene as a matter of course. When Mr. Prevalla told investigators the crash was not an accident, the Federal Bureau of Investigation took over the case.A federal law enforcement official briefed on the case said that there was no evidence of international terrorism, or that the crash was politically motivated.Given the nature of the argument in the cockpit, investigators are looking into whether the instructor\u2019s student had mental health problems and was trying to commit suicide, law enforcement officials said.The student, Fera M. Freitekh, 28, was a Jordanian national of Palestinian descent who came to the United States several years ago to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a pilot, according to his cousin Abdul-Rahman Freitekh.A Facebook page that appears to belong to Mr. Freitekh features several videos of him flying over Niagara Falls and making landings. In one picture, he is kissing the nose of a plane. It also includes a video display of a July 4 fireworks celebration, with Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d playing in the background.Mr. Prevalla, speaking to investigators from his hospital bed, where he was recovering on Wednesday, outlined an argument the two had had in the cockpit in the moments before the crash. The details of that confrontation are what led law enforcement officials to believe it was a suicide and not something more sinister.The plane, used for training, was equipped with two sets of controls, one for the instructor and one for the student. In his statement to investigators, Mr. Prevalla said the arguing occurred as they made a final approach to Runway 20 at Hartford-Brainard Airport.Mr. Freitekh was coming in for a landing when he told the instructor that \u201csomething\u2019s a little off here,\u201d a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said. Mr. Prevalla, according to the official, \u201csays, \u2018Let me take over.\u2019 And the kid comes in for a second time for a landing, or he doesn\u2019t let him take over.\u201dMr. Prevalla was becoming increasingly anxious, and as they made a second approach, he told Mr. Freitekh, \u201cI\u2019m taking over,\u201d according to the official.But apparently before the instructor could get control, Mr. Freitekh sent the plane into a nose-dive onto Main Street.Looking at the wreckage, which remained scattered on the street on Wednesday, it was hard to see how anyone was able to escape.The plane crashed around 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, tearing through telephone wires and power lines as it barreled toward the busy street. It burst into flames only yards from a minivan with several passengers, narrowly missing the vehicle and people on the ground.Lt. Josh Litwin of the East Hartford Police Department, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, said, \u201cThe fact that there were not more casualties is pretty amazing.\u201dMr. Freitekh\u2019s cousin, who was interviewed in Jordan, said Mr. Freitekh first came to the United States three years ago to study flying. When he was not able to take his final exam for financial reasons, he returned to Jordan to make money selling video games online and working at a clothing store, according to the cousin.After six or seven months, Mr. Freitekh was able to save enough money to return to the United States and resume his pilot lessons, eventually enrolling at the American Flight Academy in Hartford.Records with the Federal Aviation Administration show he was issued a private pilot certificate on May 29, 2015, and was certified to fly a single-engine plane. His cousin said he aspired to fly twin-engine planes.Mr. Freitekh\u2019s mother lives in a middle-class neighborhood in the Jordanian capital, Amman. His father, who remains married to his mother, came to the United States about a decade ago for financial reasons.His cousin said that Mr. Freitekh \u201cwas not religious at all.\u201d\u201cHe did not pray,\u201d the cousin continued. \u201cReligion was not an issue.\u201dInvestigators said Mr. Freitekh was most recently living with several roommates in an East Hartford apartment building.A neighbor, Wanda Sanchez, said Mr. Freitekh had shared with her in casual conversation that all five residents of the apartment were studying at the flight school.\u201cThey were quiet, peaceful,\u201d Ms. Sanchez said. \u201cThey were always home. They told us they were trying to be pilots.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the given name of a lieutenant with the East Hartford Police Department.

I don\u2019t think that he can fool all Americans all of the time. Still he\u2019s come a very long way with a single idea: I, and I alone, can channel your anger into an American renaissance. Policies have never really come into the Trump phenomenon. Saviors don\u2019t have policies. They have energy.It now behooves America, whatever the outcome next month, to address that anger mixed with fear. It is widespread. Trump understood this and went to work. He grasped that many people in a polarized America, whipped up by Fox News and ushered into a post-fact world by the antics of the Republican Party, were ready for a straight-talking outsider prepared to offer scapegoats for every frustration. Trump\u2019s has been a single-note campaign; that note is rage. It has been particularly effective against the ultimate insider, Clinton.There is something rotten in the state of the West. It is not one single thing; it is a feeling of downward drift in societies unjustly skewed.People know this. They feel the tectonic plates shifting, not only of America\u2019s place in the world after two wars without victory, but also of production, employment, their livelihoods. Precariousness is the new normal. Everything is visible, including the immense wealth of the rich. Tossed here and there by dimly understood global forces people revert to nativism, nationalism and ethnocentrism \u2014 in a word, to Trumpism.A political counter-disruption is now in full swing from the losers to turbo-capitalism. Its message: We will no longer listen to self-serving elites. Witness Brexit, a revolt fed by lies that delivered disaster.The creative economy is a catchy phrase but in many cases, for those without the education or connections to benefit, what is created is misery. Technology is wonderful when it\u2019s useful but less so when it puts an end to your usefulness. Its whirlwind has left humanity with their heads bowed gazing at desolate little screens.The stooped yearn then to look up and perceive a man who promises deliverance. Trump has been that man. Who cares if he questions Clinton\u2019s stamina one day and says, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t quit, and she doesn\u2019t give up,\u201d the next?He never made any damn sense anyway.His rise is a warning sign. If the warning is not heeded Trump may fail next month but another Trump will arise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Professor Wore a Hijab in Solidarity \u2014 Then Lost Her Job", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "FeatureWhen Larycia Hawkins, the first black woman to receive tenure at Wheaton College, made a symbolic gesture of support for Muslims, the evangelical college became divided over what intellectual freedom on its campus really meant.Supported by\u201cWe break, we hurt, we wound, we lament,\u201d the school\u2019s chaplain began. He led a prayer from the Book of Psalms, and the crowd sang a somber hymn to the tune of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d:Philip Ryken, the college\u2019s president of six years, spoke next. His father had been an English professor at Wheaton for 44 years, and he grew up in town, receiving his undergraduate degree from the college. \u201cI believe in our fundamental unity in Jesus Christ, even in a time of profound difficulty that is dividing us and threatening to destroy us,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThese recent weeks have been, I think, the saddest days of my life.\u201d It was the night before the first day of Lent, the 40-day season of repentance in the Christian calendar.As Hawkins climbed the stairs to the stage that night, a few dozen students stood up in the front rows. They were wearing all black and had planned this quiet bit of theater as a show of solidarity. For a long beat, they stood together between Hawkins and the seated crowd. Then, one by one, others in the audience began to rise. The silence held for a full minute, as a majority of the room stood.Then Hawkins began to speak. She told the hushed crowd that they should see Jesus in the oppressed, that Christianity is inherently political and that \u201cbubbles are made to burst.\u201d And she read the first chapter of the book of Isaiah, a blistering prophecy for the rebellious nation of Israel spoken in the voice of an angry God. \u201cWhen you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you,\u201d she read, her voice growing steadier with every line. \u201cYes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood. ... The strong man will become tinder, his work also a spark. Thus they shall both burn together.\u201dI grew up in the town of Wheaton, with the white cupola of the college\u2019s Billy Graham Center visible from my bedroom window. I entered the college as a freshman in 1998, following my parents and my grandfather, an Orthodox Presbyterian minister who graduated in 1928. Students at Wheaton attend mandatory chapel services three mornings a week, drinking is mostly forbidden, many dorms are sex-segregated and many class sessions open with prayer. Every year, faculty, staff and trustees affirm the college\u2019s Statement of Faith, a list of 12 theological commitments that aim to capture the essence of evangelical faith. It opens with a declaration of belief in a trinitarian God \u2014 \u201cWe believe in one sovereign God, eternally existing in three persons\u201d \u2014 and proceeds to cover concepts including original sin, the existence of Satan and the resurrection of Jesus. \u201cTheological checkups,\u201d as one politics professor described them, are not unheard-of. Leah Anderson, Hawkins\u2019s last department chairwoman, told me that she has been interrogated twice after parents complained about her. Once, a straightforward discussion of family policy in an Introduction to Comparative Politics class led to an accusation that Anderson was \u201canti-family.\u201dBut unlike, say, Bob Jones University or Liberty University, Wheaton is not a de facto training ground for the Christian Right. My professors included feminists, libertarians and Sanders-style socialists, and they conducted scholarly work on seemingly anything they were interested in. No Wheaton professors I spoke with, including sharp critics and those who have left the school, said they were ever afraid to do their own research. Indeed, from its founding in 1860, Wheaton defined itself as much by its intellectualism as by its Christian character. Wheaton is both \u201cpervasively Christ-centered\u201d and \u201cacademically rigorous,\u201d Ryken, the school\u2019s president, told me. \u201cWe are very serious about our academic mission.\u201dLike Hawkins, I was both a dutiful evangelical teenager and a stubborn skeptic. Wheaton, with its unusual combination of high academic standards and devout culture, seemed like a good place to learn how to think. Its graduates include politicians, chief executives, influential scholars and spiritual leaders like Billy Graham, an anthropology major in the class of \u201943. (Our families are not related.) It places alumni at top graduate schools and draws faculty from other elite institutions.Though the school never uses the phrase itself, students and alumni often archly refer to Wheaton as \u201cthe Harvard of Christian schools.\u201d The phrase is self-deprecating, because in today\u2019s academic culture, there is an obvious tension in the idea of a Christian Harvard. It wasn\u2019t always so. In the first decades of Wheaton\u2019s history, almost every other American institution of higher learning paid at least nominal deference to Christianity. Yale was the scene of several revivals led by the evangelist Dwight L. Moody in the late 19th century; Wellesley was among those that mandated considerable Bible study. At the turn of the 20th century, many state universities required students to attend church on Sunday in addition to campus chapel services, and about half of all American undergraduates attended a church-related school.Over the course of the 20th century, the academy sloughed off the cultural trappings of Christianity, not to mention the theological commitments. But at distinctly Christian schools like Wheaton, parents expect their children\u2019s religious faith to be stretched but not broken, and they take an active role in the college\u2019s direction. Alumni are unusually devoted, too, not just with the typical fits of nostalgic school spirit but with an abiding interest in the institution\u2019s ideological and spiritual mission. George Marsden, a historian whose books include \u201cThe Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship,\u201d told me that Wheaton is something like a church denomination, in that its constituents \u201care invested in it not just as their alma mater but as part of a much larger cause that they are participating in.\u201dDuring my four years at Wheaton, I drifted away from evangelicalism. But I never contemplated transferring to another school. I was reading Foucault and Judith Butler (Shakespeare and Milton too); my professors were brilliant and kind and I found plenty of kindred spirits. When the religion scholar Alan Wolfe visited Wheaton for a cover article about evangelical intellectualism in The Atlantic in 2000, halfway through my time there, he found a campus whose earnestness was both endearing and impressive: \u201cIn its own way, campus life at Wheaton College resembles that of the 1960s, when students and a few professors, convinced that they had embarked on a mission of eternal importance, debated ideas as if life really depended on the answers they came up with.\u201d At a suburban dive bar on the edge of a marsh, we drank illicit Pabst on Saturday night and talked about politics, music and philosophy like undergraduates anywhere. Then we got up on Sunday morning and went to church.Much of that stress seemed to derive from her almost bodily awareness of the world\u2019s problems. In one of our half-dozen conversations over eight months, she described seeing people look happy and knowing she was different because she felt so weighed down by the injustices she saw and read about. She quotes Old Testament prophets from memory; several people described her to me as prophetic herself. As we spoke, her concerns veered from the Syrian refugee crisis to Rwandan genocide to gun violence to income inequality. Those worries are a burden she bears as a political scientist and as a Christian, she told me.A year or two after arriving on campus, she developed a distaste for performances of patriotism and decided to stop saluting the flag and singing the national anthem. \u201cI feel very strongly that my first allegiance is to a different kingdom than an earthly kingdom,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s to a heavenly kingdom, and it\u2019s to the principles of that kingdom.\u201d Evangelicals tend to emphasize righteousness on an individual scale, but Hawkins was becoming attracted to theological traditions that emphasize systemic sin and repentance.In particular, she was reading a lot of black liberation theology, a strain of thinking that emerged from the Black Power movement of the 1960s. Jesus\u2019 central mission was to liberate the oppressed, the philosophy argues, but mainstream American Christianity is beholden to irredeemably corrupt \u201cwhite theology.\u201d The tone of black liberation is often angry \u2014 think of Jeremiah Wright\u2019s infamous \u201cGod damn America\u201d sermon \u2014 and conservative evangelicals are wary of it because of its theological pessimism and its politically radical roots. But Hawkins was beginning to view many of the Bible\u2019s commands through a lens of race and class. \u201cTheology is always contextual,\u201d she told me, a core idea of black liberation theology. She said that evangelicals have trouble confronting \u201can ontological blackness of Christ.\u201d Responding to Wheaton\u2019s charge for professors to \u201cintegrate faith and learning,\u201d she took these ideas into the classroom.She also began to work out an idea she calls \u201cembodied solidarity.\u201d The concept starts with inspiration from Catholic social teaching, the labor movement, the Eucharist (in which Christians consume bread as \u201cthe body of Christ\u201d) and the imago Dei \u2014 the idea that humans are created in the image of God. But she wanted to take \u201csolidarity\u201d past its popular use by do-gooders. Tweeting and check-writing are cheap gestures; short-term aid vacations to developing countries are \u201cpoverty porn.\u201dFor Christians, a central fact about Jesus Christ is that, unlike God the Father or the Holy Spirit, he had a body, which experienced physical suffering and pleasure; his first miracle was transforming water into wine to keep a wedding party going. He cried out in pain while being crucified \u2014 the ultimate act of \u201cembodied solidarity.\u201d But Western Christianity also has a long tradition of treating the physical realm (sex, food, beauty) with suspicion (lust, gluttony, vanity). So Hawkins\u2019s idea of \u201cembodied solidarity\u201d can read as a rebuke to American Protestantism, particularly the white intellectual strain that Wheaton represents. \u201cI was taught to think of those who emphasize the body as secular or carnal or somehow off the mark,\u201d she said, explaining that she now sees that perspective as a \u201cdefunct view of the body.\u201dTrue solidarity, Hawkins was coming to believe, involves physical risk and sustained labor. It also involves recognizing that structural inequality is a kind of violence, with physical effects on its victims. She referred to a passage in the book of Luke in which Jesus\u2019 followers fail to recognize him after his resurrection. \u201cMy question is who do we not have the eyes to see?\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cThat\u2019s the question that plagues my soul: Who am I not seeing in their suffering? What entire groups of people, humans, do I not see suffering?\u201dShe remembers sitting in front of the family\u2019s house in Oklahoma City at around age 6, looking up at the sky and thinking, There must be a God. For a while, she carried around a small green Gideon Bible in a little purse everywhere she went. But she also pushed back against Sunday-school simplicity. She was the kind of child who asked a vacation Bible schoolteacher one summer, \u201cIf Adam and Eve sinned, why did we get punished?\u201d It\u2019s a question that suggests both theological acuity and a touch of self-righteousness. The teacher, flummoxed, told her to ask her grandfather.He died suddenly when she was 11, two days after baptizing her at the front of the church sanctuary on a Sunday evening. Soon afterward, the Hawkins family began attending a Southern Baptist church in nearby Shawnee, a small city with a much smaller black population. Their new church was overwhelmingly white, but Hawkins felt comfortable there, and her faith deepened. At home, she was such a dutiful daughter that when she went out with her friends, she could joke about planning to get drunk, and her parents would tease her back, \u201cHave fun!\u201dWhen she arrived at Rice University, a prestigious liberal-arts school in Houston, she joined a local chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ, an evangelical ministry founded for college students (and now rebranded as \u201cCru\u201d). In class, she read Catholic thinkers for the first time and reformers like Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. Majoring in history and sociology, she began to see religion as a force not just in her own heart but also in human history.In graduate school at the University of Oklahoma, Hawkins studied under Allen Hertzke, a political scientist whose work has made a case for the value of religious freedom. He helped her shape a dissertation on the George W. Bush administration\u2019s faith-based initiative and the disjuncture between the Congressional Black Caucus, which largely opposed it on partisan grounds, and the black population as a whole, which overwhelmingly supported it. Though academics and activists typically hail legislators that reflect the demographics of their constituencies, she wrote, this was a case \u201cwhere black faces fail to represent black interests.\u201dShe was recruited by Wheaton before she completed her dissertation. It\u2019s easy to imagine what Wheaton thought they were getting by hiring her: A political scientist who was sympathetic to faith-friendly public policy and also willing to pick at the seams of liberal orthodoxy and contemporary racial politics. It\u2019s very likely that the school also valued the fact that she would help bolster the diversity of its faculty. Wheaton admitted an African-American college student in 1866, believed to be the first in the state. Today about a fifth or so of the undergraduate population are minorities, along with about 25 of 200 full-time faculty members. (Wheaton\u2019s minority student population is comparable to other elite Midwestern liberal-arts colleges, including Oberlin and Kenyon.) The goals of its current $175 million capital campaign include deepening racial and ethnic diversity on campus, and the school has reason for optimism. As Ryken pointed out to me, black and Latino Christians are arguably more theologically conservative as a group than white American Christians, and evangelicalism is booming in the global South.But Hawkins was also interested in progressive ideas of justice, entering a department that housed a public-policy center named for, until his recent sex-abuse scandal, Dennis Hastert, the conservative former speaker of the House of Representatives. She imagined herself \u201cpushing back against the broader current of evangelicalism\u201d in a town that has been called the evangelical Vatican. She was a single woman in a religious culture that reveres the nuclear family. And she was black, on a historically white campus that has made sincere but spotty recent efforts to address racial issues. As she told me in January, \u201cFor whatever reason, since I came to Wheaton, I\u2019ve been a lightning rod.\u201dLike all tenure-track faculty members at Wheaton, Hawkins was required to participate in a two-year program on the integration of \u201cfaith and learning,\u201d culminating in the production of a 30-to-50-page paper that lays out how each faculty member relates his or her faith to academic work. Hawkins described the program as an \u201cassimilation project.\u201d (Another black former faculty member described it to me as \u201coppressive\u201d and an \u201cindoctrination.\u201d) Jones asked her to defend her paper in writing, because it described black liberation theology without making clear that she did not endorse it. The paper included an apparently insufficiently critical analysis of a father of the movement, James Cone, who has argued in books like \u201cGod of the Oppressed\u201d that \u201cany interpretation of God that ignores black oppression cannot be Christian theology.\u201d According to Hawkins, Jones said her paper seemed to promote Marxism. (Jones, whom I knew as a child because he attended my family\u2019s church, and other administrators at Wheaton declined to discuss Hawkins, as did a Wheaton College spokeswoman.)Over the years, according to Hawkins, Jones called her into his office several more times to affirm her commitment to the college\u2019s theological and behavioral strictures. At one point, when she attended a party in Chicago on the same day as the city\u2019s pride parade, she was asked to answer for a photo that ended up on Facebook. The tension escalated in the spring of 2015, when Hawkins pushed the college to expand its language around diversity to include L.G.B.T.Q. students, a fraught mission on a campus where gay students are forbidden to date. Again, Jones asked her to confirm the Statement of Faith. (He is a psychologist by training, and a key theme of his own academic work centers on the idea that homosexuality is mutable.)That same spring, Hawkins was asked to deliver a \u201cTower Talk,\u201d the college\u2019s version of TED Talks. She wrote a speech that used zombies as an extended metaphor for the way black men have been dehumanized in American political culture. (The talk she later gave at the reconciliation service after she left Wheaton would draw from this text.) The prepared speech praised the Black Lives Matter movement and condemned the \u201ctepid response\u201d of evangelical elites to Ferguson, Mo. And she made a sweeping case that Christian justice requires recognizing the different bodily experiences of various identity groups and demanding that economic and political institutions start \u201cprioritizing the vulnerable and the least\u201d:A politics of difference requires, in short, a radical shift in the body politic \u2014 and in the body of Christ. It requires a body politic that sees bodies, gendered bodies, colored bodies, disabled bodies, L.G.B.T.Q. bodies, and declares that bodies matter. Black lives matter should not be a controversial statement where there is recognition that bodies and groups of bodies have received disparate treatment in our past and in our present. Black bodies matter. And because those bodies matter, a politics of difference is paramount.After seeing the full text, Jones asked her to revise it; she said he was particularly concerned with her reference to \u201cL.G.B.T.Q. bodies.\u201d When she declined, he canceled the talk. Then he reversed his decision after an episode in which several Wheaton football players jokingly dressed in K.K.K. robes for a skit in a variety show, prompting a campus uproar and unflattering news coverage. Hawkins said no, telling him that she didn\u2019t have confidence he would defend her if the talk proved controversial.Almost immediately, administrators began to hear from concerned alumni, donors and parents of students and prospective students. One home-schooling mother of seven left an indignant message for Anderson, Hawkins\u2019s department chairwoman, saying the family made great sacrifices to send their daughter to Wheaton, and they expected her to receive a Christian worldview there. December is a month in which many donors make significant end-of-year gifts and when high-school seniors are making their final decisions about where to apply to college. Jones would later describe the response from prospective students\u2019 parents as a \u201ctidal wave\u201d; at the time the post appeared, he characterized the financial threat as one that would imperil 15 to 20 faculty jobs. Five days after her post appeared, Jones called Hawkins into a meeting, asked her to respond in writing to several \u201cAreas of Significant Concern\u201d and placed her on paid administrative leave.It seemed odd to outsiders that Hawkins\u2019s apparently straightforward and empathetic post could cause such turmoil in an intellectual environment, even a religious one. But conservative Wheaton alumni and parents found a litany of troubling political, cultural and theological implications in her post. There were Hawkins\u2019s references to \u201cprimordial clay\u201d and the \u201ccradle of humankind\u201d in South Africa \u2014 subtle nods to evolutionary theory. There was the implication that the pope is a definitive theological authority as well as her deference to the judgment of the Council on American Islamic Relations, whose advice and blessing Hawkins sought before donning the hijab. And then there were the photos themselves, showing Hawkins in a patterned purple head scarf, which may have been the most incendiary aspect of all.On Dec. 17, Hawkins submitted a four-page theological statement to Jones. Her document begins by affirming her faith in the triune God and the divinity of Jesus and goes on to cite respected evangelical theologians, including Timothy George. It explores various interpretations of the Eucharist, human origins and the concept of imago Dei. It delves into the question of whether Muslims and Christians worship the same God, which emerged as the most contentious point in public. Hawkins\u2019s defenders pointed out that Jones and Wheaton\u2019s previous president had signed an interfaith statement in 2007 implying that same thing. Each later removed his signature, but the president said at the time that no one had pressured him to do so \u2014 a fact that suggests the \u201csame God\u201d language might not bother Wheaton\u2019s constituents when it comes from the college\u2019s white male leaders.Wheaton does not require all its professors to be trained theologians, but it considers them to be \u201cministers\u201d of a kind and requires a certain level of theological sophistication from them. Even so, Hawkins\u2019s statement is a remarkable document for a political scientist to be asked to produce within 48 hours. Christians understand God as \u201ca tri-Personal, perichoretic unity,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy statement is not a statement on soteriology or trinitarian theology, but one of embodied piety.\u201d Her reference to Muslims as her \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d \u2014 another point of contention \u2014 was in part \u201ca reflection of my African-American cultural heritage.\u201dAs Christmas break began, Jones and Hawkins met again, this time off campus. According to a person with intimate knowledge of the meeting, Jones described staying at Wheaton as a path that would be \u201cvery, very difficult.\u201d Hawkins would be required to suspend her tenure, undergo a two-year review process and submit to \u201congoing conversation\u201d about theology with administrators and members of the board. Her four-page statement was not enough, in other words; she was so radioactive that she would require indefinite oversight. At the end of the meeting, he advised her to retain a lawyer.After that meeting, Hawkins declined to further justify the theology behind her Facebook post to the administration. Later, some white Wheaton alumni and parents couldn\u2019t understand why Hawkins stopped talking with administrators. But several black current and former faculty members were sympathetic. \u201cI use the example of being pulled over,\u201d said Shawn Okpebholo, a composer and professor in Wheaton\u2019s conservatory. \u201cYou keep getting challenged over and over to explain yourself and then forced to explain yourself more. You say, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019 What they may see as insubordination is something we in the black community think is about integrity.\u201dOn Jan. 4, Jones formally recommended to the president that Hawkins be fired, on the grounds of Hawkins\u2019s \u201cfailure to accept and model the Statement of Faith of the College and/or the Community Covenant.\u201d His memo to Ryken emphasized that he was concerned with both Hawkins\u2019s individual statements and the \u201coverall narrative\u201d they suggested. \u201cMere passive affirmation of the Statement of Faith is not enough,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOne\u2019s actions in the classroom and beyond \u2014 such as statements in academic publications and more general public statements \u2014 should manifest the faculty member\u2019s full identification with the Statement of Faith.\u201d In other words, Hawkins violated the spirit of the Statement of Faith without contradicting any of its explicit claims.Through my conversations with more than 20 current and former faculty members before and after Jones recommended Hawkins be fired, the portrait that emerged was of a campus splitting along just about every internal seam and along its outer borders, too. In January, some faculty members wore their academic regalia to class as a show of solidarity with Hawkins, while others quietly circulated a statement that was critical of her theology. A planned prayer meeting for Wheaton parents who supported the administration grew so large that it had to be moved from a local home to a spare lecture hall on campus. In early February, 78 faculty members signed a statement urging Jones to reinstate Hawkins. The press had descended on campus and were covering every meeting and memo. Various private Facebook groups, which alumni on all sides of the issue had used to spread news and rumors for months, were devolving into self-reinforcing pools of sanctimony and even rage. (Ryken\u2019s sisters were active participants on a page set up to support the administration.)This is how an evangelical academic community expresses outrage: sternly worded statements, meetings and prayer. There were also flashes of real ugliness on campus. One student wearing a hijab in solidarity with Hawkins said that a classmate slammed a door in her face so hard that she was left with cuts and bruises. And the F.B.I. looked into a vicious satirical website smearing a local Islamic center where several faculty members had made friendly overtures; some of its barbs were so specific that many assumed it had to have come from within the college community.On Feb. 6, a Saturday evening, Jones seemed to have a change of heart. He emailed the entire faculty telling them that he had apologized to Hawkins earlier that week and revoked his recommendation that she be fired. Two hours later, though, the college issued a news release announcing that the two parties \u201cfound a mutual place of resolution and reconciliation,\u201d and that Hawkins would be leaving the school. Hawkins\u2019s lawyer, Robert Bloch, and Wheaton\u2019s legal teams had been in communication since December; Hawkins also had the strategic support of an interfaith labor organization based in Chicago. \u201cA lot of healing would have to happen\u201d in order for her to stay, she told me warily in January. Instead, she agreed to leave, appearing alongside college officials upon her departure after accepting terms that are subject to a confidentiality agreement. Bloch confirmed that the settlement included financial compensation.The ensuing silence opened up even more room for speculation. Over the years, Wheaton has taken great pains to maintain its institutional identity \u2014 to avoid following broader academic winds to the left, or the lure of fundamentalism on the right. \u201cThere are always people who think that Wheaton has become this really draconian, oppressive, fundamentalist place, and there are always people who think that it\u2019s just given up on its evangelical moorings and its Christianity,\u201d said Timothy Larsen, a Wheaton professor of Christian thought. The Hawkins episode, he said, was \u201ca controversy where whatever people fear is what they are really convinced is happening.\u201dMany of Hawkins\u2019s supporters dismiss the idea that the confidential settlement was true reconciliation. It was an especially painful outcome for those on campus who see Wheaton\u2019s progress on racial issues as promising, if complex. \u201cWe looked like something we\u2019re not, a white fundamentalist college,\u201d Okpebholo said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we looked like to the outside.\u201d The reconciliation service on campus, which began with prayer and ended with communion, was also galling to some who backed her. The communion service in particular \u201cfelt like spiritual manipulation,\u201d said Ezer Kang, a psychology professor who left Wheaton for Howard University this year. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t reconciliation.\u201d He walked out before the breaking of the bread.Wheaton is still feeling the reverberations from Hawkins\u2019s departure. Jones retired as provost this spring, though he remains a faculty member at the college. The board of trustees appointed a review panel of primarily trustees and faculty to undertake a thorough post-mortem, examining issues like how race and gender influenced what happened and how the Statement of Faith might affect academic freedom. A public statement related to the report is expected later this year.Since her controversial leave-taking from Wheaton, she had become something of a celebrity in the small world of interfaith media and nonprofits. In the spring, she began taking speaking engagements, and she traveled to accept awards from religious organizations in Michigan, New York and Washington. In June, she flew to Turkey with a Chicago-based Islamic nonprofit organization to meet with Syrian refugees. Strangers have recognized her on airplanes and on the street; she is wary of dating online, for fear she\u2019ll be recognized there too. She recently worked out a deal with HarperOne to write a book about \u201cembodied solidarity,\u201d a concept she returned to over and over throughout the preceding months.As a Wheaton alumnus, it was hard for me not to mourn the way things had turned out. I have always been sympathetic to Wheaton\u2019s attempts to maintain its unusual institutional character, even when those attempts are clumsy or publicly embarrassing. The balance between orthodoxy and intellectualism is poignantly fragile. And the Hawkins episode was a painful reminder of why. That Wheaton couldn\u2019t make room for a scholar like Hawkins raises questions about what real diversity might look like in a setting where a certain uniformity of belief is essential. And that so many of its constituents interpreted her actions so uncharitably, so swiftly, reflects poorly on evangelicalism as a whole. The difference between theological purity and cultural exclusion is not always as tidy as believers would like to think.In her new office, we talked about Wheaton and about Jesus, about her evolving faith and about Donald Trump.

{"Headline": "The Fear of Having a Son", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byTiesWhen my son, Macallah, was born five years ago, my college students asked how it felt to be a new father.\u201cTerrifying,\u201d I blurted. \u201cAll I can think about is bullying.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d I responded. \u201cBut this boy\u2019s going to be raised to feel and express his vulnerability. That\u2019s a curse in this culture.\u201dWhat worried me just as much was the flip-side realization: Whatever my wife and I tried to do to shape our son\u2019s masculine identity would compete against such cultural norms as a postured indifference to school, which can lead to lower grades, graduation rates and academic motivation; a sports and gaming culture that exalt alpha domination (and aggressive male reflexes); and a tight-lipped John Wayne ethos that breeds alienation and, too often, depression.All of the dread and loathing I\u2019d always felt about the limiting script of traditional masculine norms came flooding back. I was faced with one of my biggest fears about parenthood: having a son.The common wisdom, as research verifies, is that most men want sons. That\u2019s starting to shift. Some men, like me, fear becoming fathers to sons.Ms. Martin says that her own husband was relieved to have daughters instead of sons. He says: \u201c\u2018I haven\u2019t felt like I fit into a lot of the social norms around masculinity\u2026. I\u2019m much more interested in the challenge of helping a girl or young woman transcend sexist conditions. It feels more possible and more important, in some ways.\u201dThis imbalanced, man-card mind-set is part of our legacy because children ape the attitudes of the parent whose gender matches their own. In a Time magazine article about this study, Harriet Tenenbaum, a co-author, observes, \u201cMost parents say they want boys to be more expressive but don\u2019t know [they] are speaking differently to them\u2026. These are learned stereotypes and we are reinforcing them as a society.\u201dThe good news for boys is that men with a high emotional intelligence quotient don\u2019t hand down these values. The bad news: Pressure from an unexpected corner makes such men gut-check their desire to embrace boys, not to mention their own emotional sensitivity.Is it any wonder that some of us want little, if anything, to do with raising boys? The subtext bombarding us from many sides ultimately encourages us to abandon them, even as they founder beneath the chop of a changing world for which they lack the buoyancy. Yet men like me abdicate our responsibility by letting other men \u2014 the ones who don\u2019t always encourage the broader, deeper humanity within males \u2014 raise boys. And we deprive ourselves of the opportunity to heal old wounds.Recently, I sent Macallah, now 5, to his room after he ignored my repeated requests to stop yelling and throwing his toys. More than even his dismissal, what bothered me was what many people refer to as \u201cboy energy.\u201d It\u2019s a reactive, sometimes destructive, force that unnerved me even as a child. Then I heard the voice of my wife, Liz, in my head: \u201cHe only wants your attention. Boys don\u2019t always know how to ask for what they want.\u201dI found Macallah in his room, repeating the same behavior. I took a deep breath.\u201cWere you upset because I wasn\u2019t paying attention to you?\u201d I asked. Head and eyes downcast, he nodded. I bent down and hugged him, then looked at him. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you learn to tell Mama and me what you need \u2014 sometimes that means telling us what you\u2019re feeling inside, understand?\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou do it,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me what you really wanted.\u201dHe shrugged, still looking down. \u201cYou to pay attention to me,\u201d he said.He threw his arms around my waist, leaning his head into me. I didn\u2019t need words to know what filled my young son: He felt wanted.Andrew Reiner teaches in the English department at Towson University and is working on a book about masculinity.Advertisement"}

She had just read \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Stornoway Way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kevin MacNeil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s novel about a busker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustrated return to his island home, when she came across a tourism pamphlet for the Outer Hebrides. The advertisement promised \u00e2\u0080\u009ca wild untouched paradise\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a very different landscape from the one portrayed in the novel of dissatisfying isolation with drinking, drugs and anything else to keep boredom at bay. Ms. Vancon called her resulting project \u201cAt the End of the Day,\u201d the English translation of a Gaelic phrase.\u201cThe islanders can refer to it simply as the end of a working day when people find themselves in community or in family, playing traditional music in the pub or lighting up a fire fed with peat,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut it is also the moment of reflection.\u201d  She arrived on the Isle of Lewis last January. After meeting a few people, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is a snowball effect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas everybody knows everyone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She took time getting to know her subjects, mostly young islanders, and started photographing when it felt right. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go straight into the intimacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to gain trust. It is a question of respect.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHer photographs came from two trips, one in winter and one in summer. The vast difference in daylight hours between the seasons \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the sun sets at around 4 p.m. in the winter and 11 p.m. in the summer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 revealed various social rhythms of island life against a backdrop of pubs, homes, windswept peaks and glassy waterways beneath gray skies.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cJuly and August is the high season for ceilidhs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, referring to the festive gatherings with traditional music and dance.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo they go on every ceilidh they can and enjoy every possibility of events, which go on for longer than they do in the winter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon found that life for many residents involved leaving the islands for college or learning a profession. Yet despite better opportunities for careers elsewhere, most wanted to return to the islands. The communities of the Outer Hebrides have shrunk over the decades. The latest figures estimate a total population of 27,070, which, coupled with environmental and market impacts on local industries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 oil extraction, hunting, fishing, crofting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaves the island economies fragile. Opportunities can be elusive.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is really rare that it matches what they want to do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEither they have to choose a career or they have to choose the place where they grew up.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor example, Melanie MacDonald, 22, earned a nursing degree, but has yet to find a job on the island because the few positions that exist rarely open up. Holly Pearson, an 18-year-old student, is facing the same situation when she returns from university.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOpportunities for women on the island are rare,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really give you a chance to blossom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet Ms. Vancon saw strength in her subjects. Danielle MacGillivray, 26, a single mother with multiple sclerosis, is a volunteer firefighter on Benbecula Island, where she grew up and still lives.Not everyone wishes to remain. Connor Clarke, 18, encountered prejudice when he came out as gay and wants to leave for Glasgow to become an actor. His family and friends support him \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey just want him happy and loved and loving somebody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon said. Yet the fact that most people wanted to return to their island homes seemed resonant of a deep connection to a way of life that shaped them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of the young people I meet are really proud of their culture and, as well, really involved in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Vancon said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCultural heritage, like the church traditions, the Gaelic language and music, traditional dance, or sport like the shinty, are part of what makes them so different and unique.\u00e2\u0080\u009dShe now hopes to examine the turning point of exploring those moments of reflection on a larger scale: the transition between their historical legacy and the way they shape their future.\u201cNo matter where they find themselves around the world, either they stay or leave the island, at the end of the day it is there that their roots are.\u201dLaetitia Vancon\u2019s \u201cAt the End of the Day\u201d project will be exhibited in Paris by the BnF (French National Bank) on Dec. 15, organized by La Bourse du Talent."}

{"Headline": "Ex-Nurse Charged With Killing 8 Nursing Home Residents in Ontario", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 There were few common threads in the lives of the eight nursing home patients, who ranged in age from 75 to 96. One owned a tool and die shop; another was a factory worker. Some were pillars of churches; many were parents.The death notices for some of them suggested that they might have had Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other chronic medical conditions. Most of the notices described the deaths as peaceful.The motive for the killings remains, for now, a mystery. Seven of the patients died at a nursing home in Woodstock, a city of about 37,000 people that has a large Toyota plant and sits in the middle of farm country, some 80 miles southwest of Toronto. The eighth and final killing, according to the police, took place farther along Highway 401 West, at a nursing home in London, Ontario, that briefly employed Ms. Wettlaufer.A tip to the Woodstock police on Sept. 29 started the investigation, although the authorities declined to identify the person who provided it. The next day, by coincidence or not, Ms. Wettlaufer gave up her nursing license.When it became apparent that the deaths involved more than one location, the provincial police were called in.During a news conference in Woodstock, the police said that the investigation was continuing and that more charges were possible. They added that a single method had been used to kill all of the known victims.\u201cThe victims were administered a drug,\u201d said Detective Superintendent Dave Truax of the Ontario Provincial Police. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a position at this time to comment further on the specifics of the drug, as it forms part of the evidence that is now before the courts.\u201dThe glimpses of Ms. Wettlaufer\u2019s life provided through social media posts, police statements, nursing records and court documents suggest many disappointments and struggles, particularly when it came to finding steady employment.In a Facebook post about a year after the police said the final murder took place, Ms. Wettlaufer suggested that she had experienced problems with alcohol.Ms. Wettlaufer separated from her husband not long before she began working at the Woodstock nursing home, owned by Caressant Care. The company said in a statement that she had left about two and a half years ago but, citing the murder investigation, declined to give a reason for her departure.Julia King, the chief operating officer of the Meadow Park London Long Term Care nursing home, where the last victim died, said in an email that Ms. Wettlaufer had left her job there about two years ago.Charlene Puffer, who lived in the same Woodstock apartment building as Ms. Wettlaufer, told the Canadian Press news agency that the police had made several visits to the building recently. On one occasion, she said, the officers wore hazardous materials suits.As it emerged on Tuesday that the eight people had been killed rather than succumbing to disease or old age, relatives of some of the victims said they had harbored suspicions.Susan Horvath, the daughter of Arpad Horvath, who died at 75 in the London nursing home, told a radio station there that something had seemed wrong with her father\u2019s care.\u201cI just had a feeling, and I told Mom,\u201d Ms. Horvath said. \u201cThen when he passed on \u2014 and how he passed on \u2014 that\u2019s when I knew, \u2018This is not right.\u2019\u201dBut other family members, some of whom learned of the case through news reports on Tuesday, told reporters that they had never suspected anything. Several of the death notices thanked the nursing staff at the Woodstock home for their care.This is not the first time a nurse in Ontario has been accused of multiple murders. In 1981, Susan Nelles was arrested and charged with killing four infants at Toronto\u2019s Hospital for Sick Children by injecting them with a powerful heart medication. She was acquitted when evidence showed, among other things, that she had not been working during some of the shifts when the babies died.The police identified the other nursing home victims as James Silcox, 84; Maurice Granat, 84; Gladys Millard, 87; Helen Matheson, 95; Mary Zurawinski, 96; Helen Young, 90; and Maureen Pickering, 79. Death notices show that many of them came from farm towns surrounding Woodstock, including Tillsonburg, which was the center of Ontario\u2019s now-defunct tobacco industry.Coincidentally, an 8-year-old girl was abducted across the street from the Woodstock nursing home in 2009, and was later found murdered. While there was no connection between the two cases, Chief William Renton of the Woodstock police said on Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for a community to have to endure these types of tragic incidents.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is the media\u2019s actual responsibility to provide voters with as accurate and probing a portrait of the two candidates as possible.But there was also hesitation. My newspaper, The New York Times, spoke of Trump\u2019s misrepresentations, but it was not until a few weeks ago that we called Trump a liar.

At a moment when Americans want change, the Clintons feel like old news. That is why millennials galvanized by Sanders are not galvanized by her.These are all essential areas of coverage.

{"Headline": "Elena Ferrante and the Power of Appropriation", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorThat series, which follows the lives of two girls in a poor neighborhood in Naples from childhood to maturity, feels so powerfully authentic that many readers have assumed it reflected Ms. Ferrante\u2019s own experience. But as it turns out, Ms. Raja\u2019s history is very different from those of her heroines, Elena Greco and Lina Cerullo. Ms. Raja was born in Naples, but she moved to Rome at the age of 3 and grew up there. Her father was Neapolitan, but not poor \u2014 he was a magistrate. Her mother was a German Jew who fled to Italy in the 1930s to escape Nazism, and who lost most of her family to the Holocaust. None of these facts could be gleaned from the novels.The immediate reaction of many readers to these revelations was, perhaps surprisingly, anger and disgust. On social media, many Ferrante devotees have condemned Mr. Gatti and those who published him. After all, Ms. Ferrante has been vocal about her need for privacy and her refusal to participate in the celebrity-author game. Her publishers have faithfully protected that privacy, even as her books sold millions of copies and made guessing her identity a favorite literary parlor game. Yet now that Mr. Gatti has seemingly won the game, nobody seems very pleased. Hiding from the world may have been a prerequisite for Ms. Ferrante\u2019s creativity, raising the unhappy prospect that the identification of Ms. Raja may mean the end of her work.In a larger sense, too, the exposure of Ms. Ferrante feels like an attack on the idea of literature. On Twitter and Facebook, a number of writers immediately denounced the idea that to know a novelist means knowing the biographical truth about her. Surely what matters, they argue, is not Ms. Ferrante\u2019s background but her imagination. A novel is supposed to be a self-sufficient world, something the writer creates and then sets free; it is not meant to be tethered to its creator, but to transcend her. On a more personal level, many writers are frightened by the idea that to write a book means giving up all claims to privacy.All of these reactions are understandable; and it is surely true that the forensic accounting that led to the revelation of Ms. Raja\u2019s identity was more like a criminal investigation than literary criticism. But it is also true that anonymity, for any writer, is a makeshift. Even the most famous writerly pseudonyms did not remain secret for long: At first people wondered who George Eliot might be, but after a few years it was an open secret that he was really a woman, Mary Ann Evans. In our own time, the cults surrounding J. D. Salinger and Thomas Pynchon proved that an exaggerated insistence on privacy is the most effective kind of publicity. Writers who are simply themselves, even very famous writers, are generally allowed to go about their lives unmolested. It is when they try to hide that the public\u2019s curiosity becomes relentless.For it turns out that in telling the story of poor Neapolitan girls like Lina and Elena, Ms. Raja was claiming the right to imagine the lives of people quite unlike herself. In doing so, she was able to write books in which millions of people found themselves reflected \u2014 books about feminism and patriarchy, poverty and violence, education and ambition.This is the paradox of literature, which is also the glory of humanism: the idea that nothing human is alien to any of us, that we all have the power to imagine our way into one another\u2019s lives. If the exposure of Elena Ferrante reminds us of that truth, which today we are too inclined to forget, perhaps it will turn out to be justified.Adam Kirsch, a poet and critic, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe People and the Books: 18 Classics of Jewish Literature.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump, but it is generating a major uproar in Silicon Valley.Mr. Trump is toxic among technology investors and entrepreneurs. The news last weekend that Mr. Thiel was giving $1.25 million to the Republican\u2019s campaign is provoking outrage. And tech executives who work with the billionaire investor are being forced to explain why they plan to continue to do business with him.Now Mr. Thiel will defend himself. A spokesman said Wednesday evening that he would address the controversy in a speech in Washington later this month. He declined to comment further.Mr. Thiel was the first outside investor in Facebook and sits on its board. That has put the social media giant in the cross hairs of this debate. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, warned that cutting ties with Mr. Thiel because of his political views would be a troubling precedent.\u201cWe care deeply about diversity,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in an internal Facebook post to employees. \u201cThat\u2019s easy to say when it means standing up for ideas you agree with.

An affidavit filed in federal court by the F.B.I. says that Imam Bengharsa, 59, supplied $1,300 in June 2015 to a Detroit man who used it to expand his arsenal of firearms and grenades. The man, Sebastian Gregerson, 29, a Muslim convert who sometimes calls himself Abdurrahaman Bin Mikaayl, was arrested in late July and indicted on explosives charges.Nearly a year ago, in fact, the F.B.I. said in a court filing \u2014 accidentally and temporarily made public in an online database \u2014 that agents suspected the two men were plotting terrorism. \u201cBased on the totality of the aforementioned information and evidence, there is reason to believe that Bengharsa and Gregerson are engaged in discussions and preparations for some violent act on behalf of\u201d the Islamic State, an agent wrote.Yet Imam Bengharsa has not been arrested or charged. It appears that the authorities do not have clear evidence that he has broken the law. His inflammatory statements are protected by the First Amendment, and agents appear to have no proof that he knew Mr. Gregerson planned to buy illegal explosives. In his checkbook, next to the notation for the $1,300 check, Imam Bengharsa wrote \u201czakat,\u201d or charity, the documents show.The case poses in a striking way the dilemma for the F.B.I. in deciding when constitutionally protected speech crosses into inciting violence or conspiring to commit a terrorist act.In testimony before Congress this week, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the challenge for F.B.I. agents was determining when someone has crossed the line from speech to criminal activity. \u201cIt\u2019s even protected speech to say I\u2019m a fan of the Islamic State so-called,\u201d Mr. Comey said.When the suspect is a cleric, like Imam Bengharsa, the matter is especially delicate.The documents say he transferred money three times to an unnamed person in Yemen.Investigators are also exploring contacts between Imam Bengharsa and other people suspected of extremism or terrorism. One is Yusuf Wehelie, 25, a Virginia man arrested in July and charged with weapons possession, which would be illegal because he has a previous felony conviction for burglary.Mr. Wehelie first came to public attention in 2010, when he and his brother, Yahya Wehelie, both American citizens, were temporarily detained in Cairo and prevented by the F.B.I. from flying home. American officials said such delays were sometimes necessary to assess whether a person posed a security threat. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations protested that the rights of such travelers were being violated.At Yusuf Wehelie\u2019s detention hearing in July, the authorities said he had told undercover agents that he supported the Islamic State and that if he couldn\u2019t join it overseas, he would attack a military recruiting center, possibly using explosives. (Mr. Wehelie\u2019s lawyer, Nina Ginsberg, said that in later recorded conversations, he disavowed those statements and later stopped replying to the undercover agents.)In Baltimore, another young man named Maalik Alim Jones was arrested late last year and charged with joining a terrorist group in Africa. Imam Bengharsa had preached on occasion at a Baltimore mosque Mr. Jones attended, but it is not clear that they knew each other.The F.B.I. has been closely watching the imam for months, law enforcement officials say. A spokesman for the bureau declined to comment.The authorities are concerned that Imam Bengharsa, who claims an impressive list of scholarly credentials, may be spreading the Islamic State message that violence can be justified against perceived enemies of the faith. In view of the payment to Mr. Gregerson, they also fear he may be financing other supporters of the Islamic State. The F.B.I. has said in court that he is under investigation for conspiring and providing material support to the Islamic State.Imam Bengharsa did not reply to emails, phone messages or a note left at his townhouse in Clarksburg, Md., a town equidistant from Baltimore and Washington.He denied that he supported the Islamic State but said: \u201cIt might appear that way. I am an advocate of the United States and the West getting the hell out of the Middle East and the Muslim world.\u201dHe added a question: \u201cIf this was the case, why haven\u2019t they come to arrest me?\u201dImam Bengharsa, who was born in Libya, moved to the United States at age 10, according to a biography he posted online. He claims to have received a degree from Al Azhar University in Cairo, and additional degrees in economics and Islamic studies.He lived in Texas and later, after embracing religion, worked as a chaplain in Maryland prisons from 2006 to 2009, as an imam at the Islamic Society of Annapolis from 2009 to 2010 and at Masjid Umar, a small storefront mosque outside Baltimore, from 2011 to 2014. Last year he created the Islamic Jurisprudence Center, whose street address turns out to be a mailbox at the UPS Store near his home in Clarksburg. The authorities said he also frequently visited another mosque, Dar al-Taqwa, in the Baltimore suburb of Ellicott City.Imam Bengharsa appears to have long held very conservative views. In his 2011 lectures at the Islamic Society of Baltimore, for example, he said Muslims must strictly follow the shariah, or Islamic law, no matter where they live.In his standoff with the F.B.I., Imam Bengharsi appears to have scant support in the American Muslim community. Muhammad Jameel, the president of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, said that the imam\u2019s marriage lectures five years ago were his only connection to the mosque and that his recent statements were \u201cagainst all the tenets of Islam.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a nut,\u201d Mr. Jameel said. \u201cHe has freedom of speech. But if he\u2019s a criminal, I want to see him in jail.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

Maybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it: a sloping hillside, swarmed by people like ants on a crumb as far as the eye could see. The unprecedented gathering here, near the Standing Rock Sioux Nation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with some 300 tribal nation flags flying and 3,000 people on the ground \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stands along a lonesome stretch of High Plains prairie framed by buttes and big sky, where the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers meet. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen overnight. It began in early spring as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cspirit camp,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a handful of tepees, on Standing Rock Sioux reservation land, its purpose as serious as life and death. The tribe and its allies were already two years into a legal fight to stop the 1,200-mile Dakota Access Pipeline (known as DAPL), which was slated to transport fracked Bakken crude oil under the Missouri River half a mile upstream from the reservation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boundary. The spirit camp formed as a prayerful vigil by activists \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cland and water defenders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they called themselves \u00e2\u0080\u0094 watching for signs of construction.In late July, when the Army Corps of Engineers issued most final permits for the pipeline, the public fight began. The Standing Rock Sioux, represented by EarthJustice, sued the corps, saying it failed to review potential effects on the tribe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sacred sites and water supply. Then came the rallying cry. Tribal leaders asked the Oceti Sakowin, the tribes of the Seven Council Fires (or the Great Sioux Nation), to join their stand against the pipeline, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat black snake\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Lakota prophecy that could destroy Mother Earth.Two months into the mass pilgrimage near Cannonball, with tribes from across Indian Country and all over the world, the stand at Standing Rock still captures national media attention. Journalists, photographers and videographers document the goings-on, from prayerful ceremonies to direct actions at construction sites met by SWAT teams and tanks. (Or, in one infamous instance, by private security guards with attack dogs and Mace.) But largely lost in the coverage of how big #NoDAPL is growing is how deep the cause is to thousands of Native Americans. Men and women with jobs and school and children to attend to have upended their lives. Ask for how long, and all say the same: for as long as it takes to stop the pipeline. With legal rulings pending and North Dakota\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ruthless winter on its way, people are stacking firewood, insulating tepees and building earth houses of logs and grasses. The main camp, Oceti Sakowin Camp, now includes a K-12 school, a medical tent, a solar charging station, a free clothes store, a meeting \u00e2\u0080\u009chall\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a low-watt radio station. This while cellphone reception is spotty at best and water is brought in by the truckload.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go with the intention of making a photo series or with any agenda, for that matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Marcovici, a largely self-taught photographer who considers herself an activist and visual storyteller. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy only goal was to learn why the encampment existed and what, if any, role I could play, whether as a photographer or simply another hand in the kitchen.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt that time, the Standing Rock battle was largely unknown outside of Indian Country and environmental circles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d heard of the encampment found it strange that people were camped out trying to stand up against a huge oil company,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Marcovici said, referring to the Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI initially wanted to bring attention to the cause, and to tell a human story about the people sacrificing so much to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.\u00e2\u0080\u009d During her trips to the encampment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 she intends to keep returning \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ms. Marcovici spends most of her time not taking pictures. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI talk to people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI help sort supplies. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m another person in the community that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formed at these camps, not just a passing observer.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe result is a portrait of everyday life under extraordinary circumstances, behind the public rallies and ceremonies. Children riding bikes down a hill, playing basketball, swimming in the Missouri River. Adults chopping firewood, building fires, butchering a cow. In total, they show a community being built from the ground up.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms Marcovici said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that along with the everyday experiences of the camps, the images convey some of what I consider the most important part of my experience: the love and respect I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve formed for the people and the land they depict.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

{"Headline": "Poland Steps Back From Stricter Anti-Abortion Law", "Date": "2016-10-06", "News": "Supported byWARSAW \u2014 After growing protests from Polish women and an embarrassing debate in the European Parliament, Poland\u2019s governing party retreated Thursday from a proposed law that would have made virtually all abortions illegal.Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the party, the right-wing Law and Justice Party, said that while the government agreed with the intent of such a law, it opposed the version proposed by an anti-abortion group.\u201cObserving the social developments, we have come to a conclusion that this legislation will have an opposite effect to the one that was intended,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the right way to proceed.\u201dPoland already has among the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, providing exceptions only in cases of incest, rape, severely damaged fetuses and threats to the mother\u2019s life.Tightening abortion laws has been a priority for the Catholic Church, which plays a powerful role in the country and is closely allied with Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s party, which has a solid parliamentary majority.The vote came a day after a government-dominated parliamentary body, the Justice and Human Rights Commission, surprised government opponents by voting not to support the legislation in Thursday\u2019s second round of voting, presaging the measure\u2019s defeat.The commission\u2019s ruling was followed by 90 minutes of heated discussions that did not end until early Thursday. Stanislaw Tyszka, deputy marshal of the lower house of Parliament, ended the debate by scolding members. \u201cYou are behaving like mad monkeys,\u201d he said.Law and Justice members had voted overwhelmingly to move the bill forward in the first round of voting last month, but party leaders had a change of heart.Party officials said they now objected to the bill in part because it would have punished women who received abortions, including potential prison terms. The bill also called for imprisoning doctors who performed abortions.Krystyna Pawlowicz, a commission member and one of the governing party\u2019s most outspoken politicians, posted on her Facebook page that the Episcopate\u2019s position had effectively \u201cauthorized\u201d the vote against the measure.Also on Wednesday, the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, held an emotional debate over the bill, a debate that Law and Justice had tried to avert as an intrusion into Poland\u2019s sovereignty.Malin Bj\u00f6rk, from Sweden\u2019s Left Party, called the proposed law \u201ca huge blow against women\u2019s rights.\u201d Gianni Pittella, president of the European Parliament\u2019s Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, said the legislation undercut European Union values \u201cand threatens the right to health of women.\u201dSpeakers for the Polish government said the debate should never have happened. \u201cYou are talking about something on which you don\u2019t have the right to legislate,\u201d said Jadwiga Wisniewska, a European Parliament member from Law and Justice.The government had insisted throughout the debate that the legislation had not been its project, but a proposal from anti-abortion citizen groups. Leaders of those groups reacted with outrage to what they saw as a betrayal.Joanna Banasiuk, a leader of Ordo Iuris, the group that had written the legislation, said that despite the anger, the organization would accept changing the measure to remove punishments for women.Another Ordo Iuris official, Mariusz Dzierzawski, took on the governing party\u2019s leader directly. \u201cJaroslaw Kaczynski just honestly thinks that sick children should be aborted,\u201d he said.Opposition politicians and leaders of the protests against the legislation were triumphant.\u201cKaczynski caved from the wrath of thousands of women,\u201d said Marcelina Zawisza, from the left-wing Together Party that coordinated the street protests, on her Facebook page. \u201cThis is the first victorious battle in our fight for our dignity and rights. But the war is not over yet.\u201dLaw and Justice officials said that the government intended to stick with the current law, for the time being, but was considering possible future changes.Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told Parliament just before Thursday\u2019s vote that her government continued to believe that its main job was to protect human life from the moment of conception.She added that by the end of the year, the government would prepare a national program to support families with disabled children and women who give birth even after their fetuses have been found to have genetic disorders.Rafal Chwedoruk, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw, said the government was scrambling to do \u201cdamage control\u201d over its miscalculation in pushing the issue.\u201cThis vote is obviously an attempt to put an end to this issue as soon and as painlessly as possible,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

A few nights before, a fire alarm had woken the Hajjes, but because the sponsors had thought to explain what to do, they exited the apartment calmly.Because of the care the sponsors took, Ms. Hajj said she had no worries about her immediate family\u2019s future in Canada. She felt especially close to Peggy Karas, a former geography teacher whose slight air of sternness belied her generosity. Sometimes when she saw Ms. Karas at her door, the older Canadian woman straining a bit under the heavy bags of fruit and halal meat she had brought, Ms. Hajj\u2019s eyes welled in gratitude. \u201cI feel like Peggy is like my friend, my mom, my sister,\u201d she said.Because of the care the sponsors took, Ms. Hajj said she had no worries about her immediate family\u2019s future in Canada.

Ms. Hajj had already blurted out requests for the sponsors to bring over her brother Ibrahim.But her husband had not yet said a word to the sponsors about his own brother. He intended to, but his concern for his distraught wife stopped him: Perhaps she needed a relative more. \u201cMaybe if someone from her family comes here, she will feel better,\u201d he said.But her husband had not yet said a word to the sponsors about his own brother. He intended to, but his concern for his distraught wife stopped him: Perhaps she needed a relative more. \u201cMaybe if someone from her family comes here, she will feel better,\u201d he said.Asking the sponsors about more than one relative seemed like too much. The Hajjes cringed at making requests of their patrons or doing anything that could seem like taking advantage. Even when Mr. Hajj\u2019s father asked the couple for money, a humiliating request for the older man, they did not feel they could siphon from the allowances the sponsors had given them.Asking the sponsors about more than one relative seemed like too much.

Something similar was happening all over Canada. Thousands formed groups to sponsor one family for one year, to give their time and money to initiate the new arrivals into Canadian life. But thanks in large part to cellphones and social media, Canadians with no prior connection to the Middle East were getting glimpses into the well of desperation that was the refugee crisis.She had little idea that her inquiries, conveyed in gestures and broken English, were pushing the volunteers into conversations they had never anticipated.

He was one of the million-plus refugees in Lebanon, another face in a cluster of laborers waiting all day at the intersection for a chance to work. Even if one of the trucks rumbling by stopped, work was not a sure thing. Sometimes the men would rush the vehicle, piling onto the back, and the strongest would force the others off, winning the job. Ali al-Hajj, 30, made it once every five or 10 days at best.As Mouhamad al-Hajj was sleeping in his handsome new bed in Toronto, his brother Ali stood at a dusty crossroads halfway around the world, a few miles from the Syrian border.

They had lived in tandem since childhood. Mouhamad was the one who had spotted Eman as a potential wife for his younger brother. When the Hajjes lost their fourth child, shortly after birth, in Lebanon last year, the two brothers stood shoulder to shoulder to dig the tiny grave.The two used to stand at the intersection together, looking like a matched set with their skinny frames.

He accepted immediately, but when he hung up he was reeling.

The shelter was so cramped that they often slept outside during the summer. Ali did not want his older children, 5 and 3, to feel deprived, so he sometimes brought home candy even though he could not afford it. He owed the grocery store down the road over $400.There was no work for Ali that Friday, so he returned for lunch to the 6-by-10-foot shed, not really a home, where he, Eman and their three children lived.

He feared that his family had no prospects: no ability to return to Syria, no ticket out of Lebanon, no education. His 5-year-old daughter, Nihal, longed to attend school, but he could not afford to send her. She sat in the shed and tried to write, holding pencil over paper. There was no one to teach her \u2014 her parents were illiterate, too.That was far from his greatest worry.

She entered with a long to-do list: Remind Ms. Hajj of her first-ever teeth-cleaning appointment. Check in about sign-ups for swimming classes. Slip a few dollars to 8-year-old Moutayam to pay for his school assignment book. She told his parents to check it regularly, even though she knew they were unlikely to understand a word.After a morning at an art exhibit, Peggy Karas arrived at the Hajj apartment just as Mouhamad and the children were returning from school.

But the relationship had taken on a depth she had never predicted. Ms. Hajj had arrived in Canada in her final trimester of pregnancy, and when the older woman learned that the Syrian mother had lost her last baby, she devoted herself to seeing this one into the world. At 68, she wanted grandchildren, but none had yet arrived. Here were four children who needed help, the oldest three delighted by things Canadians took for granted \u2014 new pencils, popcorn at the movies, a soccer goal with a net. Like a real grandmother, she often found herself thinking about them during the day, wondering what they were up to.Initially, she thought sponsorship would be a matter of \u201cO.K., yes, we\u2019ll give you money,\u201d as she put it.

The Hajjes were supposed to be self-sufficient by next February, but she feared they had virtually no chance of succeeding. They could not fill out a permission slip, read a medicine label, pay a bill or navigate the subway to a new destination on their own.But behind each of her agenda items that day was one overwhelming worry.

Mr. Hajj\u2019s triumphs in English class, like counting the capital letters in a sentence, shrank next to the magnitude of what he had to learn. When the sponsorship year ended in less than six months, he would need a job, but that could mean he would have less time \u2014 or none \u2014 for language instruction. The Canadian government had already funded part of the Hajjes\u2019 integration, and without financial support from the sponsors, they might have to go on welfare.Together, the sponsors had more than a century of experience teaching school, yet they struggled to propel the family to basic literacy.

Recently, Ms. Hajj had thrown out the soccer schedule the sponsors had left \u2014 the words were meaningless.

But on every visit, they seemed to take on more. With the school year starting, they were contemplating adding a daily hour of afternoon homework assistance. Having invested many months, tens of thousands of dollars and their own hearts in the Hajjes\u2019 success, they found themselves in a paradoxical situation: Getting the family to become truly independent required more and more help.The doting sponsors kept vowing to do less for the family, hoping to foster progress.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Assails His Accusers as Liars, and Unattractive", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump wielded his presidential candidacy on Friday as a weapon for savaging detractors and venting personal grievances, attacking the women who have accused him of sexual assault and unwelcome advances and railing against what he described as a vast conspiracy against him by the news media and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.With a campaign speech in North Carolina that whirled from one target to the next, Mr. Trump accelerated his shift away from courting swing voters or delivering a message aimed at the political mainstream.Instead, after weeks on the defensive, battered by disclosures about his treatment of women and about his business dealings, Mr. Trump appeared increasingly consumed with the idea that he has been wronged and bent on convincing his fans that sinister forces are to blame for his political decline.Mr. Trump told the restive crowd that his advisers wanted him to focus on his core economic message, but that he had no intention of allowing his critics to go unanswered.\u201cMy people always say: \u2018Oh, don\u2019t talk about it. Talk about jobs. Talk about the economy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cBut I feel I have to talk about them, because you have to dispute when somebody says something,\u201d he added of the allegations against him. \u201cFortunately, we have the microphone. We\u2019re able to dispute; some people can\u2019t.\u201dEven as two more women came forward on Friday to say he had groped them, Mr. Trump dismissed the mounting accusations as \u201ctotal fiction\u201d and \u201clies, lies, lies.\u201d He assailed the motives of the women speaking out against him, and seemed to mock two of them as not attractive enough to draw his interest.15 PhotosHe was similarly dismissive of Natasha Stoynoff, a former writer for People magazine, who accused Mr. Trump of physically accosting her during an interview. \u201cCheck out her Facebook page, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump also ridiculed his opponent in the presidential race, Mrs. Clinton, for saying that he had crowded her physically during their last debate, and he seemed to offer an insult about her physique. When Mrs. Clinton walked in front of him, he told a crowd in Greensboro, N.C., \u201cBelieve me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201dAnd as he blasted the women who have made allegations against him as fabricators, Mr. Trump suggested that perhaps someone should make similar claims against President Obama next.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t some woman, maybe, come up and say what they say falsely about me \u2014 they could say it about him,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Though Mr. Trump has said he will provide information to refute his accusers\u2019 stories wholesale, he offered no such evidence in North Carolina. He has also loudly threatened to sue multiple publications for printing the stories of his accusers, but as of Friday evening no such suit had been filed.Mr. Trump made only passing reference to the newest accusations against him. In an interview with The Washington Post, a woman named Kristin Anderson said Mr. Trump had slipped his hand beneath her skirt and grabbed her genitals at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s.Mr. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman denied the account, and Mr. Trump said in his speech that certain details were implausible because he rarely sits alone at nightclubs. But The Post did not say Ms. Anderson had described Mr. Trump as being alone.A second woman, Summer Zervos, a Republican and a former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d said at a news conference in Los Angeles that Mr. Trump had tried to seduce her over dinner at a hotel in 2007, grabbing her breasts and thrusting his pelvis into her body. Ms. Zervos, 41, appeared alongside Gloria Allred, the celebrity litigator and a Democrat who was a delegate for Mrs. Clinton.We\u2019d like to hear how the allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald J. Trump are playing out in people\u2019s relationships. Please share your story with us.Mr. Trump denied in a statement several hours later that he ever had a meeting with Ms. Zervos at a hotel or \u201cgreeted her inappropriately.\u201d He again attacked the media and said he would \u201ctake my message directly to the American people.\u201dThe claims against Mr. Trump have gained a momentum of their own since the revelation on Oct. 7 of a recording in which he boasted to a television host about sexually assaulting women. That tape led to the direct questioning of Mr. Trump, at Sunday\u2019s debate, about whether he had ever actually done the things he described. Mr. Trump\u2019s denial prompted Ms. Leeds to come forward in an interview with The New York Times; Ms. Anderson said Ms. Leeds had inspired her to tell her story.After learning of Ms. Leeds\u2019s story, Ms. Anderson told The Post, she decided: \u201cLet me just back these girls up.\u201dBy lashing out in multiple directions and presenting himself as the target of a corrupt plot, Mr. Trump may deepen his emotional bond with voters who have turned to him as a kind of political wrecking ball aimed at Washington. But it is an unlikely strategy for improving his standing with the majority of voters who say in polls that he is ill-suited to the presidency and biased against women and minorities.Democrats have called the charges women have made against Mr. Trump disqualifying. On Thursday in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama said she had been shaken by Mr. Trump\u2019s cavalier bragging about assault.Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood and a prominent Clinton supporter, predicted women would revolt against Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks in North Carolina.\u201cIf they weren\u2019t already convinced, today proved to Americans that Donald Trump is an abusive and vindictive monster,\u201d Ms. Richards said. \u201cWith every ugly and violent insult that comes out of his mouth, Trump loses a vote, and our country gains a feminist.\u201dLeading Republicans have already pulled back from his campaign, and new signs of distance emerged on Friday between Mr. Trump and the party he nominally leads.Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who is seeking re-election, released a television commercial saying he has \u201ca lot of disagreements\u201d with Mr. Trump. And in a closely fought congressional race in central New York, the National Republican Congressional Committee has an ad vowing that its candidate, Claudia Tenney, will \u201cstand up to Hillary Clinton\u201d \u2014 implying that Mrs. Clinton will be the next president.Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who announced this week that he would no longer defend Mr. Trump, ignored him entirely in a speech to college Republicans in Wisconsin. Mr. Ryan criticized Mrs. Clinton and Democratic policies, but made no case for his own party\u2019s nominee.Mr. Trump, who has savaged Mr. Ryan repeatedly this week, declined to revisit their conflict on Friday afternoon.But Mr. Trump escalated his war on the news media, and unveiled a theory that The New York Times was attacking him at the behest of a Mexican billionaire, Carlos Slim, who is the largest individual holder of New York Times Company common shares.Reporters for the newspaper, Mr. Trump said, should be seen as \u201ccorporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and Hillary Clinton.\u201d\u201cNo media is more corrupt than the failing New York Times,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s bitter attacks on the news media, and Mr. Slim in particular, seem to echo the precise language used by two of his advisers, Stephen K. Bannon and Roger Stone, who have long cast Mr. Slim as an ominous presence in the American news media.In a statement, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times, said Mr. Slim had no involvement in the paper\u2019s news coverage. \u201cCarlos Slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism,\u201d Mr. Sulzberger said. \u201cHe has never sought to influence what we report.\u201dMr. Trump has spoken in ever more apocalyptic tones in recent days as his poll numbers have fallen: describing Mrs. Clinton as deserving incarceration; warning that the election will be rigged; and suggesting that international bankers are colluding to bring about his defeat.On Friday, he repeated his pledge to prosecute Mrs. Clinton and encouraged his crowd in chants of \u201cLock her up.\u201d \u201cFor what she\u2019s done,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should lock her up.\u201dNick Corasaniti reported from Greensboro, N.C., and Alexander Burns from New York.

That will still correspond to just one-third of the North American market, whose value is expected to reach $47 billion over the same period.Despite that relatively small size, Europe\u2019s market remains one of the largest for American cloud providers, many of which are increasing investments worldwide as companies and individuals increasingly rely on cloud-based services \u2014 such as iCloud, from Apple, and Dropbox, the online storage company \u2014 in their daily lives.In an interview, Rainer Strassner, manager of Microsoft\u2019s cloud program in Germany, said the country\u2019s law protected data stored on the servers there from information requests by foreign governments, including the United States.While such investments have focused primarily on business customers, other American tech companies have made similarly large investments aimed at speeding up digital services for everyday users across the 28-member European Union.Facebook is also working on its own Irish cloud computing center, while expanding an existing site in Sweden.Advertisement"}

It would be too easy to chalk that up to her Canadian background \u2014 she says it does help explain her commitment to finding consensus \u2014 and she has found that she gets her science across more effectively if she can connect with people personally. In a nation seemingly addicted to argument as a blood sport, she conciliates. On a topic so contentious that most participants snarl, she smiles. She is an evangelical Christian, and she does not flinch from using the language of faith and stewardship to discuss the fate of the planet.While some climate warriors treat those who are not inclined to believe them as dupes or fools, she wants to talk. \u201cIf you begin a conversation with, \u2018You\u2019re an idiot,\u2019 that\u2019s the end of the conversation, too,\u201d she said over tacos at a Tex-Mex restaurant, having ordered in the fluent Spanish she picked up during her parents\u2019 missionary service in Colombia. She is 44, but seems younger \u2014 someone who speaks with authority but can punctuate a statement about a surprising scientific fact with a wondering, almost giggly, \u201cIsn\u2019t that crazy?\u201dThe issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.Dr. Hayhoe did not set out to be a smiling climate crusader. In the scientific circles of her training, she encountered no one who needed to be convinced that what she was studying was valid, any more than a professor of literature would have to argue in favor of the existence of books.She discussed that moment of realization with her students in class last month. Her husband had only understood her dissertation work to be some arcane combination of chemistry and computation; he did not believe climate change was real.\u201cAnd I think, \u2018Whoa!\u2019\u201d she said.Her husband, from Virginia, was raised by staunch Republicans and had taken their point of view without exploring it deeply. The young couple talked out the issues in painstaking detail over the next year and a half, he bringing up questions from his own reading by denialists, and Dr. Hayhoe researching and answering.In her approach to discussing climate change, she declines invitations to televised arguments with those who deny the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is real and human activity is largely the cause. She said that such shows, with their split-screen antagonists, suggested that the two sides are evenly matched, which helps explain why Americans tell pollsters that scientists are split on the matter when it\u2019s really more like 97 percent on the side of \u201cit\u2019s real.\u201dSitting on the back porch of her house near Lubbock on an early fall evening, Dr. Hayhoe said some of her early attempts to talk to local groups about climate change fell flat. People repeated the kinds of questions that are spread by climate denialists. Hasn\u2019t the climate always changed? How do you know it isn\u2019t the sun\u2019s energy warming the planet? Why do you put so much trust in satellite readings, which could be wrong?Confronted by crossed arms and closed minds, she found herself making little initial progress. \u201cI have had people stand up, literally shaking with rage,\u201d she said.Over time, she developed a more disarming approach that incorporated the most frequent questions into the talks. She explains that yes, the climate has always changed, but the current changes correlate convincingly with the steep rise in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. She shows that the pattern of solar cycles would have the planet cooling right now instead of warming. She argues that while the satellite readings are helpful, there are some 26,500 other measures pointing in the same direction.She counters preconceptions about her by speaking openly of her faith and of her respect for the principles of science.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in climate change,\u201d she said. Belief doesn\u2019t come into it; scientific verification does.\u201cGravity doesn\u2019t care whether you believe in it or not,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if you step off a cliff, you\u2019re going to go down.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was made public, Billy Bush was negotiating his exit from NBC.Mr. Bush and NBC are working out the terms of his departure from \u201cToday,\u201d which may come in the next few days, according to two people briefed on the plans.It would be a swift fall for Mr. Bush after a brief tenure as a host in the 9 a.m. hour of the show. He joined \u201cToday\u201d this summer.Mr. Bush, 44, apologized on Friday evening, and throughout the weekend NBC officials maintained they had no plans to discipline him. As late as Sunday morning, the plan was for Mr. Bush go on \u201cToday\u201d on Monday and address the controversy, saying something along the lines of the statement he released on Friday, in which he said he was \u201cashamed.\u2019\u2019But the backlash was significant. Mr. Bush\u2019s Facebook page was deluged with thousands of angry comments. Two women that Mr. Bush and Mr. Trump discussed in the tape \u2014 the former \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d host Nancy O\u2019Dell and the \u201cDays of Our Lives\u201d actress Arianne Zucker \u2014 released statements over the weekend expressing their disappointment.Given the tape\u2019s incredible visibility, it was likely that Mr. Bush would remain part of the news cycle for the near future. \u201cToday\u201d is in competition with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and the fallout from the videotape could have affected NBC\u2019s ratings in the morning hours, particularly among women, who represent a significant portion of the show\u2019s viewership.By Sunday night, NBC had suspended Mr. Bush.

{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019m the Last Thing Standing Between You and the Apocalypse\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "FeatureInside the final weeks of Hillary Clinton\u2019s cautious \u2014 and surprisingly risky \u2014 campaign.Supported byEarly this month, I went to Toledo, Ohio, to meet with Hillary Clinton, to sit down with her for a while and take the measure of her ordeal. It was five weeks before an unnervingly high-stakes Election Day. Every campaign produces candidates declaring that \u201cthe most important election of our lifetimes\u201d is at hand. Usually this is true only for the person running (no doubt 2012 was the most important election of Mitt Romney\u2019s lifetime). But this year\u2019s stakes feel legitimate. This is not only for the milestone that Clinton\u2019s election would achieve, and all the cultural Rorschach tests, gender dynamics and political scar tissue embedded within. It\u2019s because of Donald Trump, an astonishing figure unlike any who has ever come close to assuming power in this country. \u201cNear existential\u201d is how Tim Kaine recently described this campaign, and it did not come off as complete hyperbole.After Clinton\u2019s event at an old train station, I was escorted up to an office where she was finishing an interview for \u201cGood Luck America,\u201d a political news show on Snapchat. The waiting area was arrayed with cushioned chairs, tables and reception desks. It felt like a doctor\u2019s office. I took a seat next to Dan Schwerin, Clinton\u2019s speechwriter, and Brian Fallon, the campaign\u2019s national spokesman. Aides kept shuttling in and out of the conference room that housed \u201cH.R.C.,\u201d a longstanding shorthand for the candidate in memos that over time has graduated to a spoken identifier (\u201cWhat does H.R.C. think?\u201d). As had been the case since the first debate, the mood in the Clinton orbit was buoyant. Fallon mentioned that he wished the bad Trump stories could be spread out a little bit, allowing voters to hold and fully savor each in turn, rather than being force-fed them day after day.After a few minutes, another press aide, Nick Merrill, popped his head out of the conference room, faux-squinted in my direction and said the doctor would see me now. I had not talked to Clinton in person for more than a year. She was warm and animated, but her eyes hung heavy, and she appeared somewhat worn down, no doubt still feeling some lingering aftereffects of pneumonia. In the same way that presidents seem to age eight years for every four they spend in the White House, you can see the toll this campaign has taken \u2014 the surprising challenge of Bernie Sanders, the email story and F.B.I. investigation and Trump\u2019s nothing-off-limits pelting. She sat down next to me at a conference table, slumped back in a swiveling desk chair. Her contempt for Trump was clear from the outset, far more intense than it appears even in speeches and debates. It went well beyond the competitive fervor with which one general-election candidate tends to speak about another. \u201cIt does feel much different,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I were running against another Republican, we\u2019d have our disagreements, don\u2019t get me wrong, and I would be trying to make my case vigorously. But I wouldn\u2019t go to bed at night with a knot in the pit of my stomach.\u201d She enunciated her T\u2019s (\u201cknoT in the piT\u201d) as if she were spitting out the words.\u201cI had the opportunity to meet a lot of presidents over the years,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my disagreements with them. But I never doubted for a nanosecond that they got up every morning trying to figure out what was the best path forward for the country.\u201d At least, she added, \u201cthey were serious people.\u201dThat sense of high moral purpose is evident throughout the campaign. Whenever I visited Clinton\u2019s campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, the youthful energy and confidence of the staff was leavened by a detectably uneasy undercurrent. Either they are helping elect the first female president, assuring her place in history, or they will be the people who lost to Donald Trump. \u201cThere is a dread that people have about what it would actually mean if he were to actually be elected,\u201d John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, told me. As much as Obama\u2019s team and supporters wanted to see the president re-elected in 2012, Podesta said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t feel that the country was going to fall into the abyss if Mitt Romney was president of the United States.\u201dGiven that, I asked Clinton if Nov. 8 scared her. \u201cNo, not really,\u201d she said slowly. I clarified that I was talking about the prospect of her losing. She knew what I was talking about. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lose,\u201d she said. She shot me a knowing grin.This is the standard politician\u2019s answer when asked to contemplate defeat \u2014 even candidates who are down 30 points \u2014 but Clinton seemed to mean it. \u201cI don\u2019t go there,\u201d Clinton said. Trump is such an unnerving figure, partly because in getting this far he has already defied so many predictions, largely on the strength of his ability to command the media fun house. This has been the enduring, defining characteristic of the race. His mania for being seen and heard and mentioned has proved exceptionally well suited, maybe codependent, to the current age.Trump coined a grand and nostalgic slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d easily the most recognizable campaign calling card since \u201cYes We Can.\u201d When I talked to Clinton, she told me how pleased she was with her own slogan, \u201cStronger Together.\u201d She was especially proud of how it came out of a deliberative process: grinding out ideas and really figuring out what it was she wanted to stand for. I mentioned that it hardly rolls off the tongue, sounding more like a CrossFit slogan than a rallying cry. \u201cIt\u2019s clunky, but it works,\u201d I said, and she nodded.\u201cIt works,\u201d she said with a hint of defensiveness, \u201cin part because I really believe it, O.K.? How do we get people to overcome these barriers?\u201dClinton has worked closely with (and married) some of the most gifted orators and \u201cexplainers\u201d of recent political memory \u2014 Obama, Joe Biden and Bill. All three are deft at relaying big themes and small narratives alike. Clinton, for her part, is stubbornly cautious and on script, banking on the notion that real-life concerns of voters and tangible benefits of her proposals will win out in the end over spectacle. \u201cAt the end of the day, people are going to vote on Nov. 8,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd like it or not, issues will actually be part of governing.\u201d Her approach doesn\u2019t make for the best TV, but her years in public life have made her wary of any exposure, especially when she does not control it. Scrutiny is dangerous, and disclosure is rarely rewarded. If Trump views the media as a vehicle to express his id, Clinton is all superego. She has been happy to leave that field to him, even if it makes her boring, or even ignored.Hillary Clinton\u2019s first presidential run in 2008 was badly outmaneuvered by Obama\u2019s campaign in the race to master the internet as an organizing, outreach and fund-raising tool. Her current enterprise has been deft in using social-media tools as a way of reaching supporters, disseminating opposition research and occasionally engaging with Trump. But for the most part, the dizzying new level of scrutiny and saturation made possible by the digital age only made Clinton retreat further into caution.When I spoke to her over the Fourth of July weekend in 2015 in New Hampshire, Clinton had clearly been thinking about the impact of new technology on human development and how people communicate. We were talking about mental health and substance abuse, two issues that a lot of voters in New Hampshire were raising with her. She described a meeting with a group that had developed online mental-health programs. One woman predicted to her that a big challenge in mental health over the coming years would be \u201chow to undo the damage that the internet has caused young people.\u201dIt\u2019s striking to me now that Clinton\u2019s main interest in these new media technologies was not so much as a political tool but as a policy concern for the citizenry. Clinton described \u201cthe insidious, pernicious comparisons\u201d that online communities can foster in young people, and the temptation to \u201cput out an identity online before it\u2019s ever formed\u201d in real life. Thinking about this exchange 14 months later, after what feels like a generation\u2019s worth of lines crossed and taboos shattered, her concern seems strangely prescient.Trump, of course, both shares and feeds his audience\u2019s addiction to stimuli and entertainment. Early in the campaign, during the Republican primaries, he would pretty much say yes to anyone who wanted to put him on TV or in a magazine. He was indefatigable in reaching out to reporters, lobbying for coverage. He can be undeniably fun and, to a point, seductive. My first encounter with Trump, more than a year ago, came in an unsolicited note that said simply, \u201cMark, It\u2019s Time for a Cover!\u201dClinton, on the other hand, proceeds with immense caution. When we first spoke last July, she agreed to our meeting on the maddening proposition that we do it off the record. I went along, reluctantly, as it was my only entree (she agreed later to put parts of it on the record). Her hesitancy to give interviews and allow media access has barely subsided over time. When I asked Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s 36-year-old campaign manager, how his candidate had adapted to the insane rules of engagement that this campaign has \u201cnormalized\u201d (to use a 2016 buzzword), he essentially said that she hadn\u2019t. \u201cHillary approaches this campaign through the portal of wanting to fix problems,\u201d Mook told me. \u201cAnd so politics for her is, first and foremost, not an exercise in communicating to the masses. It\u2019s about finding the right solution and then going after it.\u201dClinton is, in other words, the anti-Trump. She is not a political novelty, nor is she especially entertaining as a media personality or in front of big groups. She and her campaign know this and have been smart about not pretending otherwise. Trump\u2019s big shadow and outrage machine have even allowed her to become slightly and perhaps blissfully lost; to fade, if not into obscurity, at least into a background that cuts the glare of the scrutiny to which she has been so averse. In a sense, she is daring voters to study her positions, listen to her answers and not look to her for entertainment or emotional impact. In 2016, that can seem almost risky.\u201cI\u2019ve laid out all of these policies, and look, people kind of made fun of it, because \u2018Oh, there she goes with another policy,\u2019\u2009\u201d Clinton told me. \u201cI\u2019m trying to run a campaign that presents an alternative case.\u201d It\u2019s telling that a candidate with the name recognition, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and baggage of Hillary Clinton is nonetheless left to present her campaign as an \u201calternative case.\u201d\u201cMy husband and I laugh sometimes about the \u2018Antiques Roadshow,\u2019\u2009\u201d Clinton told me, referring to the PBS show about antique appraisers that she watches devoutly. \u201cSometimes we feel like we are the antiques on a roadshow when it comes to politics.\u201dConsigned to the back was the traveling press. Like most presidential-campaign corps, Clinton\u2019s comprises an aggressive bunch of mostly 20-something reporters, camera people and network \u201cembeds\u201d charged with tracking everything remotely newsworthy that a candidate might do on a given day. They are descendants of the \u201cBoys on the Bus\u201d generation, whom Tim Crouse made famous in his unforgiving account of \u201cpack journalism\u201d as it existed during the 1972 presidential campaign. Today\u2019s pack is distinct in fundamental ways: There are many more women and minorities in the group (as in, there are more than almost none); there is considerably less drinking, and no one smokes; and while reporters 40 years ago paid their dues and scrapped like hell to cover a presidential campaign, many of today\u2019s cast members are in their first journalism jobs. They are competitive but collegial. Their tech savviness is astounding (actually it made me scared). It\u2019s easy to see why a control-freakish enterprise like the Clinton campaign might be terrified of an army of smartphone dynamos who are just dying to tweet out what color cough drops the candidate was popping (Halls, yellow).By Sept. 5, Clinton had gone 275 consecutive days without holding a news conference. With the campaign now unofficially kicked off, it was time for her to tend to this pesky constituency. Shortly before the plane left Westchester County in New York for Cleveland, where she would be holding a Labor Day rally, Clinton made her way to the press section in the rear of the plane. Forty or so reporters maneuvered themselves over chairs, armrests and one another to capture this \u201ccasual\u201d hello for posterity.\u201cI was just waiting for this moment,\u201d she said, deploying the kind of slightly nervous icebreaker you might use on a doctor before a colonoscopy. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled,\u201d she continued. \u201cNo, really. I wanted to welcome you onto the plane. I think it\u2019s pretty cool, don\u2019t you?\u201dWhen no one spoke up to answer, the candidate jumped in herself. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to say yes,\u201d she said.Clinton tried to continue her speech, gamely if not wisely; in hindsight, Kaine should have grabbed the mike for a few minutes while Clinton recovered. She popped lozenges and gulped water. In a different political climate, some pundit might identify the coughing fit as potentially \u201chumanizing\u201d or, at worst, \u201cbad optics.\u201d But 2016 is not much for humanity. You could sense dread in the crowd \u2014 and see cringing eyes among the Clinton staff \u2014 over what would become of this moment. This is your brain on Trump. He had been suggesting for weeks that Clinton was not in good health, a conceit stoked by a Greek chorus on the internet and a few well-placed \u201cmedical experts\u201d on cable (paging Dr. Giuliani). The coughing fit was all over TV that afternoon and inspired a screaming Drudge headline about Clinton\u2019s \u201cviolent coughing fit.\u201dClinton\u2019s trachea cleared well enough for her to get through the Cleveland speech. What had become clear in this new phase of the race was that she would be devoting big parts of her events to ridiculing Trump more methodically than she had before.Back on Hill Force One, Clinton made another visit to the press cabin, this time for an official \u201cgaggle\u201d \u2014 or did it count as a news conference, which would officially end her 275-day drought? This set off a debate among the press corps and campaign, until eventually it was agreed upon that yes, this counted as a formal \u201cavailability\u201d session with the press, or \u201cavail,\u201d as it is known in the bubble. Breaking news: drought over.Clinton revealed in the session that she had increased her intake of antihistamine. She spoke in greater depth about her allergies, which prompted a pointed follow-up question (\u201cMadam Secretary, is it pollen?\u201d), a broader one about whether she was concerned about all the health-related conspiracy theories (\u201cThere are so many, I\u2019ve lost track\u201d) and another about whether she thought these health rumors were sexist (\u201cHmm, interesting\u201d). Whenever she is asked questions that touch on possible sexism and double standards, Clinton tends to assume a slow, sarcastic and vaguely disdainful voice. She declared the topic \u201cinteresting\u201d; she would \u201cleave it to others\u201d to determine. On whether she is being treated differently as a female candidate, Clinton suggested that it would be a great topic, in the future, for \u201ca lot of Ph.D. theses and popular journalism writing.\u201d She then wrapped things up, disappeared behind her curtain and left us to our \u201cpopular journalism writing.\u201dThe flight back to Westchester was marred by a near-international incident. A few of the reporters in the back started engaging in an old traveling press-corps high jinks of rolling an orange up the aisle in an attempt to reach the candidate\u2019s seat. The tradition dates at least to the Reagan years, and supposedly counted Nancy as a fan. In some iterations, the reporters would write out a question on the orange that the candidate might reward with an answer. This particular evening, the appointed citrus was a clementine, and a young TV embed scrawled out the question: Would Clinton rather have dinner with Trump or Vladimir Putin?After a few failed rolls, the fruit suffered a violent collision with a seat leg that resulted in a citrus explosion all over my laptop. Finally, one reporter successfully propelled the clementine into the candidate\u2019s sanctum up front. A few minutes later, it came back with \u201cPutin\u201d circled. Juicy. Next stop, Twitter: \u201cClinton Prefers Putin as Dining Partner to Trump.\u201dBut wait a minute. The Clinton people thought this clementine bowling was off the record. Citrus is classified! An argument ensued. Varun Anand, an affable young campaign aide assigned to \u201cwrangle\u201d the traveling press corps, looked stricken. He engaged in a somewhat plaintive discussion behind me with Monica Alba, a campaign reporter for NBC (\u201cVarun, you have no case,\u201d she said). Anand then summoned some muscle in the person of the more senior press babysitter, Nick Merrill, who strolled back unto the breach.\u201cO.K., so I was back here a few minutes ago, and everyone was laughing and throwing an orange around,\u201d Merrill said, assessing the situation. \u201cAnd now I come back again, and suddenly everyone is really tense.\u201d Correct. In any case, Merrill clarified that the clementine had not actually reached Clinton, but rather he picked it up first and read the question aloud. To which Clinton remarked that she had once eaten dinner with Putin. Merrill then circled \u201cPutin\u201d and rolled back the clementine.Everyone tweeted out Merrill\u2019s clarification. The tension lifted; Merrill headed back to the front cabin and, as he passed my seat, said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to read four paragraphs of this stupidity in your magazine story.\u201dOutside her plane after a speech in Tampa, Fla., a few days earlier, Clinton stopped for a few minutes under a wing to chat and take pictures with the photographers in her press entourage. This produced a classic through-the-looking-glass scene: Clinton posing for pictures with the photographers who normally photograph her, while the rest of her media contingent stood along the stairs photographing her posing for photos with her photographers.In her conversation with the photographers, Clinton talked about how the phenomenon of \u201cselfies\u201d has transformed her encounters with voters. She was always adept at drawing quick connections with people she met on rope lines. Even in the briefest of exchanges, they would tell her their stories. I had observed Clinton in many rope lines over the years, and I can attest that she\u2019s effective in those settings, though not at the level of her flesh-pressing demon of a husband. I watched her during the Democratic primaries in 2008 as she greeted a crowd of voters in Charleston, W.Va. One woman described to Clinton a litany of her life\u2019s struggles in the space of a few seconds (her husband\u2019s diabetes, their lack of health insurance); the candidate nodded through squinted eyes, signed an autograph on a napkin and hugged the woman, who walked away in tears.\u201cI got a lot out of these short meetings, holding somebody\u2019s hand, having somebody tell me about their problems, addiction, losing a job,\u201d Clinton told me when I spoke to her in Toledo. \u201cI thought of it like an ongoing educational experience.\u201d She misses that, she said, because now such encounters are driven by one all-encompassing goal: the selfie.\u201cIt\u2019s a loss,\u201d Clinton said. She understands why people want selfies. \u201cIt makes my time at the event with them real. Put it on Facebook, and show it to everyone who follows them on Instagram, everyone they can reach.\u201d She prefers the handwritten notes she used to get a lot more of, everything from little scraps of paper to several-page stacks of loose-leaf. They all bore the script of individual Americans wanting to tell her about their lives.After Bill Clinton was elected, his wife vowed that every letter sent to the White House, especially from a child, would receive a response. I have no idea how well they actually executed on this, but Clinton was making a bigger point here, about the importance of connection and the sharing of stories in a political world overrun by snapshots, caricatures, fragmentation and reality distortion.\u201cThis sounds a little extreme to say, but it\u2019s like an evolutionary development, right?\u201d Clinton told me. Your communities should begin small, she said, in terms that precisely echoed those set out in her 1996 book, \u201cIt Takes a Village.\u201d You form identities in your family, she said, and then in your neighborhood and in wider communities. \u201cIt was all person to person, and you learned to deal with people, for better or worse,\u201d she said. She contrasted this with modern social-media cultures. People use the terms \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d to describe people they have never met, whose identities they think they know but may not even be real. \u201cAnd you are having emotional and intellectual experiences,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cthat are unlike anything that\u2019s ever happened in the entirety of human history.\u201dLike the culture it is playing out in, this presidential campaign has existed in a racing progression of flash images and snap judgments. Personal narratives get lost, while a candidate\u2019s can become warped through the vertigo. We might be as interconnected as ever but starved for connections, Clinton says. Trump, perhaps tellingly, is not much for hearing voters\u2019 stories. He rarely does retail stops and hates shaking hands. He tweets at all hours and constantly watches himself on television. He is in so many ways the anti-Hillary.At the end of our conversation in Toledo, I asked Clinton if she thought the resentment sowed and fissures exposed in the course of this campaign would make the United States an even harder country to govern. \u201cNo, we face some hard choices,\u201d she began, and I immediately smirked \u2014 \u201cHard Choices\u201d was the title of her 2014 memoir on her years as secretary of state, and I figured she was clicking into huckster and sound-bite mode. But then she veered in a direction that surprised me.\u201cThere are some difficult trends, which are not primarily political,\u201d Clinton told me. \u201cThey are more cultural, psychological, and we just have to deal with them.\u201d Earlier she had mentioned the 1985 book \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death,\u201d by Neil Postman, about how television has oriented politics more and more toward entertainment. She also cited the historian Christopher Lasch, the author of \u201cThe Culture of Narcissism.\u201d The authors, she said, \u201cwere trying to come to grips, before the internet, trying to understand what was happening in our society, that we are experiencing a level of alienation, disconnectedness.\u201dShe told me that her primary objective as president would be to encourage connectedness, to have actual conversations. Clinton has always preferred to build narratives from a granular level: start with details and allow a message to emerge more slowly. In college in the late 1960s, she resisted revolutionary change in favor of grinding out incremental progress inside the system. She has no patience for messianic rhetoric and hyperbolic slogans and grandiose speeches. It can make her an awkward fit in this campaign environment, harder to break through and determinedly not dazzling.But Clinton said that the key to building connectedness lies in a leader\u2019s ability to knit together a sense of common destiny from the ground up. \u201cIt requires real storytelling,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think as president, I can tell that story. It\u2019s harder as a candidate.\u201d I had often heard the exact opposite. In Obama\u2019s first term, his aides lamented that it was much easier to tell stories and drive a message in a campaign context than from the White House. As president, they said, you are constantly reacting to things and largely at the mercy of events \u2014 \u201cgoverning in prose,\u201d as opposed to \u201ccampaigning in poetry,\u201d to adapt the old line from Mario Cuomo.Clinton envisions a model more suited to her skills and comforts. It also could portend a very different style of president \u2014 without the sweeping themes of Barack Obama, the moral certainty of George W. Bush or the explanatory clarity of Bill Clinton. Can Hillary Clinton do a better job inspiring people from the White House than she has from the campaign stage? Would it become easier or harder to do without Trump around to embody everything she has ever opposed and scare the daylights out of her base? \u201cDon\u2019t blow this\u201d is what Clinton hears most often these days, she told me, or variations thereof. As it has turned out, Clinton, who began her campaign intent on breaking the last barrier \u2014 the glass ceiling \u2014 has found her most compelling rationale in her own role as a barrier, a bulwark against the impossible alternative. As I was leaving our interview, she smiled, looked me in the eyes and left me with a casual reminder. \u201cAs I\u2019ve told people,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m the last thing standing between you and the apocalypse.\u201dAn article on Oct. 16 about Hillary Clinton misspelled the given name of the author of a book that she mentioned called \u201cAmusing Ourselves to Death.\u201d He is Neil Postman, not Neal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At a Christian College, Student Journalism Gets Religious", "Date": "2016-10-10", "News": "Supported byOn CampusIf you choose to enroll at my small evangelical liberal arts college in Illinois, you\u2019ll learn quickly that the Wheaton community is very much into prayer.Sometimes, it\u2019s great. Imagine, before a midterm, your professor leads the class in a prayer that goes: \u201cGod, thank you for the opportunity we have to take this test. Help the students remember what they have studied. Help them know they are not defined by their test results.\u201dIf you can\u2019t imagine that, let me tell you: It is powerful to hear that your professor cares about your sanity right before you take a high-stakes test.But the religiosity that permeates campus life can start to ring hollow for student journalists covering the college. That\u2019s because the institutional shortcomings of a Christian college aren\u2019t divorced from questions of spirituality and religion. As an editor of the campus newspaper, I have frequently been in the uncomfortable position of covering the school\u2019s leaders when they have not seemed to live up to the evangelical values they espouse.Some stories that do not have an immediately religious angle are too quick to adopt one. And some criticism may be casual cynicism \u2014 students have a tendency to sensationalize a bit anywhere. But we are also holding our college accountable for both its spiritual and its secular values.Often, controversies are imbued with a theological weight when the college maintains they are handled according to Wheaton\u2019s doctrinal convictions, even if it is at odds with students\u2019 interpretations.Wheaton made national headlines earlier this year for placing a political science professor on administrative leave after she wrote, on Facebook, that Muslims and Christians worshiped the same God \u2014 an apparent nod to Pope Francis\u2019 statement that Muslims and Christians are children of the same God. The professor had also donned a head scarf in solidarity with Muslim women, though the school said that had nothing to do with the move to suspend her. The previous year, an openly gay chaplain\u2019s office staffer who had been hired to counsel and support L.G.B.T. students on campus left during summer break, citing pressure from alumni and donors to fire her. Though Wheaton maintained that \u201cshe was not asked, encouraged, or pressured to resign,\u201d the move was met with indignation by many Wheaton students, who thought the administration showed a lack of commitment to the campus\u2019s L.G.B.T. community.In response, the college eventually issued a statement that acknowledged, \u201cSexual abuse is clearly and fundamentally incompatible with Christian ethics.\u201dJust as a judge is expected to follow the law, and politicians are supposed to vote according to the values they were elected on, administrators at Christian colleges are held to the highest spiritual standards, especially because they urge us to live righteously from an academic pulpit.And yet if we balance our cynicism with empathy and common sense, it\u2019s easy to see that a blunder on the part of the faithful doesn\u2019t mean the faith isn\u2019t worth following. Our administrators are only human.After all, Wheaton is still a place where students are genuinely moved to evangelism, charity and ministry. These are real reminders that the campus is still a place for nurturing humble, kingdom-minded Christians.Kirkland An is a senior at Wheaton College.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Outrage Over Fish Kill in Vietnam Simmers 6 Months Later", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byIn the latest sign of this festering outrage, thousands of demonstrators swarmed a steel factory in the central province of Ha Tinh on Sunday, echoing the street protests that erupted in the country\u2019s major cities in April when photographs of piled-up fish corpses were widely shared on social media.Formosa Steel admitted responsibility and agreed to pay $500 million in damages for what many Vietnamese consider one of the worst environmental disasters in the country\u2019s modern history.But residents of coastal villages and towns, where fishing drives the economies, have continued to hold boisterous rallies against the government and the company.Demonstrators said in telephone interviews on Monday that they had attended the rally to demand that Formosa Steel close the factory and compensate them for damages. Hundreds of people from Ha Tinh have sued the company in recent weeks, many with assistance from the Catholic Church.\u201cThe government tried to hide information and protect Formosa,\u201d said Tran Viet Hoa, a fisherman who said his income had fallen more than 70 percent because of the fish kill. \u201cIf Formosa remains in Vietnam and doesn\u2019t give us our clean environment back, we will continue to protest.\u201dAnother protester, Hoang Kim, said that he had seen more than 4,000 people at the rally and that many were Catholics. He said the protesters could have easily entered the factory compound but chose not to because they wanted only to make a point, not to vandalize property.Online reports about the protest in the state-controlled news media were quickly removed by the Vietnamese authorities, activists said, but the rally was widely discussed on Facebook. Neither the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry nor senior Formosa Steel officials responded to requests for comment on Monday.The fish kill, which has primarily affected Ha Tinh and three other central provinces, was not the first environmental problem to incite public outrage in Vietnam. Last year, hundreds of people staged weekly protests in Hanoi, the capital, over a government plan to chop down 6,700 trees from the city\u2019s boulevards. The protests, coupled with indignation on social media, prompted city officials to postpone the plan indefinitely.But the fish kill has had a broader national impact than the Hanoi tree protests, analysts say, in part because it has damaged the image of the seafood industry and caused many in the country to reconsider eating what is a staple of their diet.There is no indication of any involvement by Beijing in the project, but some Vietnamese have focused on the presence of mainland Chinese workers there and have blurred the distinction between China and Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as Chinese territory.After four of the Chinese workers were killed, the Chinese government evacuated about 3,000 workers from the factory by ship.This past June, after months of refusing to say definitively what had caused the fish kill, the Vietnamese government said it had occurred after Formosa Steel leaked phenol, cyanide and iron hydroxide into the sea from its steel plant.But officials did not release any detailed scientific evidence to support their conclusion, raising questions about whether other contaminants had been detected but not publicly reported, said Nguyen Duc Hiep, an environmental scientist in Australia and a visiting researcher at Ton Duc Thang University in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.\u201cIf there are heavy metals \u2014 for example, lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic \u2014 then it will stay in the environment for a very long time, and it\u2019s very toxic because it can go up the food chain and cause a lot of damage,\u201d Professor Hiep said, adding that the three chemicals that were publicly disclosed were not necessarily toxic to fish in the long term.\u201cA lot of people suspect the reason the scientific report didn\u2019t come out is because there were a lot of heavy metals,\u201d he added.The state news media has reported that the fish kill resulted in tens of thousands of lost jobs in the affected provinces, and protesters are questioning the government\u2019s suggestions that the problem has largely been resolved.Nguyen Viet Thanh, a professor of environmental economics at Vietnam National University in Hanoi, said it was difficult to separate the effects of the toxic spill from the impact of overfishing and other problems that have long affected Vietnam\u2019s coastal waters.But he said a general lack of trust in the government, along with the factory\u2019s associations with mainland China and Taiwan, had damaged consumer confidence in the domestic seafood industry and made it difficult for many fishermen on the central coast to make a living.Conflicting accounts about the fish kill by several ministries in the weeks after the event only added to the suspicions, said Le Quang Binh, former director of the Hanoi-based Institute for Studies of Society, Economics and Environment. And because so many Vietnamese were debating the issue on social media, he added, they were able to spot inconsistencies and demand more public accountability. \u201cIn Vietnam, traditionally people avoid politics because it\u2019s sensitive,\u201d Mr. Binh said. \u201cBut now, more people understand that they cannot avoid politics because politics and policy can affect their lives.\u201dJonathan D. London, a Vietnam expert at Leiden University in the Netherlands, said the intense public interest in the fish kill presented an acute problem for Vietnam\u2019s top leaders, who took office in the spring.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to do something that no leaders have had to do in the past,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is essentially address public outrage that is being freely expressed on a daily basis.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam, and Richard C. Paddock from Manila.Advertisement"}

I pulled out a monogrammed card, placed it on the desk in front of me, and proceeded to stare at it blankly for the next two hours.Though I have been a professional writer for almost 30 years, I could think of absolutely nothing to say.Offering a written expression of condolence (from the Latin word condolere, to grieve or to suffer with someone) used to be a staple of polite society. \u201cA letter of condolence may be abrupt, badly constructed, ungrammatical \u2014 never mind,\u201d advised the 1960 edition of Emily Post. \u201cGrace of expression counts for nothing; sincerity alone is of value.\u201dBut these days, as Facebooking, Snapchatting or simply ignoring friends has become fashionable, the rules of expressing sympathy have become muddied at best, and concealed in an onslaught of emoji at worst. \u201cSorry about Mom. Sad face, sad face, crying face, heart, heart, unicorn.\u201dFor those who are inexperienced or out of practice in comforting someone in grief, what are some tips for mastering (or at least not humiliating yourself in) the lost art of condolence?She singled out two expressions that particularly grated. The first was, \u201cAt least he died doing what he loved.\u201d\u201cGetting hit and run over by a van was not his love,\u201d she said. \u201cRiding a bike was.\u201dThe other expression, \u201cAt least you weren\u2019t married for so long that you can\u2019t live without him.\u201d\u201cThank God we were only married for nine years,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cDodged a bullet there.\u201dThe condolence notes that moved him most, he said, were from strangers who shared a recollection of his father. \u201cThat was important for me because I realized his place in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, you\u2019re only thinking of your own relation to the loved one. You realize this person had impact beyond you. That was comforting.\u201d\u201cThe temptation is to bring it back to yourself, but this is not about you,\u201d Ms. Reynolds said. \u201cI heard things like, \u2018I was at my friend\u2019s house when I heard,\u2019 \u2018I couldn\u2019t sleep all night long,\u2019 \u2018I cried so hard.\u2019 Really? Because I think I\u2019m sadder.\u201d A better approach, she said, is to be neutral. \u201cYou can absolutely express your sadness and sorrow,\u201d she said, \u201cbut remove yourself from the conversation.\u201d\u201cWhen did people become so squeamish,\u201d one friend griped. \u201cAll the euphemisms make my skin crawl.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t\u2019 be afraid to use the \u2018D\u2019 words \u2014 dead, died or death. Terms such as \u2018expired,\u2019 \u2018passed on\u2019 or \u2018lost\u2019 are words of denial. \u2018Expired\u2019 can be used on a driver\u2019s license but not in person \u2014 it\u2019s not respectful.\u201d\u201cThis all makes perfect sense,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think my favorite note upon the death of my brother was from one of my closest friends. \u2018My dear Jane,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018IT STINKS.\u2019\u201dBut everyone I spoke with agreed on one point: Even heartfelt gestures like these do not replace a condolence note. A stern reminder from Ms. Fenwick still seems apt: \u201cA letter of condolence to a friend is one of the obligations of friendship.\u201dOne friend told me, \u201cI personally back off from doing anything right away and offer to take the griever out for lunch, coffee or dinner a month or so later when everyone has returned to their lives and the person is left alone to deal with the pieces.\u201dMs. Reynolds said: \u201cEven three or four months later, touching base can help. I would encourage people to send notes on the deceased\u2019s birthday, on the couple\u2019s anniversary, or some other meaningful occasion.\u201dEven with these tips, many people may still feel daunted with the pressure to come up with the right words. In that case, send someone else\u2019s words. Mr. Young recommended three poems: \u201cClearances\u201d by Seamus Heaney, \u201cFuneral Blues\u201d by W. H. Auden or \u201cInfirm\u201d by Gwendolyn Brooks.Or, do something: Take the deceased\u2019s pet for a walk, run an errand, offer to pick up a relative from the airport.Or, fall back on what loving supporters have been doing for generations: Send food, even if it\u2019s by mail. Citing his own experience, Mr. Young said: \u201cCookies are great. You\u2019ve got to eat.\u201dBruce Feiler\u2019s new book, \u201cThe First Love Story: Adam, Eve, and Us,\u201d will be published next year. Follow him on Twitter@brucefeiler.Advertisement"}
