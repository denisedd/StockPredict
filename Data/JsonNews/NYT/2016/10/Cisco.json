{"Headline": "A New Era of Internet Attacks Powered by Everyday Devices", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When surveillance cameras began popping up in the 1970s and \u201980s, they were welcomed as a crime-fighting tool, then as a way to monitor traffic congestion, factory floors and even baby cribs. Later, they were adopted for darker purposes, as authoritarian governments like China\u2019s used them to prevent challenges to power by keeping tabs on protesters and dissidents.But now those cameras \u2014 and many other devices that today are connected to the internet \u2014 have been commandeered for an entirely different purpose: as a weapon of mass disruption. The internet slowdown that swept the East Coast on Friday, when many Americans were already jittery about the possibility that hackers could interfere with election systems, offered a glimpse of a new era of vulnerabilities confronting a highly connected society.The attack on the infrastructure of the internet, which made it all but impossible at times to check Twitter feeds or headlines, was a remarkable reminder about how billions of ordinary web-connected devices \u2014 many of them highly insecure \u2014 can be turned to vicious purposes. And the threats will continue long after Election Day for a nation that increasingly keeps its data in the cloud and has oftentimes kept its head in the sand.Remnants of the attack continued to slow some sites on Saturday, though the biggest troubles had abated. Still, to the tech community, Friday\u2019s events were as inevitable as an earthquake along the San Andreas fault. A new kind of malicious software exploits a long-known vulnerability in those cameras and other cheap devices that are now joining up to what has become known as the internet of things.The advantage of putting every device on the internet is obvious. It means your refrigerator can order you milk when you are running low, and the printer on your home network can tell a retailer that you need more ink. Security cameras can alert your cellphone when someone is walking up the driveway, whether it is a delivery worker or a burglar. When Google and the Detroit automakers get their driverless cars on the road, the internet of things will become your chauffeur.But hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions, of those security cameras and other devices have been infected with a fairly simple program that guessed at their factory-set passwords \u2014 often \u201cadmin\u201d or \u201c12345\u201d or even, yes, \u201cpassword\u201d \u2014 and, once inside, turned them into an army of simple robots. Each one was commanded, at a coordinated time, to bombard a small company in Manchester, N.H., called Dyn DNS with messages that overloaded its circuits.Few have heard of Dyn, but it essentially acts as one of the internet\u2019s giant switchboards. Bring it to a halt, and the problems spread instantly. It did not take long to reduce Twitter, Reddit and Airbnb \u2014 as well as the news feeds of The New York Times \u2014 to a crawl.The culprit is unclear, and it may take days or weeks to detect it. In the end, though, the answer probably does not mean much anyway.The vulnerability the country woke up to on Friday morning can be easily exploited by a nation-state such as Russia, which the Obama administration has blamed for hacking into the Democratic National Committee and the accounts of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign officials. It could also be exploited by a criminal group, which was the focus of much of the guesswork about Friday\u2019s attack, or even by teenagers. The opportunities for copycats are endless.\u201cIf the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe attacker wins.\u201dBut in recent times, hackers have been exploring the vulnerabilities of the companies that make up the backbone of the internet \u2014 just as states recently saw examinations of the systems that hold their voter registration rolls. Attacks on the companies escalated, Mr. Schneier wrote, \u201cas if the attack were looking for the exact point of failure.\u201d Think of the mighty Maginot Line, tested again and again by the German Army in 1940, until it found the weak point and rolled into Paris.The difference with the internet is that it is not clear in the United States who is supposed to be protecting it. The network does not belong to the government \u2014 or really to anyone. Instead, every organization is responsible for defending its own little piece. Banks, retailers and social media hubs are supposed to invest in protecting their websites, but that does not help much if the connections among them are severed.The Department of Homeland Security is supposed to provide the baseline of internet defense for the United States, but it is constantly playing catch-up. In recent weeks, it deployed teams to the states to help them find and patch vulnerabilities in their voter registration systems and their networks for reporting results.The F.B.I. investigates breaches, but that takes time \u2014 and, in the meantime, people want to bank online and stream television shows. On Nov. 8, Americans will have to look up where they are supposed to vote, and, in a few cases, they will cast their votes on the internet. Yet the voting system is not considered part of the nation\u2019s \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201dThe head of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael Rogers, said recently that experts were looking at the problem the wrong way. \u201cWe are over-focused on places and things,\u201d he said in a talk at Harvard. \u201cWe need to focus on the data,\u201d and how it flows \u2014 or doesn\u2019t flow.That is where the internet of things comes in. Most of the devices have been hooked up to the web over the past few years with little concern for security. Cheap parts, some coming from Chinese suppliers, have weak or no password protections, and it is not obvious how to change those passwords.And the problem is quickly expanding: Cisco estimates that the number of such devices could reach 50 billion by 2020, from 15 billion today. Intel puts the number at roughly 200 billion devices in the same time frame. (Assuming the global population is around 7.7 billion people in 2020, that would be about six to 26 devices per person.)Security researchers have been warning of this problem for years, but that caution has largely been written off as hype or fear-mongering. Then Brian Krebs, who runs a popular site on internet security, was struck by a significant attack a few weeks ago. The company protecting him, Akamai, gave up. The malware behind the attack, called Mirai, had a built-in dictionary of common passwords and used them to hijack devices to become attackers.Chester Wisniewski, a principal computer research scientist at Sophos, a security company, said that attacks like the one on Dyn \u201cmight be the beginning of a new era of internet attacks conducted via \u2018smart\u2019 things.\u201d\u201cThere are tens of millions more insecure \u2018smart\u2019 things that could cause incredible disruptions, if harnessed,\u201d Mr. Wisniewski added in an email.It is possible, investigators say, that the attack on Dyn was conducted by a criminal group that wanted to extort the company. Or it could have been done by \u201chacktivists.\u201d Or a foreign power that wanted to remind the United States of its vulnerability. The answer may not come by Election Day, but the next wave of attacks very well could.David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Helping Immigrants, Chobani\u2019s Founder Draws Threats", "Date": "2016-10-31", "News": "Supported byIts founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, is a Turkish immigrant of Kurdish descent. He bought a defunct yogurt factory in upstate New York, added a facility in Twin Falls, Idaho, and now employs about 2,000 people making Greek yogurt.But in this contentious election season, the extreme right has a problem with Chobani: In its view, too many of those employees are refugees.Now there are calls to boycott Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya and the company have been taunted with racist epithets on Twitter and Facebook. Fringe websites have published false stories claiming Mr. Ulukaya wants \u201cto drown the United States in Muslims.\u201d And the mayor of Twin Falls has received death threats, partly as a result of his support for Chobani.Online hate speech is on the rise, reflecting the rising nationalism displayed by some supporters of Donald J. Trump, who has opposed resettling refugees in the United States.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Chobani is one more flash point in this battle between the voices of xenophobia and the voices advocating a rational immigration policy,\u201d said Cecillia Wang, director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.Chobani and Mr. Ulukaya declined to comment for this article. The Trump campaign did not reply to a request for comment.As the business grew, Mr. Ulukaya needed more help. When he learned there was a refugee resettlement center in a nearby town, he asked if any of the newcomers wanted jobs at Chobani. Mr. Ulukaya provided transportation for the new hires, and he brought in translators to assist them. He paid the refugee workers salaries above the minimum wage, as he did other workers at the factory.When Chobani opened its factory in Twin Falls, Mr. Ulukaya once again turned to a local resettlement center. The company now employs resettled refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey, among other countries.\u201cThe minute a refugee has a job, that\u2019s the minute they stop being a refugee,\u201d Mr. Ulukaya said in a talk he gave this year.\u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite,\u201d Ms. Patterson said. \u201cThese companies are looking to provide resettled refuges with the ability to live happy and productive lives.\u201d\u201cHe was quite a sensation there,\u201d said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who attended the event. \u201cHere was someone who went beyond the well-meaning chatter of Davos and was walking the walk.\u201dBut while an alliance of well-known companies was now working together on the issue, the online critics zeroed in on Chobani. Shortly after Mr. Ulukaya spoke in Davos, the far-right website WND published a story originally titled \u201cAmerican Yogurt Tycoon Vows to Choke U.S. With Muslims.\u201dThen this summer, Breitbart, the conservative news website whose former executive chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is now running the Trump campaign, began publishing a series of misleading articles about Chobani.As Breitbart began publishing its articles, the online attacks grew more intense. On Twitter and Facebook, users called for a boycott of Chobani. An image was widely shared on social media that claimed Mr. Ulukaya was \u201cgoing to drown the United States in Muslims and is importing them to Idaho 300 at a time to work in his factory.\u201d And bloggers fabricated stories claiming that Chobani was pressuring local officials \u201cto facilitate their multitude of Muslim friendly/Islamification requests.\u201dSoon the mayor of Twin Falls, Shawn Barigar, found himself at the center of a conspiracy theory.\u201cIt got woven into a narrative that it\u2019s all a cover-up, that we\u2019re all trying to keep the refugees safe so that Chobani has its work force, that I personally am getting money from the Obama administration to help Chobani hire whoever they want, that it\u2019s part of this Islamification of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dAs the online comments escalated this summer, Mr. Barigar and his wife received death threats.Breitbart said it was simply covering the news.\u201cBreitbart has been a leader in delivering important and breaking news on refugee crises throughout the Western world, which pose both national security and financial risks,\u201d Alex Marlow, editor in chief, said in a statement. \u201cMr. Ulukaya hasn\u2019t merely involved himself in this issue, he\u2019s been one of the leaders in expanding refugee resettlement in the United States. Breitbart\u2019s explosive growth is due in large measure to the mainstream media\u2019s refusal to cover vital topics like this one.\u201dBut civil rights advocates said they believed it was no mystery why Mr. Ulukaya was targeted while other chief executives had been spared. \u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s an immigrant himself,\u201d Ms. Wang of the A.C.L.U. said.Mr. Roth of Human Rights Watch attributed some of the xenophobia directed at Chobani to the election season.\u201cSome people are feeling left behind, and some people are concerned about terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Trump has given a voice to these sentiments.\u201dMr. Barigar, a Democrat, concurred. \u201cDonald Trump really fueled a sentiment about immigration that is shared by a very small part of our community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are an agricultural center. We\u2019ve depended on immigrants for a half-century or more.\u201dMr. Ulukaya appears undeterred. In September, he participated in a round-table discussion with President Obama and business leaders on how corporations could do more to help refugees.\u201cHe\u2019s the xenophobe\u2019s nightmare,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cHere\u2019s an immigrant who isn\u2019t competing for jobs, but is creating jobs big time. It runs completely counter to the far-right narrative.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about criticism of Hamdi Ulukaya, founder of the yogurt maker Chobani, because of his hiring of refugees misstated the timing of a round-table discussion Mr. Ulukaya participated in with President Obama and business leaders. It was in September, not \u201clast month.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daily Report: Salesforce Has Had Its Eye on Twitter. But Why?", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byBitsOctober in San Francisco is a special time. The fog lifts. The temperature rises. The Blue Angels buzz overhead for Fleet Week as tens of thousands of business technology types descend on the city for Salesforce.com\u2019s annual conference.This year\u2019s Salesforce shindig comes with a little extra noise: For weeks now, there have been reports that the company, which makes online software to help users manage tasks like sales and marketing, is looking to buy Twitter.It is not a stretch to say that this would be a puzzling move. Salesforce has become a staple of San Francisco. It is arguably the city\u2019s biggest tech employer, and the soon-to-be tallest building in town will carry the company\u2019s name. While it has never had big profits, the Salesforce business appears stable and growing.Just a few miles down the road from Salesforce\u2019s main office is the home of Twitter, a company with a much-better-known brand but a far less successful business. Twitter is a giant of social media, of course, used by celebrities, athletes and presidential candidates. But it is struggling with growth and its problem with trolls, a term for those who torment others online, and various sorts of hateful content have proved hard to fix.How the two companies would jell is not clear. Could Salesforce absorb all of Twitter\u2019s content to improve its artificial intelligence projects? Could Salesforce help its customers gain a better understanding of their brands by having close access to the world\u2019s Twitter feeds? And would any of that justify putting up with Twitter\u2019s problems?\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMixing different kinds of tech companies into one big outfit rarely goes well. EBay and Skype didn\u2019t work, before eBay sold Skype to a group of investors. Cisco Systems, the networking technology company, tried to get into the consumer electronics business with acquisitions like Pure Digital, but it eventually shut down the whole consumer effort. And do we even need to mention star-crossed combinations like Google and Motorola, and Microsoft and Nokia?Sometimes it\u2019s best to stick to what you\u2019re good at. Your product may not be a fixture on the celebrity circuit, but having your name on the tallest building in your hometown is a pretty high-profile thing, too.Advertisement"}
