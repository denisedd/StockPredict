{"Headline": "The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byThe most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes.Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax.Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It\u2019s called cash taxes paid \u2014 the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes.I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country\u2019s 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be.A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes.Remember: That\u2019s not just federal taxes. It\u2019s federal, state, local and foreign taxes.How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices.Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent.\u201cThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. \u201cAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.\u201dThere is another victim, too \u2014 one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can\u2019t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren\u2019t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven\u2019t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can\u2019t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon\u2019s rate.This system is cumbersome \u2014 causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance \u2014 and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors\u2019 money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they\u2019re just looking out for the rest of us.Don\u2019t be fooled.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Peek at the Secret English Farm Where Amazon Tests Its Drones", "Date": "2016-10-01", "News": "Supported byWORSTED LODGE, England \u2014 After hours of searching, I pulled onto a dirt track here in the rolling hills of Cambridgeshire and spotted a small dot whirring across the blue sky, gently swaying in the breeze as it steadily flew about 200 feet above the ground.Jackpot: It was an Amazon drone.Barely visible to the naked eye, the unmarked aircraft, about the size of a large model plane, floated across a field about 1,000 yards in the distance, the lights on its four-pronged sensors flashing brightly against the afternoon sun.In retrospect, signs of Amazon\u2019s secret tests were hidden in plain sight.Amazon is not alone, however, as other companies conduct drone trials around the world.In Britain, Amazon is working with local authorities to test several aspects of drone technology like piloting the machines beyond the line of sight of operators, a practice still outlawed in the United States.A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the English test site.With competitors aplenty, it is not surprising that Amazon wants to hide efforts from prying eyes. In Fulbourn, the nearest village to the test site, where thatch-roofed houses and a centuries-old church stand guard over the quiet main street, few people even knew that the American technology giant had moved in down the road.\u201cDrones? Here?\u201d said Linda McCarthy, who was taking her two Labrador retrievers for their morning walk as I trudged by on a public footpath with a map of the area and a pair of decades-old binoculars. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything about that.\u201dOver coffee and surrounded by wildlife maps of the area, Ms. Napier, 78, complained that Amazon had not consulted many local residents about its tests. She questioned what right the company had to fly across the British countryside, possibly without the permission of landowners, even though such authorization may not be required.Ms. Napier refuses to use Amazon\u2019s services, preferring to visit her local bookshop or smaller online British rivals.Her stance against the e-commerce giant has not gone unnoticed. A company employee called last week, Ms. Napier said, trying to persuade her that the local drone trials were safe and did not pose a risk to wildlife.As consumer and commercial drones increase in popularity, the government is taking more steps to address safety concerns and regulate the aerial vehicles.She remains skeptical.\u201cThey are testing those drones here because they can\u2019t do it in America,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever the Americans don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want it, either.\u201dNothing looked out of the ordinary. Commuters arrived at a rural office park and dog walkers basked in the late-summer sun. And as I walked miles (I ended up covering the distance of a half-marathon) along a Roman road built roughly 2,000 years ago \u2014 now a grassy public footpath \u2014 I was no closer to finding the elusive machines.My ears pricked up to every noise that broke the rural tranquillity, only to be disappointed when the buzzing turned out to be a tractor, car or just a swarm of bees flying in the midday sun. Returning to my car after exhausting almost all the public footpaths, I had a sinking suspicion I was on a wild-goose chase.Only one route remained.Less than 300 yards down the grassy track on the edge of a farm, a security guard with a walkie-talkie popped up from behind a hedgerow and pointed to a sign declaring: \u201cPrivate property. No trespassing.\u201dWhen he repeatedly told me this was indeed private property and that he had called the farmer to evict me, I knew I was onto something. As I circled the property with Andrew Testa, a photographer for The New York Times, my suspicions only grew.At the entrance to the farm \u2014 despite Amazon\u2019s presence, farm work was still underway \u2014 a security guard in a fluorescent vest was checking the identifications of people arriving at the site. In the distance, hay bales were piled at least 20 feet high (presumably to test the drones\u2019 ability to navigate between buildings). A large, metallic blue platform in a far-off field provided a panoramic view of the surrounding farmland.Then we spotted it.Actually spying the drone \u2014 best seen through my colleague\u2019s long camera lens \u2014 was an anticlimax. Instead of performing a series of aerial acrobatics, the device merely bobbed along for about 20 minutes, slowly working its way from one side of the field to the other with barely a waver or shudder.The stakes for Amazon\u2019s drone test are unquestionably high. The next day, a police officer questioned my colleague as he again photographed the area, though the officer denied that Amazon had tipped him off.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Did Walmart Get Cleaner Stores and Higher Sales? It Paid Its People More", "Date": "2016-10-15", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBENTONVILLE, Ark. \u2014 A couple of years ago, Walmart, which once built its entire branding around a big yellow smiley face, was creating more than its share of frowns.Shoppers were fed up. They complained of dirty bathrooms, empty shelves, endless checkout lines and impossible-to-find employees. Only 16 percent of stores were meeting the company\u2019s customer service goals.To fix it, executives came up with what, for Walmart, counted as a revolutionary idea. This is, after all, a company famous for squeezing pennies so successfully that labor groups accuse it of depressing wages across the American economy. As an efficient, multinational selling machine, the company had a reputation for treating employee pay as a cost to be minimized.But in early 2015, Walmart announced it would actually pay its workers more.That set in motion the biggest test imaginable of a basic argument that has consumed ivory-tower economists, union-hall organizers and corporate executives for years on end: What if paying workers more, training them better and offering better opportunities for advancement can actually make a company more profitable, rather than less?It is an idea that flies in the face of the prevailing ethos on Wall Street and in many executive suites the last few decades. But there is sound economic theory behind the idea. \u201cEfficiency wages\u201d is the term that economists \u2014 who excel at giving complex names to obvious ideas \u2014 use for the notion that employers who pay workers more than the going rate will get more loyal, harder-working, more productive employees in return.Walmart\u2019s experiment holds some surprising lessons for the American economy as a whole. Productivity gains have been slow for years; could fatter paychecks reverse that? Demand for goods and services has remained stubbornly low ever since the 2008 economic crisis. If companies paid people more, would it bring out more shoppers \u2014 benefiting workers and shareholders alike?Deep in a warren of windowless offices here, executives in early 2015 sketched out a plan to spend more money on increased wages and training, and offer more predictable scheduling. They refer to this plan as \u201cthe investments.\u201dThe results are promising. By early 2016, the proportion of stores hitting their targeted customer-service ratings had rebounded to 75 percent. Sales are rising again.That said, the immediate impact on earnings and the company\u2019s stock price have been less rosy.The question for Walmart is ultimately whether that short-run hit makes the company a stronger competitor in the long run. Will the investments turn out to be the beginning of a change in how Walmart and other giant companies think about their workers, or just a one-off experiment to be reversed when the next recession rolls around?The future health of the United States economy, and the well-being of its workers, may well depend on the answer.\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t get it all right,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in the video. \u201cSometimes we make policy changes or other decisions and they don\u2019t result in what we thought they were going to. And when we don\u2019t get it right, we adjust.\u201dWhat most store employees probably didn\u2019t know was that Mr. McMillon and his executive team, who had been promoted into their jobs a year earlier, were under extraordinary pressure from investors. They needed to reverse a slide in business and fight off threats in all directions \u2014 dollar discounters on the low end, Amazon online, direct competitors like Target and countless rivals specializing in one slice of Walmart\u2019s business, from grocery chains to home-improvement warehouses.People were shopping more \u2014 at Walmart\u2019s rivals.The company offers its millions of shoppers a simple way to make their dissatisfaction known. On the back of sales receipts is a message, \u201cTell us about your visit today,\u201d along with instructions to log on to a website and answer questions about the store: Was it clean? Were they able to get what they came for quickly? Were employees friendly?In early 2015, the answers that poured into Walmart\u2019s global headquarters were, in a word, awful. The people paid to analyze the company tended to agree, too. A report by analysts at Wolfe Research in 2014 included photographs from a visit to Walmart of a sad-looking display of nearly empty bins of oranges and lemons and disorganized shelves of crackers.The company had been busy raising profits by cutting labor costs. The number of employees in the United States fell by 7 percent from early 2008 to early 2013, for example, a span in which the square footage of stores rose 13 percent.Some of that reflects technological advances, like self-checkout kiosks. But when Mr. McMillon and a new team came in to reverse the slide starting in early 2014, they diagnosed the problem as having taken the cost-cutting logic too far.From store managers nationwide, they heard that years of cost-cutting meant Walmart had become viewed as a last-ditch option for employment \u2014 not the place that ambitious people might want to work. They were under such pressure to keep labor costs low that the employees they hired showed little loyalty or career-building devotion to their jobs.\u201cWe realized quickly that wages are only one part of it, that what also matters are the schedules we give people, the hours that they work, the training we give them, the opportunities you provide them,\u201d said Judith McKenna, who became chief operating officer in late 2014, in a recent interview. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to do is not just fix one part, but get all of these things moving together.\u201dThat is how Walmart decided to build 200 training centers to offer a clearer path for hourly employees who want to get on the higher-paying management track. And it said it would raise its hourly pay to a minimum of $10 for workers who complete a training course and raise department manager pay to $15 an hour, from $12. It said it would offer more flexible and predictable schedules to hourly workers.The news from Bentonville made headlines worldwide. The federal minimum wage had been $7.25 since 2009, and the labor market had awarded meager pay gains for people at the lower end of the spectrum for decade, facts that helped increase Walmart\u2019s bottom line. Now, the United States\u2019 largest private employer \u2014 Walmart has about 2.3 million workers around the world \u2014 was signaling it was about to gingerly try a different approach, putting $2.7 billion where its mouth was.Walmart says its average pay for a full-time nonmanagerial employee is now $13.69 an hour, up 16 percent since early 2014. In the same span, consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent.On a Thursday morning in late summer, at a Walmart Supercenter No. 359 in Fayetteville, Walmart trainees followed instructors around to learn what this particular store was doing right, and wrong, on this particular day. Teresa Rasberry praised a display of University of Arkansas tailgating equipment \u2014 coolers, grills and folding chairs \u2014 complemented by a fluttering effect created by putting electric fans beneath overhead banners for Razorbacks football.\u201cSee how it pulls the eye?\u201d she asked the trainees. \u201cStep back and think about how the customer sees it.\u201dNot so good was an end display of Mr. Clean, in which the various colors of the cleaning solution were jumbled together. Lining up the bottles so they make vertical stripes of color pulls more buyers in, she said.\u201cIt may sound silly,\u201d Ms. Rasberry said, \u201cbut it works! I\u2019ve tested it myself!\u201dBack in a classroom, Walmart department managers discussed why a $15.86 bottle of Clairol hair coloring might be a bad fit for a store located in a place with an $80,000 average income. Women in that income bracket are more likely to get their hair colored at a salon, an instructor, Amanda Forslund, explained.This is one of the first of Walmart\u2019s planned 200 training academies. New department managers will come in for two weeks of training covering general retail principles (customer service, inventory management) as well as specialized training for their specific area (the bakery or electronics, for example).Walmart\u2019s pay increases got most of the attention. But the new training and prospect of better career paths for hourly staff members could be more significant in the long term.It\u2019s not that the retail industry doesn\u2019t offer potential paths to good incomes. Starting pay for an assistant store manager at Walmart is $48,500, and the manager of one of its large stores can make comfortably above $100,000.The problem \u2014 described by Walmart managers and people outside the company who study labor markets \u2014 is that there is no clear path for an entry-level worker to get there. Much training is impromptu, and chains have tended to view their hourly workers as interchangeable cogs rather than resources worth investing in.That reputation has been particularly strong at Walmart.\u201cI didn\u2019t used to think this would be something I would want to do, to work at Walmart,\u201d said Garrett Watts, a 22-year-old newly promoted customer service manager at a store in Fayetteville. \u201cThere\u2019s a stigma with it. It used to be, if you worked at a Walmart, it was the equivalent of a fast-food restaurant.\u201dHe had gone to college for two years, suspended his education and was working as a desk clerk at a hotel when he switched to Walmart this year, lured not by the starting wage but by what he had heard from a friend about the potential to rise within a giant company. He was soon promoted to department manager and runs customer services for the store. He was hired at $9 an hour and now makes $13.\u201cI wanted something that wasn\u2019t a stopgap, but could be a real career,\u201d Mr. Watts said. He is starting to set his sights on one of those $48,000-a-year assistant store manager jobs.Walmart\u2019s announcement of what it refers to as \u201cthe investments,\u201d made during the all-staff videoconference in 2015, became something of a Rorschach test. To macroeconomists, it suggested that a falling unemployment rate was finally creating the response that theory suggests it should: employers raising wages to attract the workers they need.To labor activists, it was a sign that political campaigns to raise the minimum wage were paying off. To Wall Street analysts, it was the company owning up to the weaknesses long apparent in customer surveys and sales numbers.And in the company\u2019s own framing, it was about doing the right thing. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that one of the highest priorities today must be an investment in you, our associates,\u201d Mr. McMillon said in the video.It was all of these things, Ms. McKenna acknowledged.The improving economy made it harder for Walmart to get good workers without paying more. Political momentum toward a higher minimum wage meant that entry-level pay would soon be rising in many places anyway. And executives really had concluded that customer service woes and slumping sales were because of underinvestment in employees.To some critics, though, it still amounted to a half-measure, and one framed to maximize public attention. \u201cIn our minds this is certainly a step in the right direction, but it\u2019s typical Walmart in that it\u2019s minimal and there\u2019s a lot of spin on top of what\u2019s really happening,\u201d said Daniel Schlademan, a founder of the labor group Our Walmart, which wants the company to have a starting wage of $15 an hour.In particular, new hires typically do not receive the $10 minimum wage until they finish a training program that is supposed to take six months but frequently stretches longer. And a promised increase in the predictability and flexibility of hourly workers\u2019 schedules is being tested in only 650 smaller \u201cneighborhood market\u201d stores. It has not been rolled out to the full 4,500 Walmarts.\u201cThe economic reality is that they put a great deal of pressure on managers to keep labor costs and hours down,\u201d Mr. Schlademan said.And the actions fall well short of what Zeynep Ton, an associate professor of operations at the Sloan School of Business at M.I.T., calls a \u201cgood jobs strategy,\u201d in which a retailer builds its entire operating philosophy around better-compensated staff members who are empowered to make decisions. Companies like Costco and the grocer Wegman\u2019s have a base pay closer to that of what the retail activists seek and are successful by many measures. (Costco pays entry-level workers at least $13 an hour, with hourly pay reaching up to $22.50).But while Walmart\u2019s changes aren\u2019t as extensive as advocates would prefer, the company has shifted, in relative terms, up the industry\u2019s pay scale. In early 2014, Walmart\u2019s self-reported average full-time pay was 3.7 percent higher than the average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial workers at general merchandise stores calculated by the Labor Department. Now, it is 13.7 percent higher.\u201cIt\u2019s about being competitive in the market and making sure the talent pool of applicants was the right talent pool,\u201d Ms. McKenna said.That sounds an awful lot like a reference to the concept of an \u201cefficiency wage.\u201dAn employee making more than the market rate, after all, is likely to work harder and show greater loyalty. Workers who see opportunities to get promoted have an incentive not to mess up, compared with people who feel they are in a dead-end job. A person has more incentive to work hard, even when the boss isn\u2019t watching, when the job pays better than what you could make down the street.What is interesting about this is that, if you look at what\u2019s ailing the broader United States economy, it looks a lot like what you would expect if employers were, en masse, failing to understand the possibility of efficiency wages.Employers have succeeded at holding down labor costs. The \u201clabor share\u201d of national income \u2014 the portion of the national economic pie that goes to workers\u2019 pay, as opposed to corporate profits and elsewhere \u2014 has fallen. And average pay for nonmanagerial workers has grown more slowly than the overall economy.This has coincided with disappointing results for the economy. Worker productivity has been rising slowly for the last decade, and prime working-age Americans are staying out of the work force in droves. This implies that plenty of people don\u2019t see jobs out there that offer sufficient pay or opportunity to make the jobs worth doing.Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people.Just maybe, in other words, employers across the country are pushing down labor costs like Walmart, circa 2014 \u2014 and this is one of the major culprits behind disappointing economic results since the start of the 21st century.\u201cThe management philosophy that became popular in the 1980s that led companies to cut pay for low-wage workers, fight unions and contract out work may have been profitable for the companies that practiced it in the short run,\u201d said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and leading scholar of labor markets. \u201cBut in the long run it has raised inequality, reduced aggregate consumption and hurt overall business profitability.\u201dIf you buy that theory \u2014 and, to be clear, it is more theory than settled fact \u2014 it means that the results of the Walmart experiment matter a great deal. That implies that if large companies were to spend more to pay and train their workers, it could create gains for the economy as a whole. And it would ultimately be better for those same businesses.So, 19 months in, what is Walmart finding?Those customer surveys that were so terrible at the start of 2015 have improved, with \u201cclean, fast, friendly scores\u201d rising for 90 consecutive weeks. Surveys by outside groups, like the investment banker Cowen & Company, point to more satisfied customers as well.The profit landscape is less sunny. Operating income for Walmart\u2019s United States stores was down 6 percent in the most recent quarter, reflecting higher labor costs and other new investments. The company\u2019s stock has underperformed the overall United States stock market and an index of major retailers since the program was announced, suggesting investors are not convinced that these investments will pay a lucrative return anytime soon.But at the store level, managers describe a big shift in the kind of workers they can bring in by offering $10 an hour with a solid path to $15 an hour. \u201cWe\u2019re attracting a different type of associate,\u201d said Tina Budnaitis, the manager of Walmart No. 5260 in Rogers. \u201cWe get more people coming in who want a career instead of a job.\u201dSenior executives speak in the language you might expect from a manager worried about paying an efficiency wage. \u201cOur associates are an asset,\u201d said Ms. McKenna, the chief operating officer. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to have the very lowest cost of an asset. You try to have the right asset. So rather than thinking about the lowest cost, the question is how do you get the best productivity.\u201dThe question for Walmart, and perhaps the economy as a whole, is whether these changes turn out to be one-off, or part of a shifting philosophy of how work and compensation should work in a 21st-century megacorporation.\u201cOut of the gate, they\u2019ve seen some improvement, but I think that\u2019s because they were doing Retail 101 so poorly,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones & Company. \u201cThe better question is what happens next year and the following year.

{"Headline": "Battle of the Sexes", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byCritic's NotebookAs more and more labels add men\u2019s wear to their women\u2019s wear shows, who benefits? Two critics debate the question.DEAR GUY:I understand the rationale \u2014 it is the same designer, telling the same story, whether for men or women; it is cheaper for brands and those who have to see them \u2014 and though I thought when I first heard about it that it was a logical idea. But after experiencing it, much to my surprise, I am not so sure.Yours with a big question mark, VanessaDEAR VANESSA:Fashion, as usual, follows culture. Designers are doing on runways what consumers have been doing for years: ignoring the creakier traditional restraints of sexual identity (Alice hair bands, anyone? Boyfriend jeans?) to shop across the aisle.And it\u2019s certainly a welcome corrective to the mentality of \u201clocker room talk\u201d and other remnants of an unlamented dinosaur cultural past.Fabrice Gili, creative director of the high-end hairdressing salon Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fekkai, recently pointed out to me that the fastest growing and most profitable segment of his business is men. And Fekkai, let\u2019s remember, was where Upper East Side ladies went for their highlights. Now it\u2019s guys getting a $125 trim.I think of the blend as conceptually good for everyone, a natural way of underscoring the pleasures and advantages of migrating at will along the Kinsey scale. Still, let\u2019s not forget that a bellwether like Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent showed men\u2019s and women\u2019s together almost from the start and that when the business blew up, almost the first thing he did was build a glossy new guys-only store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif.My best, GuyDEAR G:But this isn\u2019t necessarily about gender-neutral clothes, or men\u2019s clothes worn by women and women\u2019s clothes by men, although that is what was going on at Saint Laurent.At Bottega and Armani, certainly, it was classic men\u2019s wear mixed in with classic women\u2019s wear \u2014 two shows in one, if you will. At Marras, it was men\u2019s wear done in the same fabrics as women\u2019s wear, but not the same cuts or silhouettes.Which makes me wonder if mixing the two lines won\u2019t mean that men\u2019s wear starts to get overlooked. I think it\u2019s a risk.Biting my nails, V.DEAR V:For me, it\u2019s not so much about pussy bows for guys or so-called gender-neutral styles as it is about gender-agnostic consumption. The designers are just reflecting back to us their version of an Amazon search.People don\u2019t color within the lines on the web, and fashion is bound to reflect that. I\u2019ve said before that I\u2019m not so worried about men\u2019s wear being swallowed up amid the leg o\u2019 mutton sleeves and froufrou.Though you\u2019re right that men\u2019s wear is glacial in pace, it\u2019s still experiencing faster growth across the board than ever. And what global brands like Armani, in particular, are addressing is this shift in shopping habits.Historically, women bought for men, with the exception of suits. The suit, for the moment, is effectively kaput. So it\u2019s perfectly sensible to mix up the elevated sportswear Tomas Maier designs without regard for gender and to expect consumers of either (or neither) sex to tune in. (Anyway, Mr. Maier and Giorgio Armani have been softening \u2014 feminizing, if you like \u2014 men\u2019s wear all along.)All my best, G.GUY:Take off those rose-colored glasses! Pitti is a men\u2019s wear event, which kind of proves my point: It\u2019s huge in part because it\u2019s a pure play; as you say, it allows guys to geek out. It highlights what is special or desirable about men\u2019s wear, as opposed to hiding it under a much showier women\u2019s wear bushel.But maybe, as you say, that\u2019s critic\u2019s myopia, and consumers are fully capable of taking what they want from where they want, categories be damned, and we should just all be happy about the more efficient use of our time.Though when I went through a lot of the coverage of Burberry, Bottega, et al., to test my theory, it seemed as if readers could be forgiven for not realizing there was men\u2019s wear on those runways at all, so little mention did it get (and yes, mea culpa).But maybe that\u2019s what designers want? Just to make the clothes and have content for a marketing platform and forget the reviews? Could it be?Hmmm, V.VANESSA:Who knows what designers want? I doubt whether they do. That\u2019s why critics remain useful, not as the Pauline Kael-style dictators of yesteryear but as explainers. And I\u2019ve said it a million times: Fashion is a storytelling business.Beyond that, my own sense is that both the blended shows and separate-show seasons can coexist, the scale and mechanics of the two spheres being too unalike for one mode to prevail. It\u2019s odd, though, that a number of designers toss women\u2019s wear into the mix during their men\u2019s shows (Dsquared comes to mind), and when they do, the eye just edits out the stuff for women.Maybe it\u2019s practicality and maybe it\u2019s laziness. It\u2019s strenuous even for those of us who are up on our Judith Butler to have to remind ourselves constantly that gender is performance.Cheers, G.G:So your crystal-ball prediction is some sort of hybrid thing, where some brands combine and others stick to the schedule as is? And we all see the story we want to see on the runway? In that situation, you and I could go to the same show and come away with two entirely different conclusions.Is that your last word?VV:Well, I\u2019m not about to saw off the branch I\u2019m sitting on, so \u2026 that\u2019s a yes.All bestG:I admire your perspicacity. This treetop feels awfully fragile to me.VvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Comes Up Short on Profits, Focusing on Warehouses and Movies", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported bySo after months of exuberance that pushed Amazon\u2019s shares to new highs, investors took a break, sending the company\u2019s stock down more than 5 percent after it reported its latest financial results.Amazon had warned investors not to get too comfortable with its record run of profits, promising last quarter that big increases on warehouse spending would come in the second half of the year so it can handle what it expects to be a crush of holiday orders. It is also cranking out more original video productions like \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d and \u201cTransparent,\u201d to turn its Prime membership service into an attractive alternative to Netflix.Analysts took those warnings with a Himalayan-size heap of salt. They had heard such talk from the company before about increasing investments, only to see Amazon later deliver bigger-than-expected profits. Surely, Amazon was just sandbagging again.\u201cThey said something similar about last quarter and crushed it,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cI think people expected they would do that again.\u201dInstead, Amazon reported a profit of $252 million, or 52 cents a share, for the third quarter, well below the 78 cents a share average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.That figure still represented more than three times the $79 million profit it reported in the same period last year, and Amazon\u2019s corresponding operating income of $575 million was at the high end of the range that the company had previously forecast.Revenue grew 29 percent to $32.7 billion, slightly above what analysts forecast at $32.69 billion.Amazon\u2019s biggest quarter is now coming up \u2014 the end-of-year season when shoppers go wild for presents and have increasingly turned to the e-commerce giant to buy them.But Amazon\u2019s forecast for the quarter was worrisome to some analysts. The company told them to expect as much as $1.25 billion in operating income for the fourth quarter and as little as nothing, a remarkably wide range. Amazon projected that revenue would increase in a range of 17 to 27 percent over a year ago.\u201cI think the big concern here is Amazon moving into another big, deep investment cycle,\u201d said Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities.Asked about the gap between Amazon\u2019s results in the third quarter and expectations, Brian Olsavsky, the chief financial officer of Amazon, said, in effect, we told you so.In a conference call, he said Amazon opened 18 fulfillment centers during the quarter, triple the normal rate.

{"Headline": "AT&T and Time Warner Seek to Mollify Deal\u2019s Critics", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byAT&T\u2019s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner has no shortage of skeptics.First, there are the analysts.\u201cVertically challenged,\u201d was the headline from a research note by Craig Moffett, a play on the term \u201cvertical integration,\u201d where a company combines with its customer, rather than competitor.Morgan Stanley analysts called the deal a \u201cbold step,\u201d wondering whether the companies were \u201cswinging for the fences.\u201d Nomura said the deal was \u201cpuzzling.\u201dThen, there are the investors.At midday on Monday, shares of Time Warner, the recipient of by all accounts a rich offer from AT&T, were down more than 2 percent, nearly 20 percent off the deal\u2019s price tag. AT&T\u2019s shareholders did not seem too thrilled either \u2014 its shares were off nearly 2 percent.The question for the market is whether it makes sense for a cable and wireless provider to spend all of that money to acquire the home of HBO, CNN and Warner Bros.On a conference call with analysts on Monday, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, and his Time Warner counterpart, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, sought to address some of their biggest criticisms:During the hourlong call, a form of the word \u201cinnovate\u201d was used 32 times. The two chief executives believe combining their companies will help them innovate around advertising, the shows and movies people watch and where they watch them (hint: on their cellphones).Innovation, of course is not a strategy. It is something that every top executive is focused on, with or without a deal.There is one aspect to this deal that could help the two companies foster such innovation: data. AT&T has access to 133 million mobile subscribers, as well as 25 million for video. Owning the content that its users are watching will give the company better insight on how to focus on their customers through both programming and advertising, the executives argued.One analyst asked why the combination of cable and content made sense now, despite Mr. Bewkes\u2019s decision to spin off Time Warner Cable in 2009. Mr. Bewkes responded by saying, \u201cThe world has changed,\u201d citing new competition from companies like Netflix, Google, Facebook and Amazon.Over the weekend, politicians from across the political spectrum came out against the deal. Both Democrats and Republicans argued that too much consolidation between telecommunications and media could only be bad for consumers.On the call, Mr. Bewkes argued that consumers would not feel the effect of this transaction, that the cost would be \u201cborne by advertisers and consumers get a break.\u201dWhen asked about what gave him comfort on the regulatory approval process, Mr. Stephenson joked, \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but once Time Warner closes, I\u2019ll play one on TV.\u201dHis non-lawyerly take, however, focused on the fact that the companies are proposing a vertical merger. Most of the pushback lately from the Justice Department has been on companies that were taking out competitors. Because Time Warner supplies programming for AT&T, their deal would not get that same type of scrutiny.\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not sure I know of a situation where vertical integration has been blocked by the government in our two sectors,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Vertical integration may help the two companies on the regulatory front, but it does not get them far from a cost-savings standpoint. The companies pegged so-called synergies at $1 billion in annual run rate, within three years of the deal closing.That figure is small for a deal this size because there is little duplication by which to cut costs. The customer service representatives at AT&T cannot also anchor the news on CNN, for example.Analysts have been dubious of AT&T\u2019s ability to integrate another huge acquisition after closing on a $48.5 billion takeover of DirecTV last year. Why do another large acquisition now, they asked? Mr. Stephenson said that AT&T was ahead of schedule in achieving cost synergies from the DirecTV deal and that \u201cthe convergence of media and distribution is moving fast.\u201d\u201cWe want to be at the front of it. We don\u2019t want to be chasing it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Others mingled around a new foosball table, playfully arguing over the prospective teams.Fearful of cheap Chinese competition and wary of a profitable complacency that has felled giants in the past \u2014 Eastman Kodak, destroyed by digital cameras, is often cited \u2014 the company is developing new crystals that double as solar panels or that change color when tapped with a finger. It has revamped how it sells online, invested millions in high-tech machinery and signed partnerships with smartwatch makers like Misfit.Swarovski has also hired Silicon Valley advisers and sent executives to the West Coast of the United States to meet venture capitalists and others, trying to add a little tech pizazz to a business whose roots date to the days of buggy whips.\u201cTech companies can disrupt whole industries within a couple of months,\u201d said Markus Langes-Swarovski, 42, chairman of the board of the Swarovski Group and a great-great-grandson of the founder. \u201cWe need to do that to ourselves before it happens to us.\u201dTo many, Swarovski\u2019s tech dream seems an odd strategy for a 121-year-old crystal maker better known for its (sometimes ostentatious) figurines, designer jewelry and even a $2,000 Cinderella slipper. It also raises questions about whether it is an industry suited to embracing the hoodies, start-up incubators and other trappings that have given Silicon Valley global cachet.\u201cBig legacy companies want to reinvent themselves for the digital era,\u201d said Julian Birkinshaw, a professor entrepreneurship at the London Business School. \u201cFew, if any, have been successful at it.\u201d8 PhotosWithin Swarovski, which is owned by members of the extended Swarovski family, the revamp was not a slam dunk. Family shareholders were concerned that Mr. Langes-Swarovski and his executives were merely jumping on the Silicon Valley bandwagon, forgoing the company\u2019s heritage for the chance to mingle with West Coast technorati. Some were skeptical that the company, which employs more than 31,000 people and owns retail stores from New York to New Delhi, would benefit from shifting toward sensors and start-ups rather than focusing on making shiny crystal.\u201cIt was hard to get the family on board,\u201d said Mr. Langes-Swarovski, who in 2002 at the age of 28 took over the company from his father. \u201cAnd of course, it still is.\u201dThe crystal maker, which has avidly guarded its trade secrets for over a century, rarely gives a glimpse into its inner workings. The company\u2019s manufacturing center is usually off-limits even to most Swarovski employees. One enters via a high-security revolving door that would not seem out of place in a spy movie.More industrially functional than catwalk chic, the campus was dotted with people driving forklifts, shuttling boxes of crystal and other raw materials between buildings. At one new production line, two robotic arms, painted bright yellow, spun in a midair ballet as workers checked the gauges while Kings of Leon, the rock group, played on the radio.In another building, several 3-D printers whirred away, producing spare parts and prototypes of jewelry designs. Engineers kept watch over machines that were originally built for the semiconductor industry but have since been modified to pump out minuscule crystals, some barely visible when held on a fingertip. Only a disused, shabby warehouse \u2014 one of the company\u2019s original buildings \u2014 harked to the company\u2019s past.Crystal is almost identical to glass, but it includes another ingredient \u2014 lead \u2014 that adds extra sparkle. It is notoriously difficult to shape into small fragments. Mr. Swarovski\u2019s machines set his crystal apart because of their ability to create tiny, uniform cuts, which give off more light than rivals\u2019 products.\u201cOne hundred and twenty years ago, we were the Google of the age,\u201d said Taro Nordheider, a Swarovski executive vice president who was hired five years ago from McKinsey & Company to help with the company\u2019s transformation.Over the decades, the company shifted with the times. After World War I, Swarovski branched out into precision drilling tools. After World War II, it added binoculars and telescopes. And when sales to fashion designers and other companies flagged in the 1980s, the company opened retail stores to sell jewelry and figurines directly to shoppers worldwide.Eventually, Swarovski became complacent, Mr. Nordheider said. It was unprepared in 2008 when the global financial crisis hit and the company was suddenly confronted with a wave of Chinese competitors selling high-end crystals at a fraction of the usual cost, thanks mostly to cheap labor. By 2010, Swarovski had laid off almost 2,000 workers and begun rethinking how to operate in a world where price, not pedigree, was the name of the game.In 2012, Mr. Langes-Swarovski started outlining a new strategy to the company\u2019s 79 family shareholders. At dinners, board meetings and social gatherings, he told them that despite Swarovski\u2019s decades of success, things had to change. The company, Mr. Langes-Swarovski said, needed to channel his great-great-grandfather\u2019s engineering roots to cut costs, respond faster to new ideas and, most important, embrace technology that had become part of people\u2019s everyday lives.Resistance came mostly from older family shareholders who had benefited from profits produced by the company\u2019s traditional crystal business, according to several family shareholders and executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were private. Yet because Mr. Langes-Swarovski\u2019s generation now dominated daily management of the company, and his father, Gernot Langes-Swarovski, remained the largest shareholder, he was able to push ahead.The revamp began with small steps. Starting in 2013, a team of engineers spent a combined 50,000 hours and almost $5 million to build a production line that made smaller batches of crystals, at a cheaper price, to compete better with Chinese rivals and to meet demand for smaller orders.Swarovski\u2019s tech development, marketing and sales teams also were given more independence to try new ideas. In 2014, one engineer \u2014 part of an 80-person research-and-development team in Wattens \u2014 stumbled onto a way to turn a Swarovski crystal into a solar cell. After some tweaks, including making the crystal round and thinner to meet jewelry standards, Swarovski signed a deal with Misfit, which sells smartwatches and other wearable gadgets, to build the world\u2019s first solar-powered fitness tracker. It went on sale in early 2015.\u201cWe created a solar cell that isn\u2019t boring,\u201d said Michael Hutter, head of the applied research group behind the technology. \u201cWe want to be the missing link between the tech and fashion industries.\u201dThe new devices are a tech-tinged extension of Swarovski\u2019s longstanding marketing strategy for the fashion world. In the past, it has worked with design houses such as Christian Dior to affix crystals to dresses and jewelry. In the company\u2019s corporate archive, Swarovski earrings worn by Marilyn Monroe in \u201cGentlemen Prefer Blondes\u201d sit side by side with an oversize necklace once worn by Beyonc\u00e9.The building, basically an all-singing, all-dancing amusement park to sell Swarovski merchandise to visitors, included avant-garde artworks and an outdoor lake with artificial clouds dotted with crystals floating above on almost invisible wires.\u201cWhen I heard about their visit, I was a bit confused,\u201d said Brian Hoffman at StartX, a Silicon Valley tech incubator linked to Stanford University, who met with Swarovski\u2019s team for about an hour. \u201cTheir industry is not one you typically associate with technology or innovation.\u201d Swarovski\u2019s executives peppered him with questions, he said, about how best to work with outside developers and to adapt to the latest online shopping habits.In part, that new endeavor competes with the likes of Etsy, where a community of fashion-conscious buyers already can find an almost limitless supply of custom jewelry. But Swarovski hopes to use its global brand, and significant financial resources, to entice high-end designers and retailers (and high-end shoppers) onto its own site.\u201cNow we think about online platforms, not just products,\u201d said Roland Harste, who runs Swarovski\u2019s e-commerce division. The online service, which began in May, currently receives fewer than a million visitors a month, a relatively small number compared with online giants like Amazon.Design houses including Oscar de la Renta already use the site, though people are still sent to third-party websites to complete transactions. Now, Swarovski takes a cut of each purchase, but it plans to move all digital sales onto its own platform soon.Another lesson from the Silicon Valley trip, which was arranged by a former senior executive at Apple who is now advising Swarovski, was to focus more on partnerships that could give the company access to new tech ideas and trends. Such collaborations were not previously part of the company\u2019s DNA.So far, few partnerships have resulted. The Fraunhofer Society, a German foundation that has turned scientific projects into business ideas, opened a three-person office here in September, but much of the refurbished factory remains empty.He decided to set up shop here, he said, partly because of his local roots \u2014 but also because the rent is so much more affordable than in the city. \u201cWhen we started out, it would have been impossible to do it from here,\u201d he said.In February, his start-up received more than $200,000 in investments from a separate Swarovski family fund. \u201cPeople now recognize that something is going on here with technology,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Two \u201970s Movies on Video Enter the Valley of the Cult Heroines", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byOn DVDIn late 1970, Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s druggy, mystical western \u201cEl Topo\u201d opened at the Elgin Theater in New York with no more fanfare than a small notice in The Village Voice. The film was to be screened only at midnight, according to the ad, because it was \u201ctoo heavy to be shown any other way.\u201dA new outr\u00e9 cinema was born: The violent \u201cEl Topo\u201d established the template for subsequent midnight blockbusters, like John Waters\u2019s shockingly crude \u201cPink Flamingos\u201d (1972) and David Lynch\u2019s fantastically weird \u201cEraserhead\u201d (1977). Had the Japanese animator Eiichi Yamamoto\u2019s psychedelic, sexually explicit \u201cBelladonna of Sadness\u201d (1973) opened at midnight, it, too, might have entered the cult pantheon.As it was, Mr. Yamamoto\u2019s film was a commercial failure in Japan and, despite a screening at the 1973 Berlin International Film Festival, took more than 40 years to arrive in the United States; last spring, newly restored, it enjoyed brief theatrical runs in New York and Los Angeles and is now out on Blu-ray from Cineliciouspics. It\u2019s also available for streaming from Amazon Video.A product of countercultural magical thinking, \u201cBelladonna\u201d was inspired by \u201cLa Sorci\u00e8re,\u201d the 19th-century French historian Jules Michelet\u2019s examination of the medieval witch mania as a rebellion, led mainly by women, against the feudal order and the Catholic Church. The movie is also something of a revolt \u2014 against constraints of good taste as well as conventional animation.With its flat patterns, sinuous lines and entwining forms, \u201cBelladonna\u201d refracts traditional Japanese graphic art through the prism of the Art Nouveau or Vienna Secession, two movements that were in some ways inspired by Japanese woodcuts. It also echoes the candy-colored psychedelia of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d (1968), the prurient French science-fiction comic book Barbarella and the late-1960s poster art associated with the San Francisco rock scene. \u201cBelladonna\u201d is eye-popping and ear-catching. The score, by the jazz pianist Masahiko Sato, might be characterized as \u201cacid twang\u201d in its evocation of Pink Floyd and Ennio Morricone.The protagonist, Jeanne, an initially shy, sad-eyed damsel who might have been the subject of a song by a hippie troubadour, is raped on her wedding day by the demonic local lord \u2014 and then again, repeatedly, by Satan himself. (The Devil speaks with the deep, seductive voice of Tatsuya Nakadai, an actor best known in the West for his samurai roles, and appears in various guises, including that of a disembodied penis.)Part abused victim, part avenging riot grrrl, Jeanne takes up witchcraft, ultimately becoming so powerful that the feudal lord who first violated her tries to enlist her as his ally. She refuses \u2014 or rather, she makes a demand he cannot satisfy \u2014 and is thus arrested and martyred at the stake. A brief coda added for an expurgated but still unsuccessful Japanese release flashes forward to the French Revolution, identifying Jeanne with Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s 1830 painting \u201cLiberty Leading the People.\u201d\u201cBelladonna of Sadness\u201d \u2014 described in a Japanese trailer included as a Blu-ray extra as \u201ca typical Romanesque anime of intense eroticism and lyrical sorrow\u201d \u2014 is organically outr\u00e9. \u201cBeyond the Valley of the Dolls\u201d (1970), newly out on disc from Criterion, is intentionally so.Directed by the exploitation satirist Russ Meyer (1922-2004) from a screenplay by the film critic Roger Ebert, the movie was an outlandish, intentionally one-dimensional revision of the 1967 20th Century Fox hit \u201cValley of the Dolls.\u201d The three young women aspiring to show business careers in the original are here three members of a rock band who go to Los Angeles and fall under the spell of the sinister producer Z-Man Barzell (John LaZar), an androgynous figure given to orgiastic LSD happenings and flights of mock Shakespearean language.Cast with frequently nude Playboy playmates and veterans of Mr. Meyer\u2019s earlier films, \u201cBeyond the Valley of the Dolls\u201d is a relic of Fox\u2019s most delirious period. To reach the youth market, the studio was willing to try almost anything. Fox made or contemplated biopics of New Left heroes (Che Guevara and Malcolm X) and adaptations of problematic literary adaptations (\u201cMyra Breckinridge,\u201d and \u201cThe Confessions of Nat Turner\u201d), as well as Mr. Meyer\u2019s X-rated comedies.A man who loved his montage, Mr. Meyer directs the film as a succession of gag cartoons, many in close-up, with intermittent interludes of soft-focus sex. The actresses all wear wigs (or seem to) as they dance like go-go fembots to the ubiquitous bubble gum music that fills Z-Man\u2019s mansion. The outfits, for men and women, might have provided a template for Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights.\u201dMr. Meyer\u2019s grand finale mixes bloody mayhem with saccharine bromides, but the film\u2019s most outr\u00e9 aspect is its innocence. With its flat lighting; garish colors; and arch, dated slang, \u201cBeyond the Valley of the Dolls\u201d is beyond self-parody, a cartoon of a cartoon.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Predicts a Big Holiday Bounce After Its Biggest Rival, Samsung, Falters", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple predicts that strong sales of its new iPhones will soon pull the company out of a yearlong slump.And the misfortunes of its archrival, Samsung, probably deserve a bit of the credit.On Tuesday, Apple said it expects sales to start growing again in the upcoming holiday quarter, driven largely by consumer purchases of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which went on sale in September.\u201cThere\u2019s more demand we can supply right now,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said in an interview. Interest in the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple\u2019s largest model and the most direct rival to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7, is so intense that Apple said production could still lag demand even by December.If the company\u2019s forecast is accurate, it will mark a turnaround from what has been a disappointing year for the Silicon Valley giant. In April, Apple announced that sales in the first three calendar months of 2016 shrank for the first time in 13 years.The poor performance continued through the quarter that ended on Sept. 24, the company reported on Tuesday. For the most recent three-month period, Apple said, revenue fell 9 percent to $46.9 billion. Net income fell 19 percent to $9 billion.One bright spot for Apple was the accelerating growth of its services businesses \u2014 essentially its cut of iPhone app sales as well as subscriptions to Apple Music and other services such as cloud storage. Revenue from services was up 24 percent as the company squeezed more value from the billion or so Apple devices that it estimates are in active use.\u201cThe next big product is the App Store,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research, who sees services as an underappreciated part of Apple\u2019s business.Mr. Maestri said that revenue from Apple Music, the company\u2019s streaming service, grew 22 percent in the quarter and more than offset the decline in music downloads from the iTunes store.Based primarily on the robust demand for the iPhone 7, Apple raised its financial projections for the quarter that will end in December, when crucial holiday sales occur. The company said it expects revenue of $76 billion to $78 billion, compared to $75.9 billion in the same quarter last year.China, a key market for Apple where sales have fallen sharply, appears to be stabilizing. In the September quarter, sales in greater China were about flat compared to the June quarter. Sales were still down 30 percent compared to the previous year, but Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said he was optimistic about an improvement.\u201cWe are very bullish on China,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be a new normal there, but the new normal is a good growth rate.\u201dApple shares were down about 2.6 percent in after-hours trading.While phones account for the majority of Apple\u2019s business, its Mac laptop and desktop personal computers remain significant contributors to the company\u2019s bottom line. On Thursday, Apple is expected to announce several major updates to its Mac lineup, including the first major overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop in four years.Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at the Jensen Quality Growth Fund, said that Apple\u2019s phones are gradually becoming commoditized, yielding lower profit margins. Services, which are far more profitable, will drive the company\u2019s future growth.\u201cApps and services have higher margins,\u201d said Mr. Walkush, whose mutual fund has been building its stake in Apple stock. \u201cIt makes it more annuity-like.\u201dMr. Cook got a bit prickly when asked about artificial intelligence technology found in devices made by competitors like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google \u2019s Home. Those gadgets rely on amassing a large amount of information about users to deliver personalized information.He said Apple could deliver similar personalized services through its Siri technology without compromising privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s a false trade-off that people want you to believe, that you have to give up privacy to have A.I. to do something for you. We don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Mr. Cook said.As for new areas of focus for the company, he said Apple remains very interested in television content. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view,\u201d Mr. Cook said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "9 Times Donald Trump Complained About Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byYet as Mr. Trump\u2019s voluminous social media record shows, Mr. Trump has taken to Twitter many times in the past several years to denounce tax avoiders, complain about misuse of his own tax dollars and warn of the significant pain that paying taxes had caused him or others.In April 2012, after Mr. Obama released his tax returns, Mr. Trump attacked the president for calling for tax hikes yet paying what Mr. Trump suggested was a paltry tax rate of 20.5 percent. \u201cDo as I say not as I do,\u201d he taunted. (In retrospect, Mr. Trump may have been referring to himself.)In May 2012, Mr. Trump mocked Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin for renouncing his citizenship to avoid United States taxes. \u201cI guess 3.8 billion isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. One billion, on the other hand \u2026Later that year, Mr. Trump seemed to dismiss the idea that the tax code gave loopholes to wealthy people to allow them to avoid paying more taxes, retweeting a follower who observed that a handful of the wealthiest Americans paid most of the taxes.In 2015, Mr. Trump lashed out at The Washington Post, owned by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Bezos had taken advantage of the public by using losses at The Post to offset taxes on Amazon.In the same year, Mr. Trump criticized tax loopholes available to hedge funds and private equity firms, attacking them for \u201cpaying practically nothing.\u201d (Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan proposes closing the so-called carried interest loophole, which benefits investors in private equity and real estate.)In February, Mr. Trump posed for a picture next to a giant stack of papers, apparently a copy of his tax returns. His conclusion: \u201cIsn\u2019t this ridiculous?\u201d Indeed.An earlier version of this article misstated the tax liabilities suggested in Donald J. Trump\u2019s 1995 tax returns. He sustained losses enough to potentially avoid taxes on nearly a billion dollars of income \u2014 not avoid that amount in income taxes.Advertisement"}

The Apollo tests also did not carry any people.Blue Origin tested the escape system in 2012, but that was while the capsule was resting on a launchpad. This time, the capsule separated in flight, during the most stressful portion of the upward trajectory \u2014 45 seconds after ignition, at an altitude of 16,000 feet, when the rocket was passing the speed of sound and experiencing maximum air pressure.A solid-fuel rocket at the bottom of the crew capsule fired for 1.8 seconds, exerting 70,000 pounds of force to quickly separate the capsule and steer it out of the way of the booster. Its parachutes deployed, and the capsule landed softly.If there had been any people aboard, \u201cit would have been exciting, certainly,\u201d Ms. Cornell said, \u201cbut most importantly, you\u2019d be safe.\u201dThe booster had not been expected to survive, but it managed to right itself, continue on to space, and then, firing its engine again, land a couple of miles north of the launchpad in West Texas, a bit charred but intact. Still, neither the capsule nor the booster will fly again. Improved versions will be ready for future test flights.By starting with a small suborbital rocket, the company is gaining experience in developing and launching reusable spacecraft. Test flights with people may begin as early as next year, and paying passengers, six at a time, may start coming aboard as early as 2018. Blue Origin has not yet announced a price for tickets.Advertisement"}

The acquisition of Wirecutter could not only usher in a new revenue model for The Times, it could also introduce a significant new dimension to The Times\u2019s deeply ingrained relationship with its readers.First the basics of the deal, in case you missed it. Wirecutter \u2014 and its sister site The Sweethome \u2014 is in the business of recommending technology and other household products to customers, and it has a strong reputation. The sites hire scientists, technologists and other experts to essentially lab test everything from speaker systems to chef knives to determine whether or not to recommend the product. If a visitor to Wirecutter\u2019s site purchases a product by clicking a link to, say, Amazon, then Wirecutter gets a percentage of the profit. That\u2019s how it makes its money \u2014 not off ads but by a model called \u201caffiliate links.\u201d\u201cWe want The Times to be viewed as indispensable in this type of service journalism,\u201d said Ben French, vice president of products at The Times and head of an area called Beta. \u201cIt\u2019s a great service to our readers.\u201dThis is a significant change from the trifecta that has sustained journalism for centuries: the news organization, the reader and the advertiser. Traditionally, newsrooms focused on journalism and mostly stayed away from recommending consumer goods. Advertisers did the product recommending, by purchasing ads adjacent to the news. The readers, meanwhile, either found the ads useful or accepted them as part of the price for getting quality news.With the old financial model crumbling, it\u2019s understandable why The Times needs to search for new revenue. But if it\u2019s going to start giving the thumbs-up to the best toaster oven \u2014 while making money off the sale \u2014 it had better be sure readers fully understand how the arrangement works and are ready to embrace it. Readers have a deep understanding of the current revenue model, a comfort level gained over a lifetime. The new one may take some getting used to, judging by the emails to my inbox this week.Paul Landaw of Bellerose Terrace, New York, says he fears The Times is moving away from hard-hitting objective journalism and toward lifestyle and service journalism, and he is distrustful. \u201cWe are supposed to believe that the Times/Wirecutter recommendations are objective and disinterested when the Times stands to earn a commission if readers click through to buy on Amazon,\u201d he writes. \u201cSorry, but this screeches \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 to me in a loud voice. Will The Times only recommend items that can be bought through affiliate sites and disparage those that can\u2019t? Can The Times prove that this will not be a conflict of interest?\u201dGene Krzyzynski of Tonawanda, N.Y, asks, \u201cBy any chance is \u2018lifestyle journalism\u2019 coded language for \u2018The Times is going to become more and more like the \u201cToday\u201d show and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d?\u2019\u201dI don\u2019t worry that this new venture will affect the rigor or seriousness of The Times\u2019s news report, but I understand why these readers worry. It could produce a jolt when product reviews start landing on the pages of The Times.As the leadership rushes forward, I hope three issues will be front of mind: First, radical transparency to ensure readers understand exactly how the product reviews are done and how The Times makes money off them; second, a robust effort to explain to readers why the paper thinks this is a good idea; and third, clear sitewide rules for affiliate links, including their placement and their usage \u2014 from books to batteries.Philip Corbett, associate managing editor for standards, said there were many discussions about how to do this right. \u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018Are we comfortable with this revenue model?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew it could be potentially fraught. But as when evaluating most new revenue streams, not doing it presents risks too.\u201dA significant part of the conversation circled around transparency with readers, Corbett said, assuring me that both the business and news side recognizes the importance of that.As for my other two points \u2014 getting reader feedback, and setting clear sitewide rules for affiliate links \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether such efforts are in the works yet, but if they\u2019re not, I hope they will be soon.I\u2019m not abjectly against The Times dipping into product recommendation. If it is done well \u2014 with serious attention paid to the reader and the quality of the recommendation \u2014 it could be of value to The Times\u2019s audience. Clearly Wirecutter\u2019s audience felt that way.But I hope The Times will move cautiously, not merely assuming readers will view this as a useful new service but actually asking them whether they do. The Times has a lot to gain. And also to lose.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Neighborhood Bookstore\u2019s Unlikely Ally? The Internet", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byIn the summer, this small town five hours north of Detroit is a haven for tourists and summer residents who are drawn to the state\u2019s wine country. But after the fall colors fade and the sapphire waters of Lake Michigan chill, the region\u2019s population slumps by as much as 40 percent for much of the other nine months of the year.But even as the summer visitors disappear, Brilliant Books is still thriving as a result of robust online sales.A decade ago, independent bookstores were viewed as an industry on the decline. Crushed on price by Amazon and by the wide selection of national retailers like Barnes & Noble, thousands of mom-and-pop outlets had closed up shop.In a twist of fate, it is the internet \u2014 the very thing that was supposed to wipe them out \u2014 that is helping these small stores.\u201cBookstores are being reinvented by taking advantage of how the world has changed,\u201d said Oren Teicher, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association, which represents independent sellers. \u201cThe whole ability to put technology to work for you has changed everything.\u201dUndoubtedly, the bookselling industry is still digging out of a deep trough. Sales of physical books in physical stores were just $11 billion in 2015, compared with $17 billion in 2007.But owners like Mr. Makin are finding ways to gain customer loyalty with the aid of technology. He knew he could not compete with Amazon on price, but he believed that online buyers would flock to Brilliant Books if they experienced the same customer service that shoppers in his physical store do.\u201cI say, \u2018We are your long-distance local bookstore,\u2019\u201d Mr. Makin said.One of his most successful ways of getting repeat business is his store\u2019s version of a book-of-the-month program, which makes personalized recommendations for each of its nearly 2,000 subscribers every 30 days. Rather than use an online form to track preferences, Brilliant sends each new subscriber a customer card to fill out by hand and mail back.Employees then scan the card into the system so that when it is book-selection time, they can see what the customers said they liked and how they said it.\u201cHow we might write something might show an entirely different taste in books,\u201d Mr. Malkin said. \u201cPeople scribble things out. They draw arrows. We get a feel for who they are.\u201dIndividually selecting titles for nearly 2,000 people can be time-consuming. \u201cAn awfully long time,\u201d Mr. Makin said, laughing. \u201cBut the technology allows us to make this happen.\u201dOnce the selections are made, the back-end system orders books from the publishers and prints postage and address labels. After the books arrive, the staff mails personalized packages.The investment is paying off: Sales are up 14 percent this year, and Mr. Makin anticipates that 30 percent of Brilliant\u2019s sales will come from online orders \u2014 doubling last year\u2019s total. Facebook customers buy more nonfiction titles, while Twitter conversations generate more sales of young adult and children\u2019s books.\u201cWe\u2019re in the 21st century and we\u2019re a 21st century book store,\u201d said Aimee Jodoin, Brilliant\u2019s social media manager. \u201cShop small is the way to beat Amazon. People are going to shop online, so we have an online presence.\u201dThese social media experiments are shifts in culture for many small businesses.\u201cThe one thing small business has over big boxes is that they can get to know every customer, but they have been hesitant to engage online,\u201d said Peter Shankman, a social media strategist and the author of \u201cZombie Loyalists: Using Great Service to Create Rabid Fans.\u201d \u201cThey heard about needing followers but didn\u2019t see any returns. When they realized that by making it personal, they could get return shoppers, it changed.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re part of a downtown that is booming and gentrifying, so we\u2019ve had a lot of attention to our geography,\u201d said the store manager, Katie Orphan. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect that it would lead to the Instagram attention that we have had.\u201dInstead, the store communicates with its customers via social media and an email newsletter, where the most-read stories are about events and staff picks.\u201cThat\u2019s been the best tool for reaching customers and finding new sales,\u201d said Andrew Unger, Bookcourt\u2019s events and publicity manager.Still, he hopes to find a way in the future to promote the store\u2019s deep trove of audio interviews of popular talks by notable people like Garrison Keillor and Oliver Stone.\u201cSmall business, when it comes to something like this, it\u2019s hard to find someone with enough time to really dedicate themselves to it, but we hope to,\u201d Mr. Unger said.\u201cOne of our grandchildren took her out of the store so there was a whole thing about \u2018Where is Barista Barbie?

The show is meditative and slow, with the entire first season covering only a few days. It\u2019s also visually beautiful, and boldly confident in its rejection of prestige-drama pacing and style.The new episodes pick up shortly after we left off, and present that same sense of impending menace \u2014 a sense we get through Daniel\u2019s skewed, often wrong perceptions of danger \u2014 overlaid on a fighting flicker of human dignity.\u2018Pure Genius,\u2019 10 p.m., CBS (New Series)TV could use a new, good doctor show. \u201cPure Genius\u201d is not that.

There are no rules at this hospital, basically: Rules are bureaucracy, and that is bad! This is a tech hospital. No rules!

{"Headline": "Google Pixel Review: Assessing the New Smartphone", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre. It is slower than Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung\u2019s smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel\u2019s camera don\u2019t look as good as the iPhone\u2019s. And Google\u2019s built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb.Google said that it had optimized Pixel to be speedy, with real-world applications that consumers could perceive, like making the touch screen feel very responsive. It also said that it would improve its virtual assistant over time and that photos taken with the Pixel look more natural.Here\u2019s what stood out in my tests of Pixel:Google\u2019s Still-Annoying AssistantAnd so it was with Google\u2019s supposedly new-and-improved virtual assistant, called Assistant, on the Pixel. The search giant says the difference with Assistant is that it is capable of \u201ctwo-way conversations.\u201d In plain English, what Google means is you can make requests to Assistant and ask follow-up questions, and Assistant might understand the context to respond appropriately.Google offers this example: You can ask, \u201cWhere is the Taj Mahal?\u201d and then ask, \u201cHow old is it?\u201dWhile that sounds compelling in theory, Assistant failed at responding fully to many requests made with natural language. When I asked, \u201cWhat time is \u2018Westworld\u2019 on TV?\u201d Assistant displayed a web search result containing the synopsis for the new sci-fi show. When I followed up with, \u201cSo what time is it on?\u201d Assistant told me the current time, which was 9:35 p.m.From there on, Assistant continued to hit foul balls. When I said, \u201cbook me a table nearby,\u201d Assistant would try to book a table only at a restaurant called Rich Table, and didn\u2019t list other options.On the plus side, Assistant can handle a conversation about the weather. When I asked for the weather and it said it was raining, I asked whether it would stop raining this week. \u201cRain is not expected this week in San Francisco,\u201d it said. Better.In its current state, attempting to accomplish complex tasks with Assistant on Pixel will waste more time than it saves.A Mediocre Camera Like pretty much every handset maker, Google proclaims Pixel\u2019s camera to be the best on the market. Its rear camera has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, similar to the iPhone 7\u2019s 12-megapixel sensor. So I took photos with the Pixel and compared them with shots taken with the iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7.All the cameras took clear, visually appealing photographs with rich details, but there were major differences in color, even without any filters applied. The photos taken with the Pixel looked colder \u2014 they appeared to exaggerate cyans and magentas. The ones taken with the iPhone looked more vivid, though they appeared to slightly bump up yellows to make photos look warmer. The color in pictures taken with the Samsung phone looked oversaturated and unnatural.I decided to let a blind jury weigh in. My partner, a professional photographer, took photos with each camera of a plant in a colorful vase in natural lighting. She labeled each photograph A, B and C, and I sent the photos out to 30 people and, without revealing which phone each letter corresponded with, asked them to vote for their favorite. (Before reading the results below, take a look and make your own vote.)Photo A was taken with the Samsung phone, photo B with Google\u2019s Pixel, and photo C with an iPhone 7. Out of 30 votes, 19 voted for the iPhone, eight voted for the Pixel, and three voted for the Samsung phone. People seemed to gravitate toward the warmer color profiles produced by the iPhone.Comparisons With the CompetitionBased on features alone, the Pixel is decent compared with Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7. Here are some highlights:\u25a0 What sets Pixel apart is its compatibility with Project Fi, Google\u2019s experimental wireless service. You pay at least $30 a month for a package that includes unlimited minutes and messages and 1 gigabyte of cellular data. You can pay $10 more for each extra gigabyte of data or get reimbursed for the cellular data you don\u2019t use.\u25a0 The Pixel\u2019s fingerprint sensor, for unlocking the phone, is annoyingly on the back of the device rather than on the face. So when you\u2019re on the go, you will probably be using two hands \u2014 one to hold the phone and the other to place your fingerprint on the back \u2014 to unlock the Pixel.\u25a0 In speed tests run with the mobile app Geekbench, the Pixel was about 20 percent slower than both the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7.\u25a0 The Pixel wasn\u2019t designed to be water-resistant though Google says it is resistant to water sprays. The Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 survived a dive into a pitcher of water.\u25a0 It\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel still has a headphone jack, which Apple eliminated from its iPhones this year (though it turns out the iPhone\u2019s omission of the jack was not a big deal).The Bottom LineLargely because Samsung, the king of Android phones, is in the penalty box, now is a good time to consider trying something new, be it a different phone service or a different operating system altogether.Using Pixel with Project Fi may also end up saving you money: If you picked, for example, a plan with two gigabytes of data, you\u2019d pay $40 a month for cellphone and data service that works all over the world. In contrast, Verizon charges $55 a month for a similar plan that doesn\u2019t include free international roaming.If you are uninterested in Project Fi and are not deeply invested in Google\u2019s ecosystem, there is another route: Try an iPhone. Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus outperformed the Pixel in every way in terms of hardware features.And so far, to my knowledge, Apple phones haven\u2019t blown up.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article rendered incorrectly the name of a Google product shown.

Officials running Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential foundation have made about 10 trips to tech strongholds in California in the past year as they help him plot his next steps.The path from the Obama White House to the tech giants \u2014 many of them major political donors to Mr. Obama \u2014 is already well worn.\u201cThis place is becoming an assisted living facility for political vets,\u201d said Matt McKenna, a former spokesman for Mr. Clinton who decamped last year to Uber and now runs a boutique public relations firm in the center of the tech world.Suspicions that Mr. Obama harbors some dreams of joining them \u2014 at least in some capacity \u2014 were given new life during the past several weeks.

{"Headline": "With AT&T-Time Warner Deal Brewing, a Focus on Preserving CNN\u2019s Integrity", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byIn its 130-year history, AT&T has transitioned from a telegraph service to a wireless provider to a global communications behemoth.Now, one of America\u2019s oldest corporations is about to take on what may be its trickiest identity yet: journalist.Assuming its $85 billion merger with Time Warner is cleared, AT&T will soon find itself in charge of CNN, the cable news stalwart whose profitability \u2014 itself a crucial lure for suitors of Time Warner \u2014 relies on an international reputation for legitimate reporting.The difficulties of defending tough reporting and shielding journalists from powerful antagonists can be hard for any corporation to stomach. And while AT&T gained a foothold in the television industry by acquiring DirecTV last year, the company has no journalistic lineage, meaning its executives will have to face these challenges on the fly.\u201cTime Warner was built on journalism first, so they had that in their blood already,\u201d said Jonathan Klein, a former CNN president, referring to Time Warner\u2019s origins as publisher of Time magazine. \u201cAT&T does not, so there is a question if there is any kind of corporate appreciation for editorial independence.\u201d\u201cWhen people watch CNN, they are getting an independent assessment and reporting of the news,\u201d Mr. Stephenson told the CNN reporter Christine Romans. \u201cThe last thing we want to do, as AT&T, is in any way taint that in the slightest bit.\u201dThose remarks may pacify some CNN veterans, but Mr. Stephenson could find himself under more scrutiny. He has contributed about $80,000 this election cycle to aid Republican candidates, an otherwise humdrum fact that could be newly relevant if he takes charge of one of the country\u2019s most influential news outlets.Still, in interviews, media executives said that it would be foolish for AT&T to meddle in a valuable product like CNN, saying that any perception of corporate intrusion could damage a profitable brand.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Television networks are no strangers to corporate overseers. CBS, and its flagship news division, was purchased by Westinghouse in 1995; Disney owns ABC and thus its news division; and NBC News and MSNBC are subsidiaries of Comcast, the Philadelphia-based cable giant that took control of NBCUniversal in 2011.Comcast\u2019s influence over NBC\u2019s news reporting has appeared to be minimal. When the anchor Brian Williams was accused of exaggerating stories early last year, NBCUniversal\u2019s chief executive, Stephen B. Burke, consulted with David L. Cohen, an executive vice president of Comcast. But Mr. Burke, himself a former chief operating officer at Comcast, is typically the highest-level executive involved in critical decisions by the news division.CNN, founded by the maverick businessman Ted Turner, was first purchased by Time Warner in 1995. Mr. Klein, who was CNN\u2019s president from 2004 to 2010, said he never experienced any corporate interference during his time there.Mr. Klein noted that Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, had no journalistic experience when he bought The Washington Post in 2013. So far, he said, the newspaper has thrived under its new ownership.In an age of consolidation for the ailing media industry, AT&T is the latest corporation to make an audacious move into the news business. One of AT&T\u2019s chief telecom rivals, Verizon, bought AOL in 2015, giving it control of The Huffington Post.Asked on Monday if Verizon had ever tried to influence the site\u2019s coverage, Arianna Huffington, the website\u2019s co-founder who recently left The Huffington Post, replied in a text message: \u201cThey never did.\u201dThe announcement of the planned AT&T-Time Warner merger did raise a red flag for at least one TV news veteran: Tom Johnson, another former CNN president, who emailed a group of leading media figures over the weekend warning of \u201cthe critical need for AT&T to protect the news and editorial independence of CNN.\u201dMr. Johnson was prompted to write the missive after he received an outpouring of concerned messages and phone calls from former CNN colleagues, he said in an interview on Monday. A one-time publisher of The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Johnson has firsthand knowledge of corporate takeovers gone awry: He watched as his former paper was hollowed out after being acquired by the Tribune Company.But Mr. Johnson said that he found Mr. Stephenson\u2019s assurances that CNN would remain autonomous to be genuine. \u201cI really believe he\u2019s quite serious about what he believes,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Johnson added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019ll ever be another Ted Turner.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about concerns for CNN\u2019s journalistic independence if AT&T buys Time Warner misidentified the buyer of The Washington Post in 2013. It was bought by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, not by Amazon itself.Sydney Ember and Emily Steel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Introduces the Pixel, Its Own Smartphone", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For all the bells and whistles of Google\u2019s new smartphone, the biggest point of emphasis is tucked away in small type on the back of the device: \u201cPhone by Google.\u201dToday, most of Google\u2019s smartphone software runs on devices manufactured by companies like Samsung, LG Electronics and Lenovo, with Google\u2019s presence often relegated to the background. But with its new Pixel smartphone, introduced Tuesday at a press event, Google is front and center and selling a phone that it created from the industrial design to the components.Google\u2019s new strategy of controlling both hardware and software for its devices puts the company more directly in competition with Apple and many of its own Android partners. It\u2019s a necessity, Google says, because of the advent of artificial intelligence.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said devices with artificial intelligence \u2014 where computers can understand what people are saying and respond conversationally with the right information at the right moment \u2014 present a seminal moment in computing on par with the creation of the personal computer, the World Wide Web and smartphones.For Google, artificial intelligence takes form in the Google Assistant. Google demonstrated how the Assistant, through a series of questions, can be used to plan a night out \u2014 from finding out about upcoming concerts at a certain venue to booking a reservation at a restaurant or researching how long the drive from the restaurant to the show will take.\u201cThe goal is to build a personal Google for each and every individual,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.Pixel is the first smartphone with the Google Assistant built into the device. It was part of a new-product barrage including a Wi-Fi router, a virtual reality headset and a Chromecast device for streaming high-resolution video.The Echo\u2019s success informed an important part of Google\u2019s strategy: hardware products that provide a vessel to get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers.Its competitors are taking a similar path with their A.I. technology. Amazon is now building Alexa into its other hardware products like Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top boxes. Apple is considering expanding the reach of its virtual assistant from the iPhone and iPad into the home with an Echo-like device.\u201cIf you really want to make a step-change difference, you really have to design the software and hardware together,\u201d said Rick Osterloh, who returned to Google in April to be its senior vice president of hardware. He was the president of Motorola when it was owned by Google and moved with the company when it was sold to Lenovo in 2014.Part of Mr. Osterloh\u2019s mandate is to make sense of Google\u2019s fragmented hardware efforts, which span a wide range of devices, from Chromebook computers to Wi-Fi routers. He said he planned to focus Google\u2019s hardware resources in areas that highlight the company\u2019s software, while also creating a unified look and feel to the devices.Creating a uniform experience, especially in the world of smartphones, has been a challenge for Google. Hardware manufacturers often modify Google\u2019s software to make what they sell a little different from that of their competitors.For the last six years, Google worked with other hardware manufacturers such as Samsung and LG Electronics to develop the Nexus line of smartphones. Those phones provided a showcase for the best of Google\u2019s software, but much of the design and production process was handled by the company\u2019s hardware partners.With Pixel, Mr. Osterloh said, \u201cwe wanted to build things as Google intended.\u201dBut becoming a hardware manufacturer is not easy. Google is now exposed to new risks associated with a hardware business, such as managing inventory, providing customer service and procuring components.With the Pixel, Google clearly has Apple\u2019s iPhone in its sights. During an onstage presentation, Mr. Osterloh said the Pixel doesn\u2019t have an \u201cunsightly camera bump\u201d \u2014 a reference to the protruding nub that sticks out from the iPhone\u2019s rear camera.In a commercial for the Pixel, Google also said its phone is all-new while noting that the Pixel comes with a \u201csatisfyingly not new\u201d headphone jack. Apple\u2019s latest iPhones come without a headphone jack, a design decision that has sparked furious debate in the technology news media.The Pixel, which is available for order, will come with a very iPhone-like price, starting at $649. Google said Google Home will sell for $129 and be available starting next month. The Pixel is available at Verizon and Best Buy stores. For people who want to use the phone with a different carrier, Google will sell the phone unlocked at its online store.Advertisement"}

Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with eco-conscious populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers.Yet 140 miles of traffic-choked roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest.Now the political, academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring them closer together, with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America.\u201cVancouver has a lot more in common with Seattle than we do with Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, anywhere else in our country,\u201d Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, said in an interview. \u201cWe should make the most of those cultural commonalities.\u201dWhether their grand vision of a \u201cCascadia innovation corridor\u201d \u2014 which borrows its name from the region\u2019s Cascade mountain range \u2014 ever materializes, leaders on both sides of the border have motives for getting cozier immediately. American tech icons like Microsoft, with voracious needs for global engineering talent, are expanding their Vancouver offices, partly because of Canada\u2019s smoother immigration process.For its part, Vancouver wants to bring more American technology companies to the city in hopes of spinning out future entrepreneurs who will expand its comparatively small base of technology companies.\u201cWe have San Francisco real estate prices with the incomes of somewhere between Reno and Nashville,\u201d said Andy Yan, acting director of the city program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.On the thrumming streets of downtown Vancouver, signs of the Seattle region\u2019s growing economic ties to the city are hard to miss. A rectangular glass and steel office building with a large Microsoft sign occupies nearly an entire city block, sitting atop a large Nordstrom store (another Seattle brand).Microsoft says it invested $120 million in its new offices in Vancouver, which opened in June, and expects to spend $90 million more annually on wages and other operating costs. It plans to employ nearly 750 people in the city.Microsoft is hiring Canadians for the facility, but the country\u2019s more open immigration policies were an important factor in its investment, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview. Microsoft and other tech companies have long complained that the United States education system does not produce enough computer science graduates, forcing them to rely on immigrants from India, China and elsewhere.Foreign workers in the United States can wait about three times as long for a work visa as those in Canada do, the Boston Consulting Group estimates. And the prospect of Donald J. Trump winning the presidency has raised concerns among tech companies, because of the Republican candidate\u2019s comments about further restricting immigration to the United States.\u201cRight now, there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty about open immigration,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Last month, officials and executives from both cities huddled in a Vancouver hotel to discuss how to enable people, ideas and capital to flow more freely between them, as heedless of the international border separating the cities as a pod of orcas swimming in the sea.At the Cascadia conference, Ms. Clark and Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, signed an agreement to deepen the ties between Vancouver and Seattle, including more research collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, and Satya Nadella, its current chief executive, talked about globalization and education.One proposal to deal with traffic between Vancouver and Seattle was for a high-speed rail line that would whisk travelers at more than 200 miles an hour between the cities in 57 minutes (it can take four hours or more by car). The details on financing the project \u2014 which could cost an estimated $30 billion or more \u2014 have not been worked out.With roots in timber and shipping, Vancouver\u2019s economy has diversified in recent decades with the growth of film and video game production. The city claims a tech \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 a start-up valued at over $1 billion \u2014 in Hootsuite, which makes social media tools.But Vancouver remains a relative small fry in tech, with about $1.78 billion in venture capital flowing into local tech start-ups in the last decade, compared with about $8.9 billion in Seattle, the research firm Pitchbook estimates.The housing market is showing signs of cooling off, though it is not yet clear how much of that is because of the tax. The total number of homes sold in the area in August dropped 26 percent from a year earlier and price growth has slowed, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.Dennis Pilarinos, chief executive of Buddybuild, a Vancouver maker of developer tools for mobile apps, says affordability has been less of a problem for young tech workers, who may be willing to rent smaller apartments and live with roommates. But when start-ups get bigger, many struggle to recruit senior executives with families, said Mr. Pilarinos, who previously worked for Microsoft and Amazon in Vancouver.\u201cCompanies tend to run into scaling issues,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up with fewer Microsofts or Amazons.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Caught in Family Trees in \u2018Where\u2019s Poppa?\u2019 and \u2018Papirosen\u2019", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byOn DVDA small but distinct tendency within the Hollywood New Wave of the late 1960s and early 1970s was the dark, sometimes daringly tasteless comedy featuring urban neurotic protagonists and ethnic themes, often directed by a Jewish comedian.Mike Nichols\u2019s \u201cThe Graduate\u201d (1967) presaged the trend; \u201cThe Heartbreak Kid\u201d (1972), by Mr. Nichols\u2019s onetime partner Elaine May, capped it. In between came Woody Allen\u2019s early features; Mel Brooks\u2019s calculated outrage \u201cThe Producers\u201d (1968); and the no less programmatically offensive \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppa?\u201d (1970), directed by Mr. Brooks\u2019s former partner in comedy Carl Reiner.Adapted from a novel by Robert Klane, \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppa?,\u201d new on Blu-ray from Kino Lorber, is a burlesque of mother-son relations with affinities to the early work of Jewish American writers like Philip Roth, Wallace Markfield and Bruce Jay Friedman. The nostalgic references to 1940s popular culture made in the movie\u2019s opening theme are rendered discomfortingly literal when the 30-something protagonist, Gordon Hocheiser (George Segal), awakens in what is his clearly his boyhood room. The slapstick ferocity of Mr. Reiner\u2019s family drama is soon apparent when Gordon puts on a Halloween gorilla costume in a feeble attempt at scaring his mother (Ruth Gordon) to death.Mrs. Hocheiser is barely startled by her son\u2019s ploy. She simply wonders, for the first of many times, where her dead husband is and demands her morning breakfast (Pepsi over Lucky Charms). That Mrs. Hocheiser has dementia is the movie\u2019s first and greatest blasphemy. With her inimitable line readings and face-scrunching expressions, Ms. Gordon \u2014 who was in her mid-70s when \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppa?\u201d was made \u2014 is one of the most ruthless clowns to ever appear before the camera. Her imperiously addled Mrs. Hocheiser is one of the period\u2019s great comic creations, as well as one of the most disturbing.Gordon, who promised his father he would never put her in a nursing home, is bowed under the weight of his \u201cancient, terrible, senile mother,\u201d as the New York Times critic Vincent Canby described her. With Louise, a nurse in a Florence Nightingale cloak and micro-miniskirt (Trish Van Devere, barely keeping a straight face), Gordon finds an instant, if painfully frustrated, rapport. In a vain attempt to prevent his jealous mother from terrorizing Louise, Gordon recruits his equally neurotic brother, Sidney (Ron Leibman), who suffers his own form of repetition compulsion, running back and forth across Central Park, regularly accosted by the same jovial gang of muggers.A loosely connected series of set pieces, \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppa?\u201d prompted outrage in its day, Mr. Canby\u2019s approval notwithstanding. Variety called it \u201can insane movie\u201d and reported that a stampede of middle-aged theater owners made for the exit during a trade screening. The movie\u2019s climactic punch line was repeatedly expurgated and reinstated during previews. (Kino Lorber\u2019s disc offers the original ending \u2014 essential to the movie\u2019s meaning \u2014 as an extra.)Nothing if not transgressive, \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppa?\u201d is persistently scatological and casually anti-authoritarian, full of psychosexual hyperbole and rife with racial stereotypes, featuring a rape joke as potentially offensive to gay men and police officers as it is to women. Still, it was the character of Mrs. Hocheiser that critics found most unsettling. In his book \u201cHollywood\u2019s Image of the Jew,\u201d published in 1982, the film historian Lester D. Friedman refers to \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppa?\u201d as \u201cthe most unsavory portrait of a Jewish mother in the history of Jewish-American cinema.\u201dPerhaps \u2014 although why the restriction to Jewish or Jewish American? The movie is as universal as Freud\u2019s notion of the Oedipus complex, but it is also a sustained comic nightmare that comes as close to Kafka or to Freud\u2019s \u201cInterpretation of Dreams\u201d as any Hollywood entertainment ever has. The unconscious, after all, is a realm beyond political correctness.\u201cPapirosen,\u201d a family documentary chronicle by the young Argentine director Gast\u00f3n Solnicki (out on disc from Film Movement), is more circumspect but no less fraught with trauma. Combining old home movies of vacations, weddings and bar mitzvahs with a decade\u2019s worth of observational footage, Mr. Solnicki documents the weight of history on four generations of Polish-Argentine Jews.The filmmaker is largely invisible. The central figures are Mr. Solnicki\u2019s grandmother Pola, a Holocaust survivor, and his father, Victor, born in Poland just after World War II. In the late 1940s, the family made its way to Czechoslovakia and then to Buenos Aires (perhaps as not fully documented immigrants), where Mr. Solnicki\u2019s grandfather committed suicide. Mr. Solnicki\u2019s two siblings and a young nephew are supporting players, as is his mother, Mirta, a cheerful woman who at one point tells Victor that he needs \u201cmore psychoanalysis.\u201dRobust yet fragile, Victor seems the most emotionally complicated member of the family \u2014 obsessed with his own childhood and the father who abandoned him. On a trip to Prague, he searches for toys he might have owned; the movie\u2019s title refers to his favorite song, a sentimental Yiddish ballad about a Jewish war orphan who survives by selling individual cigarettes on the street. The title\u2019s literal meaning (\u201cpapers\u201d) is suggestive of Victor\u2019s attempt to give his identity a legal basis, as well as the ephemeral material Mr. Solnicki uses to present his family\u2019s story.Ultimately, the histrionics are subsumed by the movie\u2019s mysterious structure and fluid chronology. Ranging over decades and continents, \u201cPapirosen\u201d offers the dreamlike spectacle of Mr. Solnicki\u2019s family aging, de-aging and re-aging before our eyes \u2014 and his.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}

The voice on the other end of the phone call just sounds deceptively like her.It is actually a computer-synthesized voice, a tour-de-force of artificial intelligence technology that has been crafted to make it possible for someone to masquerade via the telephone.Such a situation is still science fiction \u2014 but just barely. It is also the future of crime.The irony, of course, is that this year the computer security industry, with $75 billion in annual revenue, has started to talk about how machine learning and pattern recognition techniques will improve the woeful state of computer security.But there is a downside.\u201cThe thing people don\u2019t get is that cybercrime is becoming automated and it is scaling exponentially,\u201d said Marc Goodman, a law enforcement agency adviser and the author of \u201cFuture Crimes.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is not about Matthew Broderick hacking from his basement,\u201d a reference to the 1983 movie \u201cWar Games.\u201dThe alarm about malevolent use of advanced artificial intelligence technologies was sounded earlier this year by James R. Clapper, the director of National Intelligence. In his annual review of security, Mr. Clapper underscored the point that while A.I. systems would make some things easier, they would also expand the vulnerabilities of the online world.The growing sophistication of computer criminals can be seen in the evolution of attack tools like the widely used malicious program known as Blackshades, according to Mr. Goodman. The author of the program, a Swedish national, was convicted last year in the United States.The system, which was sold widely in the computer underground, functioned as a \u201ccriminal franchise in a box,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. It allowed users without technical skills to deploy computer ransomware or perform video or audio eavesdropping with a mouse click.The next generation of these tools will add machine learning capabilities that have been pioneered by artificial intelligence researchers to improve the quality of machine vision, speech understanding, speech synthesis and natural language understanding. Some computer security researchers believe that digital criminals have been experimenting with the use of A.I. technologies for more than half a decade.That can be seen in efforts to subvert the internet\u2019s omnipresent Captcha \u2014 Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart \u2014 the challenge-and-response puzzle invented in 2003 by Carnegie Mellon University researchers to block automated programs from stealing online accounts.Both \u201cwhite hat\u201d artificial intelligence researchers and \u201cblack hat\u201d criminals have been deploying machine vision software to subvert Captchas for more than half a decade, said Stefan Savage, a computer security researcher at the University of California, San Diego.\u201cIf you don\u2019t change your Captcha for two years, you will be owned by some machine vision algorithm,\u201d he said.Surprisingly, one thing that has slowed the development of malicious A.I. has been the ready availability of either low-cost or free human labor. For example, some cybercriminals have farmed out Captcha-breaking schemes to electronic sweatshops where humans are used to decode the puzzles for a tiny fee.Even more inventive computer crooks have used online pornography as a reward for human web surfers who break the Captcha, Mr. Goodman said. Free labor is a commodity that A.I. software won\u2019t be able to compete with any time soon.So what\u2019s next?Criminals, for starters, can piggyback on new tech developments. Voice-recognition technology like Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana are now used extensively to interact with computers. And Amazon\u2019s Echo voice-controlled speaker and Facebook\u2019s Messenger chatbot platform are rapidly becoming conduits for online commerce and customer support. As is often the case, whenever a communication advancement like voice recognition starts to go mainstream, criminals looking to take advantage of it aren\u2019t far behind.Social engineering, which refers to the practice of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging information, is widely seen as the weakest link in the computer security chain. Cybercriminals already exploit the best qualities in humans \u2014 trust and willingness to help others \u2014 to steal and spy. The ability to create artificial intelligence avatars that can fool people online will only make the problem worse.This can already be seen in efforts by state governments and political campaigns who are using chatbot technology widely for political propaganda.Researchers have coined the term \u201ccomputational propaganda\u201d to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like Facebook and Twitter.It is only a matter of time before such software is put to criminal use.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cleverness in designing social engineering attacks, but as far as I know, nobody has yet started using machine learning to find the highest quality suckers,\u201d said Mark Seiden, an independent computer security specialist. He paused and added, \u201cI should have replied: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, Dave, I can\u2019t answer that question right now.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women Shun the Maternity Smock, and Stores Race to Catch Up", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported bySome pregnant women want to \u2014 gasp \u2014 flaunt it.As cultural attitudes about pregnancy have shifted, so, too, has the maternity aisle, which is rapidly looking more like a high-end boutique than the sheet section at Bed Bath & Beyond. That has created an opportunity for a new crop of online shops and specialty stores, even as traditional maternity retailers have struggled to stay relevant.But that figure does not include e-commerce, where style-conscious retailers are targeting millennial mothers who are already accustomed to shopping online, as well as the many women who are now choosing to have children later in life \u2014 when they may also have a bit more money to spend.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to overtake the stores,\u201d Ms. Allen said of Bumpstyle, which at the moment accounts for about 20 percent of the couple\u2019s business.Destination Maternity operates more than 500 stores throughout the United States, according to its latest quarterly filing. But in recent years, the company has fallen out of favor with mothers-to-be, and it is in the midst of an overhaul to make its clothes more stylish.\u201cWe\u2019re really working hard to overcome the old stigma that maternity clothes are not fashionable,\u201d said Anthony M. Romano, chief executive of Destination Maternity. \u201cShe really wants to dress in the same trends and fashion that she was dressing in before she got pregnant.\u201dBut while the company reworks itself, competitors like Baby Bump and ASOS are busy courting a growing number of style-conscious women who might be willing to spend more than their mothers did on maternity clothes.\u201cWhen I started looking for Sonia, I was so surprised for the prices,\u201d said Maria Gourdin, 70, of Sonia Bicocchi her 35-year-old daughter, who has a 21/2-year-old and a 5-month-old. \u201cA blouse was $70 or $90. I\u2019d say, \u2018No, that\u2019s impossible.\u2019\u201dMs. Bicocchi, an elementary school teacher, said she opted for less expensive clothes from the fast-fashion retailer H&M, which sells its maternity line online and in select stores. \u201cI knew I wasn\u2019t going to wear it a long time.\u201dMs. Bicocchi represents one end of the increasingly bifurcated retail spectrum, in which customers are choosing the low-end or high-end options while eschewing the traditional middle-of-the-road retailers.Maternity \u201cwas that thing that you found next to the granny underwear in the back of the department store,\u201d Ms. Pope said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what it is anymore.\u201dBut to get women to plunk down $150 on a maternity dress, Ms. Pope is also creating clothes that they might want to wear after they give birth.\u201cMaternity is a very tiny part of the marketplace,\u201d said Ms. Pope, who recently expanded into baby shoes and accessories. \u201cTo us, it\u2019s the full story of motherhood, as opposed to this very short segment of time.\u201dNonpregnant shoppers might stay with their favorite retailers for years, whereas the average woman shops for maternity clothes for an average of 12 to 14 weeks, Mr. Romano said. As Destination Maternity has struggled, it has also tried to hook women earlier and keep them longer.Mr. Romano became chief executive two years ago, during a time of sagging sales. Over the last decade, hundreds of stores have closed and the company\u2019s share price, including dividends, has sunk more than 68 percent, while sales have fallen nearly 20 percent to about $500 million in the most recent fiscal year.To turn the slump around, Mr. Romano has introduced graphic T-shirts, skinny jeans with elastic waistbands and three times as many leggings, in a variety of prints and colors. The athleisure trend \u2014 in which people wear flattering athletic clothing outside the gym \u2014 means more of a focus on spandex.\u201cThe millennials really like to show off the belly,\u201d Mr. Romano said. \u201cThe funny phrase that people use around here all the time is, is it gummy? Is it soft enough, is it stretch enough?\u201dOne of the stores the company closed was its location in a busy area of Midtown Manhattan, where Christine McCarthy, a 44-year-old experimental geologist, shopped three years ago when she was pregnant with her first child. Ms. McCarthy said she was willing to spend a bit of money to find tailored, work-appropriate dresses, but she turned to the internet when she was pregnant a second time because she could not find a good selection.\u201cI didn\u2019t like what stores were basically telling me to do, which was to just go buy bigger, baggier things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go into Forever 21 and buy an extra large dress and cinch it.\u201dMarie George, 71, remembers when bigger and baggier felt like the only acceptable options.\u201cMy generation was the first generation that didn\u2019t have to stay in the house when they were pregnant,\u201d said Ms. George, whose two children are now around 40.\u201cI remember I had this wonderful red jumper that I actually bought in the junior department, and I think I lived in that,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the time, the things that I was wearing were really ill fitting.\u201dNot so for her daughter, Rebekah George Wornow, a beauty and lifestyle expert who has 5-month-old twins. Ms. Wornow did most of her shopping online and splurged on a couple of dresses for special events.\u201cI remember Rebekah had this striped dress that really outlined her bump, and that\u2019s perfectly acceptable today,\u201d Ms. George said. \u201cI think if I had been pregnant now, I would have looked a lot better.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Increasing CPR Training to Save Lives", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byPersonal HealthIn August, Jeffrey Feig, a 50-year-old financial executive in Manhattan and father of three young sons, became one of the more than 350,000 Americans who each year suffer a sudden cardiac arrest. His heart went into an erratic and ineffective rhythm and he stopped breathing.But unlike 90 percent of people similarly afflicted, Mr. Feig not only lived to tell the tale but survived his near-death experience without any damage to his heart muscle or his brain, an outcome rarely seen following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.Mr. Feig owes his life and bright future to the forward thinking, planning and participation of fellow residents at Pine Lake Park, a bungalow colony in Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., where he and his family spend the summer. The moment he collapsed, fellow vacationers who had been trained at the colony in CPR and the use of an automated external defibrillator, or A.E.D., sprung into action.One person called for an ambulance, another began chest compressions, a third provided mouth-to-mouth ventilation while a fourth ran into the social hall to get the defibrillator, which was used to shock his heart back to a normal, lifesaving rhythm. Just two weeks before this incident, the colony had conducted a training and refresher course in these lifesaving measures.If not for his lay rescuers, Mr. Feig would most likely not have survived. It took the ambulance 10 minutes to arrive; without oxygen, the brain is permanently damaged after about four minutes and death follows a few minutes later. But moments after receiving the shock from the A.E.D., which enabled his heart to again pump oxygen-rich blood to his brain and body, Mr. Feig regained consciousness.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been given a second chance at life and I\u2019m not going to waste it,\u201d he told me. \u201cMy goal is to spread the word to increase the level of CPR training in the population and get every institution to have a defibrillator on hand and people trained to use it.\u201d He\u2019s already begun working with organizations in his Upper West Side neighborhood to make this lifesaving training and equipment more widely available.Certainly, many police officers are trained in CPR. Two New York City officers recently saved an unconscious baby in the Bronx after her mother ran with her out into the street calling for help. But according to Patrick J. Lynch, head of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, CPR training in the city\u2019s police academies remains inadequate. With an average response time of seven minutes for an ambulance in New York City, lives are being needlessly lost for lack of first aid administered by bystanders or the police.If CPR, shorthand for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is immediately applied when an electrical malfunction causes a person\u2019s heart to stop, chances of survival, although small, are doubled or tripled. Given that 70 percent of cardiac arrests occur at home, a family member or friend is most likely the beneficiary of bystander CPR. At the very least, housemates of people with known cardiac risk factors \u2014 like smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity or a prior heart attack \u2014 should learn CPR and review the training every two years.Have someone call 9-1-1 while you start chest compressions, pressing hard and fast at the center of the chest at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute. You can use the beat of the song \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d to achieve the desired rhythm, depressing the chest of an adult at least two inches and, without removing your hands, letting the chest rebound between compressions.If you or a second person is able to perform rescue breathing, two breaths should be administered for every 30 compressions.Thus, the life of a person with cardiac arrest often depends on having an A.E.D. nearby and someone who knows where it is and how to use it. You may have seen one in an airport or stadium; they should also be in schools, theaters, convention centers, houses of worship, casinos \u2014 everywhere that large groups gather. There are both fully automatic and semiautomatic versions ranging in price from $1,200 to $2,500. If a facility can afford a computer, it can probably afford an A.E.D. I found an at-home package on Amazon for about $1,300.Fear of making a mistake should not be an impediment \u2014 Good Samaritan laws in every state and the federal Cardiac Arrest Survival Act help to minimize a lay rescuer\u2019s liability. The alternative is standing by helplessly and watching someone die while you await the arrival of emergency medical personnel.Advertisement"}

Trump.The only prominent supporter of the Republican candidate in the high-tech community, Mr. Thiel is making his first donation in support of Mr. Trump\u2019s election. He will give $1.25 million through a combination of super PAC donations and funds given directly to the campaign, a person close to the investor said on Saturday.Mr. Thiel, who spoke at the Republican National Convention, apparently is unfazed by the storm around the candidate in the last week following the broadcasting of lewd conversations recorded by the syndicated program \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d The source, who requested anonymity, said the investor feels the country needs fixing, and Mr. Trump can do it.A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a message for comment.The candidate and Silicon Valley began on a bad note, with Mr. Trump lashing out at Amazon, Apple and other large companies. His position on immigration is the opposite of the tech industry\u2019s, and he has shown little interest in other issues important to entrepreneurs. A meeting this month between tech industry advisers and Trump advisers was largely considered a bust.At the convention, Mr. Thiel sounded a populist tone rarely heard among entrepreneurs.\u201cAcross the country, wages are flat. Americans get paid less today than 10 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut health care and college tuition cost more every year.

{"Headline": "Banks Bet on the Next Big Thing: Financial Chatbots", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byYour bank really wants to chat.This week Bank of America, MasterCard and several financial start-ups announced new tools \u2014 known as chatbots \u2014 that will allow customers to ask questions about their financial accounts, initiate transactions and get financial advice via text messages or services like Facebook Messenger and Amazon\u2019s Echo tower.The early versions of the financial chatbots generally do little more than answer basic queries about recent transactions and spending limits.But companies are aiming to build the chatbots into full-service automated financial assistants that can make payments and keep track of your budget for you.\u201cWhat will banking be in two, three or four years? It\u2019s going to be this,\u201d Michelle Moore, the head of digital banking at Bank of America, said in describing the bank\u2019s new offering, which it has named Erica.These bots are generally powered by artificial intelligence software that lets them pull in data and turn it into comprehensible answers, in the way that Apple\u2019s Siri attempts to do.Many companies are betting that automated bots \u2014 both in text messaging and voice-activated form \u2014 could become the dominant interface of the future, surpassing phone apps and websites as the way to reach consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the tech industry thinks this is the next big thing,\u201d said Tom Poole, the managing vice president of digital at Capital One.Mr. Poole\u2019s firm rolled out its first voice-activated bot on Amazon\u2019s Echo personal assistant system earlier this year, and it is planning advanced capabilities in the coming months: \u201cIt\u2019s just scratching the surface right now.\u201dA few start-ups have already found success \u2014 and attracted attention from the banks \u2014 by creating chatbots that do particular financial tasks.Digit, a San Francisco-based start-up, offers an iOS and Android mobile app that can monitor a customer\u2019s spending habits and pull small amounts of money from a bank checking account into a Digit savings account several times a month \u2014 with all interactions channeled through text messages. The company has raised $36 million from venture capitalists and saved $230 million for its customers since starting in 2015.Saving is one of the features being built into Bank of America\u2019s offering, Erica. The early version that the bank debuted this week can also track your credit score, look at your spending habits and offer advice on how to pay off bills, along with moving money.A day after Erica was unveiled at the financial technology conference Money 2020, MasterCard revealed its Kai offering, which it will make available to the banks that issue its cards. Neither Erica nor Kai is available to customers yet, and the companies did not provide firm release dates.Among the Silicon Valley start-ups working in the same realm, there is a common argument that the new digital financial assistants should come from outside the financial firms, so that they can link to any account a customer may have and bestow unbiased advice.Bank of America, for instance, would have little incentive to suggest that its customers sign up for a credit card with another bank, even if it is offering a lower rate.Several venture capital firms have provided backing to a start-up, Clarity Money, which was released last week and offers a range of services similar to Erica\u2019s.\u201cConsumers should have an unbiased advocate helping them navigate their financial lives,\u201d said Adam Dell, the founder of Clarity and the brother of Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell.Critics of chatbots have said that even with artificial intelligence, bots will continue to lack the intuitive and empathetic understanding that humans need when dealing with difficult problems, such as financial decisions.\u201cWe all know the technology is not there yet,\u201d said Josh Reich, the co-founder of Simple, an online bank that has not released any bot features. \u201cIt\u2019s just people picking up on a hype cycle.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

Last month, Apple released a software update that put its Siri voice assistant on the Mac.\u201cMobile has focused us on simplicity,\u201d said Julie Ask, a technology analyst at the Forrester research firm.The company is hoping that its new iPhones and other products, like the updated MacBooks, will return it to growth during the holidays.The new MacBooks, which are thinner, lighter and faster than previous models, are primarily aimed at business customers and others who spend a lot of time on their computers, said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting stuff done,\u201d he said.The cheapest model with the new Touch Bar, a 13-inch machine, is $1,800, and the 15-inch version starts at $2,400. Apple\u2019s least expensive laptop, the ultralight Air, is unchanged and costs $1,000, while competitors\u2019 machines running Microsoft\u2019s Windows typically cost $500 or less. The models with the Touch Bar can be ordered now and will ship within the next few weeks.The Touch Bar replaces the function keys at the top of the current laptop keyboards and pops up customized functions depending on the app. In Apple\u2019s Photos app, for example, it allows users to perform simple editing and play videos. In the Mail app, the Touch Bar shows reply options, automatically suggests words and phrases and shows a menu of the user\u2019s commonly used emoji.\u201cI do think it\u2019s worth a moment for a requiem for the function key,\u201d Philip W. Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for worldwide marketing, said after unveiling the Touch Bar.The new laptops immediately drew some complaints from current Apple laptop users because they use a newer type of port, USB-C, that requires adapters to work with older accessories.Apple also previewed a new app for its Apple TV set-top box as well as iPhones and iPads. Called simply TV, the app, which will be released in December, will allow users to see in one place their favorite shows from the other video apps on their device. The app will also feature suggestions of new video content to watch, curated by Apple editors.\u201cWe want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the event.The service is not quite there, since Apple has not yet signed on key streaming services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, and live television shows are still difficult to get access to on Apple TV.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Three Strong-Performing Funds Pick Stocks", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported byMany stock-picking styles have sizzled lately, with growth and value and domestic and international investing all toting up gains. Three of the better-performing mutual funds of recent months found their winners among small- and large-cap growth stocks and Chinese shares.\u201cOur typical company might have only six analysts following it, compared to maybe 50 for Apple,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. The Hood River managers say there is a \u201cresearch gap\u201d that they can fill, thanks to their 20 years of work with small caps.The three met in the 1990s while working at what was then Columbia Management in Portland, Ore. In the early 2000s, Mr. Smoluch and Mr. Marvin created a predecessor to their fund at Roxbury Capital Management. A few years later, they recruited Mr. Swank, and, in 2013, the three started Hood River Capital Management, also in Portland.As stock pickers, they\u2019re generalists, surveying all parts of the market. They will scoop up several companies in a field if they see growing companies benefiting from a broader trend. They have done that in fiber optics, with holdings like Oclaro, Fabrinet and Finisar, all recent double-digit gainers.\u201cFor a while, there was a huge overcapacity of components for fiber networks,\u201d Mr. Smoluch said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had a major industry consolidation combined with accelerating demand,\u201d as networks upgrade to meet the bandwidth needs of smartphones, cloud computing and video streaming.In researching a promising company, they talk with its competitors, customers and suppliers. They estimate they make about 1,000 calls a year. Talks with pharmaceutical and biotech executives led them to a holding in PRA Health Sciences.\u201cIt\u2019s a contract research organization that manages clinical trials,\u201d Mr. Swank said. \u201cBased on our conversations, we believe it\u2019s gaining market share, and the entire industry is being helped along by the high level of biotech financing that happened in 2015.\u201dThe institutional shares of the Hood River fund, with an expense ratio of 1.09 percent, returned 15.01 percent in the third quarter, compared with 3.85 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Mr. Baker builds his portfolio around themes that he sees shaping technology and the economy, like the emergence of artificial intelligence, and seeks stocks with strategies that will play out over three to seven years. Market attention tends to be short-term, creating opportunities for people who can be more patient, he said.He has long held Amazon shares, for example, even as other investors have said they are overvalued, based on the price-earnings ratio.\u201cAmazon has gone, over the last 15 years, from $5 to $840,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019d think people would wear down and realize that looking at it on current-period earnings isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.\u201d\u201cMore than a million people die every year driving,\u201d he said. \u201cSelf-driving cars will never drive drunk or high or distracted. They won\u2019t be texting and driving.\u201dArtificial intelligence favors the biggest tech companies, he said, because it demands lots of data and cheap, powerful computing, both of which they have in abundance.Mr. Baker has managed his fund since 2009, and over the last five years, it has been one of the top performers among large-cap growth funds, returning an annualized average of 18.53 percent. In the third quarter, it returned 11.89 percent. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.91 percent.The fund holds only 36 stocks, a deliberately focused selection, he said. \u201cYou have to choose between the last two to get down to the one you really like,\u201d he said.For several years, worrisome economic news has streamed from China \u2014 reports of a slowing economy, overheated real estate markets and banks fat with problem loans. Mr. Mattock said such macro scares have buffeted China portfolios, on and off, for the roughly 15 years he has been investing in the country.But the \u201cobsession with macro,\u201d he said, has overshadowed a continued maturation of Chinese companies that offers opportunities for committed investors. \u201cWe have a lot of the big industry leaders in the portfolio, and these macro stories meant I could pick them up at a very good price,\u201d he said.In insurance, for example, the fund owns Ping An and China Life, two of the country\u2019s biggest insurers. In e-commerce, it holds Alibaba and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba and Vipshop are leading e-commerce companies.The Matthews fund, with an expense ratio of 1.14 percent, returned 14.95 percent in the third quarter.An article in the special Mutual Fund Quarterly section last Sunday about the strongest-performing mutual funds misstated the expense ratio for the institutional shares of the Hood River Small-Cap Growth Fund. It was 1.09 percent, a net figure that accounts for fee waivers and expense reimbursements by the fund company, not 1.49 percent, which is the gross expense ratio.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Swift Opposition to Resurrection of AT&T Giant", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byOver three decades ago, such was AT&T\u2019s monopoly over the nation\u2019s communications networks that the government forcefully shattered its empire.Now, as one of its successors again seeks a formidable business empire by buying Time Warner, lawmakers, analysts and advocacy groups are closely watching to see if the union, or any that follow in its wake, poses harm to consumers.Acquisitions in general raise warning signs for regulators because of a reduction in competition. But combining a telecommunications company with a media company, in particular, raises questions about whether consumers would have less choice because the conglomerate both creates its own content and provides the pipes that deliver both its own offerings and its competitors\u2019.\u201cRarely is bigger better,\u201d Jonathan Schwantes, a senior policy lawyer at Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer Reports, said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s all about consumers having choices, good choices.\u201dPoliticians of all stripes \u2014 from Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton to lawmakers from both sides of the aisle \u2014 have also weighed in with doubts about the prospect of more consolidation. In a statement, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee said they planned to hold a hearing on the deal.And even competitors like Disney quickly chimed in, urging regulators to pay close attention in their review.At issue is whether AT&T, with over 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and DirecTV offerings, will somehow favor its own customers when it comes to HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. properties like the Batman and Harry Potter franchises.Some consumer rights advocates also questioned how AT&T will use the viewership data that it gathers from its subscribers, particularly if the Time Warner acquisition drives more consumers to AT&T\u2019s services.In an interview on Sunday, the chief executives of both AT&T and Time Warner stressed that they had no intention of limiting Time Warner\u2019s content solely to the combined company\u2019s offerings.\u201cWe\u2019re buying what I think is the premium content creator, developer and aggregator on the planet,\u201d said Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTo buy that and then constrict how that content is distributed doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me. It\u2019s almost illogical.\u201dSome consumer advocates have questioned how effectively regulators have enforced the conditions of the NBCUniversal deal. Still, Mr. Schwantes of Consumers Union said that the programming limitations were the most crucial aspect of the F.C.C.\u2019s ruling and regulators should keep them in mind as they decide whether to allow the Time Warner takeover.Of special interest is that, unlike Comcast, AT&T is a truly national service provider, as well as an international one, given its growing presence in Mexico and Latin America thanks to previous acquisitions.\u201cProgramming is what worried people the most,\u201d Mr. Schwantes said. Referring to the F.C.C.\u2019s limitations on the NBCUniversal deal, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s lowered prices, but thanks to those conditions, we still have an online video distribution marketplace.\u201dPoliticians from both parties stressed that they were concerned about any limitation of consumer choice.\u201cThis oligopolistic realignment of the American media along ideological and corporate lines is destroying an American democracy that depends on a free flow of information and freedom of thought,\u201d Peter Navarro, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump, said in a statement on Sunday.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.And Mike Lee, the Republican chairman of the Senate\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, and Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democratic member of the subcommittee, said in a joint statement that the transaction \u201cwould potentially raise significant antitrust issues.\u201dBoth AT&T and Time Warner professed little worry that their deal would fail because of regulatory interference. The transaction provides for a $500 million breakup fee payable to Time Warner if the takeover is blocked on antitrust grounds, a relative pittance for a merger of this size.Both Mr. Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey L. Bewkes of Time Warner stressed that during nearly three months of deal negotiations, the idea driving the talks was that Time Warner could help AT&T build out its own video streaming service. That service, called DirecTV Now, is Mr. Stephenson\u2019s response to the migration of consumers toward mobile and online video watching and away from traditional cable packages.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing ever-faster innovation,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said in the interview, adding that the rise of competing services, to which his company would continue selling its offerings, would maintain choice for consumers.In particular, mobile video watched on smartphones or tablets will be crucial for future viewers, according to Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Group. Even as Netflix, Amazon, AT&T, Verizon and others seek to figure out broadband-based video, mobile stands as the next hurdle to surmount.\u201cI think it all comes down to mobile video,\u201d she said, adding that no one has truly figured it out yet. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the type of content, but also where consumers watch it.\u201dBut Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Bewkes also stressed that the additional data that they could collect from video subscribers could bolster their businesses\u2019 advertising initiatives. Viewership information would allow for better targeting of ads while also shaping the kinds of content that Time Warner produces.The executives said better advertising could yield more money that would then go to further pay for additional content.\u201cIt allows us to recoup the cost of content through both subscription revenue and also through advertising,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said.Ms. Yong said that in markets served by Comcast, NBC shows tend to enjoy higher ratings, thanks to both the better viewership data available and more robust promotion.\u201cFor consumers, it means these megacompanies are going to track them across their offline and online daily experiences,\u201d Jeffrey Chester, the center\u2019s executive director, said. \u201cOn one hand, they\u2019re going to be able to access a wide variety of Time Warner-branded content on any device, but they should expect that they\u2019re going to be losing a lot of personal privacy as a result.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hating Hillary Clinton: Female Comics Skewer the Sexism of the Likability Trap", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byThe stand-up comic Jena Friedman has suggested a new campaign slogan for Hillary Clinton: \u201cGive uninspiring a chance: Settle for Hillary.\u201dMichelle Wolf, another acid-tongued stand-up in her early 30s, has also been telling jokes about the lack of excitement about Mrs. Clinton. \u201cHer name would be a good safe word,\u201d she said in a set last month at the Village Underground.Remarkably, it\u2019s been a better election for comedy about Hillary Clinton than Donald J. Trump, an unexpected development considering that when Mr. Trump announced his candidacy, it became clich\u00e9 for comedians to declare their good fortunes. But while Trump jokes on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d have been outmatched by the flamboyance of their subject, Kate McKinnon\u2019s caricature of Mrs. Clinton found a pleasingly goofy physical language to reveal the rusted gears of political calculation churning inside her head.Along with impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, which include stops at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and multiple jobs at late-night shows (Ms. Friedman worked at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d where Ms. Wolf is now a correspondent), these comics both seem most comfortable when veering into areas that are decidedly uncomfortable. Their acts do not preach to the converted (they barely touch on Mr. Trump) or traffic in the kind of jokes likely to earn applause.Ms. Wolf, whose first solo show is \u201cSo Brave,\u201d criticizes political correctness as often as Mr. Trump does. \u201cI\u2019m not a pay-for-my-own-drink feminist,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone has their own line, and mine is at the bar.\u201dAnd the title of Ms. Friedman\u2019s show, which has its premiere on Seeso and Amazon on Oct. 20, includes a highly inflammatory gendered obscenity. When telling jokes about abortion and Ebola (an obsession of hers), Ms. Friedman often slowly leans forward, flashing a just-us-friends-here smile, to test how far the audience will tolerate her pitch-black sense of humor. But when she turns to Mrs. Clinton, she adopts a more prosecutorial stance, asking why Americans don\u2019t like this trailblazing politician. After offering suggestions \u2014 too insincere, inauthentic \u2014 she asks her listeners, who shout out insults like \u201csellout\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d\u201cAmericans have more words for why we hate Hillary than Inuits have for snow,\u201d Ms. Friedman says, adding with a deadpan expression that it couldn\u2019t possibly have anything to do with gender. \u201cIf only we could gauge American misogyny,\u201d she mock-mused, sarcastically imagining the perfect social experiment that would reveal \u201cwhat percentage of American democracy would rather have a tweeting asteroid crash into American democracy than a woman leading.\u201dWhat Ms. Friedman is arguing, of course, is that Mrs. Clinton is widely disliked because we live in a sexist society, end of story. Even among Democrats, this is the kind of blunt point you often hear in private, but rarely on Sunday-morning television shows. Loudly asserting what most pundits whisper about is one of the finest traditions of political stand-up.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Shares Hit a High With Promise of the Cloud\u2019s Profit Margins", "Date": "2016-10-20", "News": "Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 Microsoft has staked its future on cloud computing, the next big technology wave for companies, and is now telling investors more about how much money it\u2019s making from the business.It appears they like what they hear so far: Microsoft\u2019s share price hit a high on Thursday \u2014 up 6 percent to more than $60 a share in after-hours trading \u2014 after the company released the financial results of its most recent quarter.The last time Microsoft\u2019s stock was this valuable was back in 1999, when Bill Clinton was still president, Mark Zuckerberg was in high school and the company was heading toward an antitrust showdown with the Department of Justice.Cloud computing represents a big change in the way businesses get access to and purchase software and computing resources because it lets customers rent what they need as they go.For outfits like Microsoft, the method is not as profitable as the old-fashioned way of selling copies of software, a business with gross profit margins above 90 percent \u2014 that\u2019s the total profit a company can make off a product once the cost of making and selling it is subtracted.But the cloud has other advantages, including more dependable flows of revenue. Tech companies like Microsoft also believe cloud computing will help make the overall technology market far bigger over time.On Thursday, Microsoft said its gross profit margin from its commercial cloud business was 49 percent, much lower than its traditional software business, but still attractive and growing quickly. Microsoft has shared gross profit margins for its cloud business on occasion before, but recently said it would do so more explicitly in its earnings statements.\u201cThe more details you get, the better,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. \u201cIt also shows the business is coming of age.\u201dMany products make up Microsoft\u2019s cloud offerings, but revenue from one, Azure, jumped 116 percent during the quarter compared with a year earlier. Azure lets customers rent online storage and other computing infrastructure from Microsoft.Microsoft was initially slow to recognize the importance of cloud computing, while its crosstown rival, Amazon, built a large business serving start-ups and big corporate customers. But after spending billions on data centers, Microsoft is finally recognized as a credible No. 2 in the market.Microsoft said net income for the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30, was $4.69 billion, or 60 cents a share, compared with $4.9 billion, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $20.45 billion compared with $20.38 billion a year ago.Investors focus on a different set of figures that exclude the effect of large revenue deferrals related to Windows 10, the Microsoft operating system from which the company recognizes revenue over time because of accounting rules governing software delivered as a service.Without those deferrals, Microsoft earned nearly $6 billion, or 76 cents a share, compared with $5.66 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue of $22.33 billion was up from revenue of $21.66 billion a year ago. The results were well ahead of the 68 cents a share in earnings and $21.71 billion in revenue that represent the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.There were blemishes on Microsoft\u2019s quarter. The revenue it gets from PC makers who put Windows on their systems did not grow, a reflection of the stagnant PC market. Its revenue from selling phones, a market Microsoft has backed away from, fell 72 percent. And its revenue from games declined 5 percent because of falling Xbox game console sales.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Pentagon\u2019s \u2018Terminator Conundrum\u2019: Robots That Could Kill on Their Own", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "The United States has put artificial intelligence at the center of its defense strategy, with weapons that can identify targets and make decisions.Supported byCAMP EDWARDS, Mass. \u2014 The small drone, with its six whirring rotors, swept past the replica of a Middle Eastern village and closed in on a mosque-like structure, its camera scanning for targets.No humans were remotely piloting the drone, which was nothing more than a machine that could be bought on Amazon. But armed with advanced artificial intelligence software, it had been transformed into a robot that could find and identify the half-dozen men carrying replicas of AK-47s around the village and pretending to be insurgents.As the drone descended slightly, a purple rectangle flickered on a video feed that was being relayed to engineers monitoring the test. The drone had locked onto a man obscured in the shadows, a display of hunting prowess that offered an eerie preview of how the Pentagon plans to transform warfare.Almost unnoticed outside defense circles, the Pentagon has put artificial intelligence at the center of its strategy to maintain the United States\u2019 position as the world\u2019s dominant military power. It is spending billions of dollars to develop what it calls autonomous and semiautonomous weapons and to build an arsenal stocked with the kind of weaponry that until now has existed only in Hollywood movies and science fiction, raising alarm among scientists and activists concerned by the implications of a robot arms race.\u201cIf Stanley Kubrick directed \u2018Dr. Strangelove\u2019 again, it would be about the issue of autonomous weapons,\u201d said Michael Schrage, a research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management.Defense officials say the weapons are needed for the United States to maintain its military edge over China, Russia and other rivals, who are also pouring money into similar research (as are allies, such as Britain and Israel). The Pentagon\u2019s latest budget outlined $18 billion to be spent over three years on technologies that included those needed for autonomous weapons.\u201cChina and Russia are developing battle networks that are as good as our own. They can see as far as ours can see; they can throw guided munitions as far as we can,\u201d said Robert O. Work, the deputy defense secretary, who has been a driving force for the development of autonomous weapons. \u201cWhat we want to do is just make sure that we would be able to win as quickly as we have been able to do in the past.\u201dJust as the Industrial Revolution spurred the creation of powerful and destructive machines like airplanes and tanks that diminished the role of individual soldiers, artificial intelligence technology is enabling the Pentagon to reorder the places of man and machine on the battlefield the same way it is transforming ordinary life with computers that can see, hear and speak and cars that can drive themselves.The new weapons would offer speed and precision unmatched by any human while reducing the number \u2014 and cost \u2014 of soldiers and pilots exposed to potential death and dismemberment in battle. The challenge for the Pentagon is to ensure that the weapons are reliable partners for humans and not potential threats to them.At the core of the strategic shift envisioned by the Pentagon is a concept that officials call centaur warfighting. Named for the half-man and half-horse in Greek mythology, the strategy emphasizes human control and autonomous weapons as ways to augment and magnify the creativity and problem-solving skills of soldiers, pilots and sailors, not replace them.The weapons, in the Pentagon\u2019s vision, would be less like the Terminator and more like the comic-book superhero Iron Man, Mr. Work said in an interview.\u201cThere\u2019s so much fear out there about killer robots and Skynet,\u201d the murderous artificial intelligence network of the \u201cTerminator\u201d movies, Mr. Work said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we envision it at all.\u201dWhen it comes to decisions over life and death, \u201cthere will always be a man in the loop,\u201d he said.\u201cAutonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow,\u201d the letter said.The debate within the military is no longer about whether to build autonomous weapons but how much independence to give them. Gen. Paul J. Selva of the Air Force, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said recently that the United States was about a decade away from having the technology to build a fully independent robot that could decide on its own whom and when to kill, though it had no intention of building one.Other countries were not far behind, and it was very likely that someone would eventually try to unleash \u201csomething like a Terminator,\u201d General Selva said, invoking what seems to be a common reference in any discussion on autonomous weapons.Yet American officials are only just beginning to contend with the implications of weapons that could someday operate independently, beyond the control of their developers. Inside the Pentagon, the quandary is known as the Terminator conundrum, and there is no consensus about whether the United States should seek international treaties to try to ban the creation of those weapons, or build its own to match those its enemies might create.For now, though, the current state of the art is decidedly less frightening. Exhibit A: the small, unarmed drone tested this summer on Cape Cod.It could not turn itself on and just fly off. It had to be told by humans where to go and what to look for. But once aloft, it decided on its own how to execute its orders.The software powering the drone has been in development for about a year, and it was far from flawless during the day of trials. In one pass over the mosque, the drone struggled to decide whether a minaret was an architectural feature or an armed man, living up to its namesake, Bender, the bumbling robot in the animated television series \u201cFuturama.\u201dAt other moments, though, the drone showed a spooky ability to discern soldier from civilian, and to fluidly shift course and move in on objects it could not quickly identify.The project is run by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as Darpa, which is developing the software needed for machines that could work with small units of soldiers or Marines as scouts or in other roles.Unlike the drones currently used by the military, all of which require someone at a remote control, \u201cthis one doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Maj. Christopher Orlowski of the Army, a program manager at Darpa. \u201cIt works with you. It\u2019s like having another head in the fight.\u201dIt could also easily be armed. The tricky part is developing machines whose behavior is predictable enough that they can be safely deployed, yet flexible enough that they can handle fluid situations. Once that is mastered, telling it whom or what to shoot is easy; weapons programmed to hit only certain kinds of targets already exist.Yet the behavioral technology, if successfully developed, is unlikely to remain solely in American hands. Technologies developed at Darpa do not typically remain secret, and many are now ubiquitous, powering everything from self-driving cars to the internet.Since the 1950s, United States military strategy has been based on overwhelming technological advantages. A superior nuclear arsenal provided the American edge in the early days of the Cold War, and guided munitions \u2014 the so-called smart bombs of the late 20th century \u2014 did the same in the conflict\u2019s final decade.Those advantages have now evaporated, and of all the new technologies that have emerged in recent decades, such as genomics or miniaturization, \u201cthe one thing that has the widest application to the widest number of D.O.D. missions is artificial intelligence and autonomy,\u201d Mr. Work said.Today\u2019s software has its limits, though. Computers spot patterns far faster than any human can. But the ability to handle uncertainty and unpredictability remain uniquely human virtues, for now.Bringing the two complementary skill sets together is the Pentagon\u2019s goal with centaur warfighting.Mr. Work, 63, first proposed the concept when he led a Washington think tank, the Center for a New American Security. His inspiration, he said, was not found in typical sources of military strategy \u2014 Sun Tzu or Clausewitz, for instance \u2014 but in the work of Tyler Cowen, a blogger and economist at George Mason University.In his 2013 book, \u201cAverage Is Over,\u201d Mr. Cowen briefly mentioned how two average human chess players, working with three regular computers, were able to beat both human chess champions and chess-playing supercomputers.It was a revelation for Mr. Work. You could \u201cuse the tactical ingenuity of the computer to improve the strategic ingenuity of the human,\u201d he said.Mr. Work believes a lesson learned in chess can be applied to the battlefield, and he envisions a military supercharged by artificial intelligence. Brilliant computers would transform ordinary commanders into master tacticians. American soldiers would effectively become superhuman, fighting alongside \u2014 or even inside \u2014 robots.Of the $18 billion the Pentagon is spending on new technologies, $3 billion has been set aside specifically for \u201chuman-machine combat teaming\u201d over the next five years. It is a relatively small sum by Pentagon standards \u2014 its annual budget is more than $500 billion \u2014 but still a significant bet on technologies and a strategic concept that have yet to be proved in battle.At the same time, Pentagon officials say that the United States is unlikely to gain an absolute technological advantage over its competitors.\u201cA lot of the A.I. and autonomy is happening in the commercial world, so all sorts of competitors are going to be able to use it in ways that surprise us,\u201d Mr. Work said.The American advantage, he said, will ultimately come from a mix of technological prowess and the critical thinking and decision-making powers that the United States military prioritizes. The American military delegates significant decisions down its chain of command, in contrast to the more centralized Chinese and Russian armed forces, though that is changing.\u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that we have an advantage as we start the competition,\u201d Mr. Work said. \u201cBut how it goes over time, we\u2019re not going to make any assumptions.\u201dExperts outside the Pentagon are far less convinced that the United States will be able to maintain its dominance by using artificial intelligence. The defense industry no longer drives research the way it did during the Cold War, and the Pentagon does not have a monopoly on the cutting-edge machine-learning technologies coming from start-ups in Silicon Valley, and in Europe and Asia.Unlike the technologies and material needed for nuclear weapons or guided missiles, artificial intelligence as powerful as what the Pentagon seeks to harness is already deeply woven into everyday life. Military technology is often years behind what can be picked up at Best Buy.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, American defense contractors can be really cutting edge on some things and really behind the curve on others,\u201d said Maj. Brian Healy, 38, an F-35 pilot. The F-35, America\u2019s newest and most technologically advanced fighter jet, is equipped with a voice command system that is good for changing channels on the radio, and not much else.\u201cIt would be great to get Apple or Google on board with some of the software development,\u201d he added.Beyond the practical concerns, the pairing of increasingly capable automation with weapons has prompted an intensifying debate among legal scholars and ethicists. The questions are numerous, and the answers contentious: Can a machine be trusted with lethal force? Who is at fault if a robot attacks a hospital or a school? Is being killed by a machine a greater violation of human dignity than if the fatal blow is delivered by a human?A Pentagon directive says that autonomous weapons must employ \u201cappropriate levels of human judgment.\u201d Scientists and human rights experts say the standard is far too broad and have urged that such weapons be subject to \u201cmeaningful human control.\u201dBut would any standard hold up if the United States was faced with an adversary of near or equal might that was using fully autonomous weapons? Peter Singer, a specialist on the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, suggested there was an instructive parallel in the history of submarine warfare.Like autonomous weapons, submarines jumped from the pages of science fiction to reality. During World War I, Germany\u2019s use of submarines to sink civilian ships without first ensuring the safety of the crew and passengers was seen as barbaric. The practice quickly became known as unrestricted submarine warfare, and it helped draw the United States into the war.After the war, the United States helped negotiate an international treaty that sought to ban unrestricted submarine warfare.Then came the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. That day, it took just six hours for the United States military to disregard decades of legal and ethical norms and order unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. American submarines went on to devastate Japan\u2019s civilian merchant fleet during World War II, in a campaign that was later acknowledged to be tantamount to a war crime.\u201cThe point is, what happens once submarines are no longer a new technology, and we\u2019re losing?\u201d Mr. Singer said. He added: \u201cThink about robots, things we say we wouldn\u2019t do now, in a different kind of war.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Brought Silicon Valley to Washington", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyThis October, the White House opened its doors to a few thousand people for South by South Lawn, a daylong event described as a \u201cfestival of ideas, art and action.\u201d Both the event and its name were a nod to South by Southwest, the annual technology-and-music festival held in Austin, Tex., where Barack and Michelle Obama showed up as surprise keynote speakers earlier this year. The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version \u2014 the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as \u201ccreator\u201d or \u201cinnovator\u201d \u2014 were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy\u2019s anthem \u201cFight the Power\u201d and Parliament\u2019s \u201cFlash Light\u201d across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon. As the sun began to set, volunteers handed out plaid blankets so people could stretch out on the ground.The event felt like the swan song of the first president who seemed to get it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the value of start-up culture. A friend in attendance that day told me that she thought Obama wanted us to feel \u201csome ownership, that tech doesn\u2019t have to be far away or out of our lives.\u201d He wants to leave behind a \u201cnation of makers,\u201d she said. Megan Rose Dickey, who covered the event for TechCrunch, wrote that it left her \u201coptimistic that maybe our country can change and learn to do the right thing.\u201dIn many ways, Obama is America\u2019s first truly digital president. His 2008 campaign relied heavily on social media to lift him out of obscurity. Those efforts were in part led by a founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who believed in the Illinois senator\u2019s campaign so much that he left the start-up to join Obama\u2019s strategy team. After he was elected, he created a trifecta of executive positions in his administration modeled on corporate best practices: chief technology officer, chief data scientist, chief performance officer. He sat for question-and-answer sessions on Reddit, released playlists of his favorite songs on Spotify and used Twitter frequently, even once making dad jokes with Bill Clinton. He stoked deep and meaningful connections with scores of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.Obama routinely pushed policy that pleased the tech-savvy, including his successful effort to keep broadband suppliers from giving preferential treatment to bigger web companies over individuals. Even his tech-specific fumbles seem unlikely to mar his permanent record: The rocky debut of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace that cost more than $600 million to build and crashed almost immediately after it went live, was later brushed off as a technical difficulty. And his administration\u2019s pressure on Silicon Valley companies to aid its cybersecurity efforts hasn\u2019t seemed to dampen their enthusiasm for him. Obama used his ties to the tech sector to foster diplomacy: Last year, he took Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, with him to Cuba as an economic endorsement of the revolutionary powers of start-ups to change the world.South by South Lawn presented an image of America as a start-up and technology as a small-batch industry, full of dreamers and inventors. I was invited to moderate a panel, \u201cHow Do We Fix Real Problems With Technology?\u201d As much as I enjoyed our conversation, the premise felt flawed. \u201cFixing\u201d problems with technology often just creates more problems, largely because technology is never developed in a neutral way: It embodies the values and biases of the people who create it. Crime-predicting software, celebrated when it was introduced in police departments around the country, turned out to reinforce discriminatory policing. Facebook was recently accused of suppressing conservative news from its trending topics. (The company denied a bias, but announced plans to train employees to neutralize political, racial, gender and age biases that could influence what it shows its user base.) Several studies have found that Airbnb has worsened the housing crises in some cities where it operates. In January, a report from the World Bank declared that tech companies were widening income inequality and wealth disparities, not improving them.For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We\u2019ve seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone. (In August, for instance, WhatsApp announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook, its parent company, and its suite of products \u2014 news that gave some Americans pause but caused German regulators to intervene on behalf on their citizens.)As Obama's presidency winds down, Silicon Valley and Washington seem to be getting closer. Just a few days after South by South Lawn, The Washington Post reported that Facebook was quietly talking to White House officials about rolling out a controversial app called Free Basics. On the surface, Free Basics sounds fantastic: It promises free mobile internet for those who can\u2019t afford expensive data plans. But only Facebook and Facebook-approved services would be available through the app, and the app can collect data on those who sign up, both to increase the company\u2019s user numbers and maintain the growth needed to impress shareholders. The same service sparked outrage when Facebook tried to introduce it in India last year; officials believed it would create an unfair marketplace and the potential for discriminatory practices. Fusion recently reported that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gave a company called Geofeedia access to information that helped law-enforcement agencies monitor and target minority activists. The close ties between our government and tech companies have led to changes that Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times technology columnist, told me \u201cwill have big effects for a long time, and we\u2019ll say they started under Obama.\u201dNone of this was mentioned at South by South Lawn. Instead, speakers heralded the power of the tech community. John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader, gave a rousing talk that implored listeners to \u201cget in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise.\u201d Clay Dumas, chief of staff for the Office of Digital Strategy at the White House, told me in an email that the event could be considered part of a legacy to inspire social change and activism through technology. \u201cIn his final months in office,\u201d he wrote, \u201cPresident Obama wants to empower the generation of people that helped launch his candidacy and whose efforts carried him into office.\u201dI left the event as the gorgeous afternoon unfurled into a balmy evening, still unsure what to make of it. But a few days later, during a speech at Carnegie Mellon, Obama seemed to reckon with his feelings about the potential \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the tech world. The White House can\u2019t be as freewheeling as a start-up, he said, because \u201cby definition, democracy is messy. And part of government\u2019s job is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\u201d But he added that he didn\u2019t want people to become \u201cdiscouraged and say, \u2018I\u2019m just not going to deal with government.\u2019\u2009\u201d Obama was the first American president to see technology as an engine to improve lives and accelerate society more quickly than any government body could. That lesson was apparent on the lawn. While I still don\u2019t believe that technology is a panacea for society\u2019s problems, I will always appreciate the first president who tried to bring what's best about Silicon Valley to Washington, even if some of the bad came with it.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: A Shift in the Child Sex Trafficking Trade", "Date": "2016-10-03", "News": "Supported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Welcome to California Today.Is there such a thing as a child prostitute?Campaigners have for years tried to erase the phrase from the law, arguing that if a juvenile cannot legally consent to sex with an adult, neither can she willingly sell her body.She is a victim of rape, they say, not a prostitute.Last week, the movement won perhaps its biggest victory as Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that bans law enforcement from arresting minors involved in the sex trade, except when their safety may be at risk.Instead, they will be treated as victims, and directed toward social services.The governor also signed a law that allows adult victims to have charges against them dropped if they can show they were coerced into selling sex.Together, the measures represent a shift in prosecutions away from children and young women and toward the pimps and criminal enterprises running the industry.The police and outreach groups say sex trafficking in California has grown rapidly in recent years \u2014 concentrated mostly in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco \u2014 as websites like Backpage and Craigslist have made transactions simpler than ever.\u201cBut the reality of street prostitution today is that minors and young women are being sexually exploited out of some type of duress, fear or some type of coercion,\u201d she said.Ms. Biddle, of Saving Innocence, cited a case in North Hollywood that involved a girl, 13, who was caught with a 47-year-old man. She was handcuffed and charged with prostitution; he got a citation, Ms. Biddle said.\u201cNow, we\u2019re able to view these children correctly under the law,\u201d she added, \u201cas victims.\u201dAfter 67 seasons behind the microphone, Mr. Scully signed off by telling the fans, \u201cI have said enough for a lifetime, and for the last time, I wish you all a very pleasant good afternoon.\u201dAs Scully heads into retirement, admirers in recent days and weeks have offered tributes to his legacy.Check out a short selection.For the people of Los Angeles, he is not merely the announcer of baseball games, he is the soundtrack of our lives, the dignified and graceful accompaniment of endless sandy summers, a daily harmonic reminder of the Southern California dream.Although he uses language fluently and precisely, he is not a poet. He is something equally dignified and exemplary but less celebrated: He is a craftsman.Vin\u2019s broadcasts are simultaneously past and present. It\u2019s tonight\u2019s game, but it\u2019s also every game you ever listened to, or every game you ever watched, even if he didn\u2019t call it, because in some sense his voice transports you to whatever time in your life you wanted to go.You\u2019re our George Bailey and it has been a wonderful life.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and attended U.C.

McAtee II, said in an interview. \u201cOur job is informing consumers what a good development this is for them.\u201dBut navigating this transaction will be a test of just how much influence AT&T has in Washington these days, especially as it tries to persuade antitrust officials at the United States Department of Justice, who will be crucial in approving the deal. The task may be particularly tricky as AT&T\u2019s lobbying team undergoes a transition after losing its longtime leader, James W. Cicconi, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush.Issues that led to the collapse of those deals seem even more prevalent now, as the nation closes out a presidential campaign that has featured candidates from both parties \u2014 most notably Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders \u2014 promising to challenge corporate power.The alarms over AT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner stem from mounting frustration over high prices and the lack of competition in the telecom industry, with most Americans limited to one or two providers of broadband services. Regulators are set to focus on AT&T\u2019s powerful control over broadband and television customers since it is the nation\u2019s second-largest wireless company, after Verizon, and biggest paid television provider since its recent acquisition of DirecTV.Time Warner\u2019s marquee content from its HBO and CNN channels and movies from Warner Bros. will lead regulators to also scrutinize whether the creation of a multi-tentacled juggernaut could suppress competition in the technology, media and telecommunications industries. One way the combined company might do that, for example, is by offering unlimited streaming of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to its wireless customers or making it harder for competing streaming video services and television programs to reach AT&T subscribers.Lawmakers have already vowed a tough review of the deal, regardless of the lobbying full-court press they know will be playing out on Capitol Hill.\u201cWe are seeing increasing consolidation, especially scary consolidation, between the content side of the media and the internet provider side,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel.The panel could hold a hearing on the proposal \u2014 with sworn testimony from AT&T executives \u2014 as soon as next month. \u201cWe have a duty to examine this deal,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.The merger sets up a monthslong battle in Washington with consumer advocates, smaller telecom and cable companies, and some tech companies preparing their own assault against the deal.\u201cThe American people want more competition, not less,\u201d said Chip Pickering, chief executive of Incompas, a lobbying group that represents internet companies including Netflix and Google. \u201cMegamergers are leaving them with higher prices and less choice.\u201dInstead, Mr. Ben-Zvi said, AT&T needs to be more specific and authentic to be more effective. The company must confront head-on any questions about the impact its deal would have on its competitors, for example, and make sure regulators and lawmakers understand that, with such rapid change in the tech sector, it has no choice but to pursue a deal like this.\u201cIncumbent telecommunications companies like AT&T are deeply threatened by the emergence of Silicon Valley giants that are poised to take over this space,\u201d said Mr. Ben-Zvi, who is not working on the AT&T-Time Warner deal. \u201cCompanies like Amazon, Google, Netflix \u2014 those are now some of AT&T\u2019s rivals, not just companies like Verizon.\u201dAT&T would not discuss details of its lobbying strategy, including whether it would employ tactics similar to those in previous mergers. \u201cWe are early in the process,\u201d Mr. McAtee, the AT&T general counsel, said.Mr. McAtee will help lead AT&T\u2019s merger efforts in Washington, along with Robert W. Quinn Jr., a policy insider in charge of lobbying who has been at the company for three decades.Both are new to being in charge. AT&T\u2019s storied lobbying operations were long led by Mr. Cicconi, who retired last month. Mr. Cicconi in the past worked closely with Wayne Watts, who served for decades at AT&T, including as general counsel, and retired last year.Together, Mr. Cicconi and Mr. Watts shepherded more than a half-dozen blockbuster mergers in the last two decades.The company is offering some clues about how it will position the deal. Unlike a \u201chorizontal\u201d merger, which unites competing companies in the same line of business, this transaction would not reduce the number of options for consumers, AT&T executives have said.AT&T also said it would not withhold Time Warner shows from competitors. It plans to create an advertising-based video business for mobile devices, similar to the ad business of the web giants Google and Facebook.The biggest advantage AT&T may have is the likelihood that the deal may face little scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission, the regulatory agency that typically gets involved if there are transfers of telecom or broadcast licenses. If Time Warner divests the one Atlanta broadcast station it owns, that would make the F.C.C.\u2019s jurisdiction moot. The merger would be reviewed under a new administration, potentially with new antitrust officials picked by the next president.Even so, it will not be easy. Michael J. Copps, a Democrat and former commissioner for the F.C.C., said that he was preparing, with consumer groups, to battle an AT&T lobbying surge.AT&T \u201chas a huge lobbying budget and the sharpest lawyers money can buy to get this deal approved,\u201d Mr. Copps said.Advertisement"}

Afterward, she tells her co-worker Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), \u201cI want to burn this place down.\u201dAmazon\u2019s \u201cGood Girls Revolt,\u201d set around the same time, takes a group of ticked-off women in a Manhattan office and gives them a match and a big pile of newsprint for kindling. But despite energy and a surprisingly timely premise, it generates only sparks and smoke.The series, whose 10-episode first season arrives on Friday, picks up roughly where \u201cMad Men\u201d left off in themes and time period, but shifts the feminism that percolated in its predecessor front and center.Dana Calvo developed the series from the book \u201cThe Good Girls Revolt\u201d by Lynn Povich, about a landmark gender-discrimination case at Newsweek. Its story involves some real-life figures, including the journalist Nora Ephron (Grace Gummer) and Eleanor Holmes Norton (Joy Bryant), the American Civil Liberties Union activist who will eventually shepherd the equal-opportunity complaint.But first, the pilot introduces three researchers at various stages of wokeness. Patti (Genevieve Angelson) is the wild child \u2014 \u201ca hippie astronaut on re-entry,\u201d she\u2019s described without irony. Jane (Anna Camp) is the prim blue blood. Cindy (Erin Darke), an introverted would-be novelist in a stultifying marriage, is in between them (and is the one who feels most like a person rather than a type).The season takes its time unfolding the discrimination case, settling in as a fizzy workplace drama with plenty of hookups, journalistic capers and office politics.All the elevators, scotch and pheromones naturally bring to mind a certain other Manhattan office in the 1960s. Is it unfair to compare \u201cGood Girls Revolt\u201d with \u201cMad Men\u201d? You bet. Is it possible not to? You try, especially when it begins an episode with Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cIs That All There Is?,\u201d prominently featured in the final half-season opener of \u201cMad Men.\u201dThe true measure of the series, though, is the challenge of every period drama: to make the characters feel as if they live in their own present, not in our past hindsight. This is the biggest weakness of \u201cGood Girls Revolt,\u201d which feels more playacted than lived in.It fills up a bingo card of references \u2014 Buffalo Springfield\u2019s \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth,\u201d a free-love party at the Chelsea Hotel. The title sequence is practically a visual dictionary of \u201cWe Didn\u2019t Start the Fire\u201d-grade boomer touchstones: a lava lamp, a joint, dog tags, a wheel of birth control pills.The series is astute about the way women can internalize sexism (like the magazine\u2019s publisher, a woman who has no interest in elevating the researchers), as well as the oblivious entitlement of the younger male writers, even Patti\u2019s relatively enlightened boyfriend, Doug (Hunter Parrish).That serendipity makes \u201cGood Girls Revolt\u201d a little like a newsmagazine cover story \u2014 well-timed, well-meaning, with a few smart takes. It just misses the nuance and rounded characters that separate timeless fiction from the news of the week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stakes Are Rising in Google\u2019s Antitrust Fight With Europe", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byGoogle is locked in a six-year battle with Europe's antitrust officials. And the stakes for both sides are getting higher.\u201cFor the European Commission, it\u2019s a case of Russian roulette,\u201d said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cIf they lose or merely settle the case, they will look weak. They have to be seen as doing something to stop Google.\u201dThe latest twist in this episode is expected to begin on Thursday, when Google officially starts responding to European charges that it has hamstrung competitors and limited consumer choice.The separate but closely linked rebuttals to European claims are expected to be submitted to competition authorities in Brussels in quick succession over the next few weeks.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.While each response will be couched in legalese, Google\u2019s main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the region\u2019s tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europe\u2019s more than 500 million consumers.Not surprisingly, the company\u2019s detractors \u2014 small European start-ups, some local politicians and American heavy hitters like Oracle \u2014 do not agree.\u201cGoogle has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that it\u2019s still on the right track,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, a group representing the Google rivals that have filed complaints against the company\u2019s perceived dominance.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But that\u2019s what other previously dominant companies thought, too,\u201d he added.Whatever happens, Google\u2019s battle in Europe will not end overnight.European officials must first review the company\u2019s rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest.If found to have breached the region\u2019s rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process.Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.Google may face tougher competition in the smartphone world if Europe forces the company to open up Android to rivals, a possibility if the search giant loses its antitrust case in the region.\u201cNo matter what happens, antitrust is part of the picture for Google for many more years,\u201d said Ioannis Lianos, a professor of global competition law and public policy at University College London. \u201cEven if Google wins, the fact that they are spending resources on this will affect their commercial thinking.\u201dThe search giant has become a boogeyman for many in Europe. In part, that is because of Google\u2019s dominance over many of the digital services \u2014 like online search and smartphones \u2014 that have become essential to people\u2019s daily lives.Advertisement"}

And a dining hall with local organic beets, plus a cook who whips up fresh salsa.But at 9 o\u2019clock on a recent Sunday morning, he and some classmates stuffed themselves into the back seat of an aging pickup truck cab and set out to gather a week\u2019s worth of firewood. Later, other students chopped some of it.Then, at the appointed shower hour, several others built fires to heat the water tanks that do (or do not) ensure a comfortable bathing experience for the 81 students who live in unheated cabins here.Finally, at a chapel meeting in the early evening, Mr. Barrera regaled the students and faculty members with a talk about how he wondered if the place was a rehab facility when he and his family arrived.Staggering as that price is, it would be a whole lot more if the school required janitorial services or a larger fleet of kitchen aides. But it doesn\u2019t, since the students more or less run the place. And that is fitting for a school where the founder, Paul Squibb, declared back in 1932 that he wanted to create an institution free of the clutter that comes from affluence and the need to keep up with whatever everyone else has or does.Eighty-four years later, that philosophy manifests itself in a campus that would almost certainly make the Top 10 list for most spartan among the nation\u2019s private secondary schools. And when it comes to the most elemental needs \u2014 food, light, heat \u2014 the students play the largest role in providing them.\u201cWorking to meet basic needs, and not just having those needs met, is itself an essential human need,\u201d according to the dean of studies, Lise Schickel Goddard, who channeled the legacy of Mr. Squibb in a history of the school this year.Midland students are among a shrinking number of California residents who don\u2019t have to worry too much about where their water comes from, since the school sits atop an aquifer that is ample to supply its needs.Power, however, is a central concern, and a curricular one, too. Each year, the sophomore class is responsible for a new solar installation intended to draw another 3 percent of the school\u2019s electricity needs from the sun.As for food, about 50 percent of the produce that students and faculty members eat comes from the 10 acres of land that they farm organically. Most of the meat comes from pigs and cows they raise. Students work in the kitchen, too, along with the cook and a few other employees.And then there\u2019s the matter of warmth. The cabins have only basic wood stoves. Upperclassmen often do without them, given how much space they take up.The shower fires, however, are perhaps Midland\u2019s best-known ritual, the thing that many visiting college representatives want to see. It doesn\u2019t take much to get one going as long as there is plenty of wood at the appointed hour. But if the day\u2019s six fire-starters shirk their duties, it is their classmates who suffer. They can, and do, give a form of demerit to one another (resulting in additional work duties) when necessary.\u201cWhat I need now is directly correlated with what everyone else needs,\u201d said Duncan McCarthy, a senior. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I need a shower. Everyone does. That was not the case at school before, where all I needed to do was homework.\u201dFaculty members maintain a loose oversight on the various work duties and will hear appeals when there are disagreements among the students. \u201cBut with showers, there is no faculty supervision whatsoever,\u201d said Lynda Cummings, the director of college counseling, who also lives on the school grounds but does not have to have to fire up her own shower. \u201cIf a kid doesn\u2019t do the job and everyone gets a cold shower, do I care? Not really.\u201dMidland does not value suffering per se. But turning teenagers loose with axes, fire, kitchen knives and live animals in the service of heat and food is, to its leaders, no different from nudging them into an Advanced Placement class. \u201cAll of us are pretty poor judges of the limits of our ability,\u201d said Christopher Barnes, the head of school. \u201cSo we try to push them past the limits of their experience while staying within the limits of their ability.\u201dThe trick is doing so without being reckless, which entails its own complex calculations of wants and needs. The cabins have sprinklers mainly because of those wood stoves, but no other running water. Students who ring the bell that wakes everyone up and rules the schedule wear ear protection, but they also may ride around on their bikes without wearing helmets.As always, most discussions of wants and needs (and Midland grown-ups do not shy away from any of them) eventually come around to the following question: How much is enough? How much risk to take? How much dessert \u2014 which is a want and not a need, but it\u2019s something that Maggie Tang, a junior, nevertheless whipped up for everyone 47 times during the last school year.How much internet? Not much or just enough, depending on whether you\u2019re a teacher or a student. The school confiscates phones, but service signals are nearly nonexistent anyway and the school\u2019s Wi-Fi network steers clear of the cabins. Still, the outside world intervenes via Amazon.\u201cWe have a handful of students who are very affluent and who don\u2019t think anything of just ordering anything they see,\u201d Mr. Barnes said. \u201cIt has transgressed this boundary that Paul Squibb tried to create by being five miles up the road.\u201d After one particularly egregious $400 fashion purchase arrived, the head of school gently asked the recipient about its appropriateness.And finally, how much, for lack of a better term, fanciness? Over the years, grateful alumni have inquired about sprucing up the place, perhaps with a tennis program or a swimming pool. But the school wants nothing to do with such things, which are neither simple nor cheap to maintain. Better, it believes, to put money into the financial aid budget, which serves 56 percent of the student body, with an average scholarship of $33,553.Even so, I couldn\u2019t help wondering whether the Midland gestalt wasn\u2019t all so much rich hippie pablum, what with the dogs that some students bring to school (who must pass their own admissions test) and buildings that are partly open to the elements. Recent Stanford and Harvard admissions aside, is it mostly a place where parents send their children for a sort of spiritual delousing?Midland faculty members and administrators have heard it all before. Mr. Barnes, who is new on the job this year, says he believes he may have a different problem. The place is so serious about living its truth that it may be scaring off some families. It is not quite at capacity, and he would like it to be.But when he was running the hiring gantlet and talking about all of that, he received a clear message that he was not to fool with the bathing ritual. Midland students are very protective of their shower fires.Mr. Barnes and his family spent a few years on a small sailboat with no shower before they came to California, so he was pretty sure he knew how those teenagers felt. \u201cIf you can narrow down your sense of need,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can buy yourself an incredible amount of freedom.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Lured\u2019 and \u2018A Scandal in Paris\u2019: Douglas Sirk\u2019s Costume Capers", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byOn DVDAmong them were \u201cA Scandal in Paris\u201d (1946) and \u201cLured\u201d (1947), paired by Cohen Media on a two-disc Blu-ray set, both starring the English actor George Sanders (1906-72). Sanders, Hollywood\u2019s suavest cad of the 1940s, typically delivered his lines with a silken, self-satisfied purr and was much appreciated by Sirk for his sense of supercilious irony.\u201cA Scandal in Paris\u201d and \u201cLured\u201d both feature protagonists who cross over from a particular unsavory milieu to become respectable enforcers of the law. In \u201cSirk on Sirk,\u201d a book-length conversation with the British journalist Jon Halliday, Sirk explains this notion of \u201cshifting identity,\u201d noting that both Sanders\u2019s and Ball\u2019s characters \u201cseem to others to be something different from what they really are.\u201dThe same might be said of their director, who was generally seen as a hack throughout his time in Hollywood. Sirk would maintain that \u201cA Scandal in Paris\u201d was his favorite movie despite, or perhaps because of, its poor reception. The New York Times called it \u201ca pedestrian and listless adventure,\u201d bemoaning the lack of scandal promised in the title; The New York Herald-Tribune\u2019s critic found a lamentable absence of \u201cfinesse.\u201dActually, Sirk\u2019s finesse was so fine as to be almost invisible. \u201cA Scandal in Paris\u201d belongs to a small cycle of 1940s costume dramas (Max Oph\u00fcls and Albert Lewin directed kindred movies) that sought, with varied success, to import European sophistication. Droll and fanciful, it is a picaresque tale with a mischievously understated attitude. Sirk puts no particular emphasis on the ridiculous ease with which Vidocq dupes and manipulates others \u2014 it is simply the way of the world.The movie is also amusingly self-reflexive. Even on the lam, Vidocq pauses to pose for an artist in the role of St. George with his criminal sidekick (Akim Tamiroff) lending his face to the dragon. This painting, of course, proves prophetic. It also adds to the movie\u2019s oddball bestiary: an aristocratic dowager who sleeps with her pet monkey, Satan; an ex-chief of police reduced to peddling caged birds that are carried on his back; and outsize papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 swans that adorn a fantastic carousel in several key scenes. The studio sets are something like Sirk\u2019s playground, filled with bric-a-brac allowing the director a number of antic juxtapositions.An independent film produced by Sirk\u2019s fellow European \u00e9migr\u00e9 Arnold Pressburger, \u201cA Scandal in Paris\u201d features an uncharacteristically light score by the Marxist modernist Hans Eisler, Bertolt Brecht\u2019s sometime collaborator. While one can never be sure of Sirk\u2019s intentions, it does seem as if he entertained himself by treating European history as the stuff of operetta, infused with what he describes in \u201cSirk on Sirk\u201d as an American surrealism.Nearly as eccentric, \u201cLured\u201d could have been titled \u201cAn American in London\u201d (or rather, given its well-worked soundstage, \u201cAn American in \u2018London.\u2019\u201d) Loosely based on \u201cPi\u00e8ges,\u201d a movie Robert Siodmak made in France in 1939 en route to Hollywood, it is ostensibly a psychological thriller about a woman who aids Scotland Yard by answering a series of personal classified ads.While the shadowy mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is suggestive of film noir, Ball\u2019s strong personality and expansive presence, enhanced by shoulder pads and upswept hair, inflect the action toward comedy. Her character is regarded as an exotic import by virtually all the Londoners she meets \u2014 and also perhaps by Sirk, who uses her as a force of nature.As with \u201cScandal,\u201d Sirk seems to enjoy messing with his adopted country\u2019s cultural assumptions. The movie\u2019s prize conceit is that the killer is a poet manqu\u00e9, obsessed with the work of Baudelaire. Perhaps to educate the movie\u2019s presumed audience, Baudelaire is ringingly described by Charles Coburn\u2019s chief inspector in a phrase Sirk could have underlined in \u2014 or even added to \u2014 Leo Rosten\u2019s screenplay, as \u201cone of the most fantastic madmen who ever lived.\u201dNEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Technology Invites a Deep Dive Into Art", "Date": null, "News": "Supported byFor many years, patrons were asked to turn off their cellphones when they entered a museum. Now, they\u2019re encouraged to use them with technologies like augmented and virtual reality, touch-screen tables and customized audio tours. The goal is to enhance the visitor\u2019s experience while keeping the artwork front and center. Here are some examples.Visitors download the app, which sets off audio content when they stand near a piece of art. They may hear fictional characters talking with one another about the artwork or perhaps about something unrelated. The idea is to mimic what patrons experience when overhearing the conversations of strangers.In an audio tour of \u201cGerman to Me,\u201d for example, an exhibition of postwar German art, patrons hear a young German-American interviewing her mother and grandmother about their experiences growing up after World War II.Other guided tours include one with the actors Kumail Nanjiani and Martin Starr from the HBO comedy \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d who are unabashedly confused by much of the art.\u201cThey ask the curator: \u2018What is this? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Mr. Winesmith said.Other museums can use and modify the software. Ultimately, the system will be able to store a large trove of descriptions of different lengths in various languages, sending the message that everyone can be part of the world of art.\u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to say, \u2018Come on in, you don\u2019t need a degree in art history, you don\u2019t even need to be able to see,\u2019\u201d said Susan Chun, the museum\u2019s chief content officer.Then, said John Durrant, the owner of Burrell Durrant Hifle, \u201cwe descend into hell\u201d \u2014 viewing a pair of dagger-wielding, disembodied ears; a man being crucified across a harp; a pig reading the last rites. \u201cCollections are static and still and flat,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the idea of moving an artwork around and feeling it as a living thing in space is irresistible.\u201dWoofbert\u2019s vision is to build an expansive platform that allows a user to choose from a wide array of works.In another technological innovation, soundscapes accompany six objects in \u201cImagining Home,\u201d an exhibition exploring notions of home, place and identity. When you walk toward an embroidered Afghan prayer mat, for example, you might hear Afghan women singing traditional songs while they make the mats.An interactive map tracks museumgoers\u2019 locations to help those who get lost find their way out of the galleries. \u201cIt\u2019s about a culture of understanding audience needs,\u201d said Chris Michaels, the museum\u2019s head of digital initiatives and publishing.\u201cMost of us, if we visit an art gallery or museum and see a work of art we really like, we\u2019ll take a photo of it or its label and save it for later to look up,\u201d said Thanos Kokkiniotis, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief executive.

{"Headline": "Young, Transgender and Acting on TV", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byIn a recent episode of \u201cModern Family,\u201d two children, a boy and a girl, play a round of broom hockey in a living room. In those 12 seconds, the first openly transgender child appeared as a transgender character in a mainstream sitcom.\u201cIt\u2019s the story of Maura when she was sort of having to hide away,\u201d Sophia, the 12-year-old actress who plays young Maura, said of her performance. \u201cThat was kind of a metaphor for trans people having always been there, but hidden.\u201d\u201cMainstream culture is catching up,\u201d she said. \u201cAt its best, that\u2019s what entertainment can do: present a world that glimpses into the future.\u201dThe \u201cTransparent\u201d crew is looking ahead by hiring transgender writers, producers and actors, even as the show is led by Jeffrey Tambor. During his Emmy acceptance speech for his portrayal of Maura, Mr. Tambor said he would not be unhappy if he were the last cisgender man to play a transgender woman on TV. (A cisgender person is someone whose gender identity reflects the sex he or she is assigned at birth.)Introducing young talent to large audiences may be a way forward. Sophia and Jackson\u2019s performances are used as different storytelling devices, and one portrayal is glossier than the other: On \u201cModern Family,\u201d Jackson\u2019s character, Tom, shows that a happy, well-adjusted transgender child interacts with the world in a way that is indistinguishable from cisgender children, while at the same time exposing any preconceived notions held by the adults in the room.On \u201cTransparent,\u201d Sophia\u2019s young Maura, told through a flashback episode set in 1958, offers a more nuanced look at how public frustration and private freedom can be dueling realities for young transgender people.The shows are operating on two different scales. \u201cModern Family,\u201d an ABC show that averages eight million viewers an episode, can be a blunt instrument that has been used to introduce sensitive topics to a wide swath of Americans.Jeff Greenberg, the show\u2019s casting director, said Jackson\u2019s appearance would be a \u201cbellwether\u201d to gauge the mainstream audience\u2019s acceptance of a transgender character.\u201cThere\u2019s a gay married couple at the center of the show, and the show has been a hit from Day 1,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s just sort of a new category and new awareness for writers and showrunners to start to include those characters in story lines, and it happened to this show.\u201dBut for a young actor, there is freedom in acting on a show dedicated to explaining the nuances of transgender lives across age, race and class. Sophia described her personal transition as a yearslong \u201cmetamorphosis,\u201d and said that she had overcome bullying. She said the experience of playing Maura among other transgender people on the \u201cTransparent\u201d set was healing.\u201cI think it\u2019s really going to help a child or people who have a child,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not confused; we\u2019re not ill. We\u2019re people, and we just want to be normal kids.\u201dJackson, who is several years younger, had different artistic challenges on \u201cModern Family.\u201d For instance, he focused on staying patient while filming a scene in a car. His acting advice for other children was simple: \u201cBe yourself, and have fun.\u201dHis mother, Jen Millarker, said that Jackson had been comfortable with appearing as a transgender character.\u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from him and what he\u2019s told other people is it\u2019s just a big part of his identity,\u201d Ms. Millarker said. \u201cHe\u2019s a kid who happens to be trans.\u201dWhen it comes to the ethics of casting a young transgender actor, Rhys Ernst, another producer on \u201cTransparent\u201d who is also transgender, said the crew had taken pains to be careful about finding someone who was not only ready to play the part, but also ready to have that part of their identity recorded and archived.\u201cYoung people in general are figuring out who they are,\u201d Mr. Ernst said. \u201cNot that they aren\u2019t certain, but being trans is complicated, and it might look different for somebody when they\u2019re 14 than when they\u2019re 25.\u201dMs. Drucker added that cultural and economic barriers kept all transgender children from having equal access to therapy and other tools \u2014 including activities as simple as gender play and dress up \u2014 that help them transition over time.\u201cIt was perfect in Sophie\u2019s case because of the support of her family,\u201d Ms. Drucker said.\u201cI had to educate myself,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said. \u201cI\u2019d been doing this for 30 years, but had never come up with anything like this.\u201dIn postproduction, life for Sophia and Jackson has returned to normal. Jackson will play an impostor Santa in a community theater production of \u201cElf,\u201d and Sophia is playing volleyball. But she\u2019s keeping her options open, and is ready for roles that expand beyond transgender characters.\u201cBeing trans is only one aspect of me,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cI can play a trans person; I can play a leaf blower. I see any role ahead, and my future could be anything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Small Factories Emerge as a Weapon in the Fight Against Poverty", "Date": "2016-10-28", "News": "Supported byBALTIMORE \u2014 James Branch\u2019s life seemed destined to follow a familiar arc in the streets that surround the Marlin Steel factory, where he bends metal from sunrise until near dark.He fathered a child while in high school, dropped out, then spent a dozen years selling drugs. He went to prison and, afterward, squatted in abandoned houses in West Baltimore. He worked the fryer at Popeyes and fought the temptation to go back to dealing on street corners that many Americans will know from the television series \u201cThe Wire.\u201dFortunately, things turned around for Mr. Branch.Now 40, he earns just over $20 an hour as a skilled machine operator at Marlin Steel, a small maker of specialized metal baskets used by much bigger manufacturers like Ford Motor, Boeing and Merck. He owns a car, rents a two-story townhouse with an airy backyard and recently watched the daughter he fathered at 16 as she graduated from college with a degree in psychology.What altered Mr. Branch\u2019s fate? There was his own discipline, of course, like completing a two-year course in metalwork between his shifts at Popeyes. Or getting up at 3:45 a.m. and taking three buses to avoid being late for his first factory job.But his success is also because of the unlikely survival of Marlin Steel, a rare breed: the urban industrial manufacturer.Marlin is a thriving factory in a place that, over the last half-century, factories have fled \u2014 first to the South, and later to Asia. That flight haunts the United States perhaps most in its urban areas \u2014 especially neighborhoods that once housed the nation\u2019s working class \u2014 and helps explain why many African-Americans in particular today live in poverty in metropolises like Baltimore, Detroit, Newark and St. Louis.Despite the candidates\u2019 election-year promises, factories will never employ the masses of Americans they once did. Automation and foreign competition will not abate no matter who occupies the Oval Office. Over the last 20 years, industrial employment has dropped by nearly one-third. Only 12.3 million Americans work in the sector today, millions fewer than in leisure and hospitality, for instance, the category that includes frying chicken at Popeyes.But small manufacturers like Marlin are vital if the United States is to narrow the nation\u2019s class divide and build a society that offers greater opportunities for everyone \u2014 rich and poor, black and white, high school graduates and Ph.D.s.\u201cThe closing of factories has taken the rungs out of the ladder for reaching the middle class in urban areas,\u201d said Robert A. Johnson, a former hedge fund investor who is now president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a liberal research group. Many service jobs do not pay as well, nor do they offer the same opportunities for advancement.And as the service sector has expanded in recent decades, less educated workers in big cities have largely been bypassed as demand has grown for well-compensated professionals in what Mr. Johnson calls F.T.E., or finance, technology and electronics.\u201cManufacturing jobs involve a skill base that you develop over time, and that fortifies your negotiating strength,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. But in lower-skilled jobs, the competition is with someone who will do the same work for less. \u201cThe marketplace doesn\u2019t give you any leverage,\u201d he said.Today, smaller plants are particularly important to job creation in factory work, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \u201cMegafactories are the exception today,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cSmall manufacturing is holding its own \u2014 and you are seeing some interesting developments in urban centers.\u201dWhile they may not rival the scale of 1950s assembly lines, these smaller craft-type producers hold out hope for cities, Mr. Paul said, particularly as some companies look to move jobs back from overseas to be closer to customers and more nimble to supply customized, small-batch orders.What is more, these jobs pay people more. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing workers typically earn just over $26 an hour. By contrast, medical orderlies and nurse\u2019s assistants (a growing field) earn half as much. And fast food, a mainstay for Americans with a high school diploma or less, has a median hourly wage of $9.11.For Mr. Branch, this is not abstract economics.\u201cThis changed my life,\u201d he said, standing next to one of the machines he operates, which can cost up to $300,000 each. \u201cI went from minimum wage at Popeyes to making almost 70K a year. They\u2019re proud of me in my old neighborhood. They say I made it out.\u201dWith the rise of Donald J. Trump, much of the economic debate during the presidential campaign has centered on the anger and economics of the white working class in the Rust Belt and elsewhere. That is partly because blue-collar whites were especially hard hit by factory closures in the last decade, largely as a result of competition from China and the savage recession eight years ago.But it was the black working class that was devastated first, by a decades-long decline of manufacturing employment.As the sociologist William Julius Wilson has written in his classic studies, \u201cThe Truly Disadvantaged\u201d and \u201cWhen Work Disappears,\u201d the exodus of factories from high-cost, union-dominated cities to cheaper, less union-friendly locales in the South and West in the 1960s and 1970s played a major role in the breakdown of urban cores.\u201cThe trends among non-college-educated, white Americans today look like a lot like the trends among black Americans in the 1970s that so worried policy makers and social scientists,\u201d said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who researches the connections among trade, labor and employment. \u201cYou see it in the falling labor force participation, the decline of traditional family structure, crime and poverty. It\u2019s all there.\u201dFor Marlin and its 24 employees, all of this hit close to home when riots swept the city in April 2015 after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black resident of West Baltimore, died in police custody. Stores were looted not far from the industrial park that\u2019s home to Marlin. The police enforced a nightly curfew.One Marlin employee, Joshua Wallace, an Iraq War veteran who serves in the National Guard, was called to duty and had to patrol the streets instead of manning the computerized cutting machine. The factory\u2019s night shift, which runs seven days a week, was shut down because Marlin\u2019s workers couldn\u2019t come or go after dark.\u201cI didn\u2019t want my guys to get shot,\u201d said Drew Greenblatt, Marlin\u2019s owner.At the same time, he does not possess squads of accountants and lawyers or foreign subsidiaries that can be used to lower Marlin\u2019s tax payments \u2014 strategies most Fortune 500 companies use to cut their taxes far below the official rate.Then there is the soaring cost of health insurance and other benefits, which Marlin provides, unlike many other low-wage service employers. Factory jobs tend to come with benefits \u2014 92 percent of manufacturing employees have access to employer-sponsored health care plans compared with 79 percent of workers over all.Health care coverage for Marlin\u2019s two dozen workers costs nearly $100,000 annually, up from about $45,000 five years ago, or about the cost of two additional employees. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how much is out of my control,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling how many obstacles there are in our way. But these people are depending on me.\u201dMarlin Steel is nearly a half-century old, but today it bears little resemblance to what Mr. Greenblatt found when he bought the company in 1998. \u201cIt was right out of a Charles Dickens novel,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, describing Marlin\u2019s old factory, then in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. \u201cEverything was done by hand, but there were guys missing eyes and fingers. It was dangerous, and health care coverage meant going to the emergency room.\u201dFor the first three decades of Marlin\u2019s existence, the company almost exclusively made simple, sturdy, welded-wire bagel baskets. As the Jewish breakfast staple exploded in popularity outside the Northeast, Marlin prospered along with it.But by the early 2000s, the bagel craze was fading, and the popularity of the Atkins diet and carb-phobia started hurting bagel sales. China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 presented traditional manufacturers \u2014 and what is more old-school than bagel baskets? \u2014 with an existential threat.Chinese versions of Marlin\u2019s products were selling for $6 each, or less than what the steel alone cost in Marlin\u2019s baskets. The other $5 that Marlin charged, to cover salaries, taxes, equipment and a sliver of profit, was now just red ink.Mr. Greenblatt did what organisms threatened with extinction have always done to survive: He evolved.He moved the factory to Baltimore in 1999, with eight of his Brooklyn employees following him, including one who is still working on the floor. Then he began going after what economists call value-added goods, products that were more specialized and sophisticated what than the Chinese were making, and therefore able to command higher prices.But producing baskets with very specific requirements, or tolerances, as they are known, for automakers or aerospace giants could not be achieved by hand. \u201cIf a bagel falls out the bottom, that\u2019s 10 cents,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \u201cA single airplane part can cost thousands of dollars, so there\u2019s no room for error.\u201dOver the course of a decade, he invested in robots that churned out baskets almost a hundred times as fast as human beings. He trained his workers to operate the robots, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each, and hired engineers to help design ever-more-sophisticated products to win customers and stay ahead of overseas rivals.\u201cIn Brooklyn, eight fellows could do 300 bends an hour,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt recalled. \u201cNow two guys running robots can do 25,000 bends per hour.\u201dToday, in fact, many of Marlin\u2019s robot-made baskets are designed specifically to be handled by other robots.Automation did not mean the elimination of jobs \u2014 in fact, it saved the company. But it does mean producing many more baskets with only a few more workers. So, while Marlin\u2019s revenue has grown to over $5 million today, from $800,000 when Mr. Greenblatt arrived, the company\u2019s work force has increased by just a third, to 24 people from 18 people.Marlin\u2019s comeback isn\u2019t exactly a secret. In 2012, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, visited the plant. Mr. Greenblatt is a well-known booster in industry circles.Less publicized is how the company\u2019s survival has transformed the lives of its workers, even as the Westport neighborhood around the factory, and other poor sections of Baltimore, remain deeply scarred. \u201cSome are dead, some are locked up,\u201d said Edward Derrill, 23, of the guys he grew up with in West Baltimore. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to end up like that.\u201dWith an associate\u2019s degree in computer science from Morgan State University, a historically black college in Baltimore, workers like Mr. Derrill can earn at least $50,000 a year. Besides health insurance, they also have access to a 401(k) plan and two weeks\u2019 paid vacation, a rarity at many local employers.\u201cYou can work your way up and get raises,\u201d he said. Mr. Derrill hopes to become a team leader soon, supervising other workers. Marlin also pays for its employees to go back to school and get degrees in related subjects like engineering, giving workers who never had a chance to attend college additional options.Nationwide and for men in particular, whether black or white, the erosion of manufacturing work has been especially devastating.In the 1950s, says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard, nearly one-third of the men who went to work after high school were employed in factories. Those jobs and that era are never coming back, Mr. Katz said, \u201cbut a job as a physical therapist or a home health aide doesn\u2019t fit the identity of someone who is a welder or a machinist.\u201dAnd while not all the workers at Marlin are men \u2014 the split is about 80-20 \u2014 for many blue-collar men there and elsewhere, the idea of working with one\u2019s hands and building things is closely connected to finding a purpose in life, and in the workplace. \u201cI call it an identity mismatch, and I think it\u2019s a huge issue for men,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cPure physical labor isn\u2019t much valued today, but we need to try and rebuild the service sector for men without college degrees.\u201dBrent Fox, 34, served with the Marine Corps in Iraq and is now the weekend shift supervisor at Marlin, a position that can pay well over $50,000 a year. While the money is a draw, Mr. Fox also said working in a service-type role doesn\u2019t appeal to him.\u201c\u2018You want fries with that?\u2019 No way,\u201d he said. \u201cI like being able to take raw material and make it into something. There\u2019s pride in making things \u2014 you don\u2019t get that in a lot of service jobs.\u201dNew employers have appeared in Baltimore, including an Amazon warehouse that employs more than 3,000. But with hourly wages of over $15 an hour, that is still less than what most Marlin workers earn.\u201cThis isn\u2019t theoretical,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, shouting over the din of metal pounding on metal. \u201cManufacturing bootstraps people out of poverty.\u201d\u201cTry to get a job,\u201d said John Brooks, who has lived in Westport for most of his 63 years. \u201cThey won\u2019t hire people from here.\u201dTicking off Baltimore employers of yesteryear \u2014 like Bethlehem Steel, and Carr Lowrey, a glassmaker that shut its doors in 2003 after 114 years down by the Patapsco River \u2014 Mr. Brooks shook his head.\u201cMcDonald\u2019s, you might not even get that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere used to be plenty of factories here. You didn\u2019t even need a high school diploma to work at Bethlehem Steel.\u201dOnce upon a time, Mr. Branch, the Marlin machine operator, also lacked a high school diploma. He earned one through an equivalency test, and later helped other prisoners earn their G.E.D.s during his time inside.After Popeyes and his course at the Magna Baltimore Technical Training Center, Mr. Branch landed a job at Crown Cork & Seal in a suburb of Baltimore. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone else would have taken a chance on me,\u201d he said.\u201cThe worst feeling in the world was watching my kids get up and leave after they visited me in prison,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI promised them I wouldn\u2019t put them through that again.\u201dMr. Greenblatt had worked with Magna, and when a headhunter steered Mr. Branch to Marlin Steel, it was a natural fit. \u201cI like being creative,\u201d Mr. Branch said, as he entered figures that would determine the diameter and angles of the parts that his machine produces.\u201cGod gave me a lot of blessings,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lived that life on the corner, you never knew which day would be your last. Now I can come home, sit on my couch, look at my big-screen TV and appreciate it because it came from honest, hard work. That\u2019s a great feeling, and nothing can take that away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Taking the Temperature Inside the (Feverish) Cloud", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Autumn is a good time to see what is happening next in the $3 trillion business technology market. In particular, it\u2019s a good time to check out what\u2019s new in corporate paranoia.This time of year, San Francisco\u2019s streets are blocked off so companies like Oracle and Salesforce can bring in thousands of customers for several days of presentations, coffee and performances by Milli Vanilli-era pop stars. In the next few days, Salesforce expects to host 171,000 people, enough that even seedy hotels in the Tenderloin neighborhood cost $600 a night.At conferences here, or in Atlanta, where last week Microsoft gathered 23,000 people, companies state their visions on the current and future state of tech.These talks are, as they say, buzzword compliant, with the companies praising their capabilities in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. They are renting computers in remote data centers over the internet and using the tremendous amounts of data we are now collecting from computers, phones and sensors to analyze and predict how to make and sell more stuff.The best part of these talks isn\u2019t viewing the technology; it\u2019s listening to each sponsoring company brag about how much better it is than its competitors. Each presents number-rich charts to prove it.Who a company names as its enemy and how it measures its relative greatness says a lot about how the company sees its own strengths and the overall stakes in the competition for the world\u2019s computing.For Oracle\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, who used to slam Microsoft or Salesforce at these events, the main antagonist is now Amazon, which has led the migration of business technology to internet-based cloud computing.\u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is over,\u201d Mr. Ellison told his audience in September. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively moving.\u201d Using select data, he described Oracle as better in speed, security and, most important, price. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to pay less, you can\u2019t place the order,\u201d he said.For Microsoft, which has spent tens of billions of dollars building its global cloud computing system, the most important factor is not money; rather, the company is focused on size, resources and its track record.\u201cThe only comparison to our depth and breadth is Google,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview after his Atlanta keynote.Also on Thursday, Google held a coming-out event for its corporate computing effort, called Google Cloud, with a Google-level array of dizzying statistics about its scale and size. The company has had 339 product releases since January, and it has 10,000 engineers working on corporate computing.The company even showed a photograph of its undersea cable to Japan, which is 9,000 kilometers long and capable of sending 60 terabytes of information a second (one terabyte is roughly the size of 500 hours of video).Alphabet, the parent company of Google Cloud, has a capital expenditure of $9.9 billion a year, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google Cloud\u2019s senior vice president. Almost all of that consists of various forms of computing infrastructure. \u201cThat is just shy of Amazon and Microsoft put together,\u201d he said.Mr. H\u00f6lzle said data that would take Amazon eight hours to sift could take six minutes on Google. In one case, analysis on Google was 29 times as fast as on Amazon Web Services, he said.The velocity itself is the crucial metric, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said in a separate interview, and he said it would decimate most of today\u2019s contenders.\u201cThis is like Android versus the iPhone in 2008,\u201d he said, evoking a comparison with Apple. \u201cThere were older phones, the BlackBerry. Android managed to be relevant even though the first versions weren\u2019t great. It wasn\u2019t that it was free, or it had maps \u2014 it was the velocity that it changed.\u201dThe sole exception to industry enemy-naming is Amazon. At last year\u2019s meeting it cited a couple of specific products from IBM and Oracle. But with revenue expected to hit $11 billion this year, it is the undisputed cloud leader. For Amazon, naming anyone else would be like anointing them.But what fun is competition when you have nothing to beat? Amazon\u2019s designated foe is all of the past, and the 95 percent of old-style corporate computing it still has to take to the cloud. The IBM and Oracle products it named were from that old world.\u201cIn the next five years, we\u2019ll see the vast majority of enterprises doing what our forward-looking enterprise customers are doing now,\u201d said Ariel Kelman, the vice president of worldwide marketing at Amazon Web Services. He named Intuit and Netflix among these pioneers.Since Amazon owns the transformation, it figures, the enemy is a failure to transform.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking for a Choice of Voices in A.I. Technology", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byJason Mars is an African-American professor of computer science who also runs a tech start-up. When his company\u2019s artificially intelligent smartphone app talks, he said, it sounds \u201clike a helpful, young Caucasian female.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of pressure to conform to the prejudices of the world\u201d when you are trying to make a consumer hit, he said. \u201cIt would be interesting to have a black guy talk, but we don\u2019t want to create friction, either. First we need to sell products.\u201dMr. Mars\u2019s start-up is part of a growing high-tech field called conversational computing. This technology is being popularized by programs like the Siri system in Apple\u2019s iPhone, and Alexa, which is built into the Echo, Amazon\u2019s artificially intelligent home computing device.Conversational computing is holding a mirror to many of society\u2019s biggest preconceptions around race and gender. Listening and talking are the new input and output devices of computers. But they have social and emotional dimensions never seen with keyboards and screens.Do we, for example, associate the stereotypical voice of an English butler \u2014 think of Jarvis the computer in \u201cIron Man\u201d \u2014 with a helpful and intelligent person? And why do so many people want to hear a voice that sounds like it came from a younger woman with no discernible accent?Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other. Where commerce is concerned, that creates a problem: Is it better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure in the market by going against type?For many, the answer is initially clear. Microsoft\u2019s artificially intelligent voice system is Cortana, for example, and it was originally the voice of a female character in the video game \u201cHalo.\u201d\u201cIn our research for Cortana, both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile,\u201d said Derek Connell, senior vice president for search at Microsoft. In other words, a secretary \u2014 a job that is traditionally seen as female.Last week, Google introduced a number of voice-based products, including Google Home, its version of Echo. All of them use Google Assistant, which also speaks in tones associated with a young, educated woman.Google Assistant \u201cis a millennial librarian who understands cultural cues, and can wink at things,\u201d said Ryan Germick, who leads the personality efforts in building Google Assistant. \u201cProducts aren\u2019t about rational design decisions. They are about psychology and how people feel.\u201dThe company has had internal debates about whether to respond differently on questions to the computer about suicide, Mr. Connell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve leaned to providing information about suicide prevention everywhere,\u201d he said, as opposed to offering no advice at all.But sometimes, if you want people to figure out quickly that they are talking to a machine, it can be better to have a man\u2019s voice. For example, IBM\u2019s Watson, when it talks to Bob Dylan in television commercials, has a male voice. When Ashok Goel, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, adapted Watson to have a female voice as an informal experiment in how people relate to conversational machines, his students couldn\u2019t tell it was a computer.But Watson\u2019s maleness is the exception. Amazon\u2019s A.I. technology is another in the comforting female voice camp.\u201cAlexa was always an assistant, and female,\u201d said Peng Shao, who worked at Amazon on the Echo and is now at a Seattle start-up, building another speech-based A.I. system. Amazon would not comment on its product.Gender is just the starting point. Can your A.I. technology understand accents? And can it respond in a way that feels less robotic and at least mimics some sort of human empathy?\u201cYou need a persona,\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional thing \u2014 people would get red, even get violent, if it didn\u2019t understand them. When it did understand them, it felt like magic. They sleep next to them. This is heading for hospitals, senior care, a lot of sensitive places.\u201dCapital One developed a banking app on Alexa, and found it had to dial down the computer\u2019s formality to make people comfortable talking about their finances with a computer.\u201cMoney is inextricably linked to emotion, enabling and preventing things in your life,\u201d said Stephanie Hay, the head of content strategy, culture and A.I. design at Capital One. At first the app said, \u201cHello,\u201d but that seemed too tense. \u201c\u2018Hi, there\u2019 worked better,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend, hanging out with me in the kitchen. I need her to be reliable and approachable, but not invasive.\u201dWe don\u2019t just need that computerized voice to meet our expectations, said Justine Cassell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We need computers to relate to us and put us at ease when performing a task. \u201cWe have to know that the other is enough like us that it will run our program correctly,\u201d she said.That need seems to start young. Ms. Cassell has designed an avatar of indeterminate race and gender for 5-year-olds. \u201cThe girls think it\u2019s a girl, and the boys think it\u2019s a boy,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren of color think it\u2019s of color, Caucasians think it\u2019s Caucasian.\u201dAnother system she built spoke in what she termed \u201cvernacular\u201d to African-American children, achieving better results in teaching scientific concepts than when the computer spoke in standard English.When tutoring the children in a class presentation, however, \u201cwe wanted it to practice with them in \u2018proper English.\u2019 Standard American English is still the code of power, so we needed to develop an agent that would train them in code switching,\u201d she said.And, of course, there are regional issues to consider when creating a robotic voice. For Cortana, Microsoft has had to tweak things like accents, as well as languages, and the jokes Cortana tells for different countries.If a French driver goes into Germany using driving directions voiced by Nuance Communications, the computer will mispronounce the name of a German town with a French accent. The idea is to keep the driver confident by sustaining the illusion that the computer is French.Local accents can be found in various versions of Apple\u2019s Siri. It\u2019s possible to localize the accent on an iPhone for the United States (\u201cSamantha,\u201d on to the phone\u2019s settings), Australia (\u201cKaren\u201d), Ireland (\u201cMoira\u201d), South Africa (\u201cTessa\u201d), and Britain (\u201cDaniel.\u201d) Apple could not say whether the English tradition of male butlers influenced its British choice.Mr. Mars\u2019s company, called Clinc, makes personal financial smartphone software that answers questions like \u201chow much can I spend on a computer?\u201d It relies on a similar Google-created female voice.He is hoping for enough success that he can eventually test and counter stereotypes with unexpected A.I. voices. \u201cYou need to be at a certain size before you can address these questions,\u201d said Mr. Mars, who teaches at the University of Michigan.But maybe not too big. \u201cI think consumers will eventually be open to exploring different voices and types,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies, they\u2019ll probably stay conservative about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Every episode of the straight-to-series order for Amazon will be available for viewing on the streaming service on Friday, Oct. 14. \u201cWhoosh,\u201d Mr. Kelley exclaimed, imagining the sound of all those episodes dropping at once.Mr. Kelley was here in his office recently, discussing \u201cGoliath\u201d and this foray into on-demand programming. At 60, Mr. Kelley looks like one of those lifelong surfers at Point Dume nearby. (Actually, he was the captain of Princeton\u2019s hockey team, before earning his law degree at Boston University.) On his desk is a yellow legal pad covered with scribbled notes; behind him is an expansive view of sunny downtown Santa Monica. A brief bike ride from his second-story office are two real-life 1950s-era beachfront dinosaurs that serve as series locales: Chez Jay, the dive bar where Billy does his best drinking, and the Ocean Lodge Hotel, Billy\u2019s residence (Room 214) and de facto law office.The deal with Amazon was struck 18 months ago, when Mr. Kelley went to Amazon Studios with his story about a down-and-out lawyer going up against a gigantic, morally questionable behemoth of a firm. There would be crooked military contractors; legal machinations behind closed doors; sun and sand and seediness; and one alcoholic, seriously outgunned lawyer facing the battle of his life, \u00e0 la Paul Newman in Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1982 film \u201cThe Verdict.\u201d\u201cWe went to them first,\u201d Mr. Kelley said of Amazon. \u201cWe were prepared to make the rounds, but they got very enthused and kind of made a pre-emptive offer for it.\u201dMorgan Wandell, the head of drama series at Amazon Studios, recalled that Mr. Kelley \u201cwas really passionate about wanting to do an underdog kind of story. He sort of had us at the pitch.\u201dThe show\u2019s co-creator, Jonathan Shapiro, a former federal prosecutor and trial lawyer, has firsthand knowledge about the world the series inhabits. Mr. Shapiro was the defense procurement fraud coordinator in the United States attorney\u2019s office in Los Angeles (the series begins with a mysterious explosion at sea), and worked with lawyers, many with military backgrounds, who formed the basis of the William Hurt character. He was employed at a Goliath \u2014 Kirkland & Ellis \u2014 for two years, although that firm, he insisted, didn\u2019t engage in the sort of dirty dealings and chicanery that his fictional one routinely does. \u201cI want to be absolutely clear that Cooperman McBride is not based on Kirkland & Ellis,\u201d he said.Mr. Kelley was finding the structure of network shows limiting: \u201cSometimes, just by virtue of having to break it up into acts, you\u2019d have this artificial, melodramatic moment to go \u2018boom\u2019 before you cut to the Dodge Ram commercial, just to make sure the audience came back,\u201d he said.With \u201cGoliath,\u201d Mr. Kelley has nearly a solid hour of uninterrupted programming each episode. Scenes can go longer; characters can have more time and room to stretch out. \u201cBilly Bob and William Hurt are very very patient, cognitive actors,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they pause, when they take a breath, there\u2019s a reason for it. And it\u2019s nice not to have to edit out and truncate a lot of those beats, because some of the richest parts of the series are played with silent looks and subtext.\u201dMr. Wandell compared it with \u201closing yourself in a great novel.\u201d\u201cOr if you\u2019re a Billy Bob Thornton fan,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s a chance to watch an eight-hour Billy Bob Thornton movie.\u201dNot that Mr. Kelley, once dubbed the king of prime time, doesn\u2019t still love the medium where he made his name. \u201cI think I\u2019ll always be grateful for broadcast,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of me would still love those big networks to maybe morph a little bit with changing times to compete with this new form of storytelling. Because here\u2019s what the broadcast networks can do: They can deliver to big audiences in a way that the others can\u2019t.

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Is a Shot in the Dark", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAT&T is a telecom company that offers wireless service in a saturated market, while Time Warner is a content company whose primary assets, networks like CNN and HBO, face tougher times in a cord-cutting world. This merger is presented as a solution \u2014 a bigger company with more options will inherently be better suited to weather the enormous changes now shattering the TV business. Together, they\u2019ll have more leverage and can build new stuff faster.If all this sounds a bit speculative, that\u2019s because it is. What this deal actually symbolizes is that the future of television is increasingly going to be built on lots of bold, possibly speculative experiments.For instance, it does not make sense for Time Warner to offer most of its content exclusively to AT&T\u2019s customers. Not only would that destroy its profitability (Comcast\u2019s customers pay a lot for CNN and HBO, so why would Time Warner want to kill that business?), but it would also be out of step with the future. The notion of content tied to specific distribution lines is exactly what consumers are moving away from when they choose services like Netflix over cable bundles.We are witnessing the emergence of a new order in the TV business. In five or 10 years\u2019 time, that order may become clear. There\u2019s a good chance it will involve some current players \u2014 Comcast, Disney and a merged AT&T and Time Warner will all play a role in the entertainment business of tomorrow. But these behemoths\u2019 size and influence will almost certainly be diminished by new tech-powered players, whose pocketbooks and ambitions seem limitless \u2014 companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and possibly Twitter and Snap.So among the questions now plaguing the industry: Do people still want to pay for TV, and if so, how much? Do people want to watch live stuff, or scripted stuff, or do they instead want to watch whatever is on their Facebook feed? Which kind of company is the most valuable player in the future of the entertainment business?That is where all the experimenting comes in. William Goldman, the screenwriter, once said that in Hollywood, \u201cnobody knows anything.\u201d This applies well to the entertainment business of today, and the AT&T and Time Warner deal is perhaps the watershed example: Every move is a guess, and if you are lucky, an educated one.\u201cI think we\u2019re all trying to figure this out \u2014 how technology and the consumer is going to change, and who are the winners and losers in this future,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, who studies the telecommunications industry at the research firm BTIG.The best argument for the deal, Mr. Piecyk said, is that it diversifies AT&T\u2019s offerings \u2014 now a single company combines content and distribution, rather than just one or the other. When you face an uncertain future, diversity isn\u2019t a bad weapon. If it turns out that in the future, content becomes more valuable than distribution, the new AT&T will have that; if the opposite happens, it\u2019s covered there, too.In conference calls with reporters and investors over the weekend, Randall Stephenson and Jeffrey Bewkes, the chairmen and chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner, added another dimension to this argument: Bigger, they said, is faster.The future of TV, they argued, will depend on a lot of new ideas that are tested and deployed very quickly. These might include new business models for paying for shows, new ways to distribute and market that content, and new technologies and industrywide standards to make sure it all works.Fragmentation led to delays, and delays contribute to consumer dissatisfaction \u2014 but in a world in which Time Warner and AT&T worked together, new products would come along faster, which would in turn push new ideas from competitors, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cThis appears to be about empire sustenance rather than economic efficiency,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group.Craig Moffett, of MoffettNathanson, was blunter: \u201cAT&T faces the twin pressures of a huge debt load and huge dividend that consumes the vast majority of their cash,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIt is clear that they had to do SOMETHING.\u201dBig media mergers are always risky. They rarely work out. But it\u2019s striking how much more things are uncertain today than in the past. So even if AT&T and Time Warner together do not make much obvious sense, well, it\u2019s something.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pentagon Confronts a New Threat From ISIS: Exploding Drones", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State in northern Iraq last week shot down a small drone the size of a model airplane. They believed it was like the dozens of drones the terrorist organization had been flying for reconnaissance in the area, and they transported it back to their outpost to examine it.But as they were taking it apart, it blew up, killing two Kurdish fighters in what is believed to be one of the first times the Islamic State has successfully used a drone with explosives to kill troops on the battlefield.In the last month, the Islamic State has tried to use small drones to launch attacks at least two other times, prompting American commanders in Iraq to issue a warning to forces fighting the group to treat any type of small flying aircraft as a potential explosive device.The Islamic State has used surveillance drones on the battlefield for some time, but the attacks \u2014 all targeting Iraqi troops \u2014 have highlighted its success in adapting readily accessible technology into a potentially effective new weapon. American advisers say drones could be deployed against coalition forces by the terrorist group in the battle in Mosul.For some American military analysts and drone experts, the episodes confirmed their view that the Pentagon \u2014 which is still struggling to come up with ways to bring down drones \u2014 was slow to anticipate that militants would turn drones into weapons.\u201cWe should have been ready for this, and we weren\u2019t,\u201d said P. W. Singer, a specialist on robotic weaponry at New America, a think tank in Washington.Military officials said that the Pentagon has dedicated significant resources to stopping drones, but that few Iraqi and Kurdish units have been provided with the sophisticated devices that the American troops have to disarm them. The officials said they have ordered the Pentagon agency in charge of dealing with explosive devices \u2014 known as the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization \u2014 to study ways to thwart hostile drones. This summer, the Pentagon requested an additional $20 million from Congress to help address the problem.In recent months, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency both rushed to complete classified assessments about the Islamic State\u2019s drone use. And the secretary of the Army, Eric Fanning, recently assigned a special office he had created to respond to emerging threats and to study how to stop drones.Unlike the American military, which flies drones as large as small passenger planes that need to take off and land on a runway, the Islamic State is using simpler, commercially available drones such as the DJI Phantom, which can be purchased on Amazon. The group attaches small explosive devices to them, essentially making them remotely piloted bombs.\u201cThis is an enemy that learns as it goes along,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland, the top American military commander in Iraq until August.Of the three known drone attacks in Iraq, only the one involving the Kurdish soldiers caused casualties. \u201cThe explosive device inside was disguised as a battery \u2014 there was a very small amount of explosives in it, but it was enough to go off and kill them,\u201d said a senior American official who had been provided with a detailed report on the episode.Last week, the Islamic State used a drone strapped with an explosive to attack a checkpoint. The device did not kill anyone but destroyed buildings. On Oct. 1, Iraqi troops shot down a drone that was only a foot long and a foot wide but had a small explosive attached to the top.\u201cThe drone could only hold one small bomb in the middle of it \u2014 no bigger load could be on it,\u201d said Gen. Tahseen Sayid, a senior Iraqi officer in the area.The Islamic State first used drones to film suicide car bomb attacks, which militants have posted online. But American and Iraqi commanders said that earlier this year it became clear the group was using drones to help them on the battlefield.In March, General MacFarland and American military commanders in Baghdad received an intelligence report that the Islamic State had posted surveillance video online that had been taken by a small drone. The video footage showed a newly created series of bases in northern Iraq where American and Iraqi forces were stationed.Just days after the video was put up, a Katyusha rocket landed in the middle of an outpost of more than 100 American Marines, killing one who was rushing to get others to shelter in a nearby bunker. The strike was so accurate that military officials described it as a \u201cgolden shot\u201d to pierce the defenses put in place, and there was speculation that a drone was used in the targeting.General MacFarland said he did not believe the footage \u2014 which did not include positional data like GPS locations \u2014 helped militants.\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be used for precise targeting,\u201d he said in a recent email exchange. \u201cIts value was limited to propaganda.\u201dIn the weeks afterward, American forces in the area unleashed a barrage of retaliatory airstrikes against Islamic State fighters who had launched the drone.\u201cWhatever capability they had, they lost a lot of it,\u201d General MacFarland said, referring to the Islamic State\u2019s operations in the area.Throughout the summer, however, American troops in Iraq and Syria reported seeing small drones hovering near their bases and around the front lines in northern Iraq. In August, the Islamic State called on its followers to jury-rig small store-bought drones with grenades or other explosives and use them to launch attacks at the Olympics. There were ultimately no such attacks at the Games.On the battlefields in Iraq and Syria, the United States has dedicated resources to take out the Islamic State\u2019s drone capabilities. In the past 18 months, the United States has launched at least eight airstrikes that have destroyed Islamic State drones on the ground, according to news releases from the American military command in Baghdad.Despite these efforts, military analysts believe that drones will continue to be a problem in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. A new report by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point says that in the future, off-the-shelf drones used by terrorist groups will be able to carry heavier payloads, fly and loiter longer, venture farther from their controller and employ secure communications links. The center provided an advance copy of the report to The New York Times.\u201cThe number and sophistication of drones used is also likely to enhance the scope and seriousness of the threat,\u201d said Don Rassler, the center\u2019s director of strategic initiatives.Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Fate: Marc Benioff of Salesforce Addresses Acquisition Talk", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, showed up onstage on Wednesday afternoon at his biggest customer event of the year to talk up his business technology company\u2019s products and strategy.But what was arguably the higher-stakes meeting was held later that day. At the plush St. Regis San Francisco Hotel, Mr. Benioff presided over a gathering with Wall Street analysts and investors. His aim: to assuage their concerns about his plan to buy Twitter, the struggling social media company.\u201cWe look at a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Benioff told the room, without directly mentioning Twitter. \u201cThe number we acquire is very few.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cit gives us ideas\u201d to look at companies.At first glance, the two companies could not be more different. Twitter is where celebrities, politicians and countless other individuals broadcast their thoughts in 140-character messages. Salesforce, on the other hand, makes online software for salespeople and marketers.Yet Twitter would fit into a vision that Mr. Benioff has had for Salesforce, which he founded in 1999, as a company that can help enterprises with all of their customer needs. Twitter, in Mr. Benioff\u2019s eyes, is already a powerful customer service tool that airlines, restaurants, banks and many other companies use to field consumer complaints and requests. Companies can also use what people post on Twitter to glean consumer habits.\u201cThis is a huge messaging and communications service,\u201d Mr. Benioff, who turned 52 last month, said on Wednesday in an interview on his way to the St. Regis. He added, \u201cI use mergers and acquisition activity to think about the market.\u201dMr. Benioff faces a battery of challenges in buying Twitter. Skeptical investors have pushed Salesforce stock down about 5 percent since news broke that the company was considering bidding for the social media company. Behind the scenes, investors have been grousing about a potential purchase. Any deal would very likely be Salesforce\u2019s largest, with Twitter valued at about $14 billion. Salesforce, which is unprofitable, has a market capitalization of about $48 billion.Twitter investors appear dubious, too. The company\u2019s stock dropped more than 20 percent on Thursday as speculation about other suitors seemed to dissipate.\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMr. Benioff acknowledged that Salesforce would face difficulties in taking over Twitter, given that Salesforce sells software to businesses while Twitter is a consumer technology company. The chief executive, who is an activist in areas like gay rights and gender equality, also said he was troubled by the amount of hate speech on Twitter.But it is not unusual for Mr. Benioff to go against the grain. A San Francisco native, he worked at Oracle, the business software company, for years before founding Salesforce as an online software firm in 1999, when online software was still unproven.\u201cMarc wants to be well thought of, to feel like he\u2019s doing things the right way,\u201d said Adam Bosworth, a Salesforce executive who left in August to work at Amazon. Mr. Bosworth recalled once disagreeing with Mr. Benioff on a management issue and sending him an email with the subject line, \u201cYou are not being a mensch.\u201d\u201cIt was the fastest response I ever got from him,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.Much of the data that Salesforce is gaining through acquisitions can help power artificial intelligence, which Mr. Benioff says will soon be everywhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought about a dozen A.I. companies, built whole new teams,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Without LinkedIn, Mr. Benioff turned his sights to Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to rev up its growth.Mr. Benioff, who is himself a power user of Twitter, said on Wednesday that while it was essential that Salesforce be in A.I., there was more to Twitter than that.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge customer-service platform,\u201d used by companies like Dell, Apple and Bank of America, he said in the interview on the way to the St. Regis. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reason to buy it, but it\u2019s a reason to look at it. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m buying it, but I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not buying it.\u201dLater, at the investor meeting where analysts shied from mentioning the name Twitter, Mr. Benioff tried to explain where he was coming from. \u201cI see things in a different kind of way,\u201d he told them. \u201cI hope someday to sit down and say how I think about that which shall not be named.\u201dEventually, though, Mr. Benioff could not resist a more direct reference to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. \u201cI wish Jack well with his company,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at the end of the investor meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, Lagging Amazon, Races Across the Threshold Into the Home", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Amazon introduced its Echo device in late 2014, Google executives were caught off guard. For years, they had predicted the creation of a virtual assistant that would answer questions or help accomplish tasks, and they focused on building that capability into smartphones and tablets.Amazon took a different approach and created the Echo, a device with the sole purpose of showcasing the company\u2019s artificially intelligent assistant software, called Alexa. Since then, the Echo has become a surprise hit, vaulting Amazon ahead of Google in a race to build technology that interacts as humans do. Users can ask Alexa to play music, dim the lights or call for a ride.For Google, whose name is synonymous with finding answers on the internet, Amazon\u2019s success with Alexa exposed a vulnerability. Google, along with its parent company, Alphabet, has invested heavily to solve the technology world\u2019s toughest problems, but it often trails competitors in turning those advancements into products and businesses.On Tuesday, Google is expected to finally unveil its answer to the Echo, alongside new smartphones and tablets. The Google Home device, which looks a little like an air freshener, is expected to go on sale later this month.Google Home is powered by what Google calls the Assistant, which uses artificial intelligence to understand what users are saying and respond conversationally with the best answers. Google introduced a messaging app last month that incorporates the Assistant, and the company plans to add the feature to its latest smartphones and tablets.Given the newness of the market for artificially intelligent home gadgets, Google has plenty of time to close the gap. The company believes it can win over consumers with a smarter digital assistant that builds on its stronghold in search and years of research in artificial intelligence.But the fact that Google was outmaneuvered by Amazon \u2014 not Apple, which builds its own digital assistant technology, called Siri, into its mobile products \u2014 has caused head-scratching throughout the technology industry. Amazon has a notoriously uneven track record in making hardware, with some hits, like the Kindle e-reader, and spectacular whiffs, like the Fire Phone.\u201cAmazon is the accidental winner here,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cAmazon got there first, which is superimpressive, and it has been a huge hit.\u201dGoogle is a leader in natural language processing \u2014 the ability to turn spoken words into terms that computers can digest \u2014 and its search engine is the starting point for how most people get answers on the internet. In fact, the company says 20 percent of Google searches on mobile phones are done by voice.So why didn\u2019t Google create an Echo-like device before Amazon?In part, Google was hindered by a balkanized structure that prevented different groups within the company from working together, according to four current and former employees.Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., had a large team working on voice search but its focus was on an app for smartphones. The company had a separate team working on the Android operating system, which runs on smartphones, tablets and internet-connected home devices, and they were building virtual assistant technology into mobile devices.Google bought Nest Labs, a manufacturer of internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors, for $3.2 billion in 2014 as an entree into the home. But the unit seldom collaborated with the rest of the company. And other Google hardware divisions responsible for building smartphones, tablets, Chromebook computers, Wi-Fi routers and Chromecast devices to stream video were focused on updating products.A competitor for the Echo, it seems, fell through the cracks.This is not the first time Amazon has jumped ahead of Google, despite the search company\u2019s considerable technological edge.From its inception, Google has devoted enormous resources to operating efficient data centers to power its many services. But it was Amazon that identified an opportunity in renting out its technology infrastructure to companies in need of computing power, storage and data analysis. That business, called Amazon Web Services, is now on pace to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year, while Google is playing catch-up.A lack of focus can at times compound these issues. Google encourages its employees to spend 20 percent of their time pursuing new ideas beyond their usual responsibilities. Products like Gmail emerged from this policy, but it also fosters a mind-set that, according to one former employee, leads Google to chase too many ideas.\u201cPart of the problem is that it has a scattershot approach to things,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. When pursuing new ideas, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t always make big bets strategically.\u201dGoogle has spent seven years working on self-driving cars, for example, and it is still not clear how the company plans to cash in on its work. By contrast, Uber, which started as a company around the time that Google started work on autonomous vehicles, is already testing self-driving cars to pick up customers in Pittsburgh.Despite its many successes, Google has a spotty history of creating devices. In 2012, Google introduced an internet-connected speaker called the Nexus Q. The vision was for the device to plug into a home entertainment system for streaming music or video, a sort of hybrid of an Apple TV and a Sonos speaker. But Google killed the product before it even started shipping it to consumers.Also in 2012, Google bought the phone manufacturer Motorola for $12.5 billion. The next year, it introduced the Moto X, the first smartphone equipped with a listening chip so users could bring the phone to life by uttering the words \u201cO.K. Google.\u201d It has pushed this feature into the latest phones running its Android operating system. Apple\u2019s more recent iPhones and iPads have a similar feature, activated by the words \u201cHey Siri.\u201dBut what makes the Amazon Echo stand out is a technology called a far-field microphone that can make out someone\u2019s voice from across a room, even when there is background clatter. And the Echo is always in position to listen for the so-called wake word \u2014 Alexa \u2014 whereas phones are often tucked away in pockets and bags. According to a former employee, Google has tinkered with far-field audio, but its focus was on the car, not a home device.Amazon invested in artificial intelligence and speech technologies in the years before unveiling Echo, but its most crucial asset was its strength in the cloud computing market, which it dominates with Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S.The vast majority of Echo\u2019s intelligence is contained in A.W.S., and most of the apps that developers have built for Alexa run on the cloud service. \u201cThe most important architectural vision is that it\u2019s all in the cloud,\u201d Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices and services, said in an interview this year.Amazon says tens of thousands of developers are creating skills for Alexa, more than 3,000 of which have been released so far. And thousands of developers are working to incorporate Alexa\u2019s voice capabilities into their hardware products. Last month, GE Appliances announced an Alexa app that lets people preheat a connected oven with voice commands.Chris Herbert, chief executive of a start-up called TrackR that makes wireless beacons for finding misplaced keys and wallets, recently released an app for Alexa that allows people to find their items with voice commands.Mr. Herbert said he had looked at the voice offerings from both Google and Apple, but neither company yet offered the same range of capabilities as Amazon, because they viewed it as an add-on feature to phones as opposed to a stand-alone computer.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling to me,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Goliath,\u2019 Billy Bob Thornton Plays a Down-and-Out David", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byWas this David E. Kelley, who, with Jonathan Shapiro, created and wrote the show, getting in a little dig at himself? You could imagine \u2014 actually, it was hard not to imagine \u2014 Mr. Kelley saying: \u201cI used to handle three shows at a time and write 50 or 60 episodes a year. I think I can handle a 10-episode web series.\u201dAs a group, the most successful of the old-school broadcast-network producers \u2014 people like Dick Wolf, Chuck Lorre and Jerry Bruckheimer \u2014 have resisted the lure of the streaming services. Mr. Kelley used to be in that league, but his last real hit was \u201cBoston Legal\u201d eight years ago. So when \u201cGoliath\u201d was announced, you could hope that the creative freedom offered by a short-season online production (which Amazon took straight to series, without requiring a pilot) would have a rejuvenating effect. Through two episodes, the jury is still out.It\u2019s a David and Goliath story, as the title half-indicates, though the main character, Mr. Thornton\u2019s Billy McBride, is definitely the David. The action begins with a series of quick scenes establishing how down and out he is: released from jail, missing a court date, told to shape up by his teenage daughter, sitting on a beachside bench and pulling a bottle of whiskey out of a paper bag.That opening is promising \u2014 quick, textured, with a sense of place and a reliably prickly performance from Mr. Thornton. And as the story unspools, the part of it in which McBride figures continues to be entertaining, in a been-there-done-that kind of way \u2014 it\u2019s reasonably well executed Los Angeles noir, shot on picturesque Santa Monica and Venice locations, and carrying just the faintest echoes of John D. MacDonald and \u201cThe Long Goodbye.\u201dBut then there\u2019s the other half of the show\u2019s odd bordering-on-bizarre split personality. The Goliath of the story is a behemoth of a law firm where McBride was once a partner; whenever the scene shifts there, the tone and rhythm change.Suddenly we\u2019re in an arch, slick, hyped-up TV legal show, with lawyers marching in formation and exchanging withering put-downs. The staff includes a dragon-lady associate (Molly Parker), a faint reminder of \u201cAlly McBeal\u201d; and a young lawyer (Olivia Thirlby) with an anxiety disorder who stutters in court.In contrast to Mr. Thornton\u2019s naturalistic portrayal of McBride, we get William Hurt breathing hard as McBride\u2019s nemesis, a ghoulish figure with a scarred face who sits in a red-lighted room watching surveillance video of his employees. Clearly, Mr. Kelley and Mr. Shapiro are trying to accentuate the contrast between their David and their Goliath, but they have ended up with what feels like two different shows.Some things we can probably count on. Mr. Kelley and Mr. Shapiro (they worked together on \u201cThe Practice\u201d and \u201cBoston Legal\u201d) will serve up a snappy piece of dialogue every few minutes. Mr. Thornton, even in one of his more routine performances, will be a pleasure to watch.And while many of the actresses have trouble animating their slightly cartoonish roles \u2014 Ms. Parker, Ms. Thirlby and Tania Raymonde as a combination prostitute and legal secretary \u2014 Nina Arianda will continue to be the best reason to watch the show.She\u2019s fearless and hilarious as the low-rent lawyer and real estate agent who drags McBride into the case. When she deadpans, \u201cHe\u2019ll be here, the hooker just texted,\u201d it could be \u201cL.A. Law\u201d all over again.A television review on Friday about the new Amazon series \u201cGoliath\u201d included an inaccurate discussion of the show\u2019s plot structure. The critic mistakenly watched the first two episodes out of order.Advertisement"}

These six don\u2019t have that problem, though you might just get tired of panicked British people breathing heavily while furiously typing.The biggest issue facing these new episodes is bloat.

{"Headline": "Tim Tebow Comforts Man Who Collapses After Game", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 From the baseball diamond at Camelback Ranch, the University of Phoenix Stadium rises like a silvery moon. The stadium was the site of one of Tim Tebow\u2019s many football triumphs. After the 2006 season, he was a member of the Florida team that upset top-ranked Ohio State in the national championship game.Tebow, a reserve quarterback, scored two touchdowns, one by air and the other with his legs. Nearly a decade later, Tebow, 29, who spent three seasons in the N.F.L., took a step Tuesday in his quest to earn respect on another team, in a different sport, when he made his debut in the Arizona Fall League.Playing outfield for the Scottsdale Scorpions, Tebow, a Mets prospect, went 0 for 3 at the plate, with three ground outs. The most solid contact Tebow made was with the left-field wall, which he crashed into face first while in pursuit of a fly ball that had eluded his outstretched glove.\u201cI\u2019ve been hit harder,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m O.K.\u201dTebow\u2019s afternoon took an intense turn after the game when a man standing in a crush of fans seeking autographs along the third-base line collapsed and appeared to have a seizure. Tebow stopped signing and cautiously made his way over to where people had gathered. He sat on the concrete retaining wall that separates the field from the first row of seats and prayed silently as a medic in a Bryce Harper T-shirt and a Detroit Tigers baseball cap tended to the man.As the man was slowly coming to, Tebow leaned over and placed his right hand on the man\u2019s left knee while Daniel Kelly, a former Jets scout who left football to become a debt counselor and minister, prayed out loud. Kelly, who was wearing a Mets Tebow jersey, attended the game with his wife, Samantha, to celebrate his 43rd birthday, and had been seated next to the fan who collapsed.As the man regained his bearings, Tebow engaged him in conversation while waiting for paramedics from the Phoenix Fire Department to arrive. The man had dropped a baseball as he collapsed and it was near the crook of his arm as he lay on his right side with his head resting on a black backpack. Tebow leaned over, picked up the ball and signed it. He returned it to him saying, \u201cI signed it for you if you want it.\u201d He also took off the gray sweat bands that he had on each wrist, signed them and gave them to the man.Tebow asked him where he was from (Hayesville, N.C.) and found out they had a friend in common whom Tebow described as \u201ca really nice kid.\u201d He asked the man, who said his first name was Brendan, if he was a Batman fan. When he answered in the affirmative, Tebow asked him if he had seen the latest Batman movie (he had) and what he thought of the ending. He found out that the man worked at Amazon. \u201cNice,\u201d Tebow replied. \u201cThey\u2019re taking over!\u201d The man also volunteered that he learned this year that he had a brain tumor. \u201cI\u2019ll be praying for you, O.K.,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cBy name.\u201dHe sat talking with the man for roughly 15 minutes. \u201cSorry this happened,\u201d the man said. \u201cGlad I got the chance to meet you,\u201d Tebow replied.The man, aware that Tebow works as a college football analyst, shifted the conversation to that topic. Tebow asked for his favorite college team and he replied, \u201cBulldogs.\u201d Raising his voice in mock anger, Tebow said: \u201cAre you kidding me? I don\u2019t know how to respond to that.\u201d He listened intently as the man told him about a major recruit on Georgia\u2019s radar.Tebow left for the Scorpions team bus only after paramedics arrived and shooed everybody out of the way.In a scrum with 21 members of the news media before he started signing autographs, Tebow was asked if he received overtures from N.F.L. teams after 2012, his last season in the league, to gauge his interest in playing a position other than quarterback. He said he had. So why did he say no?\u201cJust because it\u2019s an opportunity in the N.F.L. that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s in my heart,\u201d Tebow said. He loved playing quarterback and when that door closed, he sought new challenges \u2014 and baseball is his latest.\u201cYou definitely miss football sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thankful I get to talk about it every weekend and have fun. Yeah, there are times it\u2019s like, man, I love that sport, it\u2019s super fun, but this is also a lot of fun.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated a part of the name of the football stadium near the ballpark.

{"Headline": "AT&T Agrees to Buy Time Warner for $85.4 Billion", "Date": "2016-10-22", "News": "Supported byIn the world of media, bigger remains better.So in the wake of Comcast\u2019s $30 billion takeover of NBCUniversal and Verizon Communications\u2019 serial acquisitions of the Huffington Post and Yahoo, AT&T has bought one of the remaining crown jewels of the entertainment industry.The telecommunications giant agreed on Saturday to buy Time Warner, the home of HBO and CNN, for about $85.4 billion, creating a new colossus capable of both producing content and distributing it to millions with wireless phones, broadband subscriptions and satellite TV connections.AT&T and Time Warner said both of their boards unanimously approved the deal.\u201cWhen Jeff and I started talking, it became clear to us very quickly that we shared a very similar vision,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, told reporters on a conference call on Saturday, referring to Jeffrey Bewkes, Time Warner\u2019s chief executive. \u201cTime Warner, we believe, is the clear leader in premium content.\u201dMost analysts and investors have noted that Time Warner was part of one of the biggest merger follies of all time, when it sold itself to AOL at the height of the dot-com boom. That combination \u2014 also pitched on the idea of uniting content and the internet \u2014 proved unwieldy and was later stripped apart to a few core businesses.This time, however, the rise of online outlets like Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube and the shift of younger customers from traditional media have pressured media companies to seek out consolidation partners. These media companies are anticipating drops in fees from cable service providers and declining revenue from advertisers. Getting bigger would give them more negotiating leverage with both service providers and with advertisers.Among their top priorities is finding new ways of reaching consumers. HBO, for example, offers its HBO Now service to deliver shows like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld\u201d to consumers who do not have cable subscriptions.Even Disney, widely seen as the strongest content company, with brands like Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, has been grappling with how to overcome challenges facing its network channels. ESPN, which long served as a growth engine, is now facing declining ratings and subscriber erosion, putting advertising sales into question.\u201cThe biggest thing that we\u2019re trying to do now is figure out what technology\u2019s role is in distributing the great content that we have,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, said at a presentation at Boston College on Oct. 5.Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBC has proved a model for this new world of media deal-making. While the cable giant has occasionally been scrutinized for possible regulatory violations, NBCUniversal has generally thrived under its current ownership, with NBC enjoying a ratings comeback and Universal delivering a wide range of hit films, from blockbusters like \u201cJurassic World\u201d to dramas like \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201dStill, Time Warner\u2019s deal with AT&T is likely to face tough scrutiny from government regulators increasingly skeptical of power being consolidated among a few titans. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president, indicated on Saturday that he would seek to block the merger if elected \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dOver the last decade, Time Warner has spent significant time selling or spinning off AOL, many of the Time Inc. stable of publications, and Time Warner Cable, which was sold to another cable operator. The remaining businesses are HBO, one of the most-admired pay-TV channels; Warner Bros. movie studios; and cable channels that include CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Now, Mr. Bewkes has found a suitor willing to offer significantly more \u2014 $107.50 a share in cash and stock \u2014 and done so at a time when media companies are under pressure to strike their own deals. AT&T\u2019s offer represents a roughly 35 percent premium to where Time Warner\u2019s stock was trading before news reports of the merger talks emerged.\u201cTime Warner chairman and C.E.O. Jeff Bewkes and his senior management team can see where the entire legacy media world is headed: secular decline,\u201d Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, wrote in a research note on Saturday.Mr. Greenfield added, \u201cWe believe Bewkes will end up being remembered as the smartest C.E.O. in sector \u2014 knowing when to sell and not overstaying his welcome to maximize value for shareholders.\u201dThe announcement on Saturday also affirms the ambitious deal-making of AT&T. One of the former so-called Baby Bells that arose from the 1982 breakup of the original AT&T, the company has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on acquisitions to reconstitute some of its parent\u2019s empire.That has included buying DirecTV for $48.5 billion, adding satellite TV subscriptions as an additional source of negotiating leverage with content providers, along with the satellite company\u2019s steady stream of cash.The telecom company has also been working on its own online video service, for which Time Warner\u2019s trove of media could prove enormously helpful. Combining with AT&T is meant to accelerate those efforts, Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cWe think this is great for continued innovation in content,\u201d he said during Saturday\u2019s conference call.Still, AT&T\u2019s biggest rivals have not stood still. Comcast struck an agreement this spring to buy DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion, adding the \u201cShrek\u201d and \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d franchises to its media holdings.Verizon has charted a different course, focusing more on internet-based properties and advertising technology players rather than traditional media companies. Its $4.8 billion deal to buy Yahoo, rooted in the aging tech company\u2019s hundreds of millions of users, follows previous takeovers of the Huffington Post and AOL.Not everyone seems persuaded by the latest flurry of deal-making. Disney commented on the deal in a statement late Saturday, saying, \u201cA transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny.\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, also put out a statement cautioning approval. \u201cI will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks, and whether it stands up to stands up to the rigorous review standards set by the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division in the last few years,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about AT&T\u2019s bid to acquire Time Warner misattributed a statement in some editions that expressed caution about the merger. The statement was from Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut \u2014 not Senator Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts.Cecilia Kang, Brooks Barnes and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

She wanted to work for the company because it was on the forefront of using black models on the runway. She went on to work as the accessories editor at W and the accessories director at Teen Vogue.Two years ago, after that fateful meeting in Europe, Ms. Turini began styling Ms. Knowles for music videos and appearances like the Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute Gala.But if you ask her, she believes she\u2019s more a fashion collaborator than a stylist. Why? \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need a stylist,\u201d Ms. Turini said, laughing. \u201cShe has the final decision on anything. And there is no way me or anyone else is going to get her to wear something she doesn\u2019t want to wear.\u201dWhen it was time to style the videos for \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d and \u201cCranes\u201d from Ms. Knowles\u2019s new album, \u201cSeat at the Table,\u201d Ms. Turini and the singer looked at mood boards with images of Cam\u2019ron, Lil\u2019 Kim, Diana Ross, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye paintings and more, then sourced looks from designers like The Row, Rosie Assoulin, Phlemuns, Acne Studios, Brother Vellies and students from Central Saint Martins in London.This interview has been edited and condensed.Tell me about your process with Solange for the videos.First, I listened to the music, which was very special and very moving. Then Solange sat down with me and started to tell me how she wanted the visuals to look. It was really important for her that the visuals made black women and men look regal and majestic. She wanted the women, especially, to show sisterhood. So there was a lot of uniformity and making sure that everything matched, what I like to call twinning.She had worked with Carlota Guerrero, the video\u2019s art director, and they knew the color palette. Solange is known for prints, bright colors and color blocking, but she\u2019s definitely evolved and is embracing these nudes and muted colors and this softness. But by the time she sat down with me, she had really concrete ideas about the location, and how she wanted it to look.What looks does she gravitate toward?I think aesthically she is unlike any other friend I have or anyone else I\u2019ve worked with, because she doesn\u2019t care about labels, about brands, about any of the contrived things. She really lets the clothes speak to her. She loves unknown and emerging designers. For example, a designer whose clothes are in Croatia in a museum. That actually happened.Tell me about the Croatia piece.So she found this designer, and I found out that his work lived in this museum in Croatia. So it was basically impossible for me to get in time for the Met Gala. And I was also like, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can sit in this.\u201d But when it came time to brainstorm and discuss the videos, I was able to pull up all of that research for the Met and thought, \u201cIt\u2019s a video, so you don\u2019t have to sit in it or eat in it.\u201dHow does she find these designers?I don\u2019t know. I ask her all the time. It\u2019s kind of in her nature to find these off-the-beaten-path brands. She will send me texts and emails of screenshots. She will never know the name brands or anything like that, because that is so irrelevant to her. So I\u2019m on this treasure hunt to find where she found this, where she saw it, how it came to her. I think that is really special, because we work in an industry where the name holds so much weight. It was really refreshing to work with her. And to see that none of those things mean anything to her. We are a good balance, because I have brands I live and die by, but it makes me step out of my comfort zone and find other designers and celebrate them as well.Tell me about the looks in \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair.\u201dShe wanted to create images where black men and women looked very regal and strong and beautiful. So we asked, \u201cWhat are these iconic images in our culture?\u201d And it\u2019s Sean John velour tracksuits, do-rags and fur and finger waves. I don\u2019t know if people know how hard it is to find Akademiks velour tracksuits in 2016. I had to buy some off a website from China and reach out to the brand and find some off Amazon. And then the blue pleated outfits, which were Solange\u2019s reference to church choirs. In our black churches, the women are very pulled together. Their robes are very regal. But this is kind of the unexpected fashion twist to this.And who was the designer?Wait. So you called her dad?Yes. For another one of the designers, I DM\u2019d her son on Instagram, because she didn\u2019t have a website, didn\u2019t have a LinkedIn, didn\u2019t have anything. So I was like, \u201cHow can I find this person?\u201d I went through every channel possible, and she had a really unique last name, and I found her son and slid up in his DM\u2019s. I was like, \u201cThis might be a crazy question but do you know this person?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my mom.\u201dThe album is very much a celebration of black female empowerment. How was that a consideration in the looks?I feel like it is such a theme in our day-to-day lives. We have a group text about it, and we have these unique experiences, because some of us work in magazines, one is a doctor, we have Solange, one is a director. We are blessed to have a group of outspoken women who are leaders in a range of fields, and we have these unique experiences, in a way, because we are black women. I feel that is present in everything that I do. But with this project in particular, it was about celebrating these iconic black images and artists.Tell me about this look from \u201cCranes\u201d: Solange and her art director wanted to use a lot of natural materials, and they literally made that on set out of a plastic bag. Another one was made of yarn. One was foil. A lot of things for \u201cCranes\u201d were homemade.How does her style compare to yours?We have very different styles. She loves proportions and what I call shape shifting. She loves what I call an emoji heel: a stacked, realistic heel. But I skew sexier in my everyday attire. I don\u2019t push that on her, because that\u2019s not her, and she\u2019s not going to respond to that.What was it like working on these videos?I\u2019m really proud of the way that she presents black people in this project. It is so nice to see us in this way, to see people that look like you in this way. And I don\u2019t get a lot of that in fashion. I don\u2019t get to sit at a fashion show and know I am going to see all these beautiful black women or people that look like me in the audience or on the runway. It was a really special project to help create that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should We See Everything a Cop Sees?", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "FeatureBody cameras have been promoted as a solution to police misconduct. But the strange two-year saga of Seattle shows just how complicated total transparency can be.Supported byO\u2019Toole\u2019s eighth-floor conference room, which has views of City Hall and Elliott Bay and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains, was packed with top police and city officials. All eyes were on a lawyer from the city attorney\u2019s office named Mary Perry. A former naval officer in her 60s, Perry was small and soft-spoken and favored pearls, and she was the city\u2019s unrivaled expert in the seemingly mundane intricacies of the state\u2019s Public Records Act. She was briefing the room on the potential fallout from a landmark case she had just argued and lost before the Washington State Supreme Court. The case stemmed from a series of public-records requests by a reporter for the local television station KOMO, Tracy Vedder, who began filing them after the same high-profile incidents that would lead to the consent decree. She asked for user manuals to the department\u2019s new system of in-car dashboard cameras, then for lists of dashcam recordings, then for some of the recordings themselves. After the department denied every one of them, Vedder sued it for violating the Public Records Act.The act, which dates to 1972, when governments ran on paper and our modern torrent of electronic data was unimaginable, is one of the strongest in the country. Washington State agencies cannot deny requests for records because the requester is anonymous or the request is too broad, nor can they deny requests simply in order to protect an individual\u2019s privacy; instead, agencies must redact only the details deemed sensitive under state code \u2014 for example, some addresses, sometimes the face of a minor \u2014 and disclose the rest. Before the court, Perry had argued that a different law, the state\u2019s Privacy Act, which allows departments to withhold recordings until related criminal or civil cases are resolved, should take precedent and the Seattle Police should be allowed to broadly deny Vedder\u2019s requests until the relevant statute of limitations ran out. The court disagreed.As Perry now told Wagers and the officials gathered in the chief\u2019s conference room, Seattle and other departments across the state were operating in a new reality. Only in cases under actual, pending litigation could the police withhold video footage from the people. This presented several problems. The first was logistical and financial: Seattle Police were sitting on more than 1.5 million individual dashcam and surveillance videos, or about 300,000 hours and 350 terabytes total. Before releasing any footage, someone in the department had to review and redact it in accordance with the specific privacy exemptions the state code did have. The process was manual, a painstaking, frame-by-frame ordeal. By one estimate, 169 people would have to work for a year just to fulfill the department\u2019s existing video requests, and the department added 2,000 new video clips daily. Perry feared that the new flood of data, especially but not exclusively video, could bankrupt Seattle if someone requested it all. \u201cIt\u2019s like being on the Titanic,\u201d she later told me, \u201cand you\u2019ve got a teaspoon to bail.\u201dThe second problem was privacy. Dashcam videos were already a concern, but Seattle had also been considering using body cameras. In fact, the Police Department was now preparing a small pilot program involving a dozen officers from a single precinct to test the hardware. Any footage that bodycams gathered, Perry warned, would also be subject to the Public Records Act. The department would have even more video to manage and release, but most worrisome was how fundamentally different, and more intrusive, this video would be. Unlike dashcams, bodycams, which are attached to an officer\u2019s uniform or purpose-built glasses, can go into homes and hotel rooms. Unlike dashcams, their default view during an arrest, or during a simple conversation with a victim or witness or informant, is an intimate close-up. Many people think of body cameras as a tool for police accountability, but the primary subject of their surveillance isn\u2019t the police \u2014 it\u2019s the public.\u201cI believe in open government, I really do,\u201d Perry told me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think people have really wrapped their heads around all the implications.\u201d If the bodycam pilot was deemed a success, and the city expanded the program to the rest of its 850 front-line officers, all of them now walking surveillance cameras, what then?Wagers left the meeting stunned. \u201cI like to think I can walk into a room, take a complex problem and break it down into its component parts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meeting, I walked out thinking: Wow, this is complicated. This is messy.\u201dClemans lived with his parents in a small, suburban house south of Seattle, sleeping in a bedroom decorated with a picture of the Space Shuttle and a free calendar from a local Chinese buffet. His bed was a mattress on the floor, and his electronic devices \u2014 computers, radios, keyboards \u2014 dominated the room. Clemans, who has sandy blond hair and wide blue eyes and walks with the stooped gait of someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer, taught himself to code HTML at age 8. Home-schooled as a teenager to escape bullying, he was editing web pages for a hospital, where a friend from his parents\u2019 church worked, by 14. He taught himself basic JavaScript and CSS, and he learned the programming language Python after he showed up at a mathematics lab at the University of Washington and offered to volunteer in exchange for high-school credit. \u201cI just went there,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m very impulsive, and I don\u2019t like rules.\u201dDay 1 of his record attempt was a fluke. He was in the vicinity of the Space Needle and bored, so he took the elevator to the top. Something about being able to see the whole city at once captivated him. The next day, Clemans bought a $50 season pass. He learned of the previous record \u2014 60 consecutive days \u2014 and vowed to beat it. He came daily by bus and foot, an hourlong commute, often arriving early and staying late into the night.The Space Needle blooms out of the grounds of the 1962 World\u2019s Fair, a site north of downtown that is now known as Seattle Center. It is 605 feet tall. You enter through a plaza choked with Korean tourists and Andean flute musicians and Marine marching bands, then shuffle up a ramp to the east, above the gift shop and not far from a lineup of idling tour buses. Before handing over your ticket, you are asked to pose for a photo, then board one of three external elevators. When the elevator starts its ascent and the city comes into view, the people inside either fall silent or gasp out loud.From the observation deck, you can see mountains in four directions, water in two and, just to the south, a forest of skyscrapers. You also see a tangle of cranes; a city increasingly built by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates is booming. There are parks, markets, hidden gardens, tiny houses, tiny cars. Bulk carriers glide into port. Seaplanes land and take off. Helicopters float by. The lights of the radio towers on adjacent Queen Anne Hill, a seeming stone\u2019s throw away, blink on and off. Inside, a giant digital wall displays a shifting collage of visitor selfies, along with tourists\u2019 names and cities of origins. A joystick controls a high-definition camera mounted somewhere on the tower, allowing anyone to pan and zoom in on the unsuspecting people below, like a drone operator.The Space Needle became Clemans\u2019s office and his sanctuary. He brought his laptop, stuffing it into his backpack along with a toothbrush and toothpaste and self-help and business books, and got online with a wireless card. He exercised by walking laps around the outer deck. He offered to take tourists\u2019 photos, posed with them and answered their questions. He wrote code and blog entries. He stared at the city. It made sense from up there. It had patterns. Even its famously chaotic traffic had a predictable ebb and flow.\u201cThe sun is shining!\u201d reads one blog entry. \u201cI can see Rainier. People are happy. It doesn\u2019t get any better than this.\u201d When he claimed the record on Day 61, he appeared on the evening news. He said he would keep going for a full year, then announced on his blog that he would go for even longer \u2014 1,825 days in a row. He began wearing a black jacket emblazoned with the words \u201cRecord Holder\u201d in block letters and spending more of his time talking to tourists, meeting people from all over the world. \u201cIt was an enjoyable eight-hour visit,\u201d he wrote in another entry. \u201cI finished reading \u2018Personal MBA\u2019 and memorized the five parts of a business and the 12 ways to create value.\u201dSome days he wrote about his attempts to stick to a routine. Others he dreamed up fanciful lists. \u201cWhen I own the Space Needle in 2034,\u201d he wrote on Day 107, \u201cI will do the following twenty things.\u201d One: \u201cI will sell tickets for $200 to the very top ... for $600 you can also hang off the side.\u201d Two: \u201cEach day the Space Needle will fly a flag. Most days the flag will be the photo of a random lucky guest.\u201d Four: \u201cFor $500 you and your spouse can sleep in an elevator.\u201d Sixteen: \u201cI will pay French Spider Man Alain Robert $10 million to climb a leg of the Space Needle once every day for a year.\u201d Eighteen: \u201cI will give the security bag checkers X-ray vision glasses.\u201d Nineteen: \u201cI will personally lead a walking tour for people struggling with suicidal thoughts.\u201d\u201cThis post is for me,\u201d reads the next day\u2019s entry. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to meet my goals like reading and writing computer code four hours a day. However, I\u2019m really good at meeting this one particular goal, going to the Space Needle every day. I\u2019ve been able to do so for 108 days straight for one simple reason: Going to the Space Needle everyday is more important than anything else. I have to do it. So when I\u2019m trying to achieve a goal, I just have to remember it\u2019s more important than anything else.\u201dAfter almost 160 days, Clemans had an altercation with a Space Needle employee. Before he could get on the elevator, she asked him to pose for a photo in the booth at the top of the ramp, just like the tourists. He had been asked to do it a hundred times. It was senseless, and it enraged him. \u201cI blew up at her,\u201d he says. Just like that, the world-record holder was banned from the Space Needle for life.Adrift, he disappeared from public view. He worked on code, dabbled in robotics and considered a career as a paramedic. He was pulled over for reckless driving and hired a lawyer known for his successful dashcam requests and, he claims, the video didn\u2019t entirely match the police report, so the court reduced the charges. He met a woman on OKCupid, getting her attention by suggesting that they go build sand castles together.One day in September 2014, Clemans was with his girlfriend when he read on his laptop that KOMO had prevailed over Seattle in the state\u2019s Supreme Court in June: Police video had to be released on demand. The Justice Department had just started its investigation of Ferguson, but Clemans\u2019s concerns were closer to home. KOMO posted only snippets. \u201cI was just mad that they were getting all this video but not making it all available,\u201d he recalls. He turned to his girlfriend and told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do police data as a hobby.\u201dSome police departments started sending videos immediately, some proposed installment plans and some announced they were delaying their bodycam programs. In Poulsbo, a town of 9,500 people across the Puget Sound from Seattle, the mayor desperately emailed her local state legislator and asked him to do something about the cameras and the Public Records Act.Unlike its smaller counterparts, the Seattle department did not give its unknown nemesis any footage. Clemans responded by programming a bot. It scraped the department\u2019s website for new case numbers, then automatically requested the corresponding police reports, firing off emails 10 times a day. The more the authorities denied him, the more his appetite grew. He asked the University of Washington for all its records dating back to \u201cthe formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.\u201d He filed requests with another 60 state agencies, demanding every email they had ever sent \u2014 600 million messages in all, according to a state estimate. The Department of Agriculture informed Clemans it would need 132 years to complete the job.Wagers decided to try a different approach. At Rutgers, he had been schooled in the reformist ideals of community policing. Like the longtime New York City police commissioner William J. Bratton \u2014 whose work when he led the Los Angeles Police Department was the subject of Wagers\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation and who, as it happened, was Chief O\u2019Toole\u2019s boss when he led the Massachusetts Metropolitan District Commission Police \u2014 Wagers liked to quote Sir Robert Peel, the founder of London\u2019s bobbies, who in the early 19th century established an Anglo-Saxon tradition of policing distinct from the militaristic us-versus-them Continental model. Peel taught that good policing was about building and holding public trust. \u201cIt\u2019s about engagement,\u201d Wagers told me. \u201cWe respond. We engage. It sounds kind of trite, but it\u2019s a different way of thinking.\u201d His new plan for dealing with Clemans, he says, \u201cwas like any other response to the community: We engage.\u201dOn Twitter, Wagers followed @PoliceVideo, an account that then belonged to the still-anonymous requester. The next day, the account tweeted at Wagers, asking him why the department was giving PowerPoint presentations to city leaders about the coming bodycam pilot program but not sharing the slides with the public. \u201cScrew it,\u201d @PoliceVideo tweeted when Wagers was too slow to respond. \u201cPutting in the request now. Wish you guys would just publish this stuff.\u201dBut Wagers offered to \u201cdo you one better,\u201d and he tweeted a phone number. \u201cHere\u2019s my cell,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI give it out to everyone. Call me & happy to answer questions.\u201d It was 6:57 p.m. One minute later, Wagers\u2019s phone rang. It was Clemans. He still didn\u2019t give his real name \u2014 he had been overwhelmed by media interest in his transparency fight \u2014 but readily accepted when Wagers invited him to lunch.The next day, Clemans met Wagers and Mary Perry at Police Headquarters. They ordered a pizza. Perry tried to explain that it was technically impossible for the department to release all its archived video anytime soon. Clemans countered with an idea he had. He called it \u201coverredaction.\u201d If the system was paralyzed by the need for frame-by-frame redactions, he wondered, why not automatically redact everything? That is, instead of jockeying with requesters, painstakingly reviewing each video, blurring out the protected parts and burning the results onto DVD after DVD, the department could just use software to lightly blur everything, then proactively publish each blurred video online. Push, not pull. Viewers would be able to make out enough to know if footage merited a specific records request and a more precise manual redaction, and they would presumably ask for only the segments they thought they needed; and no longer would the department be buried under its own video. He agreed to drop his mass requests if the department would try it out.In fact, Clemans said, he had stayed up all night writing a very rough version of the overredaction code and printed it out. He showed them what he had done.The cameras that Seattle planned to use in its pilot program \u2014 which would be worn on patrol by a dozen officers in its East Precinct, their video uploaded to a server at the end of every shift \u2014 were from two local companies: Vievu, which was founded by a former Seattle SWAT officer, Steve Ward, in 2007, and its main rival, Axon, a division of Taser that is responsible for the reliable spike in the parent company\u2019s stock after major police shootings. Together the two companies dominate a market that analysts believe will soon be worth a billion dollars a year, with much of the value coming from software and storage. Both Vievu and Axon offered bundles that paired their cameras with editing programs that ran in the cloud, processing them on computers maintained by Amazon Web Services or Microsoft\u2019s Azure, which are also Seattle-area companies.But neither bundle came cheap. The millions of dollars that major police departments were beginning to spend on bodycam contracts were millions they weren\u2019t spending on better training or new officers, and neither company had come close to perfecting automated redaction, without which Seattle Police would simply be collecting more footage without any better way to share it with requesters. Seattle needed an end-to-end software fix, Wagers realized, and Seattle was also a city full of programmers. So the day before the pilot program started, he also tried another experiment: With help from Clemans, he held the department\u2019s first-ever hackathon.The overflow crowd of 80 people was \u201cstraight out of central casting,\u201d Wagers says. \u201cSkinny jeans. Hoodies. People who had sued the department. People I know I\u2019d seen on the protest line the previous week.\u201d Clemans demonstrated his overredaction program: the world as if filmed through a beer glass, fuzzy but familiar, in which it was still possible (too possible, some worried) to tell who was tall and who was short and who was male and who was female and who was black and who was white and who was running and who was chasing. It was well received, and several programmers in the room offered to help Clemans improve the algorithm. But Clemans, volunteering his time and his skills, would be the linchpin. The pilot would run for six months, and if it went well, 12 officers would soon become 850.The next day, on Dec. 20, as TV stations aired reports on the department\u2019s innovative approach to transparency, the bodycam pilot began. Clemans and the department soon developed a rhythm: Some of the videos coming in from the East Precinct were saved to U.S.B. sticks, and Clemans, unpaid and on food stamps at the time, came downtown by bus to pick them up. He processed them on his bedroom computer, tweaking the overredaction program as he went, trying to code in the right balance of concealment and transparency.I watched more than a dozen hours of the video. There were no shootings. Most of it was routine police work, which may be why it was so disturbing to see online. In one set of videos that Clemans posted, a well-dressed white mother of two is pulled over late on a Friday night. She is composed until she fails a sobriety test. Then she pleads for a chance to call the babysitter \u2014 according to Facebook, where I found her because the video also revealed her name, she has a young daughter and younger son \u2014 before breaking down in loud screams and sobs in the back of a patrol car.Elsewhere in the state, also on YouTube, a body camera captures the inside of a woman\u2019s home as she explains how her accused stalker has been ignoring a restraining order. A father pleads with two officers to check in on his adult daughter, who he says has intellectual disabilities and has become involved with a man he believes is dangerous. Two college roommates accuse each other of theft and intimidation in their living room. A white woman apparently overdosing on meth, who cries out that she\u2019s pregnant, is restrained and given medical attention. A middle-aged black man opens his apartment door for a group of officers who inform him that he has been screaming all night. Slurring his words, he admits he\u2019s suffering from PTSD and that he has a history of heroin use. He refuses to let them take him to the hospital. He refuses even when an officer reminds him that he has been screaming like this off and on for a month. But now you can hear the fear in his voice. \u201cAm I screaming right now?\u201d he wonders.One of the first bodycam videos that Clemans uploaded shows a young black woman sitting on a bed in a hotel room. The officer wearing the camera is a disembodied voice but for a fleeting glimpse of his face and torso in a mirror. His manner is professional and sympathetic, and he says he doesn\u2019t want to arrest her. \u201cWill I be charged?\u201d she asks. \u201cLet\u2019s get to that later,\u201d he says. He asks her if she would be willing to talk to a counselor. \u201cSo you can get some other kind of job so you don\u2019t have to do this anymore, O.K.?\u201d he says. \u201cOur ultimate goal is that there is no prostitution, O.K.?\u201dHe begins filling out a form \u2014 Escort Face Sheet \u2014 on a clipboard. She answers every question, sharing the intimate details of her life. She tells him about her relationship with her boyfriend, her clashes with her strict father, her time as a runaway, her drift from strip clubs to Backpage.com escort ads, her few regular johns. She claims she\u2019s new to this work. She explains that she charges per hour or half-hour. She has a dog, she says. She can rely on her parents in times of need, she says. She gives him their street address. She gives him her full name. She shares her private email address and phone number. She shares all this with the camera too.When the interview is done, she asks about it. Is the image clear? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear, yeah,\u201d the officer says, but \u201cif the press wanted it, we can redact faces \u2014 can blur out the faces and whatnot.\u201d Body cameras are new to his city, and he doesn\u2019t know that what he just told her isn\u2019t entirely true. A lawyer will decide that the video is in no part exempt from the Public Records Act, and the officer will later be shocked to see it on YouTube. He will try and fail to have it taken down. The woman in the video is easy to find in her other internet life. She\u2019s on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, where she chats with friends and posts images of dresses and animals and nail polish. You can visit her parents\u2019 house on Google Street View.Body cameras can be knocked loose when the police rush a suspect, as the world learned in July when Alton Sterling was killed in Baton Rouge, La. Officers can likewise forget or claim to forget to turn the cameras on in time to record an incident in full, as protesters saw after they forced the police to release the inconclusive, partial bodycam footage of Keith Lamont Scott\u2019s shooting in Charlotte, N.C. But for slow-moving scenes like this one, in the hotel room with the young woman who seems to trust the officer with her privacy, the technology works almost too well. Bryce Newell, an information-science researcher now at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who did his fieldwork in Washington, interviewing Clemans and Wagers and riding along with officers as they tested their new bodycams, gave a clever name to the problem they posed in a society demanding transparency: \u201ccollateral visibility.\u201dOne of the first people revealed to the public by Clemans\u2019s transparency quest was Clemans himself. His mass records requests had drawn the interest of local reporters, who started filing requests of their own to the Police Department, seeking his identity. After they got his phone number, Clemans pre-emptively outed himself, embracing the role of tech seer. He published a letter in January 2015 explaining his mission on the website of the Seattle Privacy Coalition. \u201cI pushed the envelope,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso we as a society can once and for all address accurately recording of the truth, who should have access to the truth and what we are to do with the truth.\u201d He told the local news site Crosscut that the Public Records Act did need to be amended. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change until it becomes a massive problem,\u201d he said. He told Seattle Weekly that his experience with police videos had convinced him that certain things shouldn\u2019t be made public. He left the footage on YouTube precisely to make that point. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to deal with this until they have an emotional reaction,\u201d he said.Wagers stood before the crowd, about a hundred people in all, and gave a brief technical overview of the pilot program. Then an officer from East Precinct demonstrated how the bodycam worked, briefly filming the crowd as he did so. After that, one commissioner, David Keenan, a local lawyer, asked a group of waiting panelists to state, one after the other, when, exactly, the cameras should be on, and to answer a simple question about the evidence they create: Why do we want it? That is, whom does it serve? \u201cShould it only be used if there\u2019s an accusation against a police officer?\u201d he asked. \u201cShould it be used by criminal investigators and by defendants and by prosecutors?\u201dThe growing national welter of contradictory state laws and department policies signals that there is no settled answer. Some allow officers to view it before writing their reports. (That was the central issue earlier this month in Portland, Ore., that caused protesters to storm its City Hall, where police officers met them with bursts of pepper spray.) Some do not. Some treat all bodycam videos as public records; some limit their release. Some mandate a quick deletion of police video; some have no requirements to delete it at all. Some restrict the use of facial recognition software; most allow it. A technology meant for one purpose, once unleashed, is soon used for many others.One commissioner, Jay Hollingsworth of the Mohegan tribe, the chairman of the John T. Williams Organizing Committee, named for a hard-of-hearing Native American whose 2010 shooting was partly captured on dashcam, answered Keenan\u2019s \u201cwhen\u201d question simply: Bodycams should always be on. To his right, another commissioner, Jennifer Shaw, the deputy director of the A.C.L.U. of Washington, said that she agreed in theory but that her organization supported the cameras only if they were used exclusively for police accountability. Next, Ron Smith, a detective who then headed the Seattle Police Officers\u2019 Guild, said that he was also in favor of bodycams because he believed they would exonerate officers from complaints. But the cameras went into homes and on lunch and bathroom breaks, and officers absolutely had to be able to switch them on and off.At the end of the table were two activists, Marissa Johnson and Dan Bash. Johnson later became nationally known for leaping onstage at a Bernie Sanders rally, claiming the candidate\u2019s microphone and telling him he needed to do more to acknowledge the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThis conversation about bodycams is a complete and utter farce,\u201d she said. Forget the policy details. She did not consent to being recorded at all. She did not trust the police to do the right thing with the footage. Most of all, she did not trust prosecutors to use it to prosecute officers. \u201cWhy do I need a home video of my abuse that\u2019s going to be filmed by my oppressor?\u201d she asked.An uncomfortable silence filled the room. Then Hollingsworth announced that the other panelists had made him change his mind, leaving the two employees of the Police Department, Wagers and Smith, two white men, the only people onstage who clearly supported bodycams. The mood became tense, and members of the crowd interrupted the next speaker and soon assumed control of the room, taking turns denouncing police brutality and glaring at Smith, who was eventually escorted to his car by another officer.Three weeks later, the commission, the voice of the people, called for Seattle to delay full deployment of bodycams until the state law could be rewritten. \u201cThis is a new technology,\u201d the commission said in a news release, \u201cwhich may have unintended consequences.\u201dIn an essay published shortly after the White House announced its $75 million in bodycam funding in 2014, two authors of the study, Barak Ariel and Alex Sutherland, hypothesized that it was not cameras alone that drove the positive results; it was the fact that before every interaction with a citizen, officers in the trial were required to announce that they were recording. There may have been a \u201cself-awareness effect\u201d: Both parties were reminded at the moment of contact that they were under surveillance and that they should behave accordingly. One question was whether the effect would hold up if officers did not announce the cameras\u2019 presence. Another was whether it would hold up when the cameras lost their novelty.Ariel and Sutherland also worried about anyone basing decisions on a single study, which, no matter how rigorous, could well be a fluke, \u201cthe statistical equivalent of \u2018luck,\u2019\u2009\u201d they wrote. The Rialto sample was small. The notable drop in citizen complaints, for instance, was from 28 in the yearlong period before the study to 3 while it was underway. At least 40 reasonably scientific studies have followed Rialto, but many, according to a recent survey carried out by George Mason University, have yet to be published.Rialto suggests a drop in the use of force. A study from Arizona suggests a drop in arrests but a rise in citations. A separate Arizona study, along with one from London, suggests a rise in arrests. When Temple University researchers recently sifted through a Washington Post database of 986 deadly shootings of civilians by police in 2015, they found that when officers wore body cameras, civilians were 3.64 percent more likely to die. The increase was more pronounced, 3.75 percent, in the deaths of African-Americans and Hispanics and a barely measurable 0.67 percent in the deaths of Caucasians and Asians. They hypothesized that a different kind of self-awareness was at work: Officers, aware of their bodycams and more certain their use of deadly force would be seen as justified, were less likely to hesitate.After Rialto, Ariel and Sutherland set out to replicate their influential study on a much larger scale, collaborating with eight large and small police departments covering two million citizens in the United States and Britain. Their resulting analysis of 2.2 million officer hours, published this May, seems to validate their concerns that Rialto offered an incomplete picture. It found that police use of force actually went up by an astonishing 71 percent when officers could turn their cameras on and off at will and went down (by 37 percent) only when they recorded nearly every interaction with the public from start to finish. A second analysis of the same data, published late last month, supports Rialto\u2019s finding that citizen complaints drop significantly, almost to zero, when bodycams are present, while underscoring the authors\u2019 warning that more research is needed to understand how and why and under what conditions. \u201cIt may be that in some places it\u2019s a bad idea to use body-worn cameras,\u201d Ariel said in announcing the May results, \u201cand the only way you can find that out is to keep doing these tests in different kinds of places.\u201dThe videos didn\u2019t shake the local opposition to bodycams, and they didn\u2019t meet the standards of the state Public Records Act \u2014 if asked, Seattle would have to provide more precisely redacted versions \u2014 but they met a national need for positive news about the police. The YouTube channel was featured on the \u201cToday Show,\u201d and the department\u2019s innovation was the subject of coverage, some skeptical and some not, by The Guardian, Vice News, \u201cMarketplace,\u201d \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d and The New York Times. The tech press couldn\u2019t get enough. One well-reported article in the online publication Backchannel called Clemans \u201cthe body-cam hacker who schooled the police.\u201dWagers began receiving calls and email from departments around the country. The future of policing, he saw, was now more than ever reliant on what technology the police could afford to buy from companies like those that built modern Seattle. He pledged that Clemans\u2019s code, once completed, would be open-source and freely shared so that smaller agencies, which didn\u2019t have the staff to handle video-records requests, let alone the money for bundled bodycam contracts, could stay on the cutting edge. In one overredaction test, the department processed 2,400 videos in three hours on rented Amazon Web Services computers in the cloud, a task that would have gummed up the public-disclosure unit of the Seattle Police for weeks had the files been redacted manually. The computer rental cost the department $1.20 \u2014 40 cents an hour \u2014 Wagers marveled. To meet the demands of the Public Records Act, all Clemans needed to do was get his algorithm to redact only faces and other private details, rather than the full frame.Clemans was now an employee: The department had offered him a six-month contract at $22.60 an hour. But when the pilot program ended in July, and the question of whether to expand it loomed, he still had not perfected his code. He was trying to solve a problem, mostly by himself, that teams of professional engineers at Taser and its rivals have yet to fully crack. Distracted, he noticed other inefficiencies at Police Headquarters and he felt increasingly compelled to fix them. After visiting the understaffed 911 center, then in the news for its slow response times, he came up with a new idea: a program that automatically highlighted the most pressing calls, allowing dispatchers to be more efficient. But the captain in charge of the 911 center didn\u2019t welcome his intrusion, and he belittled the idea at a tense late-August meeting brokered by their superiors. Clemans, by his own admission, \u201cgot really mad.\u201d He swore at the captain. He yelled until he had to be escorted from the building. And just like that, in an echo of his Space Needle blowup, he was exiled from headquarters. He made a threat on his way out: \u201cI\u2019m going to P.D.R.\u201d \u2014 public-disclosure request \u2014 \u201cthe [expletive] out of you,\u201d he shouted.In September 2015, when Seattle won a $600,000 Justice Department grant to expand the bodycam program to the rest of the police force, which the mayor pledged to more than match, Clemans wasn\u2019t there to help celebrate. He was working remotely, back in his bedroom or hunched over a laptop at the Starbucks he now frequented on the 40th floor of Columbia Center, the tallest building in town, where the views were stunning and free.Days after the grant announcement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch came to Seattle to declare it a national model for police reform. The federal monitor overseeing the consent decree, who had previously lauded the overredaction experiment when calling for rapid deployment of bodycams, now praised the department\u2019s systematic approach to investigating any use of force \u2014 a significant change from the cursory reporting of the past. Wagers, meanwhile, was helping Chief O\u2019Toole to select his replacement. He had by then been in Seattle and away from his wife and children for more than a year.On Oct. 29, 2015, a week after Wagers announced he was leaving the department, Clemans texted in his own resignation. He no longer believed the department could ever truly be transparent on its own, he told me. His time inside the department, far from co-opting him, had weaponized him after his blowup with the 911 captain: He knew even better which records to request. He wrote a new bot capable of sending the department up to 10,000 requests in 24 hours. He asked for 911 records, \u201ctables & columns of all databases,\u201d all front-facing dashcam video from 2014 and \u201call computer codes written by Tim Clemans.\u201d Over the next few days, he piled on, requesting \u201call roll-call notes,\u201d text records from the department\u2019s license-plate scanners, the source codes of key department software and \u201call Outlook calendars of supervisors, managers & command staff.\u201d He also started building a website where he would publish it all, which he called the People\u2019s NSA. He expanded his demands to include every public record in every format \u2014 paper, tape or digital \u2014 the City of Seattle had. He soon asked 39 neighboring cities for the same. By the end of 2015, according to a study on public-records requests he obtained via a public-records request, Clemans had filed 2,272 requests to the Seattle Police Department alone, making him again its No. 1 antagonist. One day at her office, Mary Perry showed me a printout of the latest ones, five pages long. \u201cWe\u2019re being crippled,\u201d she said. Wagers was on his way home, Clemans was making more demands than ever and she was back where she started.Searching for blurred video of a crime down your block may someday be as easy as searching for a restaurant on Google Maps. But a new state law making footage harder to request in bulk \u2014 the Tim Clemans Act, his friends called it \u2014 had just gone into effect thanks to the efforts of Poulsbo, the small town that had contacted its state representative. Clemans had also been studying YouTube\u2019s privacy policy, and he would soon decide to remove the videos he posted there from public view. For now, though, he wore his own D.I.Y. bodycam, a cellphone strapped to a chest harness, and was streaming live to the internet as he followed the protesters and the police on a borrowed bicycle.The protesters gathered outside the department\u2019s East Precinct. An old man, homeless, busking below a mural, quickly collected his things before any violence could break out. But none did. According to the judge who would preside over the latest consent-decree hearing a few weeks later, notably saying the words \u201cblack lives matter\u201d from the bench, the department was making steady strides toward an exit from federal oversight: Its de-escalation tactics were a national model, he said, and its use of force was substantially down. He never mentioned bodycams.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Cat People\u2019 and a Gallery of Horror Predators", "Date": "2016-10-27", "News": "Supported byOn DVDOver the course of his brief career, the Russian-born producer Val Lewton (1904-1951) pioneered a new sort of horror movie. Shock ran second to atmosphere. The supernatural was a function of the psychological.Lewton\u2019s best-known movie, \u201cCat People\u201d (1942), begins with a quote that glosses Freud\u2019s view of religion: \u201cEven as fog continues to lie in the valleys, so does ancient sin cling to the low places, the depressions in the world consciousness.\u201d The quote is attributed to the movie\u2019s resident psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd, the author of a book, \u201cThe Anatomy of Atavism,\u201d and refers to the protagonist\u2019s belief that her aroused passions transform her into a feral cat.Reissued by Criterion in a digital restoration, \u201cCat People\u201d was the first Lewton production. Impressed by Universal\u2019s recent success with \u201cThe Wolf Man\u201d (1941), his studio, RKO, assigned him a title along with a modest budget. The result, directed by Jacques Tourneur, was smart, literate and economical, establishing the gold standard for a particular kind of B-movie. It was also a hit with audiences.The cheerful, staid Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) picks up the strange, enchanting Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), a recent refugee from Serbia whom he finds sketching a panther at the Central Park Zoo. They date, and, despite her superstitious belief that she harbors \u201csomething evil,\u201d they eventually wed.When Irena\u2019s fears prevent them from consummating their marriage, Oliver turns first for advice to the psychiatrist Dr. Judd (Tom Conway) and then, for emotional comfort, to his work buddy Alice (Jane Randolph), an all-American type, as normal as he. Shamed and abandoned, Irena begins to disintegrate \u2014 or, to put it another way, to experience her inner feline predator.While gripped with sexual repression, Irena carries another burden: She is obsessed with the history of her nation, imagined as a primeval curse. (Earlier versions of DeWitt Bodeen\u2019s screenplay included scenes of Nazi occupation.) Irena cannot escape her past, and she contaminates the optimistic Americans with whom she comes in contact. In the buildup to their agonizing breakup, Oliver blames her for teaching him \u201cunhappiness.\u201d Alice, the healthy homewrecker, is mortally afraid of Irena; the rational, overconfident Dr. Judd should be.Despite their lurid titles (\u201cI Walked With a Zombie,\u201d \u201cBedlam\u201d) and advertisements, Lewton productions were subtle. Horror was predicated on the power of suggestion. A scene in which Irena plays with a caged bird and inadvertently causes it to die of fright, or one where, dining with Oliver and his friends at a cheery bo\u00eete called the Belgrade, she is spooked by a feline older woman who addresses her in Serbian as \u201csister,\u201d are more unsettling than the movie\u2019s conventional scares.Lewton\u2019s major special effect was cutting. He inherited two editors, Mark Robson (who worked on \u201cCat People\u201d) and Robert Wise, who had worked at RKO with Orson Welles, and eventually converted them into directors. Kent Jones\u2019s 2008 documentary feature, \u201cVal Lewton: The Man in the Shadows,\u201d included as an extra, notes that the most intense moments in Lewton-produced films are only a few seconds in length. Well edited itself, Mr. Jones\u2019s intelligent, affecting documentary uses clips to suggest an affinity between Lewton\u2019s films and those of Jean Cocteau; the deployment of empty space in Lewton productions is similarly akin to Surrealist paintings in the projection of an uncanny imminence.Unlike his films, the appreciation of Lewton\u2019s artistry requires no suspension of disbelief. (Earlier iterations of \u201cCat People\u201d are available for streaming on Amazon Video.)The six-film, three-DVD set \u201cHollywood Legends of Horror\u201d (Warner Archive, repackaging movies previously available as twofers) gives some idea of routine pre-Lewton horror: star-driven, intermittently humorous and often hokey, if not without a certain poetry.\u201cDoctor X\u201d (1932), directed by Michael Curtiz, is notable for its muted two-strip Technicolor and Lee Tracy\u2019s comic performance as a persistent reporter. \u201cThe Return of Doctor X\u201d (1939), directed by Vincent Sherman, is more of a curiosity, featuring Humphrey Bogart as a scientist with a corpselike affect and white streak in his hair.Those are the only Warner Bros. features; the rest are from MGM, two directed by Tod Browning. \u201cMark of the Vampire\u201d (1935), a remake of Browning\u2019s 1927 silent \u201cLondon After Midnight,\u201d is distinguished by its lush gothic mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. (James Wong Howe was the cinematographer.) More entertaining, \u201cThe Devil-Doll\u201d (1936) stars Lionel Barrymore, frequently in drag, as a banker escaped from Devil\u2019s Island to wreak vengeance on his former partners with the help of some cunningly miniaturized assassins.Closest to a classic is Karl Freund\u2019s \u201cMad Love\u201d (1935), based on a story previously filmed by Robert Wiene in Austria in 1924. Peter Lorre makes his Hollywood debut playing an insane surgeon obsessed with an actress he has discovered at the Grand Guignol. (The movie flopped but left its mark. Under its Spanish title, it figures in the Malcolm Lowry novel \u201cUnder the Volcano\u201d; the critic Pauline Kael saw it as an influence on \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d)Lorre\u2019s mad doctor notwithstanding, the most frightening film is \u201cThe Mask of Fu Manchu\u201d (1932). Rivaling D. W. Griffith\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d in the pathology of its racially driven sexual paranoia, the movie was produced by William Randolph Hearst, whose newspapers often warned of \u201cthe yellow peril.\u201d Given the campy gusto with which Boris Karloff plays the titular monster of depravity, it would be pleasant to think that he and his Liverpool-born director, Charles Brabin, were satirizing, rather than dramatizing, the xenophobic mythology of British imperialism.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Sense of AT&T\u2019s Bid for Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byDealBook\u201cYou had a lot of people saying you should\u2019ve combined a donkey with a rabbit and gotten a flying unicorn.\u201dThat was how Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, once described his company\u2019s colossal failure of a merger with AOL. He spent the last decade dismantling much of his company in the name of \u201cfocus,\u201d spinning off his cable business and magazine empire.And yet over the weekend Mr. Bewkes agreed to sell Time Warner to AT&T for $85 billion in a deal that, if approved by regulators, will vastly reshape the media and telecommunications world \u2014 and ultimately the way Americans will consume and pay for their favorite television shows.There was a good reason that Mr. Bewkes had been skeptical of big mergers that combined distribution and content: They are complex and hard to make successful, and they invariably face enormous headwinds from regulators, who will undoubtedly tie their hands in an effort to protect consumers from anti-competitive behavior.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, prices aren\u2019t going to go down because of this,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research. \u201cI don\u2019t think vertical integration lends itself to consumer benefits.\u201dAlready, Donald J. Trump has denounced the acquisition and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll look at breaking this deal up\u201d if he were president. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential nominee, said he was concerned about the transaction. \u201cLess concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media,\u201d he said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201dA raft of consumer-protection groups are already girding for a fight. And media and telecommunication rivals are hinting that they are prepared to battle the deal in Washington. \u201cA transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,\u201d a spokesman for Disney said.The worry among consumer groups and rivals, of course, is that for AT&T to make the deal work strategically and financially \u2014 the company is paying a 35 percent premium to Time Warner\u2019s stock price before news of the deal broke last week \u2014 it is going to use Time Warner\u2019s content as a weapon against its rivals by raising the price that they pay for carriage of channels such as HBO and CNN, while integrating those same channels into new AT&T offerings at lower prices.Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, dismissed that notion in an interview on Sunday, calling it \u201cillogical\u201d and saying he wants to \u201cdispel\u201d such an idea. He insisted he has no intention to limit Time Warner\u2019s content on rival systems and that \u201cit doesn\u2019t make business sense\u201d to restrict the distribution of Time Warner programming.Instead, he said, he sees the benefits of the merger coming from the additional data AT&T will be able to provide to Time Warner \u2014 and advertisers \u2014 about what consumers are watching, as well the ability to create specialized, interactive programming for AT&T\u2019s mobile customers that he expects other distributors will copy.Still, he suggested that his ultimate goal is to create a wireless network using next-generation technology known as 5G that competes not just with wireless providers, but with cable companies, by providing high-speed broadband and television service. \u201cI will be sorely disappointed if we are not going head-to-head\u201d with cable providers by 2021, he said.That notion may be both attractive and unattractive to regulators. On one hand, AT&T would be able to finally create real competition for cable companies, which have long held monopoly or duopoly positions in most markets. Owning Time Warner, Mr. Stephenson said, would \u201cdrive our incentive\u201d to build out its next- generation network even faster.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.On the other hand, regulators have been reticent to let cable companies merge to create a truly national footprint out of fear that it would put too much power into the hands of distributors; the government blocked Comcast\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Cable, for example.But Craig Moffett, another veteran media research analyst, said he gave the deal only a 50-50 chance of being approved.\u201cYou can imagine lots of strategies that would involve withholding content from distributors or not counting downloads of Time Warner content against data caps,\u201d Mr. Moffett said. \u201cBut those things are either already expressly prohibited or will be\u201d as part of any arrangement AT&T and Time Warner make with regulators.It is a question that Mr. Greenfield raised too. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be able to withhold HBO from Verizon, what exactly are you getting?\u201d he asked.Which raises the question: Why pursue the deal at all?Well, there are some potential benefits. While AT&T probably won\u2019t be able to use Time Warner\u2019s current crop of channels to bludgeon its competitors, it will be able to use Time Warner\u2019s creative team to devise all sorts of new programming options, many of which could become exclusive to AT&T.What\u2019s to stop AT&T, for instance, from creating a better version of Verizon\u2019s Go90, a specialized original channel. Go90 hasn\u2019t caught on, but AT&T could leverage Time Warner\u2019s team to create the next-generation HBO \u2014 and that channel could likely be exclusive to AT&T\u2019s service.Still, upstart companies like Netflix and Amazon Prime have proven that it is possible to create great original content without owning a legacy media company. Hire a couple of great creative executives and wave around a big checkbook, and you can attract high-quality scripts and headline-grabbing stars.In the chess game that is the media industry \u2014 a tens-of-billions-of-dollars version of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 perhaps owning Time Warner will give AT&T a jump-start into a world that many couldn\u2019t even imagine a decade ago. \u201cIt\u2019s empire building,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said.Whether it proves to be a success or the \u201cflying unicorn\u201d that AOL merger turned out to be remains the question.So as they say in the television business: Stay tuned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Promises, Promises From AT&T", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe company agreed to pay Time Warner, which owns Warner Bros. studios, HBO, CNN, TNT and other TV channels, a 35 percent premium over its market value. AT&T executives say the deal would benefit its customers by leading to new innovations. But it would only be logical for the company to use Time Warner\u2019s trove of movies and TV programming to keep and attract subscribers to AT&T while making it harder or more expensive for competing telecom and streaming companies to get access to that content.Or, if the Justice Department felt that imposing conditions would not work, it could seek to block the deal in federal court. That approach could backfire if courts decide that the merger doesn\u2019t violate antitrust law.Regulators need to keep in mind that the AT&T-Time Warner deal could spur even more consolidation in a very concentrated media and telecommunications industry. In most parts of the country, just one or two companies offer high-speed internet service. Four providers effectively control the wireless business, and six media giants dominate the TV and movie business. The question for antitrust regulators is whether this deal would invariably lead to even less competition.Advertisement"}

Or who might be \u2014 it\u2019s not clear from Tuesday\u2019s premiere. So there\u2019s your first-season dramatic arc.The 30-year-old ing\u00e9nue of \u201cNo Tomorrow\u201d is Evie (Tori Anderson), an overly organized, mostly cheerful sort with a soul-killing job at an Amazon-like retailer. One day at the farmers\u2019 market she is instantly, hilariously smitten with Xavier (Joshua Sasse of \u201cGalavant\u201d), a red-bearded vision in a knit cap and yogaesque clothes. When he says his name is \u201cXavier with an X\u201d in his soft British accent, we\u2019ve officially entered rom-com territory.Which means there\u2019s a catch, of course. Xavier believes the world will be destroyed by an asteroid in just over eight months, which doesn\u2019t necessarily make him crazy but sets off some alarms for Evie. (Literally \u2014 the alarms on Xavier\u2019s basketball arcade game light up when she finds out.) Then he ups the ante: A seize-the-day type himself, he decides to break Evie out of her rut by getting her fired.This doesn\u2019t sit well with Evie, and it\u2019s just as big a problem for the viewer who wants a romantic comedy to stay within certain emotional boundaries. Xavier is an artificial construct designed to balance the naysayers in Evie\u2019s life \u2014 her mother, who praises Evie\u2019s current boyfriend because \u201che loves you just the way you are\u201d; and her female boss, who slams her with an entire catalog of women-in-the-workplace put-downs (too timid, no confidence, no one listens to you).

Almost all of the book\u2019s characters speak fluent brag and dis, with the exceptions of strait-laced Isaiah and his beloved older brother, Marcus. They were orphaned early, and Isaiah grew up listening to both his big brother\u2019s advice and his favorite music (Motown).

The second was the arrival of another lost boy, a budding little con man named Juanell Dodson, who had nowhere to live and took Marcus\u2019s place as Isaiah\u2019s apartment-mate, sans adult supervision.

Although Cal (as he\u2019s known to his staff of managers and flunkies) lives in what is supposed to be extreme fabulousness \u2014 he has a life-size portrait of Michael Corleone in his living room \u2014 he is miserable. And not himself. And unproductive. And terrified. IQ and Dodson are summoned after Cal is attacked by one of the awfulest hit-critters imaginable.It turns out that Cal isn\u2019t crazy in thinking that someone wants to kill him. And since he hasn\u2019t left his humongous home in weeks and keeps the drapes drawn, there\u2019s no normal way to get at him. So in comes Mr. Ide\u2019s version of the Hound of the Baskervilles: a pit bull that weighs as much as a Great Dane. Cal evades him only by winding up in his swimming pool and nearly dies there because he can\u2019t swim. Genius needed. Urgently.\u201cIQ\u201d becomes a detective story about the attack on Cal and Cal\u2019s crew. That and the dog\u2019s story are big enough to take up a good part of the book \u2014 a really good part. Consider these details from Cal\u2019s divorce: While the fights were on, Cal\u2019s wife, Noelle, airfreighted Cal\u2019s Rottweiler to a rival rapper. He had her shoe collection frozen in concrete. They went public with anatomical insults, comparing each other\u2019s body parts to cottage cheese and a knitting needle. One of Cal\u2019s cronies said that the tabloids owed them an award.Mr. Ide packs a lot of action and scenery into the book\u2019s investigation scenes. But he has also built and bolstered Isaiah as a fine, durable character for the long run. The guy doesn\u2019t always show off the deductive talent for which he\u2019s praised \u2014 he gets things too easily, usually on the first guess \u2014 but he has an enormous range of skills. He can solve a problem or fix a car with equal ease. He\u2019s sane and orderly, but he\u2019s also excited by the thrill of the hunt. As a tribute to the Motown-loving Marcus, he names his dog Ruffin. And Mr. Ide ends the book with a meaningful jolt. It gives this story closure but does nothing to suggest that Mr. Ide and his canny hero won\u2019t be back again.IQBy Joe Ide321 pages. Mulholland Books. $26.Advertisement"}

It has some of the most advanced A.I. technology in the world and an unmatched database of terms thanks to its search engine.So what happened?

{"Headline": "Time Warner\u2019s Non-Mogul Mogul Who Foretold Its Worth", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byJeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, made a big bet in the summer of 2014 when he rejected an $80 billion takeover bid by 21st Century Fox, controlled by Rupert Murdoch.Mr. Bewkes had promised shareholders that Time Warner would create more value on its own than any proposal Fox was positioned to offer. Privately, Mr. Bewkes was telling colleagues and investors that Time Warner was likely to land a much more lucrative deal if it were put on the market a couple of years later. Among the potential bidders, Time Warner reasoned, were deep-pocketed technology companies like Apple and Google \u2014 and even, possibly, AT&T, which was tied up with a different deal at the time.Over the next two years, it was not clear that Mr. Bewkes had played his cards right. Fears of cord-cutting, ratings declines and a weak advertising market stoked panic across the industry over the future of traditional media in a digital world. And while Time Warner introduced several efforts to transform the company, such as a stand-alone streaming service for HBO, questions persisted about whether the company would have the resources to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon.As it turns out, Mr. Bewkes\u2019s bet paid off. In a big way.On Saturday night, AT&T announced that it had agreed to buy Time Warner for about $85.4 billion, or $107.50 a share in cash and stock \u2014 about a 35 percent premium to where Time Warner\u2019s stock was trading before reports of the merger talks, and well above the $85 a share Fox was offering.AT&T and Time Warner promised to \u201clead the next wave of innovation\u201d as the worlds of media, communications and technology collide.\u201cFor Time Warner shareholders, the price is exceptional,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.And for Mr. Bewkes, the deal has sealed his legacy as a behind-the-scenes non-mogul media mogul.In an industry populated by larger-than-life executives like Mr. Murdoch and Sumner Redstone, whose activities have sometimes provided fodder for the gossip pages, Mr. Bewkes carved out a reputation as a personable numbers guy with a sense of humor and a low public profile. Mr. Bewkes lifted the company\u2019s stock price, slowly but surely, by disposing of assets, eventually making his company the most attractive takeover target in the media market.\u201cHe is not an executive that is cut from the old-school media mogul cloth,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura. \u201cHis legacy is very much that he did so well for shareholders, whereas another type of media executive, a personality like a Sumner Redstone, would want to continue to preside and reign over this powerful media empire.\u201dIn an interview on Sunday, Mr. Bewkes deferred a question on how he thought about the AT&T-Time Warner deal in the context of his own legacy as a media executive.\u201cI don\u2019t think of it as my legacy,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cI think of it as the great institution of Time Warner, which has had a mission in this world since Henry Luce invented the magazine in 1923 and actually invented talking pictures in the years since.\u201dMr. Bewkes, 64, has worked at Time Warner for more than three decades. He became the chief executive of the premium TV network HBO in 1995, where he helped raise the network\u2019s profile by pushing for more original programming. His purview expanded in 2002, when he was named chairman of the company\u2019s networks and entertainment division. And in 2008, Mr. Bewkes succeeded Richard Parsons in the chief executive\u2019s suite.At the time, the company was still reeling from its disastrous dot-com merger with AOL. Time Warner shares traded as low as $14. Mr. Bewkes whittled the company down, unloading Time Warner Cable, then AOL, then its Time Inc. magazine division. What remained was a focused and well-respected television and film company that owned HBO; Warner Bros. film and television studios; and cable networks including CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS.\u201cThat gave us the best choice of whether we wanted to consolidate another company into ours, or it made us the most valuable company if we wanted to consolidate with someone else, which is what we have now come to,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.But Mr. Bewkes was not ready to exercise those options in the summer of 2014, when Fox appeared with its takeover offer. He said that he had never doubted the decision, in large part because Time Warner management considered the deal to be worth much less than it initially seemed.On the day that the Fox deal was announced, the transaction was worth about $80 billion. But that deal was heavily tilted toward Fox stock, which has lost about a third of its value since then. In addition, the transaction required taking out a substantial loan to cover the cash portion, and Time Warner would have assumed part of that debt.As a result, Time Warner estimates that the Fox deal would be valued at about $70 per share today. The AT&T bid represents about a 60 percent premium over the Fox offer.\u201cWe knew all that,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cThat is why we didn\u2019t consider it.\u201dIt was a different story in August, when Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, visited Mr. Bewkes at Time Warner\u2019s headquarters in New York. The two executives discussed their views for the future of content and distribution amid the rise of streaming services that are blurring lines among the media, communication and technology industries. Their visions aligned, and a deal quickly fell into place.\u201cWe see a convergence,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cIt is not just creating content but introducing it to you as a viewer, wherever you go.\u201dAs an example, Mr. Bewkes pointed to more vigorous CNN offerings on mobile and better search and recommendation tools to discover HBO programming, whether a person is watching on a mobile phone, tablet or television set.Mr. Bewkes acknowledged that on its own, the media industry has been slow to put in effect new technologies that allow people to watch the programming they want to watch \u2014 when and how they want to watch it.\u201cLook at how slow some of these companies have been to put these innovations in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do things like that if we are together.\u201dOn Sunday, AT&T insisted that it would not try to influence its new assets in either the entertainment or news segments.\u201cOur intent is to operate Time Warner as it operates today, with autonomy in its divisions, including the world-class creative talent and journalists that make Time Warner a leader in entertainment and news,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said in a statement.\u201cCNN is an American symbol of independent journalism and First Amendment free speech,\u201d he added. \u201cMy board and I are clear \u2014 CNN will remain completely independent from an editorial perspective.\u201dAT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner is expected to face intense regulatory pressure, and if it is approved, the companies do not expect it to close until late 2017. Mr. Bewkes, whose contract with Time Warner runs through 2020, is planning to stay with the company through a yet-to-be-determined transition period.Analysts said that they expected many other Time Warner executives to continue in their roles, because AT&T is a telecom company with little experience in programming. That was yet another contrast to the Murdoch offer.\u201cAny offer that was made to Time Warner was prefaced with the notion that the key up-and-coming leadership within Time Warner would not be jettisoned,\u201d Mr. DiClemente said. \u201cThat tone, in general, is a little different than the Murdoch tone, which was perceived as the expectation that they would be working for Rupert, James and Lachlan Murdoch.\u201d\u201cCulturally, this is more of a reason why this fits,\u201d he added.Mr. Bewkes put it more bluntly. \u201cThis fell into place,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it is kind of obvious.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Migrant Workers in Recreational Vehicles", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byRetiringEAST GRAND FORKS, Minn. \u2014 Michael Shoemaker is sitting at a picnic table in front of his recreational vehicle on an early October evening here at the Red River State Recreation Area. \u201cI woke up to a realization this morning,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker, who is 69, says with a deadpan expression. \u201cThe only way I will have a smoking hot body is when I\u2019m cremated.\u201dHe cracks up. \u201cI love telling jokes,\u201d he says.Mr. Shoemaker is a work camper, one of thousands of modern-day nomads who live in their motor homes or trailers, traveling from campground to campground for seasonal jobs. A majority of work campers are in the second half of life, many well into the traditional retirement years.Mr. Shoemaker, who has worked, among other places, behind retailing counters at Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, as well as the spring training camp for the Kansas City Royals and Texas Rangers in Arizona, has joined 550 work campers hired to help stack and store the sugar beet harvest for American Crystal Sugar along the border of North Dakota and Minnesota.The work-camping community illuminates many trends shaping and being shaped by baby boomers, including the search for both money and meaning in life as they grow older. Work campers (often shortened to workampers) run the gamut from low-income retirees to the well-heeled. But they all seem to thrive on a mobile lifestyle that works for those who prize their independence but may strike many of their peers as rootless.\u201cThey\u2019re retired and need money,\u201d says Al Sorensen, 70, the work-camper liaison for the sugar beet harvest for Express Employment Professionals in Grand Forks, N.D. \u201cBut they\u2019re tired of the plain old corporate life.\u201dThe work combines elements of the gig economy, telecommuting and contingent labor increasingly commonplace among American workers. Like the gig economy, the schedule is flexible and, in a sense, work campers do their job from their home \u2014 that is, a mobile home.The pay is low, typically $7.25 to $12 an hour. And a lot of the jobs are hard: One of the more popular is working during seasonal peaks in an Amazon warehouse fetching orders. Most work campers do not put in enough hours to make a living wage.On the other side of the equation, the rewards include traveling America\u2019s highways and byways, working at a variety of tasks and spending time in campgrounds near beautiful scenery. Work camping also comes with a measure of freedom, particularly for those who have Social Security and a pension to fall back on. Bad manager? Rev up the R.V. Don\u2019t like the work? Head for the hills.Wearing a blue hard-hat and a yellow safety vest at an American Crystal storage and processing facility, Bill McClain is working the harvest for the sixth time. He is 60 years old and a self-described \u201ceconomic refugee.\u201dMr. McClain owned a Harley-Davidson shop in Hesperia, Calif., for 22 years. The disheartening combination of the economic downturn and increased state regulations, he said, pushed him and his wife to sell everything in 2010, buy a Holiday Rambler R.V. and join the work-camping community.\u201cI like the lifestyle 90 percent of the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I hate the job, I just do it. But we don\u2019t go back.\u201d When the sugar beet harvest is done, they plan to hit the road and spend time with family. After that, seasonal jobs in Arizona and California beckon.\u201cThere is work all over the country,\u201d Mr. McClain said. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018cruising the 70s.\u2019 You try and stay at 70 degrees as much as possible.\u201d\u201cMost, I believe, are motivated by the general impression that their savings may be gone before they are,\u201d she emailed from her 28-foot Safari Trek R.V. on the road near Las Vegas. \u201cWorkamping allows them to enjoy their years on the road without fear of depleting their savings.\u201dThe sugar beet harvest is considered good pay. Newcomers start out at $12.85 an hour for 12-hour shifts. (Experienced workers and machine operators get more.) Four of those hours are overtime Monday through Friday; Saturday is at 1.5 times pay and Sunday two times. The campsite fees are paid for by the employer, a common arrangement.Many of the jobs involve assisting the operators stacking sugar beets in piles 30 feet high, about 80 feet across and a quarter-mile to a half-mile long. Other jobs include picking up sugar beet bags weighing roughly 30 pounds for testing at the quality lab. The harvest lasts only 10 to 12 days, depending on the weather.Vicky Loftis, formerly of Caruthers, Calif., says she is enjoying the experience. She is 50 and a first-timer in the Red River Valley. \u201cI wanted the adventure of the harvest,\u201d she says. \u201cIn 20 years I can say I worked the sugar beets.\u201dMs. Loftis had a small business helping disabled people learn computers. She owned her \u201cbricks and sticks\u201d home (a common phrase among work campers for a traditional house). She was deeply unhappy. \u201cI was drowning,\u201d she recalled.Single and with no children, Ms. Loftis decided to significantly change her life. She walked away from her business, sold her home and possessions and now lives full time in her weather-beaten R.V., previously owned by her father.She generally works from her motor home on computer-based jobs. Her first seasonal job before the harvest was at a campground high in the mountains near Tucson. It was a change of pace. Among her tasks were checking in campers and cleaning toilets. The extra money is earmarked toward her long-term project of remodeling and upgrading her R.V.\u201cI gifted this lifestyle for myself on my 50th birthday,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is so much to see. I am free to go where I want to go.\u201dSome work campers say they don\u2019t really need the money. For Buddy and Cindy Ward, it\u2019s mostly about having fun and allowing them to pay for their children and grandchildren to visit them over holiday periods. They enjoyed a number of adventures after selling a successful glass installation business they had built from scratch in Georgia. Married 51 years, they became work campers five years ago with their sleek black-and-gold R.V. around the time Mr. Ward, who is now 71, had a stroke.\u201cHis stroke was an eye-opener,\u201d Ms. Ward, 69, said. \u201cIf you want to do something, do it. We love this.\u201dAs for Mr. Shoemaker, the jokester, he retired in 2010 from his job as a machine operator making armor for the Abrams tank at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. Following in the footsteps of his brother and his sister-in-law, he now travels in his R.V. with two Shih Tzus, Kobie and Katie.His previous job was at the Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota. He had never worked the sugar beet harvest and he thought he would give it a try since it was only about 600 miles from Crazy Horse.Since he is experienced and comfortable working with machinery, he was hired to operate a beet piler \u2014 a large, elongated yellow machine reminiscent of a praying mantis. \u201cI can still shovel and work with the best of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI am enjoying the heck out of this.\u201dMr. Shoemaker has a pension from Idaho National and receives Social Security. His R.V. is almost paid off. The seasonal work supplements his income.But the real lure for him, he says, is that the lifestyle keeps him engaged and active. He is intrigued by a job opportunity at a fishing camp in Montana for his next gig after the harvest.\u201cI watched my dad retire, sit in a chair and die a miserable death,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI won\u2019t do that. You have to have a purpose.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM Is Counting on Its Bet on Watson, and Paying Big Money for It", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byWatson, can you grow into a multibillion-dollar business and become the engine of IBM\u2019s resurgence?IBM is betting its future that the answer is yes. Its campaign to commercialize Watson, the company\u2019s version of artificial intelligence technology, stands out, even during the current A.I. frenzy in the tech industry.Yet industry experts question how quickly IBM can build a business around Watson. \u201cIBM has pursued big, bespoke moonshot initiatives that can take years and are extremely expensive,\u201d said Tom Austin, a research fellow at Gartner. \u201cIt seems like they\u2019re swimming upstream with that.\u201dAdapting Watson technology to industries like health care and manufacturing, IBM insists, was always going to be a long-term commitment \u2014 and one that began shortly after Watson beat human champions on the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in 2011.But the years of investment and applied-science projects, IBM executives say, are increasingly turning into moneymaking opportunities in sizable markets.\u201cThis is the broad commercialization of Watson in oncology,\u201d said John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees IBM\u2019s research labs and the Watson business.The new genomics service, IBM executives say, is one step in the company\u2019s march to build a so-called ecosystem of corporate partners and software developers that use Watson technology.For a programmer, Watson can provide code that allows a start-up\u2019s software to read and interpret legal documents more easily, for example. For a big company, Watson can provide not just software but also IBM consultants helping a retailer, for example, use the technology to customize marketing and improve customer service.The artificial intelligence marketplace, analysts agree, is primed to grow rapidly. A.I. is also the new arena of high-stakes competition in computing, fueled by big data and innovations in software algorithms.The market \u2014 defined as A.I.-related hardware, software and services \u2014 will surge from $8 billion this year to $47 billion by 2020, predicts IDC, a research firm.Today, the A.I. business, experts say, resembles the internet in the mid-1990s: a thing on its own that eventually will be built into all kinds of products and services. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re headed \u2014 A.I. everywhere,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst.All the major technology companies are investing aggressively in A.I. software, including companies beyond IBM like Salesforce, SAP and Oracle that focus on business customers.But consumer internet companies with large cloud computing businesses, analysts say, are most likely to build the equivalent of operating systems for A.I. \u2014 the so-called platforms on which most developers write applications. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are the front-runners.IBM may have a chance to join that group. By 2020, IDC predicts, 60 percent of the A.I. applications will run on the platform of four companies: Amazon, Google, Microsoft and IBM.IBM needs A.I.-fueled growth more than the others. When the company reports its third-quarter financial results on Monday, analysts expect the recent pattern to continue; its new businesses like Watson, data analytics and cloud computing are growing but not fast enough to outpace the erosion in its traditional hardware, software and services lines. Revenue has declined for 17 consecutive quarters.IBM does not report financial results for Watson separately. But the securities research arm of the Swiss bank UBS estimates that Watson may generate $500 million in revenue this year and could grow rapidly in the years ahead, possibly hitting nearly $6 billion by 2020 and almost $17 billion by 2022.IBM has acquired industry expertise and proprietary data sources, in addition to supplying A.I. platform tools and technology. \u201cIBM has taken a very different approach from Google, Amazon and Microsoft,\u201d said Judith Hurwitz, an independent analyst. \u201cIt\u2019s leveraging data and the knowledge of experts.\u201dIBM first focused on health care, and that business now accounts for two-thirds of the Watson unit\u2019s employment. Three years ago, IBM experts began working with leading medical centers. And it has spent more than $4 billion buying a handful of companies with vast stores of medical data like billing records, patient histories, and X-ray and M.R.I. images. \u201cA.I. machines are only as smart as the data you give them,\u201d Mr. Kelly noted.Watson\u2019s core strength, dating back to the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d competition, is its ability to read and interpret words, known as natural-language processing. Once trained, Watson can digest thousands of documents in minutes.At the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Watson was tested on 1,000 cancer diagnoses made by human experts. In 99 percent of them, Watson recommended the same treatment as the oncologists.In 30 percent of the cases, Watson also found a treatment option the human doctors missed. Some treatments were based on research papers that the doctors had not read \u2014 more than 160,000 cancer research papers are published a year. Other treatment options might have surfaced in a new clinical trial the oncologists had not yet seen announced on the web.But Watson read it all. \u201cHumans enabled by A.I. is the way to go with genomics,\u201d said Dr. Norman E. Sharpless, head of the school\u2019s cancer center.The byline for an article on Monday about IBM\u2019s efforts to commercialize Watson, its artificial intelligence technology, was omitted.

{"Headline": "Jared Kushner Talks of a Trump TV Network With a Media Deal Maker", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump\u2019s son-in-law has discussed the possibility of a Trump-branded television network with a friend who has helped guide such deals.Jared Kushner, who is married to Mr. Trump\u2019s older daughter, Ivanka, had conversations about the idea with Aryeh B. Bourkoff, the chief executive of LionTree, a boutique investment bank that has helped advise media deals.But such an effort, reported earlier on Monday by The Financial Times, would face enormous obstacles: Creating a television network would require a major cash investment, as well as a willingness by cable providers to carry the network. Without both, discussions of a television network would remain in the realm of fantasy.About a month ago, Mr. Kushner informally reached out to Mr. Bourkoff, a veteran media investment banker, about setting up a Trump television channel, according to a person briefed on the matter. But the conversation with Mr. Bourkoff was brief and has not progressed since, and the banker is unlikely to work on such a network, this person added. Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bourkoff are friends and speak frequently.A spokesman for LionTree declined to comment. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.Within Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, top aides over the summer made reference to the possibility of running a media holding after the election, guided by the belief that the Republican nominee would win and such a property could help bolster his agenda, according to a person with direct knowledge of those discussions, who also asked for anonymity.People close to the Trump campaign have noted the emphasis that Mr. Kushner has placed on digital advertising, as Mr. Parscale has amassed data that has limited applicable use in a political race.But Mr. Trump himself is said to have expressed limited enthusiasm for the idea of \u201cTrump TV.\u201dMr. Trump, who historically gets investors for his major projects, seems unlikely to put in large amounts of his own cash into a potentially risky venture.What\u2019s more, major cable providers like Charter, Time Warner Cable and Comcast might be reluctant to give Mr. Trump visibility by putting a Trump channel in their lineup.When Rupert Murdoch created Fox News two decades ago, he faced hurdles in getting a channel from Time Warner Cable. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, helped broker a deal by which Fox would be aired broadly. Mr. Giuliani is now an adviser to Mr. Trump.Starting a TV network is no easy feat, as Oprah Winfrey, the popular daytime host turned media mogul, learned.In January 2008, Ms. Winfrey announced with much fanfare that she was teaming up with the media group Discovery Communications to start OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network. Ms. Winfrey would take on responsibility for the programming, while Discovery planned to convert its Discovery Health network to the new venture and help with distribution and other operations. OWN was expected to make its debut the next year.But Ms. Winfrey struggled out of the gate. The start was delayed until January 2011, in part because of issues with programming the round-the-clock network. Discovery invested more than $500 million. It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that the network broke even.That was all during an easier time for television networks, before they faced such competition from streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.The experience is a lesson for anyone in just how arduous and costly it is to start a television network, land distribution, attract viewers and, ultimately, make money.Michael de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That will still correspond to just one-third of the North American market, whose value is expected to reach $47 billion over the same period.Despite that relatively small size, Europe\u2019s market remains one of the largest for American cloud providers, many of which are increasing investments worldwide as companies and individuals increasingly rely on cloud-based services \u2014 such as iCloud, from Apple, and Dropbox, the online storage company \u2014 in their daily lives.In an interview, Rainer Strassner, manager of Microsoft\u2019s cloud program in Germany, said the country\u2019s law protected data stored on the servers there from information requests by foreign governments, including the United States.While such investments have focused primarily on business customers, other American tech companies have made similarly large investments aimed at speeding up digital services for everyday users across the 28-member European Union.Facebook is also working on its own Irish cloud computing center, while expanding an existing site in Sweden.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Day, Cars Will Connect With Your Fridge and Your Heartbeat", "Date": "2016-10-13", "News": "Supported byWheelsWHEN Bruce Wayne rolled up to his Bat Cave, a roadblock dropped automatically, the camouflaged garage door swung open, the lights flickered on and Alfred was already standing by.\u201cThe car is going to become another node in the internet of things,\u201d said Kamyar Moinzadeh, chief executive of Airbiquity, a Seattle software and engineering company specializing in vehicle tracking and telematics.But cars more fully integrated into the so-called internet of things \u2014 everyday devices able both to send and receive data \u2014 could become more of a seamless piece of the daily digital fabric of people\u2019s lives.BMW announced this month that its Connected services would enable Alexa owners to lock the car doors and check car battery levels from the comfort of their sofas.Ford Motor plans to introduce Alexa integration into vehicles, including the Escape and Fusion, before the end of this year, said James A. Buczkowski, who oversees advanced engineering at Ford.\u201cYour spouse could add things to the shopping list, which your car would alert you to,\u201d Mr. Buczkowski said. The updated list could then automatically tip off the car\u2019s navigation system about where to pick up the last-minute items.The first generation of connected systems like G.M.\u2019s OnStar were focused on helping drivers when they were lost or their cars broke down, and the second generation has been about connecting the dashboard to smartphones for streaming live traffic information or audio services like Pandora, said Mr. Moinzadeh at Airbiquity.The next generation, he said, will focus on managing our entire digital lives, aided by semiautonomous systems that assume more responsibility for actual driving tasks.\u201cOnce we get to the world of autonomous driving, these cars are not going to be about horsepower but about the in-vehicle experience and how it\u2019s connected to your lifestyle,\u201d Mr. Moinzadeh said. \u201cThe car will talk to all your connected things, whether it\u2019s your refrigerator or your home security system.\u201dMercedes-Benz is among the automakers intent on integrating cars more fully into the mobile communications network, without waiting to peg it to autonomous driving.\u201cThe car is developing into a quality-time machine,\u201d Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Daimler, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, said last month at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin.Next year, Mr. Zetsche said, the company\u2019s In Car Office services will automatically connect drivers to scheduled conference calls and navigate to appointments based on calendar entries.Other industry executives see potential health and safety applications.\u201cIn health care, it\u2019s about monitoring people and how they are behaving,\u201d said Bret Greenstein, vice president for the Watson internet-of-things artificial intelligence division at IBM.Driver attentiveness can be assessed by a combination of sensors in the car, including acoustic monitors, eye trackers and wearable devices, Mr. Greenstein said.\u201cEven how fast or safely you drive tells us about your mood and well-being,\u201d he said.Brain waves and heart rates can indicate stress, according to Mr. Buczkowski of Ford. Such signals might then tell the car to block incoming calls or switch the audio system from AC/DC to Yanni.The welter of onboard sensors, Mr. Buczkowski said, could turn the car into a four-wheeled digital stethoscope that compiles a continuous record of your condition, generating a more accurate assessment of your health compared with the snapshot of a once-a-year checkup.Between the digital dreams and the on-road reality, though, there are technological challenges, according to Chris Penrose, who oversees the internet-of-things group at AT&T. The company, he said, is working on such efforts with nearly 20 different auto brands around the world.But right now, for example, there is no single networking standard for internet-of-things devices, even in the so-called smart home segment. There are multiple wireless systems, including ZigBee and Z-Wave, and no single software platform has taken hold.\u201cThere are multiple gateways into the house now,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive technology for the Silicon Valley company Nvidia.Onboard car systems must have access to the vast amount of information accumulating from all these devices to take advantage fully of the internet of things, Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cBut if there is no standard,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes it very difficult.\u201dMr. Buczkowski acknowledges the hurdles. Separate and incompatible systems from Google and Amazon might be able to compete or coexist in the home market. But cars operate in the public sphere and will need to share information with traffic systems, parking meters and other cars.\u201cVehicles from Ford, G.M., Honda, etc., will all have to talk to each other,\u201d Mr. Buczkowski said. \u201cHow do we manage it \u2014 and who manages it?\u201d\u201cIn automotive, it\u2019s a unique situation because the device is traveling at 60 or 70 miles per hour,\u201d Mr. Moinzadeh said.There is also the sheer ubiquity of automobiles. Everything around us will be connected, including people and cities, said Mohamad Nasser, general manager of the internet-of-things business at Sprint, the mobile communications company.\u201cYou don\u2019t want people messing around with the streetlights,\u201d Mr. Nasser said.While being constantly online may have its drawbacks, it also makes vehicles more resilient, experts say. More and more, as Tesla has already demonstrated, our cars will be upgradable over the air, making them easier to update and repair. And if cars are communicating with their surroundings and one another, the benefits will outweigh the risks, many predict.But the risks cannot be ignored. Tim VanGoethem, a vice president at the telematics firm Harman International, which has been focusing on automotive security, said the threat from hackers was one aspect of an inevitable evolution automakers would have to confront.\u201cOnline shopping and mobile banking,\u201d he pointed out, \u201chave had to go through this already.\u201dAdvertisement"}
