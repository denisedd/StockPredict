{"Headline": "Salesforce Rules Out a Bid for Twitter", "Date": "2016-10-14", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Twitter may have to fix its problems on its own, at least for now.Salesforce.com, the enterprise software maker that had been the most likely bidder for the embattled social media company, has declined to pursue a takeover.As Salesforce exits, virtually no other suitors seem likely to emerge. Rumors of potential other bidders \u2014 Google, Disney and Apple were among the names floated \u2014 quickly evaporated.Shares of Twitter, which had stabilized on the hopes that Salesforce might still make a bid, dropped about 5 percent in afternoon trading on Friday, to $16.88.And shares of Salesforce rose about 5 percent, to $74.27.Mr. Benioff confirmed his remarks but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Twitter, Kristin Binns, declined to comment.The interview all but confirms that Twitter will need to pursue a self-help plan rather than looking to a new owner that could shield it from the skepticism of stock market investors.Despite its prominence as a forum for public discussion \u2014 especially during the presidential race \u2014 Twitter has still lost ground to competitors old and new. Some Twitter users have been leaving the service, and the company has found it difficult to persuade people to join. Its advertising revenue growth is also on a path toward slowing down.During the weeks when rumors of a Twitter deal reached fever pitch, speculation swirled around potential divides within the company\u2019s board. Among those who opposed a sale, at least at first, was Jack Dorsey, its co-founder and chief executive.More recently, Mr. Dorsey had become increasingly open to selling the company. Without a deal, Mr. Dorsey and his team are more likely to face tough questions when earnings are reported on Oct. 27.\u201cThere is declining advertising interest in Twitter,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cWhen you overlay that with the company\u2019s current fundamentals, you\u2019ll see very little top line revenue growth next year.\u201dAt the same time, companies mooted as potential buyers had decided that Twitter at its current valuation \u2014 its market capitalization has surpassed $13 billion at certain points \u2014 was too expensive and required too much work to fix.Salesforce\u2019s investors are probably feeling some relief.For much of its 17-year existence, Salesforce has relied on acquisitions to grow, augmenting its core customer-relationship management offerings. But 2016 has proved a particularly active time for deal-making at the company. Salesforce has bought 13 companies for more than $4.4 billion.Shareholders were upset that in August, Mr. Benioff agreed to pay $582 million for a company called Quip, a maker of real-time collaboration software that had negligible revenue. But Mr. Benioff said he needed its founders to rebuild his corporate architecture for the next new things in corporate software.A bid for Twitter \u2014 a consumer-oriented company with significant challenges \u2014 represented to many investors an act of overweening ambition. At a $12 billion market cap, Twitter would have been the largest deal yet for Salesforce, which is worth $50 billion.In an interview during his annual customer conference this month, he said he was attracted to Twitter as a way for companies to field customer complaints and promote themselves, and pursued the deal in part to learn more about the current tech market.Some of that may have been bluster. Mr. Benioff has often treated his company a bit like a start-up, both in his generous stock grants to employees and his single-minded decision-making. Yet many large Salesforce shareholders, including the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, sent emails and other messages to Salesforce executives voicing their displeasure.The prospect of a shareholder revolt could have proved disastrous for the company, which relies heavily on its stock for its deal-making and to pay its employees. A sustained drop in Salesforce\u2019s stock price would harm both activities.In a meeting with analysts last week, Mr. Benioff sounded unusually contrite and somewhat shocked that his impetuous style had riled his biggest shareholders. \u201cWe will think through everything, but we would never do a deal that would ever do the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at that meeting.By Friday, Mr. Benioff conceded that Twitter was a deal he could afford to pass up.\u201cIt\u2019s not the right fit for us for many different reasons,\u201d he said in the Financial Times interview.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paying $15 Billion for Twitter Will Be Hard for Anyone to Justify", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsTwitter\u2019s openness to being sold has set off a tweetstorm with a direct message: It will be hard for a new owner to make buying the $15 billion social network stack up.All the excitement has shaken up investors. Twitter shares soared as much as 35 percent in the days after a Sept. 23 report on CNBC that said the company was moving closer to a sale. They tumbled 20 percent on Thursday after the news reports that Google and others had lost interest.In the meantime, the stock of Salesforce.com has fallen more than 5 percent in a day on two occasions after being linked to the auction \u2014 and rebounded again after remarks by its chief executive, Marc Benioff, suggested that he might not be that eager. Salesforce, a $50 billion business-software maker, is short on cash, and investors probably aren\u2019t thrilled about the idea of being diluted for Twitter. More generally, though, there is no way conventional financial analysis can help any company rationalize an acquisition of the purveyor of 140-character messages.Twitter is expected to lose about $270 million next year. Add back around $100 million of interest, then cut in half the roughly $1.7 billion of research and development and marketing costs, as a buyer might do. Twitter\u2019s operating profit would then be about $700 million. According to Morningstar, Twitter\u2019s weighted average cost of capital is roughly 9 percent. To generate an equivalent return on investment, even generously assuming a zero tax rate, would mean paying no more than $7.7 billion for the company, about half its current market value.Silicon Valley often prefers its own oddball math. Twitter may look cheap next to what Microsoft is paying for LinkedIn if the chosen metric is price per monthly active user. Or a company like Alphabet, the parent of Google, might think it can wring more value from Twitter\u2019s ample data. The topic that seems to be trending, though, is that it will be hard for anyone to justify buying Twitter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Companies That Avoid Taxes", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byThe most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes.Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax.Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It\u2019s called cash taxes paid \u2014 the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes.I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country\u2019s 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If Hillary Clinton wins, it may well be.A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes.Remember: That\u2019s not just federal taxes. It\u2019s federal, state, local and foreign taxes.How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices.Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. AT&T and General Electric each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. Coca-Cola, Apple and IBM paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) is at 16 percent. Boeing is at 8 percent, Facebook at 4 percent.\u201cThe tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. \u201cAll these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.\u201dThere is another victim, too \u2014 one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can\u2019t take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren\u2019t as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven\u2019t persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can\u2019t easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, Home Depot, Walmart and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon\u2019s rate.This system is cumbersome \u2014 causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance \u2014 and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors\u2019 money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they\u2019re just looking out for the rest of us.Don\u2019t be fooled.Advertisement"}

Amazon, which is the most opaque large company in tech, told investors that it was expecting a remarkably wide range in business performance in the holiday quarter.

No competition within markets makes me very sad, even if I do get to make a fiber joke.Man, I feel like I think about Twitter\u2019s mortality more frequently than my own. Is there any good news this time?Also, layoffs can be seen a few ways. It\u2019s always painful and you can\u2019t cheer when a company does it. Real people and their lives are affected by them. That being said, Twitter employs 3,900 people, and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t tell you what most of them actually do all day. I\u2019m not sure they could, either. So, perhaps this was something that was a long time coming, as many people around the company will grudgingly admit.Anyway, they\u2019re doing O.K., considering.

I think Apple should have just bought a carmaker and brought it all in-house. Seems to me that the great hubris of Silicon Valley is thinking that you can build everything, no matter how complex, on your own.TechCrunch criticized the hire, citing a screed against the homeless that Gopman posted to Facebook a while back that made him persona non grata of San Francisco for quite some time.For me, the biggest takeaway here is that VR tweets seem like the most insane thing ever. But I have been wrong before.To me, it seems we\u2019re witnessing a newfound political awareness in the tech industry, which is reliably lefty but has long been willing to sit out national political disputes. I don\u2019t think Thiel\u2019s donation is going to cost him anything beyond social awkwardness, but in the long run, I suspect it will spark a progressive awakening among many in the industry. What do you think?To me, if you\u2019re building technology that is literally shaping the world as it will be defined in the future, there is no avoiding that your personal ideologies will come into question at some point. Perhaps this Thiel situation will finally bring that sense of self-awareness to those who hadn\u2019t realized this yet. In any case, yeah, I think it\u2019s probably going to rouse techies to be more vocal than they\u2019ve been in the past.It\u2019s a novel idea: People still want to play video games on their big-screen TVs at home, so you have to produce a console as successful as the Xbox or PlayStation that can run next-generation graphics and games.That said, everyone games on the go these days. The advent of the smartphone changed what we think of when we think of gaming, as users have migrated en masse to freemium or low-cost app gaming on their phones. It\u2019s easier if, say, you\u2019re commuting, since you only have to carry one device that you already have in your pocket anyway.I have my thoughts on this \u2014 namely, it could be awesome or terrible \u2014 but I wonder mostly about the content that needs to fill this thing out. And other than the highly successful franchises Nintendo has built out over the years like Mario, Zelda and a handful of others, I haven\u2019t really seen any blockbuster titles from them in some time.What do you think? Fail or win?But if that\u2019s the case, you have to wonder why you need a stand-alone device \u2014 why couldn\u2019t you just carry around a controller for your smartphone or tablet, and then connect your device to your TV when you\u2019re home? In other words, why is Nintendo making new hardware when it could simply put out its games for the iPhone, iPad and Android devices?To me, it seems like a complicated path. I\u2019d favor something simpler: Kill the hardware, focus on creating killer games, release them for high prices on iOS and Android, and profit.Look at Disney: After they bought \u201cStar Wars\u201d they planned to crank out a movie a year until 2020, and everywhere I look there\u2019s a BB-8 motorized ball for me to trip over.O.K., enough for me today.

{"Headline": "AT&T Aims for an Empire in Merger Talks With Time Warner", "Date": "2016-10-21", "News": "Supported byFor companies that sell consumers cable and internet service, merely distributing entertainment and programs is not enough. They want to own them.The media conglomerate Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN and the movie studio Warner Bros., has long been among the most prized takeover targets.It is being courted by AT&T, a telecommunications giant that lacks ownership of any of the shows and videos it delivers through its various businesses. The two are in advanced talks for AT&T to acquire Time Warner, and a deal may be announced as early as Monday, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.A merger would come at a pivotal time in the communications industry, where the giants are scrambling to create entertainment empires to maintain competitiveness as consumers increasingly embrace cheaper, digital alternatives.Regulators have been wary of allowing combinations of businesses that could create less competition and thwart innovation by start-ups, and a tie-up of AT&T and Time Warner could raise concerns. It is a bold move in an election year that will usher in a new administration and a fresh set of regulators.Time Warner is asking AT&T to pay more than $90 a share in the deal, said the people who asked not to be named because the details are still private.The transaction is not yet final and may fall apart or get delayed, said the people with knowledge of the discussions. Representatives from Time Warner and AT&T declined to comment.A combination with AT&T would be an about-face from Time Warner\u2019s strategy just seven years ago. The company divested Time Warner Cable in 2009, and Time Inc. in 2014, in order to focus on developing programs and entertainment.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Still, AT&T has historically been less aggressive than its peers in building a content empire. It was a losing bidder for Yahoo, for example.AT&T has a tendency to acquire industry leaders. In the media world that would be Time Warner and Disney, and Disney\u2019s $150 billion market valuation makes it a much larger takeover to swallow. Two other companies, Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family, have been exploring a reunification.The biggest question posed by analysts after Bloomberg News first reported the talks on Thursday is whether or not this transaction would pass regulatory muster. Regulators including the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department have historically been skeptical of similar combinations.\u201cAt best, we believe a lengthy antitrust review of T/TWX with an uncertain outcome may give both sides pause on considering a combination,\u201d Credit Suisse research analysts wrote in a note on Thursday using the ticker symbols for AT&T and Time Warner. \u201cAt worst, it may act as a barrier to a deal being proposed, in our view.\u201dAdditionally, it is an audacious move with the presidential election just around the corner, which will most likely yield a reshaping of the top regulators that will study this deal. Hillary Clinton has promised to be tough on corporate mega-powers and consolidation within industries. Most analysts have surmised that a deal between AT&T and Time Warner would carry a significant amount of regulatory scrutiny.For Jeff Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, signing a deal may be worth the risk, if AT&T is willing to pay both a high enough price and a generous breakup fee in the event that the combination is blocked, said Richard S. Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.In addition to the potential regulatory challenges, an acquisition of Time Warner would be a large one for AT&T to digest. The combined company would have about $150 billion worth of debt, with around $175 billion in annual revenue. In a low-interest rate environment, financing of such large deals has been more prudent.Some analysts are skeptical that AT&T could handle the deal. AT&T has said its \u201cplate is full\u201d in absorbing DirecTV, Mike McCormack, an analyst with Jefferies, said in a note.Time Warner itself is no stranger to slicing and merging. The company is a byproduct of a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1989, which created the largest media conglomerate in the world at the time, with cable, publishing and movie assets. Seven years later, the company acquired Turner Broadcasting, bringing the cable network CNN under its wing.In 2000, Time Warner merged with AOL, a combination that has since been seen as one of the largest mistakes ever in deal making. Nine years later, Time Warner said it would spin off AOL at a fraction of its valuation after the dot-com bubble burst.These days, Time Warner\u2019s units comprise premium channels such as HBO and Cinemax, as well as Turner, which operates TBS, Turner Sports and others, in addition to CNN. Time Warner also runs Warner Bros. Entertainment, which released movies including \u201cSully,\u201d \u201cStorks\u201d and \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d this year.If the deal between AT&T and Time Warner succeeds, other media and entertainment companies could become takeover targets. Many stocks in that industry gained on Friday as more reports surfaced about the deal.Time Warner\u2019s shares gained 7.8 percent on Friday to $89.48, while AT&T\u2019s declined 3 percent to $37.49.Michael J. de la Merced and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Predicts a Big Holiday Bounce After Its Biggest Rival, Samsung, Falters", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple predicts that strong sales of its new iPhones will soon pull the company out of a yearlong slump.And the misfortunes of its archrival, Samsung, probably deserve a bit of the credit.On Tuesday, Apple said it expects sales to start growing again in the upcoming holiday quarter, driven largely by consumer purchases of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which went on sale in September.\u201cThere\u2019s more demand we can supply right now,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said in an interview. Interest in the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple\u2019s largest model and the most direct rival to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 7, is so intense that Apple said production could still lag demand even by December.If the company\u2019s forecast is accurate, it will mark a turnaround from what has been a disappointing year for the Silicon Valley giant. In April, Apple announced that sales in the first three calendar months of 2016 shrank for the first time in 13 years.The poor performance continued through the quarter that ended on Sept. 24, the company reported on Tuesday. For the most recent three-month period, Apple said, revenue fell 9 percent to $46.9 billion. Net income fell 19 percent to $9 billion.One bright spot for Apple was the accelerating growth of its services businesses \u2014 essentially its cut of iPhone app sales as well as subscriptions to Apple Music and other services such as cloud storage. Revenue from services was up 24 percent as the company squeezed more value from the billion or so Apple devices that it estimates are in active use.\u201cThe next big product is the App Store,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research, who sees services as an underappreciated part of Apple\u2019s business.Mr. Maestri said that revenue from Apple Music, the company\u2019s streaming service, grew 22 percent in the quarter and more than offset the decline in music downloads from the iTunes store.Based primarily on the robust demand for the iPhone 7, Apple raised its financial projections for the quarter that will end in December, when crucial holiday sales occur. The company said it expects revenue of $76 billion to $78 billion, compared to $75.9 billion in the same quarter last year.China, a key market for Apple where sales have fallen sharply, appears to be stabilizing. In the September quarter, sales in greater China were about flat compared to the June quarter. Sales were still down 30 percent compared to the previous year, but Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said he was optimistic about an improvement.\u201cWe are very bullish on China,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be a new normal there, but the new normal is a good growth rate.\u201dApple shares were down about 2.6 percent in after-hours trading.While phones account for the majority of Apple\u2019s business, its Mac laptop and desktop personal computers remain significant contributors to the company\u2019s bottom line. On Thursday, Apple is expected to announce several major updates to its Mac lineup, including the first major overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop in four years.Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at the Jensen Quality Growth Fund, said that Apple\u2019s phones are gradually becoming commoditized, yielding lower profit margins. Services, which are far more profitable, will drive the company\u2019s future growth.\u201cApps and services have higher margins,\u201d said Mr. Walkush, whose mutual fund has been building its stake in Apple stock. \u201cIt makes it more annuity-like.\u201dMr. Cook got a bit prickly when asked about artificial intelligence technology found in devices made by competitors like Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google \u2019s Home. Those gadgets rely on amassing a large amount of information about users to deliver personalized information.He said Apple could deliver similar personalized services through its Siri technology without compromising privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s a false trade-off that people want you to believe, that you have to give up privacy to have A.I. to do something for you. We don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Mr. Cook said.As for new areas of focus for the company, he said Apple remains very interested in television content. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view,\u201d Mr. Cook said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Pixel Review: Assessing the New Smartphone", "Date": "2016-10-18", "News": "Supported byTech FixThe absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre. It is slower than Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung\u2019s smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel\u2019s camera don\u2019t look as good as the iPhone\u2019s. And Google\u2019s built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb.Google said that it had optimized Pixel to be speedy, with real-world applications that consumers could perceive, like making the touch screen feel very responsive. It also said that it would improve its virtual assistant over time and that photos taken with the Pixel look more natural.Here\u2019s what stood out in my tests of Pixel:Google\u2019s Still-Annoying AssistantAnd so it was with Google\u2019s supposedly new-and-improved virtual assistant, called Assistant, on the Pixel. The search giant says the difference with Assistant is that it is capable of \u201ctwo-way conversations.\u201d In plain English, what Google means is you can make requests to Assistant and ask follow-up questions, and Assistant might understand the context to respond appropriately.Google offers this example: You can ask, \u201cWhere is the Taj Mahal?\u201d and then ask, \u201cHow old is it?\u201dWhile that sounds compelling in theory, Assistant failed at responding fully to many requests made with natural language. When I asked, \u201cWhat time is \u2018Westworld\u2019 on TV?\u201d Assistant displayed a web search result containing the synopsis for the new sci-fi show. When I followed up with, \u201cSo what time is it on?\u201d Assistant told me the current time, which was 9:35 p.m.From there on, Assistant continued to hit foul balls. When I said, \u201cbook me a table nearby,\u201d Assistant would try to book a table only at a restaurant called Rich Table, and didn\u2019t list other options.On the plus side, Assistant can handle a conversation about the weather. When I asked for the weather and it said it was raining, I asked whether it would stop raining this week. \u201cRain is not expected this week in San Francisco,\u201d it said. Better.In its current state, attempting to accomplish complex tasks with Assistant on Pixel will waste more time than it saves.A Mediocre Camera Like pretty much every handset maker, Google proclaims Pixel\u2019s camera to be the best on the market. Its rear camera has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, similar to the iPhone 7\u2019s 12-megapixel sensor. So I took photos with the Pixel and compared them with shots taken with the iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7.All the cameras took clear, visually appealing photographs with rich details, but there were major differences in color, even without any filters applied. The photos taken with the Pixel looked colder \u2014 they appeared to exaggerate cyans and magentas. The ones taken with the iPhone looked more vivid, though they appeared to slightly bump up yellows to make photos look warmer. The color in pictures taken with the Samsung phone looked oversaturated and unnatural.I decided to let a blind jury weigh in. My partner, a professional photographer, took photos with each camera of a plant in a colorful vase in natural lighting. She labeled each photograph A, B and C, and I sent the photos out to 30 people and, without revealing which phone each letter corresponded with, asked them to vote for their favorite. (Before reading the results below, take a look and make your own vote.)Photo A was taken with the Samsung phone, photo B with Google\u2019s Pixel, and photo C with an iPhone 7. Out of 30 votes, 19 voted for the iPhone, eight voted for the Pixel, and three voted for the Samsung phone. People seemed to gravitate toward the warmer color profiles produced by the iPhone.Comparisons With the CompetitionBased on features alone, the Pixel is decent compared with Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S7. Here are some highlights:\u25a0 What sets Pixel apart is its compatibility with Project Fi, Google\u2019s experimental wireless service. You pay at least $30 a month for a package that includes unlimited minutes and messages and 1 gigabyte of cellular data. You can pay $10 more for each extra gigabyte of data or get reimbursed for the cellular data you don\u2019t use.\u25a0 The Pixel\u2019s fingerprint sensor, for unlocking the phone, is annoyingly on the back of the device rather than on the face. So when you\u2019re on the go, you will probably be using two hands \u2014 one to hold the phone and the other to place your fingerprint on the back \u2014 to unlock the Pixel.\u25a0 In speed tests run with the mobile app Geekbench, the Pixel was about 20 percent slower than both the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7.\u25a0 The Pixel wasn\u2019t designed to be water-resistant though Google says it is resistant to water sprays. The Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 survived a dive into a pitcher of water.\u25a0 It\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel still has a headphone jack, which Apple eliminated from its iPhones this year (though it turns out the iPhone\u2019s omission of the jack was not a big deal).The Bottom LineLargely because Samsung, the king of Android phones, is in the penalty box, now is a good time to consider trying something new, be it a different phone service or a different operating system altogether.Using Pixel with Project Fi may also end up saving you money: If you picked, for example, a plan with two gigabytes of data, you\u2019d pay $40 a month for cellphone and data service that works all over the world. In contrast, Verizon charges $55 a month for a similar plan that doesn\u2019t include free international roaming.If you are uninterested in Project Fi and are not deeply invested in Google\u2019s ecosystem, there is another route: Try an iPhone. Apple\u2019s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus outperformed the Pixel in every way in terms of hardware features.And so far, to my knowledge, Apple phones haven\u2019t blown up.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article rendered incorrectly the name of a Google product shown.

{"Headline": "Google Introduces the Pixel, Its Own Smartphone", "Date": "2016-10-04", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For all the bells and whistles of Google\u2019s new smartphone, the biggest point of emphasis is tucked away in small type on the back of the device: \u201cPhone by Google.\u201dToday, most of Google\u2019s smartphone software runs on devices manufactured by companies like Samsung, LG Electronics and Lenovo, with Google\u2019s presence often relegated to the background. But with its new Pixel smartphone, introduced Tuesday at a press event, Google is front and center and selling a phone that it created from the industrial design to the components.Google\u2019s new strategy of controlling both hardware and software for its devices puts the company more directly in competition with Apple and many of its own Android partners. It\u2019s a necessity, Google says, because of the advent of artificial intelligence.Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said devices with artificial intelligence \u2014 where computers can understand what people are saying and respond conversationally with the right information at the right moment \u2014 present a seminal moment in computing on par with the creation of the personal computer, the World Wide Web and smartphones.For Google, artificial intelligence takes form in the Google Assistant. Google demonstrated how the Assistant, through a series of questions, can be used to plan a night out \u2014 from finding out about upcoming concerts at a certain venue to booking a reservation at a restaurant or researching how long the drive from the restaurant to the show will take.\u201cThe goal is to build a personal Google for each and every individual,\u201d Mr. Pichai said.Pixel is the first smartphone with the Google Assistant built into the device. It was part of a new-product barrage including a Wi-Fi router, a virtual reality headset and a Chromecast device for streaming high-resolution video.The Echo\u2019s success informed an important part of Google\u2019s strategy: hardware products that provide a vessel to get the Google Assistant into the hands of consumers.Its competitors are taking a similar path with their A.I. technology. Amazon is now building Alexa into its other hardware products like Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top boxes. Apple is considering expanding the reach of its virtual assistant from the iPhone and iPad into the home with an Echo-like device.\u201cIf you really want to make a step-change difference, you really have to design the software and hardware together,\u201d said Rick Osterloh, who returned to Google in April to be its senior vice president of hardware. He was the president of Motorola when it was owned by Google and moved with the company when it was sold to Lenovo in 2014.Part of Mr. Osterloh\u2019s mandate is to make sense of Google\u2019s fragmented hardware efforts, which span a wide range of devices, from Chromebook computers to Wi-Fi routers. He said he planned to focus Google\u2019s hardware resources in areas that highlight the company\u2019s software, while also creating a unified look and feel to the devices.Creating a uniform experience, especially in the world of smartphones, has been a challenge for Google. Hardware manufacturers often modify Google\u2019s software to make what they sell a little different from that of their competitors.For the last six years, Google worked with other hardware manufacturers such as Samsung and LG Electronics to develop the Nexus line of smartphones. Those phones provided a showcase for the best of Google\u2019s software, but much of the design and production process was handled by the company\u2019s hardware partners.With Pixel, Mr. Osterloh said, \u201cwe wanted to build things as Google intended.\u201dBut becoming a hardware manufacturer is not easy. Google is now exposed to new risks associated with a hardware business, such as managing inventory, providing customer service and procuring components.With the Pixel, Google clearly has Apple\u2019s iPhone in its sights. During an onstage presentation, Mr. Osterloh said the Pixel doesn\u2019t have an \u201cunsightly camera bump\u201d \u2014 a reference to the protruding nub that sticks out from the iPhone\u2019s rear camera.In a commercial for the Pixel, Google also said its phone is all-new while noting that the Pixel comes with a \u201csatisfyingly not new\u201d headphone jack. Apple\u2019s latest iPhones come without a headphone jack, a design decision that has sparked furious debate in the technology news media.The Pixel, which is available for order, will come with a very iPhone-like price, starting at $649. Google said Google Home will sell for $129 and be available starting next month. The Pixel is available at Verizon and Best Buy stores. For people who want to use the phone with a different carrier, Google will sell the phone unlocked at its online store.Advertisement"}

Red Flags", "Date": "2016-10-11", "News": "Supported byAt the same time, Twitter is moving forward as if it will remain an independent company, people involved in the negotiations said.This strategy reflects the challenges Twitter faces.It is trying to clarify the company\u2019s mission and focus, all while handling deal talks, the potential threat of an activist shareholder lawsuit and a declining stock price.Perhaps unsurprisingly, interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees reveal frustration among the rank-and-file. A handful of employees have even stopped showing up for work entirely, several people said.Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, has sent two companywide memos to shore up employees\u2019 spirits, one in mid-September and one last week, but he did not shed light on the rumors about a sale of the company, leading to more grumbling by employees.As it focuses on becoming profitable, Twitter is also looking to sell Vine, the six-second video sharing app, and Fabric, a mobile developer platform.Twitter had talked to Microsoft about acquiring Fabric, according to four people involved in the matter, but those talks stalled when Salesforce, one of Microsoft\u2019s competitors, was rumored to be interested in Twitter.And in a move that is unlikely to help morale at Twitter, the company is also considering additional layoffs, after announcing a cut of more than 300 jobs last year.\u201cMy 2015 return shows adjusted gross income of $11,563,931,\u201d he revealed. \u201cMy deductions totaled $5,477,694.\u201dAbout two-thirds of those represented charitable contributions, he said.

{"Headline": "The Quest to Make a True Blue M&M", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "The Mars research kitchen lacks many of the familiar accouterments of a home kitchen and is really more of a laboratory. Located at the North American headquarters of Mars Chocolate in Hackettstown, N.J., it adjoins a huge manufacturing facility that makes half the country\u2019s M&M supply; when I visited at the end of July, the place was already months into its pre-Halloween production frenzy. In response to growing pressure from consumers across the globe, Mars announced in February that over the next five years it would remove artificial colors from all the processed foods it makes for human consumption, and that pigments found in natural substances would take their place. This research kitchen is where scientists are now cautiously tinkering with the chemistry of some of America\u2019s most celebrated candies.Mars has joined a growing list of global food manufacturers removing artificial dyes from some or all of their products. The companies include Nestl\u00e9 USA, General Mills, Kraft, Frito-Lay, Campbell\u2019s, Kellogg\u2019s and Mondelez International (the maker of Oreos, Tang and Sour Patch Kids). The orange glow of Kraft\u2019s revamped macaroni and cheese now comes from paprika, turmeric and annatto, a coloring extracted from tree seeds. General Mills experimented with 69 different natural dyes before it released a naturally colored Trix and six other reconfigured cereals in January. (The company was unable to find a workable blue or green, so those colors have been left out for now.)In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved Mars\u2019s petition to use the microscopic algae spirulina to make the first natural blue dye approved for use in the United States. As a result, any food manufacturer in the country can legally use spirulina as a colorant. Mars spent years researching spirulina\u2019s safety; in order to overhaul 1,700 or so recipes and update its global manufacturing capabilities, the company desperately needs a substitute for synthetic Blue No. 1, as does the rest of the industry. But right now, there isn\u2019t nearly enough spirulina dye to go around \u2014 and in any case, sometimes it doesn\u2019t yield just the right blue, or the color degrades and comes out blotchy, or it tastes odd. So researchers are still looking everywhere for other natural blue pigments. Among the contenders being tested in laboratories are a berry found in Central and South America, the huito, traditionally used to make dark blue, semi-permanent ceremonial tattoos and as a bug repellent; a blue gardenia flower; red cabbage; aged red wine; a bacteria used to make Swiss cheese; the Japanese kusagi berry; butterfly-pea flowers; and pigments derived from soil bacteria, tree-root fungi, sea sponges and mushrooms. With funding from PepsiCo, another business expanding its use of natural colors, a University of Illinois grad student in pharmacognosy (the study of medicinal substances found in nature), who has spent several years searching for new blues, recently found a previously unknown blue pigment in algae growing in a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park.Many colors have well-established natural-dye alternatives: orange from beta-carotene, for example, or yellow from turmeric, a mainstay in curry. Robbins has spent seven years studying the molecular structures of these dyes, and here\u2019s what she has learned: Natural compounds are unpredictable. The molecules hold on to remnants of the places where they grew \u2014 the minerals in the water, say, or the weather during a growing season \u2014 and sometimes those earthy, atmospheric residues look strange or taste and smell funky. Artificial colors are simple, stable and nonreactive; Robbins calls them \u201chappy campers.\u201d Yellow No. 5 looks the same whether it\u2019s in an acidic product (a Skittle, for instance) or a more basic one (an M&M), while acidic conditions can change a natural pigment from pink to dark blue.On the day I saw her kitchen, Robbins was preparing to produce a test batch of M&Ms colored blue using pigment from red cabbage. The smell of warm chocolate was tinged with a faint, sulfuric sauerkraut smell. Despite the sterile setting, earthy odor molecules from natural dyes somehow made their presence known \u2014 a borscht aroma from the beet dye, a slight eggy scent from the radish. Over the last century, the processed-food industry largely succeeded in replacing fickle nature with synthetic, shelf-stable colors and flavors and preservatives concocted in laboratories. Now that work has to be undone. As Neil Willcocks, vice president of global research and development for the Wrigley division of Mars, told me, \u201cThis is the most complex technical undertaking that any of us have ever seen in the history of the company.\u201dIn the early 1800s, just as chemistry emerged as a real science from the murky realm of alchemy, food sellers increasingly began to add things to their products, usually to hide discoloration or spoilage. Copper made pallid pickles green again; children ate candies turned red with lead; old milk was watered down, dyed yellow and thickened with flour and other dubious powders. Sometimes these colorants and heavy metals killed people directly, but more often \u2014 in milk, for example \u2014 they simply concealed the presence of contaminants or bacteria that caused illness and death.The potential dark side of these garish colors began to emerge on Halloween in 1950. Dozens of trick-or-treating children, in a couple of cities, became ill after eating candy tinted with high levels of Orange No. 1, then one of the most widely used coal-tar additives found in soft drinks, candy, baked goods and processed meats like hot dogs. Government officials collected candy samples and sent them to Washington, where volunteers who ate them became sick with diarrhea and abdominal pain. The episode caused an outcry among parents and politicians, prompting tests of all artificial colorants. Some of the coal-tar dyes \u2014 different colors were created by mixing the hydrocarbons with other chemical compounds \u2014 were found to be relatively safe, but nearly every rat and dog given Orange No. 1 showed signs of distress, ranging from weight loss to death. Scientists deemed the dye an acute toxin. Red No. 32 fared even worse; in one experiment, all 48 rats fed Red No. 32 died.After years of haggling between government and industry, a Supreme Court ruling in 1958 resulted in a final ban for Orange No. 1 and Red No. 32. Two years later, federal legislation led to the prohibition of numerous other dyes and required more rigorous testing of all food colors, eventually leaving us with the seven colors still in use today: Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, Green No. 3, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Red No. 3 and Red No. 40. But fears were renewed in 1973 when a pediatric allergist from San Francisco named Benjamin F. Feingold presented a paper at a medical conference suggesting that the consumption of artificial colors caused hyperactivity in children. Though he had little but anecdotal evidence to support his theory, Feingold wrote two best-selling books that advised parents to remove artificial colors and flavors from the diets of hyperactive children. Despite the popularity of what was called the Feingold Diet, the production of F.D.A.-certified artificial colorants in the United States surged to more than 17 million pounds of powder in 2015 from 1.6 million pounds in 1955. A study released earlier this year found that 43 percent of all food products marketed to children, and 95 percent of fruit-flavored snacks, contain artificial dyes.A meta-analysis of 23 studies undertaken in the decade after Feingold first put forward his advice found the link between diet and hyperactivity too small to be statistically significant. But then in 2004 and 2007, two landmark scientific articles, one published in The Lancet, revealed that consuming some artificial colors had a small but noteworthy effect on hyperactivity in more than 300 British children. The studies prompted the European Union in 2010 to begin requiring food labels to clearly note the presence of several artificial dyes along with the warning that they \u201cmay have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\u201d To avoid having to include that alarming label, many food manufacturers began phasing out synthetic colors in the European market. A year later, an F.D.A. advisory panel voted that no such label was necessary in the United States. (The panel also noted that more research was needed.)Label or no label, American consumers began to lose their appetite for synthetic dyes, too. A survey of some 26,000 American adults over the last three years shows that a full half of them say they want to avoid artificial colors and preservatives. A recent Nielsen poll ranked the absence of artificial food dyes as the third-most-important factor in food-purchasing decisions among consumers worldwide. Parents have created YouTube testimonials and petitions on change.org claiming that their children have become more focused or their nightmares have gone away after cutting artificial dyes from their diet. Videos and blogs show toddlers turning into \u201cmonsters\u201d minutes after eating synthetically colored candies and cupcakes. Some people appeal to companies directly, like the mother of a 9-year-old named Trenton, who said her son abruptly stopped being disruptive at school and hockey practice after he quit eating artificial colors. Her petition to Mars to make M&Ms \u2014 one of the boy\u2019s favorite candies \u2014 with natural colors received nearly 217,000 signatures.There are things we still don\u2019t know about how artificial colors interact with the human body. Research shows that Blue No. 1 is the only dye that crosses the blood-brain barrier, which exists to protect the brain from toxins and pathogens. It enters the fluid inside the skull, but scientists know almost nothing about what it does once it\u2019s there. Rather than continue to defend themselves against these growing concerns, big food companies last year began making public commitments to give up synthetic dyes. Fulfilling those promises has set off a quest for novel colors that calls to mind the preindustrial days when explorers and traders traveled the world collecting indigo from South Asia or a dark red powder derived from cochineal insects used by the Aztecs.This blue-extraction operation, the first in the United States, was opened a year ago by a Japanese chemical company called DIC, which also runs a similar extraction plant in southern China. DIC now produces 90 percent of the world\u2019s supply of spirulina-based blue pigment in these two facilities, and it projects that the market will increase as much as 10-fold over the next two years as the food industry scrambles to replace Blue No. 1. One Mars executive told me that to convert only its blue M&Ms to spirulina blue, the company would, in his estimation, need twice the current global supply. And Mars has committed to converting all the food it makes for humans to natural colors. (Its pet food will still contain artificial colors.)\u201cBlue is going to just explode,\u201d Amha Belay, the affable, crinkly-eyed chief technology officer at the extraction facility, told me in a lilting Ethiopian accent. We were standing atop the four-story-high hot-air dryer, which turns the wet muck into green powder. About 10 percent of that powder is made up of molecules called phycocyanins, which, when wrested from the green, make the highly prized blue dust. Belay looked proud up there, pointing out across the desert, where the company is planning to nearly double the pond acreage over the next couple of years.By 9 a.m., the temperature around the blue extractor was already near 100 degrees, and the air was thick with monsoon moisture pushing up from Mexico. \u201cSpirulina like it hot,\u201d Belay said. Microalgae are an especially promising source of natural pigments, not just blues but also oranges, reds, greens and yellows. Scientists estimate that there may be as many as a million different species of microalgae, and Belay is a natural evangelist for the tiny blobs. He grew up in Addis Ababa, not far from alkaline lakes that teemed with naturally growing spirulina and flocks of flamingos, whose bright pink feathers are colored by pigments called carotenoids found in the algae, which is consumed by brine shrimp, which are eaten by the birds. Without carotenoids, flamingos would be gray (and deciduous trees would not erupt in autumnal glory).Belay and I peeked through a window at the brand-new research-and-development lab next to the extractor. The company, worried that I might give away secrets about its methods and technology, wouldn\u2019t let me inside, but behind the glass I could see Japanese researchers trying to extract other colors from the pond slime. The search feels almost feverish; last year the global market in natural colors was worth an estimated $970 million, up 60 percent since 2011. Natural colors now represent more than half the food-colors market in dollar terms. From here, the blue powder will go to one of the large dye companies (known as the color houses), whose scientists will further tinker with it before selling it to food companies like Mars.\u201cBlue is just the beginning,\u201d said Belay, who thinks about color not as a static thing but as a dynamic universe of visible light. Looking at a mound of algal glop, he knows that it appears green because in the process of converting the sun\u2019s energy, the algae\u2019s chlorophyll molecules absorb blue and red waves and reflect green back to our eyes. Vision is a subtractive process: The human eye sees only what\u2019s left behind, unabsorbed. Strip away the chlorophyll, and underneath there are other pigment molecules like carotenoids, which can be used to make yellows, reds, oranges and browns. In a handful of soggy spirulina, Belay can see the potential for a sort of Crayola wonderland.Everyone I talked to at Mars insisted that they needed to find natural colors that exactly replicate the current artificial ones. The changing of an extremely popular food\u2019s color is viewed warily for legitimate reasons. Humans have learned over millenniums to see in colors signposts indicating safety and danger, so we can avoid having to stick everything in our mouths to find out whether it is poisonous or not.There are two dominant theories about why human vision evolved as it did. Either our perception of color helped us locate food, training us to differentiate the reds of ripened fruit from green foliage, or the way we see emerged from our need to detect changes in one another\u2019s skin tone that might indicate anger or sexual arousal. However it developed, the human perception of color is, like emotion, experiential. As soon as we open our eyes each morning, we\u2019re surrounded by shimmering light that must be converted into something knowable and navigable. Humans can ordinarily distinguish more than two million different colors. Instead of continually reconstructing images of everything we see, our brains take shortcuts by creating color memories as filters. A ripe banana is assigned a particular yellow based on previous experience with bananas. Researchers call this the \u201cmemory color effect,\u201d and not all cultures see and know colors in the same way. A global food conglomerate like Mars, which sells products in 150 countries, wants its goods to be uniformly recognizable anywhere in the world. Aided by marketing and chemistry, brands fight against the different experiences of individual retinas. Companies want their colors to become, in essence, memory colors for the entire species.Just adding a red coloring can make food taste 10 percent sweeter. In one well-known 1980 study, researchers gave people differently colored beverages. Some drinks appropriately matched colors and flavors (cherry with red, say), while others scrambled them. More than a quarter of the taste testers reported that the cherry-flavored drink had a lemon-lime taste when it was colored green, but no one mentioned lemon-lime when the same cherry drink was red. Their brains determined flavors based on color before the liquid touched their tongues.Colors can also influence how much people eat. The greater the variety of colors consumed, the longer it takes someone to feel full. Scientists call this phenomenon \u201csensory-specific satiety.\u201d \u201cIf you look at something that has five or six different colors in it, you go, Wow, that\u2019s going to be fun to eat,\u201d says Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University. \u201cEven if someone says to you, \u2018All those M&Ms taste exactly the same.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t matter. Your mind sees that variety as more enjoyable and tempting than a plain bowl of blue M&Ms, and so you eat more.\u201dWhy anyone wants to eat blue foods in the first place has long confused food scientists. In the natural world, the color tends to flag the presence of things to avoid, like mold, spoiled meat or poisonous berries. People asked to name flavors associated with specific colors easily rattle off answers. Yellow? Bananas, lemons. Red? Cherries, strawberries, apples, ripeness. But blue stumps people, after they mention blueberries. In one study, British participants associated blue with raspberry; in Taiwan, subjects linked blue to mint. But these flavor associations have nothing to do with what\u2019s growing in the soil or ripening on the vine and are instead flavor-color connections created by food companies. Blue was, in some ways, the final frontier in food coloring. Survey respondents around the world overwhelmingly say their favorite color is blue. Yet in the 1960s and \u201970s, marketers and food anthropologists argued that consumers would reject the inherently unappetizing color. In a famous study from the era, a researcher fed subjects steak under color-masking lights. Halfway through the meal, he switched on the regular lights to reveal that the steaks were dyed blue, which induced nausea and illness in the participants who had, until then, been relishing the meat.The predictions that blue food would fail were, of course, wrong. Gatorade introduced the first of several blue drinks in 1995. Blue M&Ms came out the same year, after consumers chose the new color over pink and purple in a contest. By the early 2000s, Heinz had introduced a teal-colored ketchup, Kraft a blue macaroni and cheese and Kellogg\u2019s a cereal that turned milk baby blue. The most gimmicky blue products were eventually discontinued, but the color became a mainstay, especially in the \u201cfun foods\u201d category dominated by candy, sugary drinks and cereals.Look at a bowl of naturally colored Trix cereal set beside its artificially colored predecessor. The effect is akin to putting a watercolor of a desert landscape next to an Andy Warhol print: Nature\u2019s colors are more muted, gentle. For many snack and candy makers, that wimpy palette will not suffice. Until more vibrant colors can be extracted from nonsynthetic sources, some food marketers may have to rely on manipulating visual responses in other ways. \u201cConsumers mostly want things to stay the same as they always have, to taste the same as they always have, to look the same as they always have,\u201d says Charles Spence, a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University whose research has shown that so-called extrinsic colors surrounding a food item \u2014 the color of the plate, say, or flatware \u2014 influence how people see and experience what they\u2019re eating. In one of Spence\u2019s studies, participants rated a pink strawberry mousse as 10 percent sweeter and 15 percent more flavorful when eaten from a white plate compared with a black plate. He\u2019s now consulting with food manufacturers that want to alter their packaging so consumers will be less likely to notice the subtler colors produced by natural dyes.\u201cDo you need a spit cup?\u201d\u201cSomeone get her some water, quick.\u201dDespite the furrowed brows of the scientists, the spirulina-blue M&M tasted good. The hard sugar coating clicked pleasantly against my teeth just before releasing that familiar wash of milk chocolate, the same as any M&M. When I nodded approvingly, the scientists seemed to be relieved. It\u2019s true, the blue is not the same \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s a different blue, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a bad blue,\u201d Robbins, the color-chemistry manager, said \u2014 but it is vibrant, chipper even, and does not come across as a shoddy knockoff. My approval, as a proxy for sweet-toothed consumers, seemed to make these scientists a little giddy.But that changed when we moved on to the spirulina Skittle. I could feel the nervousness of the white-smocked group rise as I was handed a small, clear, plastic cup \u2014 the kind hospitals sometimes use to administer medications \u2014 containing a single round blue candy. I put it on my tongue, and at first all I noticed was the tart hit of sugar and acid inducing that expected rush of saliva. I\u2019ve never chewed under such scrutiny. I quickly swallowed and smiled reassuringly. \u201cJust wait,\u201d Robbins said, and then there it was: a distinct, boggy, shallow-pond-in-late-summer aftertaste.I would have spit, but the scientists seemed so vulnerable already. I took a gulp of water. Their disappointment was understandable: They\u2019ve spent years trying to control these rowdy pigments when what they need and want is something stable and predictable. I felt for them. But I could not help rooting for the spirulina-blue phycocyanin molecule, doggedly carrying with it the turbid water where it grew, the scalding sun in a cloudless azure sky, the white birds wheeling above, hovering for a moment to catch insects on the water\u2019s surface. How brazen this little bit of blue, untamed by the industrial dryers and stainless-steel separation tanks at the pigment-extraction facility; unwilling to be broken by the labs at the big biosciences companies that take that blue powder, further refine it and sell it to food companies as dye. It\u2019s obstinate, even here, so many chemical interventions later, at Mars, where it manifests a whisper of its origin story in a Skittle. Just a faint, lingering flavor, as if to say, \u201cI\u2019m blue because the world, in all its unruly variety, made me this color.\u201dMalia Wollan is a frequent contributor to The New York Times and the Tip columnist for the magazine.

They said the right award might be limited to profits attributable to the protected features, including the iPhone\u2019s rounded corners and grid of icons.But the justices seemed frustrated about how to articulate the right legal standard. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he did not know what jurors should be told in deciding how much companies that infringe design patents must pay.\u201cNeither side gives us an instruction to work with,\u201d he said.Justice Sonia Sotomayor echoed the point. \u201cHow do we announce the right test?\u201d she asked.Kathleen M. Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, said jurors could, for instance, hear expert testimony from accountants.Justice Kennedy responded that such evidence could not place a value on a \u201cstroke of genius\u201d like the design of the Volkswagen Beetle. That analogy came up throughout the argument, with some justices arguing that the car\u2019s design provided much of its value.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. disagreed. \u201cI can\u2019t get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if it, you know, costs, I think, $1,800 when it was first sold in the United States? What if it cost $18,000? What if it got two miles per gallon? What if it broke down every 50 miles?\u201dJustice Stephen G. Breyer said jurors could be given examples. \u201cYou know, wallpaper, you get the whole thing,\u201d he said, referring to total profits. \u201cA Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don\u2019t get all the profit from the car.\u201dDesign patents are far less common than utility patents, which cover how products work. The Supreme Court has not heard a design patent case in over a century.Ms. Sullivan, Samsung\u2019s lawyer, argued that design patents are poorly suited to complex devices with many features, adding that they can give rise to disproportionate penalties.\u201cA smartphone is smart,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work.\u201dDesign patents once covered household items like spoons and fireplace grates \u2014 whose design was central to the product \u2014 and a finding of infringement required the defendant to turn over all of its profits.The case before the Supreme Court is just one challenge faced by Samsung. The firm is killing its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after struggling to address reports that the device can overheat and catch fire because of a manufacturing flaw.The three design elements at issue in this case, Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc., No. 15-777, are, in Samsung\u2019s description, \u201ca particular black rectangular round-cornered front face\u201d; \u201ca substantially similar rectangular round-cornered front face plus the surrounding rim\u201d; and \u201ca particular colorful grid of sixteen icons.\u201dThe court appeared to acknowledge the possibility that \u201can award of a defendant\u2019s entire profits for design patent infringement makes no sense in the modern world.\u201d But it added that \u201cthose are policy arguments that should be directed to Congress.\u201d\u201cWe are bound by what the statute says, irrespective of policy arguments that may be made against it,\u201d the court said.The design patent law says that infringers \u201cshall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit\u201d from the sale of \u201cany article of manufacture.\u201dAs the case reached the Supreme Court, the two sides and the Obama administration all focused on that last phrase, agreeing that the \u201carticle of manufacture\u201d at issue could be a component of the product rather than the entire product sold to consumers.\u201cThe parties, actually, and the government are fairly close,\u201d Justice Breyer remarked.But Ms. Sullivan said the appeals court had not allowed it to make its case on what was the \u201carticle of manufacture.\u201d Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for Apple, responded that Samsung had litigated the case on the understanding that the entire phone was the relevant product and that it could not change its mind now.The justices did not seem inclined to adjudicate that last dispute. \u201cWe have a hard enough question trying to figure out what the standard is,\u201d Justice Breyer told Mr. Waxman. \u201cNow, why can\u2019t we just ask the lower courts to listen to your arguments and theirs, and work it out.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Banks Bet on the Next Big Thing: Financial Chatbots", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byYour bank really wants to chat.This week Bank of America, MasterCard and several financial start-ups announced new tools \u2014 known as chatbots \u2014 that will allow customers to ask questions about their financial accounts, initiate transactions and get financial advice via text messages or services like Facebook Messenger and Amazon\u2019s Echo tower.The early versions of the financial chatbots generally do little more than answer basic queries about recent transactions and spending limits.But companies are aiming to build the chatbots into full-service automated financial assistants that can make payments and keep track of your budget for you.\u201cWhat will banking be in two, three or four years? It\u2019s going to be this,\u201d Michelle Moore, the head of digital banking at Bank of America, said in describing the bank\u2019s new offering, which it has named Erica.These bots are generally powered by artificial intelligence software that lets them pull in data and turn it into comprehensible answers, in the way that Apple\u2019s Siri attempts to do.Many companies are betting that automated bots \u2014 both in text messaging and voice-activated form \u2014 could become the dominant interface of the future, surpassing phone apps and websites as the way to reach consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the tech industry thinks this is the next big thing,\u201d said Tom Poole, the managing vice president of digital at Capital One.Mr. Poole\u2019s firm rolled out its first voice-activated bot on Amazon\u2019s Echo personal assistant system earlier this year, and it is planning advanced capabilities in the coming months: \u201cIt\u2019s just scratching the surface right now.\u201dA few start-ups have already found success \u2014 and attracted attention from the banks \u2014 by creating chatbots that do particular financial tasks.Digit, a San Francisco-based start-up, offers an iOS and Android mobile app that can monitor a customer\u2019s spending habits and pull small amounts of money from a bank checking account into a Digit savings account several times a month \u2014 with all interactions channeled through text messages. The company has raised $36 million from venture capitalists and saved $230 million for its customers since starting in 2015.Saving is one of the features being built into Bank of America\u2019s offering, Erica. The early version that the bank debuted this week can also track your credit score, look at your spending habits and offer advice on how to pay off bills, along with moving money.A day after Erica was unveiled at the financial technology conference Money 2020, MasterCard revealed its Kai offering, which it will make available to the banks that issue its cards. Neither Erica nor Kai is available to customers yet, and the companies did not provide firm release dates.Among the Silicon Valley start-ups working in the same realm, there is a common argument that the new digital financial assistants should come from outside the financial firms, so that they can link to any account a customer may have and bestow unbiased advice.Bank of America, for instance, would have little incentive to suggest that its customers sign up for a credit card with another bank, even if it is offering a lower rate.Several venture capital firms have provided backing to a start-up, Clarity Money, which was released last week and offers a range of services similar to Erica\u2019s.\u201cConsumers should have an unbiased advocate helping them navigate their financial lives,\u201d said Adam Dell, the founder of Clarity and the brother of Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell.Critics of chatbots have said that even with artificial intelligence, bots will continue to lack the intuitive and empathetic understanding that humans need when dealing with difficult problems, such as financial decisions.\u201cWe all know the technology is not there yet,\u201d said Josh Reich, the co-founder of Simple, an online bank that has not released any bot features. \u201cIt\u2019s just people picking up on a hype cycle.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Chilly Reaction to AT&T-Time Warner Deal", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byThe $85 billion AT&T deal for Time Warner won\u2019t win regulatory approval. We will continue our current course even if it does. Will a line of major media consolidation dominoes \u2014 involving titans like Disney, Fox and Comcast \u2014 begin to fall? Not likely.Such was the chilly reaction that senior entertainment executives had on Monday regarding AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner \u2014 even as many analysts speculated in the opposite direction, contending that the deal may force a vast reshaping of the media business as the big seek to compete by getting even bigger.\u201cWe think the likelihood of a Fox bid for Sky now rises,\u201d said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, referring to the pan-European satellite television and internet company. Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG, pondered, \u201cCan Comcast really resist buying T-Mobile?\u201d Michael Morris, a Guggenheim Partners analyst, contended that Disney \u201cshould be strongly considering acquiring\u201d Netflix.The upshot: There was little agreement on Monday about what the aftershocks of AT&T\u2019s weekend acquisition of Time Warner, home to Harry Potter and \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d might look like.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know enough,\u201d Michael Nathanson, one of Wall Street\u2019s more circumspect media analysts, wrote in a research note, putting the odds of AT&T winning regulatory approval at 50-50 \u2014 essentially a coin flip.Maneuvering, however, was in full force.Some senior media executives, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions, said they were assessing what concessions they might be able to extract from AT&T in return for supporting its acquisition. At the same time, Hollywood\u2019s two biggest remaining content conglomerates, the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox, indicated that they would fight the deal in Washington.\u201cA transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,\u201d Zenia Mucha, a Disney spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday.A Fox spokeswoman, Julie Henderson, released a similar statement on Monday: \u201cA deal of this size and scope, and the impact it will have on consumers, should receive the highest level of regulatory scrutiny.\u201dHere is a look at where the AT&T deal leaves other prominent media companies and what some analysts think they might consider in response:The Walt Disney Company, with a market capitalization of $150 billion, is too big to be bought by anyone other than a Google or an Apple. And Disney, which has a singular corporate culture in Hollywood, has made it clear that it sees itself as the predator and not the prey when it comes to technology related deal making.\u201cOne of the key capabilities that Disney lacks as of today is the ability to build a scaled, direct-to-consumer business for its television and studio properties with the associated back end technology expertise,\u201d Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a research note on Monday.The country\u2019s largest cable and broadband operator, Comcast also owns the NBC broadcast network, a bundle of cable television networks including Bravo, USA and MSNBC, film and TV studios and theme parks. What more could Comcast need?Acquiring a wireless company would be particularly pressing, the analysts said, if AT&T introduced a new streaming service bundled with wireless data.The Murdochs have ownership control, and nobody thinks they would be sellers \u2014 especially since Rupert Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan, were given the chance to run the family media company only last year.But the family may have already shown its hand, several analysts and bankers said. Over the long term, Fox thinks it needs to get bigger. That thinking comes from Fox\u2019s unsuccessful $80 billion takeover bid for Time Warner in 2014. If Fox offered that much before, could it make an even bigger offer for Time Warner now? (Ms. Henderson, the Fox spokeswoman, shot down that possibility on Monday.)On the company\u2019s last conference call, James Murdoch, Fox\u2019s chief executive, answered a question about potential acquisitions by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re quite happy with where we are today.\u201d He added that the company would be \u201cvery careful with our capital.\u201d Fox\u2019s recent strategy has involved eschewing trendy takeover targets like Vice Media in favor of reinvesting in channels like National Geographic.The question is whether the AT&T deal changes that stance. Fox could swing into buying mode, tucking in MSG Networks, with holdings in sports television, or even Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns rights to the James Bond franchise.On Monday, some analysts and media executives said that they expected the AT&T-Time Warner deal to accelerate those considerations. The AT&T-Time Warner deal underscores the old industry adage that content is king, they said. The agreement also highlighted the need for entertainment companies to band together so that they would have more heft in negotiations with the larger and larger cable, satellite and wireless companies.But while such a deal may be crucial for the survival of Viacom, which has struggled mightily, the same may not be true for CBS, which is in more of a position of strength. Any CBS-Viacom deal requires winning over Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, who has expressed doubt over the corporate marriage. The latest development may well give Mr. Moonves more bargaining power.Advertisement"}

Last month, Apple released a software update that put its Siri voice assistant on the Mac.\u201cMobile has focused us on simplicity,\u201d said Julie Ask, a technology analyst at the Forrester research firm.The company is hoping that its new iPhones and other products, like the updated MacBooks, will return it to growth during the holidays.The new MacBooks, which are thinner, lighter and faster than previous models, are primarily aimed at business customers and others who spend a lot of time on their computers, said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting stuff done,\u201d he said.The cheapest model with the new Touch Bar, a 13-inch machine, is $1,800, and the 15-inch version starts at $2,400. Apple\u2019s least expensive laptop, the ultralight Air, is unchanged and costs $1,000, while competitors\u2019 machines running Microsoft\u2019s Windows typically cost $500 or less. The models with the Touch Bar can be ordered now and will ship within the next few weeks.The Touch Bar replaces the function keys at the top of the current laptop keyboards and pops up customized functions depending on the app. In Apple\u2019s Photos app, for example, it allows users to perform simple editing and play videos. In the Mail app, the Touch Bar shows reply options, automatically suggests words and phrases and shows a menu of the user\u2019s commonly used emoji.\u201cI do think it\u2019s worth a moment for a requiem for the function key,\u201d Philip W. Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for worldwide marketing, said after unveiling the Touch Bar.The new laptops immediately drew some complaints from current Apple laptop users because they use a newer type of port, USB-C, that requires adapters to work with older accessories.Apple also previewed a new app for its Apple TV set-top box as well as iPhones and iPads. Called simply TV, the app, which will be released in December, will allow users to see in one place their favorite shows from the other video apps on their device. The app will also feature suggestions of new video content to watch, curated by Apple editors.\u201cWe want Apple TV to be the one place to access all of your television,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the event.The service is not quite there, since Apple has not yet signed on key streaming services such as Amazon\u2019s Prime Video, and live television shows are still difficult to get access to on Apple TV.Advertisement"}

Created with the agency Droga5, the campaign includes three videos featuring Mr. Corden interviewing innovators in the restaurant, transportation and lodging fields. The series is called \u201cReserve What\u2019s Next.\u201dJPMorgan Chase introduced the credit card in August. Demand for the card \u2014 which has a $450 annual fee and offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus, as well as triple points for dining and travel purchases worldwide \u2014 was so great that Chase received tens of thousands of applications within the first few days.

They clearly like experiences more than stuff. They clearly want to make their own decisions about everything, including travel. It\u2019s more fun to post a picture of a fish taco or of a sunset over a beach than of a new couch.\u201dDroga5 enlisted David Gelb, director of the documentary \u201cJiro Dreams of Sushi\u201d and the Netflix series \u201cChef\u2019s Table,\u201d to film three videos, each three to five minutes long and featuring a different innovator.

The third video will feature someone from the lodging industry.Ms. Lemkau said Mr. Corden was given \u201cgeneral guidelines\u201d for his conversations with the innovators. \u201cThe whole reason we chose him was because he would be hilariously entertaining unscripted,\u201d she said.All videos will carry the card\u2019s tagline: \u201cTravel\u2019s changing.

Showing off what you own has been replaced by sharing what you do, since sharing experiences is much more egalitarian.\u201dTravel in particular \u201cis the most attainable experience for millennials,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we ask them what they\u2019re saving money for, travel is at the top of their list every time.\u201dMr. Coates praised the documentary style of the new Chase campaign, noting that its behind-the-scenes approach appeals to millennials, who \u201clove to geek out over things, digging into the process behind the product.\u201dHe warned, however, that the card might encourage users to accelerate spending to earn more rewards, thus potentially increasing the debt load of a generation already struggling with student debt.For his part, Mr. Corden said he was thrilled to use the card.\u201cObviously, travel has just always been a huge part of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t come as a shock to tell you that eating has been a huge part of my life.

{"Headline": "Obama Brought Silicon Valley to Washington", "Date": "2016-10-25", "News": "Supported byOn TechnologyThis October, the White House opened its doors to a few thousand people for South by South Lawn, a daylong event described as a \u201cfestival of ideas, art and action.\u201d Both the event and its name were a nod to South by Southwest, the annual technology-and-music festival held in Austin, Tex., where Barack and Michelle Obama showed up as surprise keynote speakers earlier this year. The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version \u2014 the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as \u201ccreator\u201d or \u201cinnovator\u201d \u2014 were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy\u2019s anthem \u201cFight the Power\u201d and Parliament\u2019s \u201cFlash Light\u201d across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon. As the sun began to set, volunteers handed out plaid blankets so people could stretch out on the ground.The event felt like the swan song of the first president who seemed to get it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the value of start-up culture. A friend in attendance that day told me that she thought Obama wanted us to feel \u201csome ownership, that tech doesn\u2019t have to be far away or out of our lives.\u201d He wants to leave behind a \u201cnation of makers,\u201d she said. Megan Rose Dickey, who covered the event for TechCrunch, wrote that it left her \u201coptimistic that maybe our country can change and learn to do the right thing.\u201dIn many ways, Obama is America\u2019s first truly digital president. His 2008 campaign relied heavily on social media to lift him out of obscurity. Those efforts were in part led by a founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who believed in the Illinois senator\u2019s campaign so much that he left the start-up to join Obama\u2019s strategy team. After he was elected, he created a trifecta of executive positions in his administration modeled on corporate best practices: chief technology officer, chief data scientist, chief performance officer. He sat for question-and-answer sessions on Reddit, released playlists of his favorite songs on Spotify and used Twitter frequently, even once making dad jokes with Bill Clinton. He stoked deep and meaningful connections with scores of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.Obama routinely pushed policy that pleased the tech-savvy, including his successful effort to keep broadband suppliers from giving preferential treatment to bigger web companies over individuals. Even his tech-specific fumbles seem unlikely to mar his permanent record: The rocky debut of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace that cost more than $600 million to build and crashed almost immediately after it went live, was later brushed off as a technical difficulty. And his administration\u2019s pressure on Silicon Valley companies to aid its cybersecurity efforts hasn\u2019t seemed to dampen their enthusiasm for him. Obama used his ties to the tech sector to foster diplomacy: Last year, he took Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, with him to Cuba as an economic endorsement of the revolutionary powers of start-ups to change the world.South by South Lawn presented an image of America as a start-up and technology as a small-batch industry, full of dreamers and inventors. I was invited to moderate a panel, \u201cHow Do We Fix Real Problems With Technology?\u201d As much as I enjoyed our conversation, the premise felt flawed. \u201cFixing\u201d problems with technology often just creates more problems, largely because technology is never developed in a neutral way: It embodies the values and biases of the people who create it. Crime-predicting software, celebrated when it was introduced in police departments around the country, turned out to reinforce discriminatory policing. Facebook was recently accused of suppressing conservative news from its trending topics. (The company denied a bias, but announced plans to train employees to neutralize political, racial, gender and age biases that could influence what it shows its user base.) Several studies have found that Airbnb has worsened the housing crises in some cities where it operates. In January, a report from the World Bank declared that tech companies were widening income inequality and wealth disparities, not improving them.For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We\u2019ve seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone. (In August, for instance, WhatsApp announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook, its parent company, and its suite of products \u2014 news that gave some Americans pause but caused German regulators to intervene on behalf on their citizens.)As Obama's presidency winds down, Silicon Valley and Washington seem to be getting closer. Just a few days after South by South Lawn, The Washington Post reported that Facebook was quietly talking to White House officials about rolling out a controversial app called Free Basics. On the surface, Free Basics sounds fantastic: It promises free mobile internet for those who can\u2019t afford expensive data plans. But only Facebook and Facebook-approved services would be available through the app, and the app can collect data on those who sign up, both to increase the company\u2019s user numbers and maintain the growth needed to impress shareholders. The same service sparked outrage when Facebook tried to introduce it in India last year; officials believed it would create an unfair marketplace and the potential for discriminatory practices. Fusion recently reported that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gave a company called Geofeedia access to information that helped law-enforcement agencies monitor and target minority activists. The close ties between our government and tech companies have led to changes that Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times technology columnist, told me \u201cwill have big effects for a long time, and we\u2019ll say they started under Obama.\u201dNone of this was mentioned at South by South Lawn. Instead, speakers heralded the power of the tech community. John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader, gave a rousing talk that implored listeners to \u201cget in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise.\u201d Clay Dumas, chief of staff for the Office of Digital Strategy at the White House, told me in an email that the event could be considered part of a legacy to inspire social change and activism through technology. \u201cIn his final months in office,\u201d he wrote, \u201cPresident Obama wants to empower the generation of people that helped launch his candidacy and whose efforts carried him into office.\u201dI left the event as the gorgeous afternoon unfurled into a balmy evening, still unsure what to make of it. But a few days later, during a speech at Carnegie Mellon, Obama seemed to reckon with his feelings about the potential \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the tech world. The White House can\u2019t be as freewheeling as a start-up, he said, because \u201cby definition, democracy is messy. And part of government\u2019s job is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\u201d But he added that he didn\u2019t want people to become \u201cdiscouraged and say, \u2018I\u2019m just not going to deal with government.\u2019\u2009\u201d Obama was the first American president to see technology as an engine to improve lives and accelerate society more quickly than any government body could. That lesson was apparent on the lawn. While I still don\u2019t believe that technology is a panacea for society\u2019s problems, I will always appreciate the first president who tried to bring what's best about Silicon Valley to Washington, even if some of the bad came with it.Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stakes Are Rising in Google\u2019s Antitrust Fight With Europe", "Date": "2016-10-30", "News": "Supported byGoogle is locked in a six-year battle with Europe's antitrust officials. And the stakes for both sides are getting higher.\u201cFor the European Commission, it\u2019s a case of Russian roulette,\u201d said Christian Bergqvist, an associate professor of competition law at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cIf they lose or merely settle the case, they will look weak. They have to be seen as doing something to stop Google.\u201dThe latest twist in this episode is expected to begin on Thursday, when Google officially starts responding to European charges that it has hamstrung competitors and limited consumer choice.The separate but closely linked rebuttals to European claims are expected to be submitted to competition authorities in Brussels in quick succession over the next few weeks.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.While each response will be couched in legalese, Google\u2019s main argument is that its business practices do not fall afoul of the region\u2019s tough antitrust rules and that competitors can freely offer their own rival digital services to Europe\u2019s more than 500 million consumers.Not surprisingly, the company\u2019s detractors \u2014 small European start-ups, some local politicians and American heavy hitters like Oracle \u2014 do not agree.\u201cGoogle has taken its best shot, but the European Commission has decided that it\u2019s still on the right track,\u201d said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer for FairSearch Europe, a group representing the Google rivals that have filed complaints against the company\u2019s perceived dominance.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt Google feels like it has a strong defense. But that\u2019s what other previously dominant companies thought, too,\u201d he added.Whatever happens, Google\u2019s battle in Europe will not end overnight.European officials must first review the company\u2019s rebuttals, and a final decision in any of the cases is not expected until midway through 2017, at the earliest.If found to have breached the region\u2019s rules, Google faces fines totaling up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and may be forced to change how it operates in the 28-member bloc. While any antitrust fine is not expected to reach the maximum possible, the company is likely to appeal any European ruling, further lengthening the process.Yet it is this death-by-a-thousand-cuts regulatory limbo that arguably represents the biggest headache for Google.Google may face tougher competition in the smartphone world if Europe forces the company to open up Android to rivals, a possibility if the search giant loses its antitrust case in the region.\u201cNo matter what happens, antitrust is part of the picture for Google for many more years,\u201d said Ioannis Lianos, a professor of global competition law and public policy at University College London. \u201cEven if Google wins, the fact that they are spending resources on this will affect their commercial thinking.\u201dThe search giant has become a boogeyman for many in Europe. In part, that is because of Google\u2019s dominance over many of the digital services \u2014 like online search and smartphones \u2014 that have become essential to people\u2019s daily lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vast Group of New Video Games and Hardware Jostle for Holiday Attention", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byFiguring out what to get for your video gamer friends and relatives this holiday season is about to become a lot more complicated.Over the next two months, the game industry is pushing out one of the more crowded product lineups of recent years. What\u2019s different is the sheer amount of stuff: not just blockbuster titles for gaming consoles, but also new hardware, independent games and a bigger emphasis on virtual reality.They are all jostling for attention during the end of the year, which is when around 40 percent of the industry\u2019s sales take place, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.\u201cThe lineup of hardware and software this holiday will look to some to be an evil conspiracy specifically designed to drain the wallets of hard-core gamers,\u201d Mr. Pachter said.The choices might be made even more complicated by the question of whether to buy a game title or just rent it. NPD Group, a research firm that tracks retail sales in the United States, is projecting an increase in spending on rental games from services like GameFly and Redbox, as more people opt to try titles before they purchase.The wealth of options underlines how console makers and game publishers have to work harder to keep people interested in games, especially with more entertainment options than ever. As a result, the game industry has embraced new technology like virtual reality, as well as new approaches to current products.The appearance of new consoles, for example, is notable because the hardware is coming partway through a typical five-to-seven-year cycle for new consoles.Here is more about what gamers can expect this holiday season:Seasoned gamers may opt for the Xbox One S or the PlayStation 4 Pro, both of which promise more power and a better visual experience. Nintendo\u2019s NES Classic Edition seems aimed at those who value nostalgia \u2014 the low price suggests this may be the better option for those who simply want to rediscover the joy of their gaming youth with something easy to plug in and play.So what games are set to be big this holiday season? The answer: Shooter games. Again.That category of games, where people take on the character of someone doing the shooting, has long been popular for its first-person perspective. This month, the video game publisher Electronic Arts released two shooter games, Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2. Activision is making its latest Call of Duty war game \u2014 this one is titled Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare \u2014 available in November.Many of these games have long lineages (the Battlefield series has been around since 2002), reflecting how unlikely it is that gamers will ever tire of shooters. Most of the games have multiplayer modes, meaning people can play with their friends. Also, there are essentially no consequences for being killed, since when you die in one of these games, you simply respawn immediately and carry on.Other games that are expected to do well this holiday season also have shooting elements. Those include a third-person shooter game, Gears of War 4 (published by Microsoft); the action adventure game Mafia III (published by Take-Two); and Watch Dogs 2, an open-world adventure game set in a fictionalized version of San Francisco (from Ubisoft).With the increased use, the quality of mobile and independent games is also improving, especially in graphics and design. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more indie titles with greater polish and the feel of a major game title,\u201d said Kate Edwards, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, a trade group.Ms. Edwards said the independent games that are getting buzz for the holiday season are Cuphead, a run-and-gun platform game drawn in the style of 1930s cartoons and inspired by the work of cartoonists like Max Fleischer (made by Studio MDHR for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One); and Overland, a survival strategy game set in post-apocalyptic North America (made by Finji for PC; $20).Others include Gang Beasts, a melee party video game (made by Boneloaf for PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 VR; $20); Hand of Fate 2, an action role-playing game (made by Defiant Development for PC and Xbox One); and Cryptark, a 2-D science-fiction shooter (made by Alientrap for PC, Mac, Linux and PlayStation 4; $15). That\u2019s right, shooter games again.Still, the games will have to work to stand out from the crowd. An average of about 500 gaming apps are released for Apple iOS devices every day, according to Pocket Gamer, a site that tracks apps offered in the App Store.\u201cMajor studios and indies alike are all creating in V.R., which means even the most jaded gamer is likely to be surprised by what comes out later this year and beyond,\u201d said Jason Rubin, head of content at Oculus, which is owned by Facebook.Interest in virtual reality games appears to be increasing, according to Mr. Rubin. Samsung Gear VR, a headset that runs on Oculus software, reported more than a million unique users for the last few months, he said.Some virtual reality games that consumers can look forward to include Rock Band VR by Harmonix, a rhythm game that lets players bust out a guitar solo in front of a bustling crowd; The Unspoken, made by Insomniac Games, which allows people to cast spells at rival magicians; and a game called Wilson\u2019s Heart, from the studio Twisted Pixel, in which players must try to escape an abandoned hospital.There will be more to come. Mr. Rubin said developers would continue to experiment with new types of virtual reality experiences, especially in multiplayer games that will plunge several people at once into the same immersive virtual environments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking the Temperature Inside the (Feverish) Cloud", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported byBitsSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Autumn is a good time to see what is happening next in the $3 trillion business technology market. In particular, it\u2019s a good time to check out what\u2019s new in corporate paranoia.This time of year, San Francisco\u2019s streets are blocked off so companies like Oracle and Salesforce can bring in thousands of customers for several days of presentations, coffee and performances by Milli Vanilli-era pop stars. In the next few days, Salesforce expects to host 171,000 people, enough that even seedy hotels in the Tenderloin neighborhood cost $600 a night.At conferences here, or in Atlanta, where last week Microsoft gathered 23,000 people, companies state their visions on the current and future state of tech.These talks are, as they say, buzzword compliant, with the companies praising their capabilities in cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. They are renting computers in remote data centers over the internet and using the tremendous amounts of data we are now collecting from computers, phones and sensors to analyze and predict how to make and sell more stuff.The best part of these talks isn\u2019t viewing the technology; it\u2019s listening to each sponsoring company brag about how much better it is than its competitors. Each presents number-rich charts to prove it.Who a company names as its enemy and how it measures its relative greatness says a lot about how the company sees its own strengths and the overall stakes in the competition for the world\u2019s computing.For Oracle\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, who used to slam Microsoft or Salesforce at these events, the main antagonist is now Amazon, which has led the migration of business technology to internet-based cloud computing.\u201cAmazon\u2019s lead is over,\u201d Mr. Ellison told his audience in September. \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively moving.\u201d Using select data, he described Oracle as better in speed, security and, most important, price. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to pay less, you can\u2019t place the order,\u201d he said.For Microsoft, which has spent tens of billions of dollars building its global cloud computing system, the most important factor is not money; rather, the company is focused on size, resources and its track record.\u201cThe only comparison to our depth and breadth is Google,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview after his Atlanta keynote.Also on Thursday, Google held a coming-out event for its corporate computing effort, called Google Cloud, with a Google-level array of dizzying statistics about its scale and size. The company has had 339 product releases since January, and it has 10,000 engineers working on corporate computing.The company even showed a photograph of its undersea cable to Japan, which is 9,000 kilometers long and capable of sending 60 terabytes of information a second (one terabyte is roughly the size of 500 hours of video).Alphabet, the parent company of Google Cloud, has a capital expenditure of $9.9 billion a year, said Urs H\u00f6lzle, Google Cloud\u2019s senior vice president. Almost all of that consists of various forms of computing infrastructure. \u201cThat is just shy of Amazon and Microsoft put together,\u201d he said.Mr. H\u00f6lzle said data that would take Amazon eight hours to sift could take six minutes on Google. In one case, analysis on Google was 29 times as fast as on Amazon Web Services, he said.The velocity itself is the crucial metric, Mr. H\u00f6lzle said in a separate interview, and he said it would decimate most of today\u2019s contenders.\u201cThis is like Android versus the iPhone in 2008,\u201d he said, evoking a comparison with Apple. \u201cThere were older phones, the BlackBerry. Android managed to be relevant even though the first versions weren\u2019t great. It wasn\u2019t that it was free, or it had maps \u2014 it was the velocity that it changed.\u201dThe sole exception to industry enemy-naming is Amazon. At last year\u2019s meeting it cited a couple of specific products from IBM and Oracle. But with revenue expected to hit $11 billion this year, it is the undisputed cloud leader. For Amazon, naming anyone else would be like anointing them.But what fun is competition when you have nothing to beat? Amazon\u2019s designated foe is all of the past, and the 95 percent of old-style corporate computing it still has to take to the cloud. The IBM and Oracle products it named were from that old world.\u201cIn the next five years, we\u2019ll see the vast majority of enterprises doing what our forward-looking enterprise customers are doing now,\u201d said Ariel Kelman, the vice president of worldwide marketing at Amazon Web Services. He named Intuit and Netflix among these pioneers.Since Amazon owns the transformation, it figures, the enemy is a failure to transform.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking for a Choice of Voices in A.I. Technology", "Date": "2016-10-09", "News": "Supported byJason Mars is an African-American professor of computer science who also runs a tech start-up. When his company\u2019s artificially intelligent smartphone app talks, he said, it sounds \u201clike a helpful, young Caucasian female.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of pressure to conform to the prejudices of the world\u201d when you are trying to make a consumer hit, he said. \u201cIt would be interesting to have a black guy talk, but we don\u2019t want to create friction, either. First we need to sell products.\u201dMr. Mars\u2019s start-up is part of a growing high-tech field called conversational computing. This technology is being popularized by programs like the Siri system in Apple\u2019s iPhone, and Alexa, which is built into the Echo, Amazon\u2019s artificially intelligent home computing device.Conversational computing is holding a mirror to many of society\u2019s biggest preconceptions around race and gender. Listening and talking are the new input and output devices of computers. But they have social and emotional dimensions never seen with keyboards and screens.Do we, for example, associate the stereotypical voice of an English butler \u2014 think of Jarvis the computer in \u201cIron Man\u201d \u2014 with a helpful and intelligent person? And why do so many people want to hear a voice that sounds like it came from a younger woman with no discernible accent?Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other. Where commerce is concerned, that creates a problem: Is it better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure in the market by going against type?For many, the answer is initially clear. Microsoft\u2019s artificially intelligent voice system is Cortana, for example, and it was originally the voice of a female character in the video game \u201cHalo.\u201d\u201cIn our research for Cortana, both men and women prefer a woman, younger, for their personal assistant, by a country mile,\u201d said Derek Connell, senior vice president for search at Microsoft. In other words, a secretary \u2014 a job that is traditionally seen as female.Last week, Google introduced a number of voice-based products, including Google Home, its version of Echo. All of them use Google Assistant, which also speaks in tones associated with a young, educated woman.Google Assistant \u201cis a millennial librarian who understands cultural cues, and can wink at things,\u201d said Ryan Germick, who leads the personality efforts in building Google Assistant. \u201cProducts aren\u2019t about rational design decisions. They are about psychology and how people feel.\u201dThe company has had internal debates about whether to respond differently on questions to the computer about suicide, Mr. Connell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve leaned to providing information about suicide prevention everywhere,\u201d he said, as opposed to offering no advice at all.But sometimes, if you want people to figure out quickly that they are talking to a machine, it can be better to have a man\u2019s voice. For example, IBM\u2019s Watson, when it talks to Bob Dylan in television commercials, has a male voice. When Ashok Goel, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, adapted Watson to have a female voice as an informal experiment in how people relate to conversational machines, his students couldn\u2019t tell it was a computer.But Watson\u2019s maleness is the exception. Amazon\u2019s A.I. technology is another in the comforting female voice camp.\u201cAlexa was always an assistant, and female,\u201d said Peng Shao, who worked at Amazon on the Echo and is now at a Seattle start-up, building another speech-based A.I. system. Amazon would not comment on its product.Gender is just the starting point. Can your A.I. technology understand accents? And can it respond in a way that feels less robotic and at least mimics some sort of human empathy?\u201cYou need a persona,\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional thing \u2014 people would get red, even get violent, if it didn\u2019t understand them. When it did understand them, it felt like magic. They sleep next to them. This is heading for hospitals, senior care, a lot of sensitive places.\u201dCapital One developed a banking app on Alexa, and found it had to dial down the computer\u2019s formality to make people comfortable talking about their finances with a computer.\u201cMoney is inextricably linked to emotion, enabling and preventing things in your life,\u201d said Stephanie Hay, the head of content strategy, culture and A.I. design at Capital One. At first the app said, \u201cHello,\u201d but that seemed too tense. \u201c\u2018Hi, there\u2019 worked better,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend, hanging out with me in the kitchen. I need her to be reliable and approachable, but not invasive.\u201dWe don\u2019t just need that computerized voice to meet our expectations, said Justine Cassell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. We need computers to relate to us and put us at ease when performing a task. \u201cWe have to know that the other is enough like us that it will run our program correctly,\u201d she said.That need seems to start young. Ms. Cassell has designed an avatar of indeterminate race and gender for 5-year-olds. \u201cThe girls think it\u2019s a girl, and the boys think it\u2019s a boy,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren of color think it\u2019s of color, Caucasians think it\u2019s Caucasian.\u201dAnother system she built spoke in what she termed \u201cvernacular\u201d to African-American children, achieving better results in teaching scientific concepts than when the computer spoke in standard English.When tutoring the children in a class presentation, however, \u201cwe wanted it to practice with them in \u2018proper English.\u2019 Standard American English is still the code of power, so we needed to develop an agent that would train them in code switching,\u201d she said.And, of course, there are regional issues to consider when creating a robotic voice.

{"Headline": "HealthCare.gov Will Add \u2018Simple Choice\u2019 Plans in Effort to Improve Value", "Date": "2016-10-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace opens in two weeks, many consumers will have a new option for the law\u2019s fourth open-enrollment period: standardized health plans that cover basic services without a deductible.With many health plans on the marketplace coming with deductibles in the thousands of dollars, consumers have complained that they were getting little benefit beyond coverage for catastrophic problems. The new standardized options are meant to address that concern \u2014 to ensure that \u201cenrollees receive some upfront value for their premium dollars,\u201d as the Obama administration said.\u201cToo many people, especially people on high-deductible plans, are still struggling to afford the care they need,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said, praising the new effort.But the new plans could still be costly. While the federal government specifies deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket costs for the standardized options, it does not limit premiums, which in most cases are still regulated by state insurance commissioners. The administration has said it does not expect the standardized options to have a significant effect on premiums in 2017.Federal officials say the new option will simplify shopping under the Affordable Care Act by reducing variation among plans, and consumer advocates like the idea. The standardized options will be identified on HealthCare.gov with the label \u201cSimple Choice.\u201dOpen enrollment begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. People without health insurance next year face possible tax penalties that could exceed $700 a person.\u201cThis is one more tool that will make it easier for consumers to select the right plan,\u201d said Marjorie K. Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services.Sandy H. Ahn, a researcher at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University, said the \u201cstandardized plans will allow consumers to make more of an apples-to-apples comparison.\u201dAdministration officials did not say how many such plans will be available, in which states they will be offered or how much they will cost. The government encouraged but did not require insurers to offer standardized options.The standardized version of a midlevel silver plan has a $3,500 deductible, but primary care and specialty care visits, outpatient mental health services and prescription drugs are generally exempt from the deductible. In other words, consumers may face co-payments, but they do not have to meet the deductible before the insurance company starts to pay for such services.On HealthCare.gov, the administration intends to introduce the idea of standardized options by describing Simple Choice as \u201cthe easiest way to shop for plans.\u201d\u201cAll Simple Choice plans in the same category (like Silver) have exactly the same core benefits, deductibles and co-payments,\u201d states a message to be displayed on the federal website. \u201cWhen viewing Simple Choice plans, you can focus on other important features that may be different: monthly premiums, additional services covered, doctor and hospital networks.\u201dThe Obama administration is still struggling to keep the Affordable Care Act affordable for many consumers. State officials have approved rate increases of 25 percent or more for many plans in 2017, after finding that insurers lost tens of millions of dollars in the exchanges. Aetna, UnitedHealth and other insurers have pulled back from the public marketplace, leaving consumers in many states with fewer choices.Under the standardized version of a silver plan, co-payments would be $30 for a visit to a primary care doctor, $65 for a visit to a specialist, $15 for a generic prescription drug, $50 for a preferred brand-name drug and $100 for a nonpreferred brand-name drug. Consumers may be responsible for up to 40 percent of the cost of specialty drugs, including certain high-cost medicines for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.For the lowest-income families, the charges would be lower.Federal officials said they had studied several state-run exchanges \u2014 in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Vermont \u2014 that provide standardized options.Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the California exchange, said standardized options had contributed to the stability and success of the marketplace there.\u201cCalifornians seeking coverage through the marketplace can easily compare health plans, knowing that every health plan has the same cost-sharing levels and benefits,\u201d Mr. Lee said.Insurers generally dislike efforts to standardize health plans. Standardized options \u201cincrease the complexity of the decision-making process\u201d by adding one more factor for consumers to consider, said America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group.In a letter this month to the Obama administration, Anthem, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, said, \u201cStandardized benefit designs threaten to commoditize insurance and stifle innovation, while potentially misleading consumers.\u201d The administration said insurers still had discretion to vary many features that would not be standardized.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Is a Shot in the Dark", "Date": "2016-10-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtAT&T is a telecom company that offers wireless service in a saturated market, while Time Warner is a content company whose primary assets, networks like CNN and HBO, face tougher times in a cord-cutting world. This merger is presented as a solution \u2014 a bigger company with more options will inherently be better suited to weather the enormous changes now shattering the TV business. Together, they\u2019ll have more leverage and can build new stuff faster.If all this sounds a bit speculative, that\u2019s because it is. What this deal actually symbolizes is that the future of television is increasingly going to be built on lots of bold, possibly speculative experiments.For instance, it does not make sense for Time Warner to offer most of its content exclusively to AT&T\u2019s customers. Not only would that destroy its profitability (Comcast\u2019s customers pay a lot for CNN and HBO, so why would Time Warner want to kill that business?), but it would also be out of step with the future. The notion of content tied to specific distribution lines is exactly what consumers are moving away from when they choose services like Netflix over cable bundles.We are witnessing the emergence of a new order in the TV business. In five or 10 years\u2019 time, that order may become clear. There\u2019s a good chance it will involve some current players \u2014 Comcast, Disney and a merged AT&T and Time Warner will all play a role in the entertainment business of tomorrow. But these behemoths\u2019 size and influence will almost certainly be diminished by new tech-powered players, whose pocketbooks and ambitions seem limitless \u2014 companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and possibly Twitter and Snap.So among the questions now plaguing the industry: Do people still want to pay for TV, and if so, how much? Do people want to watch live stuff, or scripted stuff, or do they instead want to watch whatever is on their Facebook feed? Which kind of company is the most valuable player in the future of the entertainment business?That is where all the experimenting comes in. William Goldman, the screenwriter, once said that in Hollywood, \u201cnobody knows anything.\u201d This applies well to the entertainment business of today, and the AT&T and Time Warner deal is perhaps the watershed example: Every move is a guess, and if you are lucky, an educated one.\u201cI think we\u2019re all trying to figure this out \u2014 how technology and the consumer is going to change, and who are the winners and losers in this future,\u201d said Walter Piecyk, who studies the telecommunications industry at the research firm BTIG.The best argument for the deal, Mr. Piecyk said, is that it diversifies AT&T\u2019s offerings \u2014 now a single company combines content and distribution, rather than just one or the other. When you face an uncertain future, diversity isn\u2019t a bad weapon. If it turns out that in the future, content becomes more valuable than distribution, the new AT&T will have that; if the opposite happens, it\u2019s covered there, too.In conference calls with reporters and investors over the weekend, Randall Stephenson and Jeffrey Bewkes, the chairmen and chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner, added another dimension to this argument: Bigger, they said, is faster.The future of TV, they argued, will depend on a lot of new ideas that are tested and deployed very quickly. These might include new business models for paying for shows, new ways to distribute and market that content, and new technologies and industrywide standards to make sure it all works.Fragmentation led to delays, and delays contribute to consumer dissatisfaction \u2014 but in a world in which Time Warner and AT&T worked together, new products would come along faster, which would in turn push new ideas from competitors, Mr. Bewkes said.\u201cThis appears to be about empire sustenance rather than economic efficiency,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group.Craig Moffett, of MoffettNathanson, was blunter: \u201cAT&T faces the twin pressures of a huge debt load and huge dividend that consumes the vast majority of their cash,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIt is clear that they had to do SOMETHING.\u201dBig media mergers are always risky. They rarely work out. But it\u2019s striking how much more things are uncertain today than in the past. So even if AT&T and Time Warner together do not make much obvious sense, well, it\u2019s something.Advertisement"}

National advertisers would presumably pay more to reach them and have an alternative to spending on Google and Facebook.Targeted advertising has become commonplace on streaming services like Hulu or platforms like YouTube, where, for example, women in their 20s may see ads for birth control, pregnancy tests or certain movie trailers. Advertisers hope things could potentially move even beyond that on TV, with people seeing ads based on, for instance, their location or individual interests, much like what happens on the internet. Still, skepticism over whether the AT&T-Time Warner merger will normalize the practice for traditional TV is rife within the ad industry.\u201cAs to the question of whether this is a new route for advertising and another opportunity for targeted addressable TV advertising, the answer is it\u2019s going to take a significant period of time,\u201d said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising giant WPP, pointing to the risks around regulation and combining the two companies. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but implementing it is not going to be easy.\u201dTailored advertising is a generally accepted part of the internet experience \u2014 consumers see it daily on Facebook or through banner ads, where it has become common for a specific shirt or bag placed in an online shopping cart to haunt a person for weeks, even after it has been purchased. But traditional TV has largely continued to advertise in broad swaths, showing ads to demographics like 18- to 49-year-old men.\u201cThe reality of it is, we\u2019re moving into a world where consumers are turning against advertising,\u201d Mr. Tobaccowala said.Stephen B. Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, speaking on Comcast\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, said that the TV group has been working to developing advanced advertising products but that the process was difficult.\u201cBut it\u2019s clear what advertisers want,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to combine the data intensity of internet advertising with the clear value and ability to change peoples\u2019 perceptions that you get with a television ad.\u201dOthers see great potential for advertising in the merger, which would marry AT&T\u2019s more than 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and DirecTV properties, with Time Warner\u2019s offerings, which include CNN, TBS, Cartoon Network, the website Bleacher Report, HBO and Warner Bros. Pictures. On Tuesday at WSJD, a technology conference organized by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Stephenson said that, starting next month, the company would offer a 100-channel internet-based premium television service that would cost $35 a month and allow people to watch video on their mobile phones and other devices.Rob Norman, chief digital officer of WPP\u2019s GroupM, a major media investment group, said the success of targeted advertising would hinge on cost. He offered the example of a home improvement business advertising grass seed in places like Arizona and Montana, which have significantly different climates. That advertising could be further tailored for whether viewers lived in a condominium versus a suburban home with a lawn, he said.\u201cIf you believe in a future where the very, very fine targeting of households or individuals with specific messaging makes economic sense to do at scale, what this merger does is enable that by making more audience available to target in that way,\u201d Mr. Norman said. \u201cThe question will be: What is the premium for addressability for that level of targeting that the advertiser is willing to pay?\u201dThe biggest change is that television \u201chas evolved to being more fluid and digital-like,\u201d as it appears on devices like phones and tablets and streams through accessories like Roku and Apple TV, Mr. Hanlon said.\u201cThis is clearly one of the significant envisioned benefits of this tie-up, which is the next generation of video advertising in a much more robust, targetable and data-rich manner,\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the realm of digital advertising has been a dress rehearsal for the medium of television, which is now essentially getting ready for its full-fledged digital transformation.\u201dDave Morgan, the founder and chief executive of Simulmedia, which works with advertisers on targeted TV ads, said a combined AT&T and Time Warner could narrow the average price gap between cable ads and more expensive digital video ads by establishing a uniquely \u201chigh degree of coordination\u201d between a distributor, programmer and sales systems for digital and traditional video.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a magic silver bullet, but I do think a combination like this is going to accelerate better, more data-driven TV ads,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. Outside of targeting, he said, that could also mean frequency capping, so that people do not see the same ads over and over again, better retargeting and improved measurement.Mr. Sorrell predicted, \u201cAll of this is going to happen, but it\u2019s a question of how long it\u2019s going to take.\u201dAT&T AdWorks, the company\u2019s advertising division, said it did not use its mobile location and other mobile data for products out of that unit.

{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Fate: Marc Benioff of Salesforce Addresses Acquisition Talk", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce.com, showed up onstage on Wednesday afternoon at his biggest customer event of the year to talk up his business technology company\u2019s products and strategy.But what was arguably the higher-stakes meeting was held later that day. At the plush St. Regis San Francisco Hotel, Mr. Benioff presided over a gathering with Wall Street analysts and investors. His aim: to assuage their concerns about his plan to buy Twitter, the struggling social media company.\u201cWe look at a lot of things,\u201d Mr. Benioff told the room, without directly mentioning Twitter. \u201cThe number we acquire is very few.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cit gives us ideas\u201d to look at companies.At first glance, the two companies could not be more different. Twitter is where celebrities, politicians and countless other individuals broadcast their thoughts in 140-character messages. Salesforce, on the other hand, makes online software for salespeople and marketers.Yet Twitter would fit into a vision that Mr. Benioff has had for Salesforce, which he founded in 1999, as a company that can help enterprises with all of their customer needs. Twitter, in Mr. Benioff\u2019s eyes, is already a powerful customer service tool that airlines, restaurants, banks and many other companies use to field consumer complaints and requests. Companies can also use what people post on Twitter to glean consumer habits.\u201cThis is a huge messaging and communications service,\u201d Mr. Benioff, who turned 52 last month, said on Wednesday in an interview on his way to the St. Regis. He added, \u201cI use mergers and acquisition activity to think about the market.\u201dMr. Benioff faces a battery of challenges in buying Twitter. Skeptical investors have pushed Salesforce stock down about 5 percent since news broke that the company was considering bidding for the social media company. Behind the scenes, investors have been grousing about a potential purchase. Any deal would very likely be Salesforce\u2019s largest, with Twitter valued at about $14 billion. Salesforce, which is unprofitable, has a market capitalization of about $48 billion.Twitter investors appear dubious, too. The company\u2019s stock dropped more than 20 percent on Thursday as speculation about other suitors seemed to dissipate.\u201cThis would be a disaster,\u201d said Joel Fishbein, managing director at BTIG, a financial services firm. \u201cBenioff is a visionary, but this could blow up. Engineers could leave Salesforce, and it would send the stock down 30 or 40 percent.\u201dMr. Benioff acknowledged that Salesforce would face difficulties in taking over Twitter, given that Salesforce sells software to businesses while Twitter is a consumer technology company. The chief executive, who is an activist in areas like gay rights and gender equality, also said he was troubled by the amount of hate speech on Twitter.But it is not unusual for Mr. Benioff to go against the grain. A San Francisco native, he worked at Oracle, the business software company, for years before founding Salesforce as an online software firm in 1999, when online software was still unproven.\u201cMarc wants to be well thought of, to feel like he\u2019s doing things the right way,\u201d said Adam Bosworth, a Salesforce executive who left in August to work at Amazon. Mr. Bosworth recalled once disagreeing with Mr. Benioff on a management issue and sending him an email with the subject line, \u201cYou are not being a mensch.\u201d\u201cIt was the fastest response I ever got from him,\u201d Mr. Bosworth said.Much of the data that Salesforce is gaining through acquisitions can help power artificial intelligence, which Mr. Benioff says will soon be everywhere. \u201cWe\u2019ve bought about a dozen A.I. companies, built whole new teams,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Without LinkedIn, Mr. Benioff turned his sights to Twitter, which has been trying to figure out how to rev up its growth.Mr. Benioff, who is himself a power user of Twitter, said on Wednesday that while it was essential that Salesforce be in A.I., there was more to Twitter than that.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge customer-service platform,\u201d used by companies like Dell, Apple and Bank of America, he said in the interview on the way to the St. Regis. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reason to buy it, but it\u2019s a reason to look at it. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m buying it, but I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not buying it.\u201dLater, at the investor meeting where analysts shied from mentioning the name Twitter, Mr. Benioff tried to explain where he was coming from. \u201cI see things in a different kind of way,\u201d he told them. \u201cI hope someday to sit down and say how I think about that which shall not be named.\u201dEventually, though, Mr. Benioff could not resist a more direct reference to Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey. \u201cI wish Jack well with his company,\u201d Mr. Benioff said at the end of the investor meeting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google, Lagging Amazon, Races Across the Threshold Into the Home", "Date": "2016-10-02", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Amazon introduced its Echo device in late 2014, Google executives were caught off guard. For years, they had predicted the creation of a virtual assistant that would answer questions or help accomplish tasks, and they focused on building that capability into smartphones and tablets.Amazon took a different approach and created the Echo, a device with the sole purpose of showcasing the company\u2019s artificially intelligent assistant software, called Alexa. Since then, the Echo has become a surprise hit, vaulting Amazon ahead of Google in a race to build technology that interacts as humans do. Users can ask Alexa to play music, dim the lights or call for a ride.For Google, whose name is synonymous with finding answers on the internet, Amazon\u2019s success with Alexa exposed a vulnerability. Google, along with its parent company, Alphabet, has invested heavily to solve the technology world\u2019s toughest problems, but it often trails competitors in turning those advancements into products and businesses.On Tuesday, Google is expected to finally unveil its answer to the Echo, alongside new smartphones and tablets. The Google Home device, which looks a little like an air freshener, is expected to go on sale later this month.Google Home is powered by what Google calls the Assistant, which uses artificial intelligence to understand what users are saying and respond conversationally with the best answers. Google introduced a messaging app last month that incorporates the Assistant, and the company plans to add the feature to its latest smartphones and tablets.Given the newness of the market for artificially intelligent home gadgets, Google has plenty of time to close the gap. The company believes it can win over consumers with a smarter digital assistant that builds on its stronghold in search and years of research in artificial intelligence.But the fact that Google was outmaneuvered by Amazon \u2014 not Apple, which builds its own digital assistant technology, called Siri, into its mobile products \u2014 has caused head-scratching throughout the technology industry. Amazon has a notoriously uneven track record in making hardware, with some hits, like the Kindle e-reader, and spectacular whiffs, like the Fire Phone.\u201cAmazon is the accidental winner here,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cAmazon got there first, which is superimpressive, and it has been a huge hit.\u201dGoogle is a leader in natural language processing \u2014 the ability to turn spoken words into terms that computers can digest \u2014 and its search engine is the starting point for how most people get answers on the internet. In fact, the company says 20 percent of Google searches on mobile phones are done by voice.So why didn\u2019t Google create an Echo-like device before Amazon?In part, Google was hindered by a balkanized structure that prevented different groups within the company from working together, according to four current and former employees.Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., had a large team working on voice search but its focus was on an app for smartphones. The company had a separate team working on the Android operating system, which runs on smartphones, tablets and internet-connected home devices, and they were building virtual assistant technology into mobile devices.Google bought Nest Labs, a manufacturer of internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors, for $3.2 billion in 2014 as an entree into the home. But the unit seldom collaborated with the rest of the company. And other Google hardware divisions responsible for building smartphones, tablets, Chromebook computers, Wi-Fi routers and Chromecast devices to stream video were focused on updating products.A competitor for the Echo, it seems, fell through the cracks.This is not the first time Amazon has jumped ahead of Google, despite the search company\u2019s considerable technological edge.From its inception, Google has devoted enormous resources to operating efficient data centers to power its many services. But it was Amazon that identified an opportunity in renting out its technology infrastructure to companies in need of computing power, storage and data analysis. That business, called Amazon Web Services, is now on pace to generate more than $10 billion in revenue this year, while Google is playing catch-up.A lack of focus can at times compound these issues. Google encourages its employees to spend 20 percent of their time pursuing new ideas beyond their usual responsibilities. Products like Gmail emerged from this policy, but it also fosters a mind-set that, according to one former employee, leads Google to chase too many ideas.\u201cPart of the problem is that it has a scattershot approach to things,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. When pursuing new ideas, he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t always make big bets strategically.\u201dGoogle has spent seven years working on self-driving cars, for example, and it is still not clear how the company plans to cash in on its work. By contrast, Uber, which started as a company around the time that Google started work on autonomous vehicles, is already testing self-driving cars to pick up customers in Pittsburgh.Despite its many successes, Google has a spotty history of creating devices. In 2012, Google introduced an internet-connected speaker called the Nexus Q. The vision was for the device to plug into a home entertainment system for streaming music or video, a sort of hybrid of an Apple TV and a Sonos speaker. But Google killed the product before it even started shipping it to consumers.Also in 2012, Google bought the phone manufacturer Motorola for $12.5 billion. The next year, it introduced the Moto X, the first smartphone equipped with a listening chip so users could bring the phone to life by uttering the words \u201cO.K. Google.\u201d It has pushed this feature into the latest phones running its Android operating system. Apple\u2019s more recent iPhones and iPads have a similar feature, activated by the words \u201cHey Siri.\u201dBut what makes the Amazon Echo stand out is a technology called a far-field microphone that can make out someone\u2019s voice from across a room, even when there is background clatter. And the Echo is always in position to listen for the so-called wake word \u2014 Alexa \u2014 whereas phones are often tucked away in pockets and bags. According to a former employee, Google has tinkered with far-field audio, but its focus was on the car, not a home device.Amazon invested in artificial intelligence and speech technologies in the years before unveiling Echo, but its most crucial asset was its strength in the cloud computing market, which it dominates with Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S.The vast majority of Echo\u2019s intelligence is contained in A.W.S., and most of the apps that developers have built for Alexa run on the cloud service. \u201cThe most important architectural vision is that it\u2019s all in the cloud,\u201d Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices and services, said in an interview this year.Amazon says tens of thousands of developers are creating skills for Alexa, more than 3,000 of which have been released so far. And thousands of developers are working to incorporate Alexa\u2019s voice capabilities into their hardware products. Last month, GE Appliances announced an Alexa app that lets people preheat a connected oven with voice commands.Chris Herbert, chief executive of a start-up called TrackR that makes wireless beacons for finding misplaced keys and wallets, recently released an app for Alexa that allows people to find their items with voice commands.Mr. Herbert said he had looked at the voice offerings from both Google and Apple, but neither company yet offered the same range of capabilities as Amazon, because they viewed it as an add-on feature to phones as opposed to a stand-alone computer.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind-boggling to me,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s the measure of how much excess cash AT&T has to cover its 5.3 percent dividend.Company executives always make promises when they announce big deals. But talk is cheap, delivery costly.This holds especially true for telecommunications shareholders. \u201cThe telecom industry has many examples of deals which failed to reach their potential, or destroyed significant value, including investments in content,\u201d Simon Flannery, an industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note published on Monday. After one year, his research shows, the top quartile of telecom deals generated positive returns of around 6 percent; the bottom quartile, meanwhile, showed a roughly 25 percent loss in value.I wanted to ask Mr. Flannery for more details, but a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said he was restricted from commenting because the firm is an adviser on the AT&T-Time Warner deal.AT&T shareholders would surely welcome a lift in earnings if the Time Warner deal were to deliver one. A more immediate concern for investors may be what the merger will mean to the future of AT&T\u2019s beloved dividend. These payouts have been the main reason to own what has otherwise been a lackluster stock.AT&T\u2019s dividend of 5.3 percent per year, well above the 3.6 percent paid by its peers, according to Bloomberg, has been a lure for investors. It also may have lulled them into complacency about the company\u2019s operations over the years.During the last five years, AT&T shares have gained 25 percent versus a 67 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, not counting dividends. The company\u2019s operational performance has also disappointed. In 2015, AT&T\u2019s net income was 27 percent below the level of two years earlier. Revenue growth is one area where AT&T has outpaced its peers, but much of the 11 percent increase in 2015 from the year before was attributable to AT&T\u2019s purchase of DirecTV and Mexican wireless operations.Some analysts think the deal for Time Warner could put a dent in the rich AT&T dividend. \u201cInvestors should be cautious because in order to maintain the dividend, AT&T has to take on a huge amount of debt,\u201d said Ginette Rowe Beecherl, an analyst at Greenbrier Partners, a money management firm in Dallas. \u201cTo the extent that their assets decline as their technology is supplanted, will they really be able to support such a high dividend?\u201dBrad Burns, an AT&T spokesman, said the company was confident in its ability not only to sustain the dividend, but also to raise it. He said free cash flow generated by Time Warner would help the combined companies bring down debt ratios by the end of the first year after the deal closes. And four years after, the company will be back to its historical target debt range, he said.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.Among the 500 companies in the S.&P. index, AT&T is the fourth-largest dividend payer in aggregate dollars, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Global. This year, AT&T is expected to pay some $12 billion in dividends. Only Exxon Mobil, Apple and Microsoft pay more.In recent years, AT&T\u2019s dividend payouts have accounted for 60 to 70 percent of the company\u2019s free cash flow. This compares with a 40 percent average dividend payout ratio among S.&P. 500 companies currently.To conclude the merger, AT&T\u2019s debt will rise to over $190 billion, from about $126 billion, according to Mr. Flannery at Morgan Stanley. He wrote that this debt load could put the dividend at risk if AT&T\u2019s business deteriorated or its capital expenditures and interest costs rose.Shareholders are not the only ones benefiting from AT&T\u2019s sumptuous dividend. Some of the incentive pay received each year by Mr. Stephenson and his top lieutenants is tied to the total shareholder return of the company\u2019s stock. AT&T\u2019s hefty dividend makes a big contribution to that total return measure.\u201cAT&T is not a technology company, not a services company and not a utility company \u2014 it\u2019s a dividend-paying company.\u201d Ms. Beecherl, the Greenbrier analyst, said. \u201cif it pulls off its latest gamble to remain relevant by acquiring Time Warner, investors will be left with a company with one of the highest levels of debt in the world while its technology is supplanted, and its C.E.O. receives $25 million a year.\u201dMr. Stephenson may well be right about the promise of the Time Warner deal. But judging by the 5 percent loss in AT&T shares since the deal was announced, it seems that quite a few of his shareholders aren\u2019t sticking around to find out.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Salesforce Shareholders Besiege Possible Twitter Deal", "Date": "2016-10-07", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The investor pressure began building on Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce.com, two weeks ago.The investors made their concerns known to Mr. Benioff. In emails and other communications, the shareholders told the chief executive and Salesforce\u2019s investor relations team that they disapproved of a tie-up with Twitter.The effort was led by Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund firm that is Salesforce\u2019s largest shareholder, with about 14 percent of the company. At least one Fidelity portfolio manager emailed Salesforce about the deal being a bad idea, according to people briefed on the correspondence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the communications were private. Other Salesforce investors, including hedge funds, said they would sell the company\u2019s stock, according to two people with knowledge of the communications.\u201cI read all of your notes, you probably know that,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cI also read your emails. And as I digest all of that information, this is actually the No. 1 thing that has been on my mind. In some cases we have been unusually surprised and we have had to do a reset.\u201dThe pushback offers a window into how big investors can exert pressure on would-be deals behind the scenes. Salesforce is particularly vulnerable to what its large institutional investors think because the unprofitable online software company relies heavily on its stock to make acquisitions and pay employee compensation. As a result, the company needs to keep investors happy for its share price to continue going up.Salesforce declined to comment, as did a representative from Fidelity.It is unclear whether or not Mr. Benioff will continue to pursue Twitter. One person involved in the negotiations said that, for now, Salesforce\u2019s shareholders have halted a potential deal.For Twitter, that would mean that its options have narrowed. The social media company had been talking to potential buyers, as well as considering divestitures and layoffs to focus its business. But companies including Google, Apple and Disney are not interested in buying Twitter, people at those companies said, and Salesforce appeared to be one of the last interested parties.Even though Salesforce is a 17-year-old company, in some ways Mr. Benioff still runs it like a start-up, making promises of boundless growth and equity riches for all employees.If shareholders were to sell and drive down the value of Salesforce stock, that would hurt Mr. Benioff\u2019s deal-making capabilities. Salesforce needs to aggressively acquire companies to keep its revenue growing as its core business, customer-management software, slows, said Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.The recent investor pushback puts Mr. Benioff, who has long been a shareholder darling, in an unfamiliar position. Salesforce shares have zoomed higher since pricing at $11 in its initial public offering to around $71 now, as investors clamored to own a piece of one of the first companies to successfully convince big enterprises to rent out software that is stored in the cloud, rather than own it and run it themselves.But after the Twitter news broke, investors pushed the stock down by as much as 8 percent over the next 10 days.On Wednesday, during Mr. Benioff\u2019s investor meeting where he sometimes gazed upon his own image projected on an enormous screen above the crowd, he bristled at times over the shareholder reaction.\u201cWell, what about this one deal right here!\u201d Mr. Benioff said, using a shrill and mocking voice to imitate one shareholder email. \u201cI mean the kind of things that I have been reading in the emails are so extreme I am like, Jesus, do they really think that we would do a deal at that level?\u201dMr. Benioff emphasized that he is a careful deal maker who is sensitive to what any acquisition might mean for Salesforce\u2019s shareholders, which include large, influential institutions like T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, Sands Capital Management and Harbor Funds. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in running the company like a lone wolf,\u201d he said, pointing to his board members who sat in the front row.But he still left the door open, ever so slightly, for future acquisitions. \u201cWe believe innovation happens not just in Salesforce, but in other companies,\u201d he said.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Leslie Picker from New York.

{"Headline": "Yahoo Said to Have Aided U.S. Email Surveillance by Adapting Spam Filter", "Date": "2016-10-05", "News": "Supported byA system intended to scan emails for child pornography and spam helped Yahoo satisfy a secret court order requiring it to search for messages containing a computer \u201csignature\u201d tied to the communications of a state-sponsored terrorist organization, several people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Two government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Justice Department obtained an individualized order from a judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year. Yahoo was barred from disclosing the matter.To comply, Yahoo customized an existing scanning system for all incoming email traffic, which also looks for malware, according to one of the officials and to a third person familiar with Yahoo\u2019s response, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.With some modifications, the system stored and made available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation a copy of any messages it found that contained the digital signature. The collection is no longer taking place, those two people said.The order was unusual because it involved the systematic scanning of all Yahoo users\u2019 emails rather than individual accounts; several other tech companies said they had not encountered such a demand.News of the order has opened a new chapter in a public debate over the trade-offs between security needs and privacy rights that has cast a spotlight on the sometimes cooperative, sometimes antagonistic relationship between Silicon Valley companies and the United States government.By contrast, Yahoo cooperated with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order, although the technical burden on the company appears to have been significantly lighter than the one the F.B.I. placed on Apple.The two government officials familiar with the matter said the digital signature Yahoo was ordered to look for last year was individually approved in an order issued by a judge, who was persuaded that there was probable cause to believe that it was uniquely used by a foreign power.Investigators had learned that agents of the foreign terrorist organization were communicating using Yahoo\u2019s email service and with a method that involved a \u201chighly unique\u201d identifier or signature, but the investigators did not know which specific email accounts those agents were using, the officials said.The Reuters article reported that in response to a \u201cbroad demand\u201d from the government, Yahoo had \u201csecretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers\u2019 incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.\u201dAccording to the government officials, Yahoo was served with an individualized court order to look only for code uniquely used by the foreign terrorist organization. Two sources, including one of the officials, portrayed it as adapting the scanning systems that it already had in place to comply with that order rather than building a brand-new capability. The other official did not comment on the technology. The officials did not name the terrorist organization.Asked on Wednesday about the information obtained by The New York Times, Suzanne Philion, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said the company had nothing further to say. Earlier in the day, the company said in a statement that the Reuters article was \u201cmisleading.\u201d\u201cWe narrowly interpret every government request for user data to minimize disclosure,\u201d the Yahoo statement said. \u201cThe mail scanning described in the article does not exist on our systems.\u201dRichard Kolko, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, declined in a statement to discuss specific foreign intelligence collection techniques, but referred to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.\u201cUnder FISA, activity is narrowly focused on specific foreign intelligence targets and does not involve bulk collection or use generic key words or phrases,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people.\u201dThere is no engineering limitation preventing technology companies from using their spam and child pornography filtering systems to search email traffic for other sorts of digital signatures, said Hany Farid, chairman of the computer science department at Dartmouth, who helped develop the child pornography scanning system with Microsoft.But the use of that technology to carry out an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to search for a digital signature used by a foreign power is rare, and one of the officials portrayed it as innovative.\u201cThis is another example of how the government is pushing secretly novel or innovative interpretations of surveillance law\u201d to conduct wiretapping in broader ways than the public realizes, said Jennifer Granick, the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society.The government has not released any intelligence court opinion explaining how the judge interpreted FISA to authorize such surveillance. Although Congress in June 2015 enacted a law that required the government to make public novel and significant rulings by the court, the order to Yahoo appears to have predated that legislation, the USA Freedom Act, by several months.Yahoo has an inconsistent record with meeting government data demands. In 2007, the company settled a lawsuit related to allegations that it helped the Chinese government crack down on journalists by passing along their Yahoo emails.But that year, the firm fought a legal battle, then secret, before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, challenging a mandate that it turn over, without a warrant, emails from user accounts the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency said belonged to noncitizens abroad who had been targeted for surveillance.Yahoo was not able to clarify details of the Reuters article on Tuesday because orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are secret by law, and an increasing number of other government requests come with gag orders that prohibit tech companies from even acknowledging they exist.Dozens of other companies have filed briefs in support of Microsoft. In its brief, Apple said it had received about 590 gag orders, of unlimited or indefinite durations, in the first eight months of 2016.Vindu Goel contributed reporting.Follow Charlie Savage and Nicole Perlroth on Twitter @charlie_savage and @nicoleperlroth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Wait a Month for a Sofa That\u2019s Not Even What You Wanted?", "Date": "2016-10-26", "News": "Supported byDuring dinner-party conversation, Edgar Blazona kept hearing complaints about the drudgery of buying furniture. Long delivery times. Lack of choice.So in the spring of 2015, he started a furniture company, BenchMade Modern, to make custom sofas on demand.Sofa lengths can be set by the customer in one-inch increments. The company also offers dozens of colors, fabric swatches and full-size paper printouts of sofas to let customers see how the pieces will look and fit in their homes.The BenchMade Modern factory in Los Angeles tracks the construction process, gives customers live online updates and provides free delivery. The typical turnaround time for production is seven days.\u201cI wanted to take away customers\u2019 frustrations,\u201d said Mr. Blazona, a former Pottery Barn designer whose company now has 16 employees. \u201cWith big furniture retailers, you can buy sofas in a few sizes and colors, and they\u2019re shipped in two to four weeks.\u201dAs retailers like Ikea and Crate & Barrel lose their luster among some shoppers, a range of furniture start-ups like BenchMade Modern see an opportunity. They are courting customers, increasingly millennials, who want unique furniture that will last. And fast delivery becomes increasingly important as more online retailers offer shorter delivery times for all types of goods.BenchMade Modern, based in San Francisco, is already breaking even, Mr. Blazona said. To keep costs low, he is using a hybrid store model, in which furniture is sold online and in a showroom in the Mission District of San Francisco. To speed the process, orders are sent directly to the factory.Technology is making it easier, and cheaper, to offer made-to-order.\u201cThe days of the megafurniture store are gone,\u201d said Mr. Blazona, who designed his eight-piece sofa collection in a clean, Modernist style. \u201cThey\u2019re very expensive to run. And customers get overloaded with too many choices.\u201dMr. Blazona had experience in the industry. He began another Modernist furniture firm, TrueModern, in 2005, which he still owns.BenchMade Modern has raised $800,000 from six angel investors. The company is raising an additional $1 million from venture capitalists to finance factory improvements.\u201cThe furniture industry is old dog,\u201d Mr. Blazona said. \u201cI had to start my own U.S. factory to fix this,\u201d he added, referring to the manufacturing process.\u201dJason Hancock fits the profile of the customer these start-ups are trying to attract. He was looking for two sofas that could fit into his and his wife\u2019s new home in San Francisco. He said he first researched West Elm and Room & Board offerings.Mr. Hancock, an advertising account manager, heard about BenchMade Modern via word of mouth. He bought from the firm because of the custom sizes that could fit into a long space. The short delivery time and comparable prices were also big selling points.\u201cI\u2019d rather buy from a smaller company,\u201d said Mr. Hancock, \u201cbecause you feel like you\u2019re part of the process.\u201d He added that he was impressed that Mr. Blazona personally called him to confirm the furniture order.\u201cThe days of walking into Pottery Barn and buying a whole bedroom suite\u201d are gone, Ms. Fine said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a huge appetite for customization.\u201dThe lower barriers to entry are also prompting more design-driven furniture businesses. John Humphrey started Greycork in Rhode Island in 2013 with a mission of offering well-designed furnishings made from high-quality woods like Baltic birch from Scandinavia or Russia and American ash. Four Greycork designers are Rhode Island School of Design graduates. The furniture can be assembled by consumers in minutes. The company also offers free shipping and free 60-day trials.Mr. Humphrey, a former analyst at a venture capital firm, expects Greycork revenue to reach $1 million this year. His goal is to scale up quickly, as Warby Parker did, by offering affordable pieces. He is offering a coffee table for $185.His online financing campaign via Indiegogo set out to raise $50,000 and ended up with just over $270,000. Since then, he has raised another $2 million from venture capital and angel investors.The company, he said, was particularly focused on attracting millennials, a growing consumer market of those ages 18 to 34. \u201cThe opportunity is very large,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a brand that speaks to millennials.\u201dMillennials became the largest furniture consumer group in the United States in 2014, according to Fung Business Intelligence research. Their spending on furniture increased 142 percent from 2012 to 2014.But while the start-ups have opportunities in the market, they are facing production issues. Greycork\u2019s far-flung furniture supply chain, Mr. Humphrey said, was difficult to manage as wood was shipped from Russia and fabric imported from China for pieces assembled in the southeastern United States. \u201cWe\u2019re working down the learning curve,\u201d he said.Some furniture start-ups have set their sights on the typical Ikea customer.Brad Sewell, a former Apple engineer, started Campaign Living last year. It is taking preorders and aims to offer furniture with simple lines and deliver it in three to five days. The affordable furnishings can be assembled in a few minutes without tools and easily repacked in two boxes. An armchair, for example, sells for $495.Campaign Living, which has three employees, has raised over $1 million in seed money, said Mr. Sewell, whose company is based in Emeryville, Calif. \u201cEveryone needs a place to sit,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s enough space for everyone to exist.\u201dHis offerings don\u2019t fit into the \u201cdisposable furniture\u201d category that many young people may be accustomed to. He spent a year creating prototypes. He said he had tested furniture frames using hydraulic cylinders in Detroit that simulated the load of a 250-pound human.Furniture frames are made from laser-cut steel. The legs are crafted from sustainable woods from the Midwest. Particle board is banned. He said he hoped his furniture would be handed down through generations.The offbeat signature styles of some of the new designers may never be a huge part of the $96 billion furniture industry, but start-ups are finding ways to reach their target audiences with them.Akron Street, a small New York company founded by two designers, Hansley Yunez and Lulu Li, has also offered up easy-to-assemble pieces. Its 12-piece furniture line, which went on sale last summer, is made with white oak from Appalachia. A solid wood coffee table, for instance, is $295.The company began with a $140,000 family loan. Since then, the founders have bootstrapped the financing. They designed the website themselves, and advertising and marketing are done by word of mouth or on Craigslist. The furniture showroom is the couple\u2019s East Village apartment in New York City.Already, the company has a waiting list for some furniture pieces.\u201cPeople may not want all the same furniture,\u201d said Mr. Yunez, who is also courting millennials. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a sense of identity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time Warner\u2019s Non-Mogul Mogul Who Foretold Its Worth", "Date": "2016-10-23", "News": "Supported byJeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, made a big bet in the summer of 2014 when he rejected an $80 billion takeover bid by 21st Century Fox, controlled by Rupert Murdoch.Mr. Bewkes had promised shareholders that Time Warner would create more value on its own than any proposal Fox was positioned to offer. Privately, Mr. Bewkes was telling colleagues and investors that Time Warner was likely to land a much more lucrative deal if it were put on the market a couple of years later. Among the potential bidders, Time Warner reasoned, were deep-pocketed technology companies like Apple and Google \u2014 and even, possibly, AT&T, which was tied up with a different deal at the time.Over the next two years, it was not clear that Mr. Bewkes had played his cards right. Fears of cord-cutting, ratings declines and a weak advertising market stoked panic across the industry over the future of traditional media in a digital world. And while Time Warner introduced several efforts to transform the company, such as a stand-alone streaming service for HBO, questions persisted about whether the company would have the resources to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon.As it turns out, Mr. Bewkes\u2019s bet paid off. In a big way.On Saturday night, AT&T announced that it had agreed to buy Time Warner for about $85.4 billion, or $107.50 a share in cash and stock \u2014 about a 35 percent premium to where Time Warner\u2019s stock was trading before reports of the merger talks, and well above the $85 a share Fox was offering.AT&T and Time Warner promised to \u201clead the next wave of innovation\u201d as the worlds of media, communications and technology collide.\u201cFor Time Warner shareholders, the price is exceptional,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group.And for Mr. Bewkes, the deal has sealed his legacy as a behind-the-scenes non-mogul media mogul.In an industry populated by larger-than-life executives like Mr. Murdoch and Sumner Redstone, whose activities have sometimes provided fodder for the gossip pages, Mr. Bewkes carved out a reputation as a personable numbers guy with a sense of humor and a low public profile. Mr. Bewkes lifted the company\u2019s stock price, slowly but surely, by disposing of assets, eventually making his company the most attractive takeover target in the media market.\u201cHe is not an executive that is cut from the old-school media mogul cloth,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Nomura. \u201cHis legacy is very much that he did so well for shareholders, whereas another type of media executive, a personality like a Sumner Redstone, would want to continue to preside and reign over this powerful media empire.\u201dIn an interview on Sunday, Mr. Bewkes deferred a question on how he thought about the AT&T-Time Warner deal in the context of his own legacy as a media executive.\u201cI don\u2019t think of it as my legacy,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cI think of it as the great institution of Time Warner, which has had a mission in this world since Henry Luce invented the magazine in 1923 and actually invented talking pictures in the years since.\u201dMr. Bewkes, 64, has worked at Time Warner for more than three decades. He became the chief executive of the premium TV network HBO in 1995, where he helped raise the network\u2019s profile by pushing for more original programming. His purview expanded in 2002, when he was named chairman of the company\u2019s networks and entertainment division. And in 2008, Mr. Bewkes succeeded Richard Parsons in the chief executive\u2019s suite.At the time, the company was still reeling from its disastrous dot-com merger with AOL. Time Warner shares traded as low as $14. Mr. Bewkes whittled the company down, unloading Time Warner Cable, then AOL, then its Time Inc. magazine division. What remained was a focused and well-respected television and film company that owned HBO; Warner Bros. film and television studios; and cable networks including CNN, TNT, Turner Sports and TBS.\u201cThat gave us the best choice of whether we wanted to consolidate another company into ours, or it made us the most valuable company if we wanted to consolidate with someone else, which is what we have now come to,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said.But Mr. Bewkes was not ready to exercise those options in the summer of 2014, when Fox appeared with its takeover offer. He said that he had never doubted the decision, in large part because Time Warner management considered the deal to be worth much less than it initially seemed.On the day that the Fox deal was announced, the transaction was worth about $80 billion. But that deal was heavily tilted toward Fox stock, which has lost about a third of its value since then. In addition, the transaction required taking out a substantial loan to cover the cash portion, and Time Warner would have assumed part of that debt.As a result, Time Warner estimates that the Fox deal would be valued at about $70 per share today. The AT&T bid represents about a 60 percent premium over the Fox offer.\u201cWe knew all that,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cThat is why we didn\u2019t consider it.\u201dIt was a different story in August, when Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chief executive, visited Mr. Bewkes at Time Warner\u2019s headquarters in New York. The two executives discussed their views for the future of content and distribution amid the rise of streaming services that are blurring lines among the media, communication and technology industries. Their visions aligned, and a deal quickly fell into place.\u201cWe see a convergence,\u201d Mr. Bewkes said. \u201cIt is not just creating content but introducing it to you as a viewer, wherever you go.\u201dAs an example, Mr. Bewkes pointed to more vigorous CNN offerings on mobile and better search and recommendation tools to discover HBO programming, whether a person is watching on a mobile phone, tablet or television set.Mr. Bewkes acknowledged that on its own, the media industry has been slow to put in effect new technologies that allow people to watch the programming they want to watch \u2014 when and how they want to watch it.\u201cLook at how slow some of these companies have been to put these innovations in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do things like that if we are together.\u201dOn Sunday, AT&T insisted that it would not try to influence its new assets in either the entertainment or news segments.\u201cOur intent is to operate Time Warner as it operates today, with autonomy in its divisions, including the world-class creative talent and journalists that make Time Warner a leader in entertainment and news,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said in a statement.\u201cCNN is an American symbol of independent journalism and First Amendment free speech,\u201d he added. \u201cMy board and I are clear \u2014 CNN will remain completely independent from an editorial perspective.\u201dAT&T\u2019s deal for Time Warner is expected to face intense regulatory pressure, and if it is approved, the companies do not expect it to close until late 2017. Mr. Bewkes, whose contract with Time Warner runs through 2020, is planning to stay with the company through a yet-to-be-determined transition period.Analysts said that they expected many other Time Warner executives to continue in their roles, because AT&T is a telecom company with little experience in programming. That was yet another contrast to the Murdoch offer.\u201cAny offer that was made to Time Warner was prefaced with the notion that the key up-and-coming leadership within Time Warner would not be jettisoned,\u201d Mr. DiClemente said. \u201cThat tone, in general, is a little different than the Murdoch tone, which was perceived as the expectation that they would be working for Rupert, James and Lachlan Murdoch.\u201d\u201cCulturally, this is more of a reason why this fits,\u201d he added.Mr. Bewkes put it more bluntly. \u201cThis fell into place,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it is kind of obvious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.\u201cCountries like Germany are well aware of data privacy, and it has made them more wary of where data is kept,\u201d said Gregor Petri, a cloud computing analyst at the technology research firm Gartner in Veghel, the Netherlands. \u201cLocal data sovereignty has become important, and American companies are now aware of that.\u201dThere is also a more basic explanation for American companies\u2019 expansion into European cloud computing: a growing amount of money to be made.Europe\u2019s market for so-called cloud application services, or software that is run virtually across the internet, is expected to more than double, to $16.1 billion, by the end of the decade, according to Gartner. That will still correspond to just one-third of the North American market, whose value is expected to reach $47 billion over the same period.Despite that relatively small size, Europe\u2019s market remains one of the largest for American cloud providers, many of which are increasing investments worldwide as companies and individuals increasingly rely on cloud-based services \u2014 such as iCloud, from Apple, and Dropbox, the online storage company \u2014 in their daily lives.In an interview, Rainer Strassner, manager of Microsoft\u2019s cloud program in Germany, said the country\u2019s law protected data stored on the servers there from information requests by foreign governments, including the United States.While such investments have focused primarily on business customers, other American tech companies have made similarly large investments aimed at speeding up digital services for everyday users across the 28-member European Union.Facebook is also working on its own Irish cloud computing center, while expanding an existing site in Sweden.Advertisement"}

Only a small group of executives at both companies were part of the merger project, called Bobtail.The primary point of concern between the two companies was price. Even regulatory issues were less of a problem, with just a $500 million fee payable to Time Warner if the deal was scrapped on antitrust grounds.In the early days of their announced merger, the two companies have had to answer questions and mollify critics.With near-zero interest rates at home, foreign buyers are rushing into the United States bond market with their savings, the global glut of which has reached record levels.Money that could be spent on shopping sprees in China and Japan or on building infrastructure in Germany is being accumulated and put into global capital markets.And not much can be done to force savers to spend more.So it is down to the United States to get global growth going while investors dabble in riskier corners of the market.\u201cA.I.G. is instructive,\u201d said Mark B.
