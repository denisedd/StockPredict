{"Headline": "New Ways Into the Brain\u2019s \u2018Music Room\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byBasicsGiven the antiquity, universality and deep popularity of music, many researchers had long assumed that the human brain must be equipped with some sort of music room, a distinctive piece of cortical architecture dedicated to detecting and interpreting the dulcet signals of song. Yet for years, scientists failed to find any clear evidence of a music-specific domain through conventional brain-scanning technology, and the quest to understand the neural basis of a quintessential human passion foundered.Now researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have devised a radical new approach to brain imaging that reveals what past studies had missed. By mathematically analyzing scans of the auditory cortex and grouping clusters of brain cells with similar activation patterns, the scientists have identified neural pathways that react almost exclusively to the sound of music \u2014 any music. It may be Bach, bluegrass, hip-hop, big band, sitar or Julie Andrews. A listener may relish the sampled genre or revile it. No matter. When a musical passage is played, a distinct set of neurons tucked inside a furrow of a listener\u2019s auditory cortex will fire in response.Other sounds, by contrast \u2014 a dog barking, a car skidding, a toilet flushing \u2014 leave the musical circuits unmoved.\u201cWhy do we have music?\u201d Dr. Kanwisher said in an interview. \u201cWhy do we enjoy it so much and want to dance when we hear it? How early in development can we see this sensitivity to music, and is it tunable with experience? These are the really cool first-order questions we can begin to address.\u201dDr. McDermott said the new method could be used to computationally dissect any scans from a functional magnetic resonance imaging device, or F.M.R.I. \u2014 the trendy workhorse of contemporary neuroscience \u2014 and so may end up divulging other hidden gems of cortical specialization. As proof of principle, the researchers showed that their analytical protocol had detected a second neural pathway in the brain for which scientists already had evidence \u2014 this one tuned to the sounds of human speech.Importantly, the M.I.T. team demonstrated that the speech and music circuits are in different parts of the brain\u2019s sprawling auditory cortex, where all sound signals are interpreted, and that each is largely deaf to the other\u2019s sonic cues, although there is some overlap when it comes to responding to songs with lyrics.In fact, Dr. Rauschecker said, music sensitivity may be more fundamental to the human brain than is speech perception. \u201cThere are theories that music is older than speech or language,\u201d he said. \u201cSome even argue that speech evolved from music.\u201dAnd though the survival value that music held for our ancestors may not be as immediately obvious as the power to recognize words, Dr. Rauschecker added, \u201cmusic works as a group cohesive. Music-making with other people in your tribe is a very ancient, human thing to do.\u201d\u201cThe story was, oh, what\u2019s special about music perception is how it recruits areas from all over the brain, how it draws on the motor system, speech circuitry, social understanding, and brings it all together,\u201d she said. Some researchers dismissed music as \u201cauditory cheesecake,\u201d a pastime that co-opted other essential communicative urges. \u201cThis paper says, no, when you peer below the cruder level seen with some methodologies, you find very specific circuitry that responds to music over speech.\u201dTo address the question, Dr. McDermott, a former club and radio disc jockey, and Dr. Norman-Haignere, an accomplished classical guitarist, began gathering a library of everyday sounds \u2014 music, speech, laughter, weeping, whispering, tires squealing, flags flapping, dishes clattering, flames crackling, wind chimes tinkling. Wherever they went, they asked for suggestions. Had they missed anything?Focusing on the brain\u2019s auditory region \u2014 located, appropriately enough, in the temporal lobes right above the ears \u2014 the scientists analyzed voxels, or three-dimensional pixels, of the images mathematically to detect similar patterns of neuronal excitement or quietude.\u201cThe strength of our method is that it\u2019s hypothesis-neutral,\u201d Dr. McDermott said. \u201cWe just present a bunch of sounds and let the data do the talking.\u201d\u201cThe sound of a solo drummer, whistling, pop songs, rap, almost everything that has a musical quality to it, melodic or rhythmic, would activate it,\u201d Dr. Norman-Haignere said. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason the result surprised us. The signals of speech are so much more homogeneous.\u201dThe researchers have yet to determine exactly which acoustic features of music stimulate its dedicated pathway. The relative constancy of a musical note\u2019s pitch? Its harmonic overlays? Even saying what music is can be tricky.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to come up with a dictionary definition,\u201d Dr. McDermott said. \u201cI tend to think music is best defined by example.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tips and Myths About Extending Smartphone Battery Life", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byTech FixAshlei Teme\u00f1a\u2019s family trip to Disneyland last Thanksgiving break turned into a nightmare when her smartphone battery hit empty.Ms. Teme\u00f1a, a San Francisco support technician, had gotten separated from her family and realized she had no way to find anyone. Instead of riding roller coasters, she wandered around searching for the group \u2014 eventually locating them four hours later watching fireworks.\u201cI wanted to throw my phone on the ground by the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Teme\u00f1a said.Many consumers can relate. Despite the leaps forward in mobile phone technology with crisp, clear screens and faster chips, batteries have made only sluggish progress. That has propelled a desire for longer battery life to the top of the list of factors considered by consumers when they purchase smartphones, according to a 2014 survey by the research firm IDC.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of investments on all fronts for improving the technology above and beyond that, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that hitting any kind of mass market for several years out,\u201d Mr. Quong said. In general, lithium ion improves about 10 percent a year in terms of the amount of energy that can be stored in a given space, which is partly why consumers perceive batteries as being far behind other technologies.The results showed that some conventional beliefs about extending battery life \u2014 like turning off Wi-Fi or shutting down all your phone\u2019s apps \u2014 produced negligible or even harmful results. The Wirecutter also found plenty of helpful practices to get more use out of your battery, like playing music stored directly on the device (instead of streaming it) or tweaking email configurations.The Wirecutter tested a range of recent Apple and Android smartphones with the latest operating systems in tightly controlled environments. Your phone\u2019s results will vary depending on the phone model, cellular carrier, location and other factors, but the general results should hold. Here are eight tips and seven myths busted by our findings:A smartphone\u2019s screen consumes more energy than any other component, so the easiest way to cut down battery drain is to reduce your screen brightness. In an hourlong test, an iPhone 6s used 54 percent less battery power with the screen brightness at minimum as compared with maximum brightness. An Android test phone used 30 percent less.But it\u2019s tough to use a dim screen in bright environments, so most phones offer an auto-brightness mode that automatically adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness based on ambient light. The Wirecutter found that enabling auto-brightness saved a good amount of battery life.When browsing the web, your smartphone also burns through power when it downloads mobile ads on websites. Installing an ad blocker will greatly extend battery life.Email can have a major impact on battery life if you have multiple email accounts and receive lots of email. Your smartphone can update your email automatically using a technology called push, which brings new messages to your phone the instant they are transmitted. Push can be a power hog because it requires your phone to constantly listen for new messages, so if you get a lot of email, there\u2019s a good chance your phone is using lots of energy.The Wirecutter tested an iPhone 6s Plus configured with three email accounts, receiving a total of 20 to 30 messages an hour. In these tests, having push active over the course of a day caused Mail to account for 5 to 10 percent of the phone\u2019s overall battery use.To save energy, most phones can be configured to instead check for (or \u201cfetch\u201d) emails on a schedule \u2014 say, every 30 minutes \u2014 or only when you manually tell your email app to refresh.The next tip may come as unwelcome news. Nowadays, online streaming is the most popular way to listen to music, with services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music \u2014 but this method guzzles lots of battery power. In the Wirecutter\u2019s tests, streaming music over a Wi-Fi connection for two hours used 10 percent of an iPhone\u2019s battery reserves; streaming the same music stored directly on a device over two hours consumed only 5 percent.Fortunately, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music still let you listen to songs the old-school way: by storing the music right on your device.You may have noticed that when you\u2019re in a place without good Wi-Fi or cellular coverage, your phone\u2019s battery seems to drain much more quickly. That\u2019s because the phone uses energy searching for a good signal and, if the signal is very weak, trying to get a better connection.To conserve battery life, disable the phone\u2019s wireless circuitry. Airplane Mode, an option that will turn off all wireless features, is a quick and easy solution in areas with poor reception.Alternatively, you can disable (in your phone\u2019s settings) a single wireless feature. For example, if you have terrible wireless carrier coverage in your office, but Wi-Fi is great, disabling cellular connectivity while there will keep the phone from wasting energy trying to get a cellular connection while still letting you connect to the Internet over Wi-Fi.Consumers can get even better results with a bit of sleuthing. Both the iPhone and Android systems provide a simple way to see which apps are using a lot of battery power. For iPhones and Android phones, open the Settings app and in the Battery menu, there are sorted lists of apps that are using the most energy.On the iPhone\u2019s battery usage screen, tap the clock button to reveal information about how much of your battery life each app is consuming when you\u2019re actively using the app (\u201cscreen\u201d) compared with when you\u2019re not (\u201cbackgd\u201d). On Android, the most useful information are the timers for \u201cCPU total\u201d and \u201cCPU foreground.\u201d Foreground is how much time you had the app open; subtract \u201cforeground\u201d from \u201ctotal,\u201d and you\u2019ll know how much time the app has been busy in the background.Be on the lookout for apps that are active for extended periods in the background and are using a lot of battery power. Examples include an email app that spends lots of time checking for new messages even when your phone is asleep, a news reader that updates articles in the background or a fitness app that constantly monitors your location.If you find apps using up lots of energy in the background, disable their background activities. On an iPhone, go to the Settings app, tap General and then Background App Refresh and disable the background activities for any apps. On Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Data Usage, choose an app, then select \u201cRestrict Background Data\u201d for background data usage.If a location-based app is using a lot of power, especially in the background, there\u2019s a good chance the app is using GPS, Wi-Fi and the phone\u2019s sensors frequently. You can decide whether to disable location features for it (either via your phone\u2019s Location Services settings, or by changing settings in the app itself). On an iPhone, you can disable the app\u2019s ability to track your location by going to Privacy menu and Location Services.To disable location tracking on Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Apps, choose an app and select \u201cPermissions,\u201d then tap to disable Location permission.Both Apple and Google recommend disabling push notifications, which are essentially app alerts, to conserve battery life. Notifications require regular communication with notification servers, and each notification causes your phone to wake up for a few seconds, including turning on the screen, to show you a message and give you a chance to act on it.In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing, receiving a few dozen notifications over the course of an hour didn\u2019t noticeably affect battery usage. But if you get a lot of notifications each day, that energy use can add up. If a particular app or service (say, Twitter or your email client) is constantly producing notifications, consider disabling notifications for that app.On an iPhone, open the Settings app, tap Notifications, tap the app name and disable Allow Notifications. On Android, disable notification in an app\u2019s settings menu, or long-press the notification itself and select the \u201ci\u201d icon. This will send you to that app\u2019s App Notifications settings, where you can block all notifications.There is plenty of inaccurate conventional wisdom about methods to prolong battery life. Let\u2019s start with one of the worst \u201ctips\u201d: Closing (or force-quitting, as it\u2019s commonly called) apps you are not currently using. The theory is that apps running in the background are using your phone\u2019s components, so quitting them will save energy.While that may be true on a computer, smartphones are designed differently: Once an app is no longer in the foreground \u2014 meaning you are not actively using it \u2014 most or all of its processes are frozen. In other words, while an app may still be loaded in a phone\u2019s memory, it probably is not doing much in the background to drain your battery.Finally, quitting apps actually has drawbacks: When you force-quit an app, all of its code can be purged from your phone\u2019s RAM, which means that the next time you open the app, the phone has to reload all of that code. That, of course, requires energy.A common suggestion for extending battery life is to disable Wi-Fi. However, if you\u2019re in range of a strong Wi-Fi signal, your phone uses less energy to connect to the Internet with a Wi-Fi connection than a cellular one. If you regularly use apps that rely on your location, having Wi-Fi enabled helps your phone determine its location without having to rely solely on power-hungry GPS features, so it actually helps a battery last longer.Many apps that use your location do so only intermittently. Even using the Maps app for short navigation sessions doesn\u2019t use more than a few percent of your battery\u2019s capacity \u2014 and having the phone\u2019s screen continually on is a big part of why navigation uses a lot of power.In other words, don\u2019t disable all of your phone\u2019s location-based features just to extend your battery life. You won\u2019t see a big jump in use time, but you may end up disabling \u2014 and subsequently missing \u2014 useful features. Instead, check (using the tips above) to see if any of apps consuming the most battery life also track your location. If so, and if you don\u2019t need that location tracking, consider disabling it for those apps.Many people, and even smartphone vendors such as Apple, claim that using Wi-Fi for wireless data consumes less power than using a cellular signal, so you should use Wi-Fi whenever you can. However, the Wirecutter\u2019s testing found this isn\u2019t always the case.In testing in a location where both Wi-Fi and cellular LTE signals were strong, an hour of browsing over Wi-Fi used roughly the same amount of battery power as an hour using LTE on an iPhone. On a Motorola Android phone, LTE used only 2 to 3 percent more power than Wi-Fi.In other words, as long as you have a good signal, you probably won\u2019t see a huge difference between Wi-Fi and cellular data, and it\u2019s probably not worth the hassle of switching between the two.Both iPhones and Android phones include a hands-free feature for summoning their virtual assistants by speaking voice commands. You can just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to the iPhone or \u201cO.K. Google\u201d and then speak your request or command. While convenient, this feature requires your phone to constantly listen for that special phrase, which uses some power.Yet if you have one of the phones that supports this feature, disabling it won\u2019t conserve much battery life. In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing with an iPhone 6s Plus and a Nexus 6P, there was a negligible difference in battery usage between having the always-on virtual assistant enabled or disabled over a two-hour period.Using Siri or O.K. Google uses some energy, so if your phone\u2019s battery is getting low, you should probably stop asking the phone question after question during your commute. But just having the feature enabled isn\u2019t worth worrying about \u2014 and it can be quite convenient.A common warning around the Internet is that you should use only the charger that came with your phone, otherwise you could damage your phone\u2019s battery. In reality, the phone itself contains all the circuitry responsible for charging its battery. The AC adapter (as it\u2019s more accurately known) simply converts the AC current from a wall outlet into low-voltage, low-amperage DC current that it provides via a USB port. This is why you can also charge your phone using the USB port on a computer, a USB battery pack or a charger in your car \u2014 the phone is designed to allow it to charge from a variety of power sources that can produce a wide range of current.Finally, you may see warnings that a cheap third-party charger could damage your phone. There\u2019s some truth here: Many chargers \u2014 especially budget models sold online, or even at your local shopping mall kiosk \u2014 are poorly made, or use low-quality components. A poorly made charger can not only damage your phone, but could also hurt you by exposing you to dangerous currents. So if you\u2019re replacing your phone\u2019s AC adapter, or buying an extra, stick with a reputable vendor.For many years, devices that used rechargeable batteries required \u201cconditioning\u201d or \u201ccalibrating,\u201d a procedure that prevented the battery from forgetting how much capacity it actually had. Today\u2019s smartphone batteries no longer suffer from this issue.If you have tried all the above and still struggle to get through the day with your battery, consider buying an external battery. These accessories \u2014 which can take the form of a bulky case with a built-in battery that you wear on the phone, or a separate battery pack that connects to your phone with a cable \u2014 can provide power to last an additional few hours at the end of the day, or even to fully charge your phone\u2019s battery.For days of smartphone power, the Anker PowerCore 15600 is the Wirecutter\u2019s pick if you need to charge a phone repeatedly or keep a full-size tablet and phone topped up through a busy week. It has enough available power to charge a typical smartphone five times or to fill a large tablet such as an iPad Air almost twice \u2014 for under $40.After her stressful day at Disneyland, Ms. Teme\u00f1a bought an external Amazon battery pack. She said the pack could fully charge her phone six times, but it wasn\u2019t ideal because of its bulk. Ultimately, she wishes her iPhone had a better battery.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why a battery wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with all the other advances they\u2019re putting into phones now,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The outcome, though, is far from assured.The plan is the brainchild of the European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the European Union. The digital single market involves a raft of new policies that would come into force \u2014 if everything goes according to plan \u2014 by the end of the decade. The proposal has been championed by many political leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.By allowing anyone from Ireland to Bulgaria to tap into the same digital marketplace, policy makers argue, Europeans could access a more diverse \u2014 and often cheaper \u2014 set of online services, from discounted online shopping to video-on-demand programming. Right now, for instance, someone in Spain cannot legally view (or buy) digital movies or sports events that are streamed online by companies based in other European countries.For a new generation of politicians here, the goal \u2014 despite the absence of bonhomie among many countries \u2014 is nothing short of a digital United States of Europe. \u201cThere are going to be no easy victories,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, a former Estonian prime minister who is leading the European Commission\u2019s digital campaign. \u201cIt will be an uphill struggle.\u201dAs a straight-talking Estonian, Mr. Ansip does not do exaggeration. And he\u2019s right about the obstacles, given renewed anxiety about the global economy and the growing number of migrants on Europe\u2019s doorsteps. After all, if politicians can\u2019t agree on who should be let across their borders, some question how much time they will spend on ensuring that Amazon purchases or iTunes subscriptions are delivered efficiently.And many vested interests could still scupper the plans. National television producers, for example, have long supported regulations that restrict people in France, say, from buying video-on-demand services from neighboring Germany. \u201cAs soon as you go across a border, it becomes complicated and costly,\u201d said Paul Todd, head of eBay\u2019s European operations, adding that basic hurdles like high shipping costs limit people from reaching new customers. \u201cThere are annoying barriers to doing business.\u201dA potentially deeper problem is that basic Internet skills \u2014 along with other essential services like high-speed mobile networks \u2014 vary drastically among European countries, as does understanding of e-commerce and general familiarity with the online world.As a result, experts say, those countries accustomed to living in an online world may well plow ahead with Europe\u2019s plans for a digital single market, while less tech-savvy neighbors \u2014 including Portugal and Spain \u2014 could easily be left behind.\u201cEveryone says we need a single digital market,\u201d said Giuseppe Recchi, chairman of Telecom Italia, the country\u2019s former telecom monopoly. \u201cBut how do you make that happen so that everyone prospers?\u201dMark Scott is the European technology correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PBS Is Creating a Channel Exclusively for Children", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byPBS is starting a new 24-hour channel dedicated solely to children\u2019s programming.The channel, which will be called PBS Kids and will be announced on Tuesday, will be free. It is expected to debut later this year \u2014 most likely in the fall. PBS Kids will also be available online with a live stream.More children\u2019s programming is available than ever, much of it being watched through streaming services and on-demand.Netflix has significantly increased its children\u2019s offerings in recent years, and it is expected to have 35 original series for children by year\u2019s end.Last month, HBO began broadcasting the latest season of \u201cSesame Street,\u201d after it took over first-run rights for the series from PBS. HBO has said more children\u2019s programming is coming, and Amazon has also produced shows aimed at that demographic.PBS will use the channel to broadcast popular shows already on its stations, like \u201cDaniel Tiger\u2019s Neighborhood,\u201d \u201cDinosaur Train\u201d and \u201cWild Kratts.\u201dPBS Kids will exist as a subchannel. Other PBS subchannels include World (which airs mostly documentaries) and Create (which broadcasts shows dedicated to topics like cooking and travel). PBS said the children\u2019s channel was not created with a hope of lifting fund-raising efforts, despite the recent loss of the first-air rights to \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\u201cThis is not designed in and of itself as a fund-raising effort,\u201d said Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS.The broadcaster said the new channel would be distinguished from other children\u2019s programming for the same reason PBS\u2019s programming has always stood out: It is free, with an emphasis on educational content.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge distinction between the content that\u2019s available through other media providers and PBS,\u201d said Lesli Rotenberg, the broadcaster\u2019s general manager of children\u2019s programming. \u201cEven though there may be more, there isn\u2019t necessarily more educational content for kids.\u201dPBS said that its live stream would also offer educational game opportunities for children. Ms. Rotenberg said that PBS\u2019s online games received twice as many page views and significantly more users than videos.The idea for PBS Kids arose, in part, because children are watching programs all day, not just in the morning and after school.\u201cThe challenge is when a lot of kids are available to be watching, we are broadcasting other things like the \u2018NewsHour,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Kerger said. \u201cThere are a lot of children, particularly that are home in early prime time, we aren\u2019t able to accommodate them except for on-demand. Given the fact that there are so many kids where on-demand is not an option, we want to be able to reach those kids.\u201dPBS was once in business with Comcast for the 24-hour children\u2019s channel called Sprout (the two are no longer connected). Ms. Kerger said that partnership was when PBS learned that there was also a valuable place for children\u2019s programming in prime time.\u201cThe assumption was that after 6 at night there wasn\u2019t as much an appetite for kids\u2019 content,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, deep into prime time, there are still a lot of kids watching television.

And as soon as a company hits turbulence, calls for a management shake-up almost always follow.History suggests that changing course can have big results. But not every company has needed to shake up its ranks to regain its footing. And even those that did bring in new management have found themselves under attack again:In the late 1990s, Priceline seemed to have the golden touch. On its first day of trading in 1999, its market value hit $12.9 billion. At the time, it was the highest first day valuation of any company that had gone public.The company\u2019s stock plummeted.

But the company had not recorded a profit in its early years, causing some analysts and investors to question whether it was any different than all the other dot-coms that failed by 2001.\u201cAt Amazon, they were ruthlessly committed to the customer experience,\u201d said Nick Donatiello, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cAnd that is still their strategy.\u201dThrough it all, Mr. Bezos consistently relayed his growth plan to investors.That\u2019s unlike some tech companies like Yahoo and Twitter, Professor Hsu of Wharton said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear communication either by way of their actions or their words as to how they are going stay relevant.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is unlikely Bezos could have anticipated how the various initiatives would turn out,\u201d he added. \u201cHe therefore had some sense of the necessary pacing of new business introductions to widen the touch points Amazon would need to ultimately win.\u201d\u201cIt took a change in management to clean up some prior misdirection and set a new strategy,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cTo make these changes, the company needed to \u2018reset expectations\u2019 and take the short-term hit from Wall Street as it invested for the long-term gain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Letter on iPhone Security Draws Muted Tech Industry Response", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byThe response from other technology companies? A mix of carefully calibrated support and crickets.Asked about Apple\u2019s opposition to the court order, representatives of Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment.The range of reactions highlights the complicated set of factors influencing tech companies\u2019 responses to government demands for customer data in the era after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, of widespread government surveillance. Some companies may be keeping their heads low to avoid becoming targets during the raucous presidential campaign, while others may fear that being too vocal will jeopardize government sales and relationships with law enforcement, privacy experts said.\u201cThe issue is of monumental importance, not only to the government and Apple but to the other technology giants as well,\u201d said Tom Rubin, a former attorney for Microsoft and the United States Department of Justice, who is now a law lecturer at Harvard University. \u201cThose companies are undoubtedly following the case intently, praying that it creates a good precedent and breathing a sigh of relief that it\u2019s not them in the spotlight.\u201dSome Silicon Valley luminaries were more direct in their support of Mr. Cook, including Jan Koum, the chief executive of WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook. In a message posted to Facebook, Mr. Koum said he admired Mr. Cook\u2019s position on privacy.\u201cWe must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set,\u201d Mr. Koum wrote. \u201cToday our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\u201dBut behind the scenes, there was discomfort among some companies that have generally allied themselves with Apple on the topic of government surveillance.All of the companies involved in Reform Government Surveillance, including Apple, acknowledge that they often comply with law enforcement requests for customer data when under order from a court. Apple\u2019s stance in this case seemed overly antagonistic to some companies in the coalition, according to people privy to conversations on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.In its statement on Wednesday, Reform Government Surveillance chose its words carefully. The association\u2019s member companies, the statement said, \u201cremain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers\u2019 information.\u201dThere was also disagreement about Apple\u2019s tactics. Gunter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, an information security company in San Jose, Calif., argued that the government\u2019s demand that Apple help unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was in line with similar one-time requests and that Apple was creating an unnecessarily high-stakes battle by framing the unlocking as creating a universal back door.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that since Apple has attempted to deny the F.B.I. request citing use of \u2018back doors,\u2019 should they lose this legal argument, the repercussions could be extensive to the entire security industry,\u201d he said in a blog post.If Apple had instead framed the issue as more of a tech-specific matter, \u201cthe prospect of a lost appeal would be greatly limited,\u201d rather than \u201cbeing included in appeals over anti-terrorism and a specific instance of a horrific crime,\u201d Mr. Ollmann added.Privacy advocates speculated that one reason Apple was willing to stake out a bolder position against what it saw as law enforcement overreach was that it is not as eager for government business as some of its rivals. Amazon has a large deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to help run its cloud computing operations, for example.On Wednesday, Microsoft promoted a deal with the United States Department of Defense under which the department will standardize its computers on the company\u2019s Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft has also pushed back against the government on issues including a court case in New York involving an effort to get Microsoft customer data stored outside the United States.Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group, said some tech companies \u201care a little bit uneasy doing things on the law enforcement side that might disrupt their ability to win contracts.\u201dPrivacy advocates also said that Apple was taking a stronger position on privacy matters because its business does not hinge on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data, unlike the operations of other tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cook has contrasted the privacy policies of Apple, which makes the overwhelming majority of its money by selling devices like the iPhone and Macs, with those of Internet companies that make their money from advertising.Apple\u2019s absolutist position is also seen by many as a reflection of Mr. Cook\u2019s view that privacy is a human right.\u201cThey\u2019re deeply a consumer company,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re less reliant on information as a business model. They sell things. I really think their C.E.O. has religion on privacy and personality matters.\u201dConor Dougherty and Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it.Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances.These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe\u2019s more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies.\u201cWe will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday.The new deal \u201cis a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201dIt provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy.\u201dBoth sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April.But the deal\u2019s first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union.Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people\u2019s digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans\u2019 data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday.The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe.\u201cThe problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement.In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans\u2019 data.The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data.Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency\u2019s surveillance of foreign citizens.During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies\u2019 use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states\u2019 national security practices, had demanded written guarantees.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a one-off decision by the commission,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. \u201cWe have achieved effective protection of Europeans\u2019 rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the regulators then decide that the new agreement with the United States does not protect Europeans\u2019 privacy rights, the national officials would have the power to investigate \u2014 and potentially fine \u2014 companies. And because the data pact cannot take effect until all 28 European Union countries have signed off on it, the questions raised by the national data privacy officials could complicate that process.These uncertainties, legal experts say, may threaten the new data transfer deal \u2014 known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. The agreement was reached after three months of tense negotiations between American and European Union officials.Such data is the lifeblood of modern international business and digital commerce. Billions of dollars in trans-Atlantic trade hang in the balance, for online companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as for more traditional multinationals like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial company General Electric.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin\u2019s group of privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the current data transfer system would remain in place at least until the end of February. But the deadline raises questions of what would happen if the region\u2019s privacy regulators could not be reassured that the new Privacy Shield pact provided sufficient protection of personal data.\u201cI am 100 percent sure we received concrete assurances from the Americans,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner who was in charge of Europe\u2019s negotiating team, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, she conceded, \u201cthe current situation isn\u2019t ideal.\u201dThe main provisions of the Privacy Shield included written guarantees by the United States that its national security agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans\u2019 data when it is transferred to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The deal also calls for the creation of a data privacy ombudsman within the State Department as the first point of contact for Europeans seeking redress for privacy complaints. These provisions would be reviewed annually to ensure that they met European privacy standardsSome of them, including Ms. Falque-Pierrotin in France and her counterparts in Germany and Spain, have sent letters to companies warning them that the current trans-Atlantic data transfer system is on shaky legal ground. But others \u2014 particularly officials in Britain and Ireland, where many international companies have headquarters \u2014 have said they favored the current data transfer approach.This divide, legal experts warn, could lead to some agencies pursuing investigations into companies\u2019 activities, on the behalf of citizens who believe their data may have been misused. Others, in contrast, are likely to permit companies to continue moving digital information almost unfettered between two of the world\u2019s largest economies.\u201cBusinesses will want to be cautious about signing up to Privacy Shield given the potential legal challenges,\u201d said Marc Dautlich, a data protection lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London.Wednesday\u2019s developments are the latest chapter of a bitter dispute.On one side are companies and government agencies in Europe and the United States that favor unfettered data transfers.On the other side are consumer advocacy groups in Europe, backed by some national data protection agencies, who are skeptical that Europeans\u2019 privacy rights will be upheld when their personal data is transmitted to the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a big concern about this agreement,\u201d said Estelle Mass\u00e9, a policy analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group in Brussels. \u201cWill it hold up in court?\u201dComplicating the issue are security concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about the rise of international terrorism. American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not want Europe\u2019s tough data privacy protections to prevent them, when necessary, from gaining access to the online communications of terrorism suspects, among others.This standoff is the result of a ruling last year by European judges that local citizens\u2019 digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. The judges also demanded that Europe\u2019s data protection authorities take a more active role in policing how information leaves their national borders.Even as they agreed on the broad outlines of the new accord, American and European policy makers knew they still had to fill in the details. Now, the national data regulators have given them a deadline.Victoria A. Espinel, president of the Software Alliance, a trade group in Washington, underlined the implications the deal could have.\u201cHalf a trillion dollars of trade is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still expect that cool heads will prevail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But e-commerce sales growth has been steadily declining for the last year, from 17 percent growth in the first quarter, despite heavy investments in the business.In contrast, Amazon said sales rose 26 percent in its fourth quarter, compared with 15 percent sales growth in the first quarter.Walmart executives cited challenges in international markets, especially China, Brazil and Britain. Last year, Walmart introduced a mobile payment application as a way to bridge the customer experience between its online and in-store sites. The executives said they would continue to build that service and expand the online sale of groceries from the 20 markets where it is offered already.Shares of Walmart were down about 3 percent in late-afternoon trading on Thursday.For the current fiscal year, which began this month, sales are projected to be flat, whereas previous estimates called for growth of 3 to 4 percent.In Walmart\u2019s fourth quarter, sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial metric in retailing, rose 0.6 percent in the United States. That quarter included the critical holiday shopping season and was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth. The increase, though, fell short of the 1.5 percent growth in the third and fourth quarters a year ago. Customer visits to United States stores rose 0.7 percent, slowing from an increase of 1.7 percent in the third quarter.\u201cThis past year has been a year of investment, operational improvement and change, even while we delivered solid growth,\u201d said Doug McMillon, Walmart\u2019s president and chief executive. \u201cWe do see an underlying strength in our Walmart U.S. business that wasn\u2019t there a year ago.\u201dQuarterly revenue, which reached $129.7 billion, fell 1.4 percent from the year-ago period, with currency adjustments shaving off $4.8 billion.Earnings per share were $1.43, compared with $1.53 a year ago. Costs associated with the store closings cut 20 cents off earnings per share, which was partly offset by tax-related gains of 14 cents a share. Excluding items, adjusted earnings per share were $1.49.For the full fiscal year, profit was $4.57 a share, or $4.59 excluding certain one-time items, compared with $4.99 the year before, and revenue was $482.1 billion, compared with $485.7 billion in the year-ago period.Nordstrom said the fourth-quarter profit of $180 million, or $1 a share, included a charge of 17 cents a share for asset impairment. But even without that charge, the results fell short of what analysts were expecting.While overall sales rose 5.2 percent in the quarter, and 7.5 percent for the year, its comparable sales, or those in stores open more than a year, rose by about 1 percent.Nordstrom got better results from online sales and sales through its discount stores.Full-price store net sales fell 2.5 percent, and same-store sales fell 3.2 percent. Sales through Nordstrom.com rose 11 percent and those at Nordstrom Rack and NordstromRack.com/HauteLook rose 12 percent.The company also said earnings per share through the first half of 2016 could fall 30 percent, reflecting last year\u2019s sale of its credit receivables and the costs of new stores and other growth projects.Advertisement"}

The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be more than $300 million.It is a deal that says much about the competition between Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to control much of the computing world over the next few years.A.W.S., Google and Microsoft\u2019s Azure business all rent access to globe-spanning cloud computing systems, each with millions of servers. All are trying to fill them with capabilities that developers can use to build products faster. The point is to get the corporate business into their clouds, and sell additional features once they are there.Scott Guthrie, the vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft, said Xamarin would continue to offer development tools to write for Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android mobile operating systems. Xamarin says it has 15,000 customers in 120 countries.Developers \u201ccan choose any cloud\u201d in which to manage and deploy their mobile applications, he said, but added \u201cyou\u2019ll see a deep integration with Azure,\u201d including features that won\u2019t be available in competing clouds.In other words, the idea is to treat everything equally, some more than others.It makes sense. In this competition, A.W.S. has an early lead and an outsize share of start-up developers. Google is vaunted for its low price and capabilities. Microsoft has the most corporate software in existing servers, and is trying to transfer those customers to the Azure cloud. To the extent Xamarin can help turn those into mobile apps, it helps with continuity.\u201cWe see enterprises that want to develop solutions to employees on mobile,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. In addition, he said, \u201cevery enterprise wants to deliver mobile software to its own customers.\u201dThat idea underlines another trend in the current competition: With access to the cloud, mobile, sensors and large-scale data analysis, every company is becoming responsible for the entire life of its product, not just to the point of purchase, and customers are starting to demand that companies remain aware of how their products are being used.\u201cThe customers we are working with have a desire to build applications factories,\u201d said Nat Friedman, the chief executive of Xamarin, who will oversee all tools development under Mr. Guthrie. \u201cThey all want end-to-end service, and this is a way to offer that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florist-Friendly Marketplaces Help Local Flower Shops Hang On", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipThis weekend, florists across the country will send out millions of Valentine\u2019s Day bouquets filled with roses, carnations, tulips and other blooming symbols of love. And some will lose money on almost every single sale.The recession and shoppers\u2019 changing preferences have played a role: Fresh flowers are a luxury that tends to get scrapped when money is tight. But florists say one of their biggest challenges is a behind-the-scenes margin fight that plays out every time a buyer goes online to arrange a flower delivery.That leaves the bricks-and-mortar merchants, to whom the orders are passed for fulfillment, typically collecting 70 percent or less of the sale price, fueling a sort of love-hate relationship with online merchants. While they can increase business for a florist, that business can come at a high price.The industry\u2019s current financial structure has its roots in a century-old practice. In 1910, a group of 15 American florists formed a cooperative, the Florists\u2019 Telegraph Delivery service, to exchange orders. A customer in Denver would, for example, be able to walk into a local flower shop and arrange a delivery to a friend in Boston. The originating florist transmitted the order through the florists\u2019 wire service and received a commission for the effort; the rest of the money was passed on to the fulfilling merchant.In a typical wire service transaction today, the originating merchant receives 20 percent of the sale price, and the wire service \u2014 FTD, 1-800-Flowers and Teleflora are the industry\u2019s big three \u2014 keeps 7 percent. If an order comes in directly through a wire\u2019s website, the service keeps the full 27 percent.BloomNation charges a flat 10 percent fee on the orders it processes, and it does not have a standardized product catalog. Merchants take and post photos of their own arrangements.That part particularly delights Ms. Paurus, who changes her photos daily.\u201cIf we get a double shipment of roses, within a few minutes, we can have a rose special on our website,\u201d she said.BloomNation\u2019s executives say 1,500 shops are using their marketplace. Farbod Shoraka, one of the founders, began working on the concept five years ago after hearing from his aunt, a florist, about her business\u2019s many pain points.\u201cThe consumer was frustrated, the business owner was frustrated, and the middleman was making all the money,\u201d Mr. Shoraka said. \u201cIt was a very clearly broken model, from a business standpoint.\u201dSo why do florists stick with it? Some of them say they value the sales volume that the wire services bring in and have found ways to make the orders profitable. Others point to the industry\u2019s reliance on the vendors it has worked with for decades.\u201cA lot of florists still rely on the wire services to send their outgoing orders, including many florists we have worked with for years and years,\u201d Ms. Bank said. \u201cAlthough we try to talk them into paying us directly, many are resistant. That\u2019s why we will likely continue with Teleflora, to maintain those relationships.\u201dThe wire services say they play a vital role in marketing florists\u2019 goods.\u201cWe run analytics to quantify what it costs to acquire an order,\u201d he said. \u201cMy cost across all of the platforms usually ranges from 24 to 30 percent. In the end, no matter what I use, I have to figure out how to make money on about 73 percent of the sale.\u201dBut as their industry shrinks, some flower shop owners are stepping up their efforts to change the way it operates.Recently the group requested a new feature, now in development, and it is one that sounds rather familiar.\u201cWe had the idea that we wanted to create our own florist-to-florist network,\u201d said Mr. Fiannaca, one of the group\u2019s founders. \u201cI can send an order to a member florist, and his or her products would populate on my web page.\u201dSo a century later, Real Local Florists is essentially working to recreate the kind of co-op that FTD pioneered. When asked about the similarity, Mr. Fiannaca laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s a good model,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just has to be one that helps keep local florists in business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But for years now I have had a sick feeling every time I shop for almost anything made of wood. The prices are often unbelievably good, but then I notice the words \u201cMade in Vietnam,\u201d or some other country where illegal logging is demolishing forests at appalling speed, largely for the United States and European markets.But more than a year earlier, private investigators revealed the company\u2019s criminal logging, and federal agents raided its headquarters. Oddly, the market shrugged it off then, and Mr. Lynch held onto his job. I don\u2019t mean to minimize the formaldehyde issue, but people can rip tainted flooring out of their homes, and class-action lawsuits on behalf of customers and shareholders may help recoup their losses. Replacing old-growth forest, on the other hand, is almost impossible.The forests of Russia\u2019s Far East are the only remaining home of the 450 or so wild Siberian tigers and 50 wild Amur leopards in the world. Those 500 lives matter infinitely more than our discount prices.The tigers require huge expanses of intact forest \u2014 a home range of 450 square miles for a male, and about a third of that for a female. They also need that forest to be abundantly populated with deer and wild boar, and these prey species in turn must feed on acorns from Mongolian oak and pine cones from Korean pine to survive. But forests like that are rapidly vanishing thanks to companies like Lumber Liquidators.The statement of facts accepted by the company as part of its settlement was damning. In pursuit of sharp discounts and higher profit margins, employees sought out lumber they knew, or ought to have known, was illegal, and submitted falsified import declarations to disguise that fact. They asserted, for instance, that Mongolian oak, which grows only in the Far East of Russia, had been harvested in Germany. They did it by the boatload, and probably would have continued to do so, because customers flocked through the doors, and investors smiled. In 2012, Mr. Lynch\u2019s first year leading the company, one financial website chose him as their \u201cchief executive of the year,\u201d noting Lumber Liquidators\u2019 knack for deep discounting that \u201cputs its peers to shame.\u201dBut the shame turned out to lie elsewhere in October 2013, when the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit conservation group, unveiled the results of a long-term undercover operation in China and Russia. Investigators had followed the lumber from the forests north of Vladivostok to the mill, and from the mill to the Chinese factory that was the largest buyer. They weren\u2019t looking for Lumber Liquidators, said Alexander von Bismarck, the conservation group\u2019s executive director. But \u201cwe almost literally bumped into the stacks and stacks of boxes that have the Lumber Liquidators brand in the factory that we had gone to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were the largest customer of the worst actor in terms of cutting and buying illegal timber in that forest.\u201dBeyond the $13.1 million fine, Lumber Liquidators\u2019 market worth has sunk roughly 90 percent, from more than $3 billion in 2013 to less than $400 million as of last week. \u201cThis is the first time that the guys risking their lives in the Russian Far East have an actual concrete reaction in the market to their intelligence,\u201d said Mr. von Bismarck. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Is that all they get, $13 million?\u2019 But we\u2019ve had 100 years of losing forests where nothing has happened.\u201dThe Lumber Liquidators settlement also includes a five-year probation, in which the company must enact an environmental compliance plan, with probation officers and Department of Justice lawyers looking on. Why no criminal sentences? Corporations typically compartmentalize knowledge, so someone may know that a wood product is illegal, and someone else may know the documentation is false, and someone in retail may know they\u2019re getting an incredible price \u2014 but they ask no questions, any more than you would on being offered choice merchandise that \u201cfell off the back of a truck.\u201dBut the case puts companies on notice to ask those questions, said Mr. von Bismarck, because even if $13.1 million is pocket change, a couple of billion dollars loss in stock value starts to feel like real money. That message is also reaching companies in China and other countries that have exported illegal lumber with impunity, he said.The legal change has also given hope to those who take the risk of fighting illegal logging in their home countries. In Houston last September, a tip from forestry officials in Peru led United States customs agents to seize a shipload of lumber said to have been illegally logged in the Amazon. That seizure was followed by a crackdown by Peru\u2019s government on opponents of illegal logging, which included the firing of Peru\u2019s top forestry official, death threats and the firebombing of his offices. But firing and intimidation may no longer avail: The same ship that made the Houston delivery is now being detained with another load from the Amazon by officials in the Dominican Republic.This is all good news. It means tigers and a host of other species may still have forests to wander in, and honest companies will face less unfair competition from stolen timber. It\u2019s also a reminder of a fundamental truth we all tend to forget in our insatiable quest for bargains: The lowest price is seldom the best deal for anyone.Richard Conniff is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cHouse of Lost Worlds: Dinosaurs, Dynasties, and the Story of Life on Earth\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stripe Atlas Aims to Ease the Way for Foreign Entrepreneurs", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byStripe, the San Francisco-based e-commerce start-up, thrives when other businesses do well. So the company wants to help many more businesses get off the ground.Determining eligibility requires little more than filling out a form. After that, Stripe will incorporate an entrepreneur\u2019s company as a business entity in Delaware, and provide the entrepreneur with a United States bank account and Stripe merchant account to accept payments globally.The target audience is all of the entrepreneurs outside the United States who want access to the country\u2019s well-developed banking infrastructure and business services. Stripe is particularly interested in attracting entrepreneurs from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia, among other regions.\u201cA majority of the growth over the next 10 years will come from these underserved markets,\u201d Patrick Collison, co-founder and chief executive of Stripe, said in an interview last week. \u201cThat includes about 6.2 billion people we don\u2019t reach yet, and that\u2019s a huge missed opportunity if we didn\u2019t try to do so.\u201dEligible entrepreneurs will also be offered access to basic tax and legal consulting and business services from partners like PricewaterhouseCoopers, and will receive free credit to run their online business on the Amazon Web Services hosting platform.Atlas is to begin on Wednesday in an invitation-only beta test; entrepreneurs can apply for the program through Stripe or one of the 50-plus start-up accelerator programs that the company has teamed up with globally. The beta program\u2019s cost is $500.It seems like a fine deal for fledgling entrepreneurs, and considering the cumulative value of the services offered, it essentially is. It is also potentially lucrative for Stripe, which processes digital payments for small and medium-size online businesses. More businesses using Stripe means an increase in payments processed over all. Stripe takes a small percentage of each transaction processed.For Dana Khater, the 22-year-old founder of Coterique, a digital platform based in Cairo for little-known international designers who want to sell their clothing online, setting up Atlas will help solve a problem as seemingly simple as paying her stable of designers.\u201cRight now, everything is very manually operated,\u201d Ms. Khater said. \u201cI need to go to the bank, withdraw money, then go to an exchange rate site, go back to the bank and set up the wire transfer. It\u2019s a huge tax on my time and effort.\u201dMs. Khater will also be saved the cost of traveling to the United States \u2014 which often requires more than one trip \u2014 to set up the services herself.There has been a retrenching in doling out venture capital in Silicon Valley and other start-up hubs like New York, and for months, global markets have been in turmoil, causing some investors to become more risk-averse. That could affect the number of entrepreneurs willing to start a small business.What\u2019s more, Stripe is potentially luring away entrepreneurs to incorporate themselves in the United States instead of, say, their home countries. That means fewer tax dollars for the nations these entrepreneurs reside in, which could irk local governments.Mr. Collison said the time horizon for Atlas is focused less on Day 1 than on Day 1,000.Stripe said Atlas would help entrepreneurs incorporate in countries outside the United States over time, but said there would still be a positive net effect on local economies in host countries if entrepreneurs incorporated in America succeed.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have Atlas, the business may not get off the ground in the first place,\u201d said Benjamin M. Lawsky, former superintendent of financial services for New York State, who now sits on the advisory board for Atlas. \u201cOr the innovator will get up and move out of the country to where the advanced economy is \u2014 like in the U.S., for example.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Drivers and Others in the Gig Economy Take a Stand", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byLast September, Dallas-area drivers for UberBlack, the company\u2019s high-end car service, received an email informing them that they would be expected to start picking up passengers on UberX, its low-cost option.The next day, when the policy was scheduled to go into effect, dozens of drivers caravaned to Uber\u2019s office in downtown Dallas and planted themselves outside until company officials met with them. Many had taken out loans to buy luxury vehicles that cost upward of $35,000, and worried that the modest per-mile rate for UberX passengers would barely cover gas and wear and tear, to say nothing of their car payments.The standoff stretched across nearly three more tense days until Uber allowed them to opt out of the policy. \u201cThey thought we were just going to give up, walk away,\u201d said Kirubel Kebede, a leader of the group. \u201cBut we said, \u2018No, this is our livelihood.\u2019\u201dIn the rapid growth of the online gig economy, many workers have felt squeezed and at times dehumanized by a business structure that promises independence but often leaves them at the mercy of increasingly powerful companies. Some are beginning to band together in search of leverage and to secure what they see as fairer treatment from the platforms that make the work possible.\u201cWe started realizing we\u2019re not contractors, we\u2019re more like employees,\u201d said Berhane Alemayoh, one of the UberBlack drivers in Dallas. \u201cThey tell us what kind of car to drive. They kick you out if a customer accused you of not having a clean car. They started to tighten the rope. Gradually, we can\u2019t breathe any more.\u201dPerhaps the most prominent effort was a measure to give ride-hailing drivers the right to unionize in Seattle, which was approved by the City Council in December.But while many campaigns by alienated workers have shunned this more traditional labor-organizing approach, they have highlighted a basis for advancing the interests of gig economy workers collectively.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of workplace identity and group consciousness despite the insistence from many of these platforms that they are simply open \u2018marketplaces\u2019 or \u2018malls\u2019 for digital labor,\u201d said Mary L. Gray, a researcher at Microsoft Research and professor in the Media School at Indiana University who studies gig economy workers.The efforts extend well beyond drivers for Uber and its prime competitor, Lyft. A group of couriers who find work on the platform Postmates is waging a campaign to create an \u201cI\u2019m done after this delivery\u201d button because they worry that turning down jobs will affect how many future assignments they receive. (A Postmates official said turning down jobs had no effect on future work, but that the company was still sympathetic to the idea.)The National Domestic Workers Alliance, which organizes nannies and housekeepers, recently produced what it calls the Good Work Code, which it has urged gig economy companies to adopt.\u201cThey would be dispatched to a home that didn\u2019t feel safe, but would be hesitant to exit themselves from that situation because it might affect their ratings,\u201d said Palak Shah, the alliance official leading the effort, citing one of several issues that the Good Work Code is intended to address. A handful of firms, like Managed by Q, LeadGenius and CareLinx, have embraced the guidelines.Though the so-called Turkers tend to value the flexibility and independence of freelancing and often reject the idea of a traditional union, many have also developed a kind of working-stiff identity. \u201cI\u2019ve heard them say Jeff Bezos is their boss \u2014 we\u2019re workers here,\u201d said Niloufar Salehi, a Stanford Ph.D. student who spent a year immersed in Turker forums to help the workers organize.By contrast, sellers of goods on digital marketplaces like eBay and Etsy rarely think of themselves as employees. In their minds, they say, they are independent artisans and shopkeepers.\u201cEtsy is the place where the shop exists, where I pay rent,\u201d said Sandie Russo, a longtime seller of hand-knit accessories and knitting patterns who once ran an online forum in which sellers helped one another address common problems. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely that you\u2019re an entrepreneur, not a worker.\u201dLike the Etsy shopkeepers, many Uber drivers began their relationship with the company thinking of themselves as self-employed.Unlike sellers on eBay or Etsy, Uber drivers cannot set the prices they charge. They are also constrained by the all-important rating system \u2014 maintain an average of around 4.6 out of 5 stars from customers in many cities or risk being deactivated \u2014 to behave a certain way, like not marketing other businesses to passengers.The experience of the Dallas UberBlack drivers is telling. When Uber entered Dallas in 2012, many of the drivers were either independent hired-car operators or contractors for limousine companies who bought or leased their own cars.\u201cSome had their own business, they were fine with the business,\u201d Mr. Alemayoh said. \u201cThey just used Uber as a complement.\u201dThe drivers formed a tactical alliance with the company to help it gain the city\u2019s approval, which local cab operators resisted. Mr. Alemayoh even sang Uber\u2019s praises in testimony before the Houston City Council, after the company asked him to speak there as part of its expansion efforts. \u201cI said it\u2019s fair to drivers to have Uber,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI spoke on their behalf, they didn\u2019t pay me.\u201dBut the relationship began to sour in 2014, when the company decreed that drivers with cars made before 2008 would no longer be able to participate in UberBlack.\u201cWe said, \u2018You guys are affecting so many families,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Kebede, a leader of a group called the Association of Limousine Owners and Operators of Dallas Fort Worth, formed the previous year. Uber extended the grace period by several months in some cases but did not reverse the policy.By the time Uber handed down its UberX directive in September, the drivers had long since recognized that they were at the company\u2019s beck and call. Because of Uber\u2019s popularity, almost all their other sources of business had dried up. And Uber had earned the imprimatur of the City Council, which made the drivers politically expendable, too.So it was something of a surprise that the drivers\u2019 association, which represents about 500 of the 2,000 to 3,000 black-car drivers it believes are active in the Dallas area, was able to push Uber not only to scale back the UberX change, but also to reinstate several of the drivers it had deactivated for pressuring fellow drivers as the showdown escalated.Some continue to be deactivated for what they feel are arbitrary reasons, which Uber maintains are unrelated to the protest (\u201cDrivers have the right to free expression and we respect that,\u201d said a company representative). But to the extent that the Dallas drivers have been successful, one crucial advantage is that they were able to organize in person rather than depend exclusively on the Internet and social media.That also helps explain the success of the campaign in Seattle, where Uber had previously reversed a rate cut after facing pressure from drivers. (Uber maintains that the reversal was unrelated.) \u201cThe drivers have gone out and talked to each other,\u201d said Dawn Gearhart, a spokeswoman in the area for the Teamsters union, which provides support services to local drivers. \u201cEvery time they would call a meeting, a couple hundred people would show up.\u201dIn the Tampa area, drivers have protested cuts that brought rates down to 65 cents a mile from 95 cents as of early January, and from $1.20 as recently as last spring. Net earnings for drivers there can come perilously close to subminimum wage rates on a 15- to 20-minute trip in town once they factor in pickup and wait times and the cost of gas, depreciation and maintenance.\u201cWe sometimes lower prices in a city to get more people using Uber,\u201d said an Uber representative. \u201cAs we have always said, price cuts need to work for drivers. If they do not, we will roll them back.\u201d In response, the Tampa area drivers started a weekly logout of an hour or two during peak periods for weekend revelers. During that time, they write messages on their windows about what they consider unlivable wages. The group has grown rapidly to a network of 700 drivers who communicate via an app-based walkie-talkie service called Zello.The Tampa drivers\u2019 goal is to enlist Uber\u2019s most politically valuable asset \u2014 legions of customers who have grown dependent on the service \u2014 to help send a message to Uber. Over time, they hope to extend the logouts to several hours, perhaps even a full day on the weekend.\u201cIt\u2019s a little blip on Uber\u2019s radar,\u201d said Josh Streeter, one of the leaders. \u201cBut then people might believe they have the power. That if they band together, they could pull off a bigger action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gearing Up for the Cloud, AT&T Tells Its Workers: Adapt, or Else", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 Thirty-four years ago, Kevin Stephenson got his younger brother, Randall, a job with the telephone company.Kevin, then 23, and Randall, 22, had tried selling cattle feed with their father near their home in Moore, Okla., but that didn\u2019t pan out. Kevin was hired to do accounting at a local Southwestern Bell office. Randall, who was in college, needed a bit more help. \u201cHe had trouble getting hired,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI talked to someone I knew in personnel.\u201dThe brothers had different tastes. Kevin liked to be outside, and now, at 57 years old, he works in Norman, Okla., fixing the decades-old copper lines that still connect to landline telephones in most homes as well as to modern Internet conduits like high-speed fiber optics. Randall liked numbers and stayed indoors, rising through the management ranks.Southwestern Bell became SBC Communications and took on the old AT&T name through an acquisition in 2005. By 2007, Randall was running the place.Today, Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is trying to reinvent the company so it can compete more deftly. Not that long ago it had to fight for business with other phone companies and cellular carriers. Then the Internet and cloud computing came along, and AT&T found itself in a tussle with a whole bunch of companies.AT&T\u2019s competitors are not just Verizon and Sprint, but also tech giants like Amazon and Google. For the company to survive in this environment, Mr. Stephenson needs to retrain its 280,000 employees so they can improve their coding skills, or learn them, and make quick business decisions based on a fire hose of data coming into the company.In an ambitious corporate education program that started about two years ago, he is offering to pay for classes (at least some of them) to help employees modernize their skills. But there\u2019s a catch: They have to take these classes on their own time and sometimes pay for them with their own money.To Mr. Stephenson, it should be an easy choice for most workers: Learn new skills or find your career choices are very limited.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.\u201cThere is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop,\u201d he said in a recent interview at AT&T\u2019s Dallas headquarters. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning, he added, \u201cwill obsolete themselves with the technology.\u201dKevin? He admires his younger brother, but he is among the many AT&T lifers who are not that keen to participate in this reinvention of old Ma Bell. \u201cI\u2019m riding the copper train all the way down,\u201d he said.He talks about the changes with obvious affection for both his brother and his longtime employer. In interviews, many veteran AT&T employees around the country showed a surprising amount of emotion toward a company that has been broken up, rebuilt and reinvented several times.But that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is particularly eager to rebuild and reinvent themselves for a new AT&T. Even if it means, as Randall put it, obsolescence.Companies\u2019 reinventing themselves to compete with more nimble competitors is hardly a new story. Many have tried, and a handful have even succeeded. Mr. Stephenson wants AT&T to be among those few.By 2020, Mr. Stephenson hopes AT&T will be well into its transformation into a computing company that manages all sorts of digital things: phones, satellite television and huge volumes of data, all sorted through software managed in the cloud.That can\u2019t happen unless at least some of his work force is retrained to deal with the technology. It\u2019s not a young group: The average tenure at AT&T is 12 years, or 22 years if you don\u2019t count the people working in call centers. And many employees don\u2019t have experience writing open-source software or casually analyzing terabytes of customer data.If you don\u2019t develop the new skills, you won\u2019t be fired \u2014 at least AT&T won\u2019t say as much \u2014 but you won\u2019t have much of a future. The company isn\u2019t too worried about people leaving, since executives estimate that eventually AT&T could get by with one-third fewer workers.Mr. Stephenson declined to project how many workers he might have by 2020, when the cloud-based system is supposed to be fully in place. One thing about cutting people in an aging work force, he noted, is that \u201cdemography is on our side.\u201d Other senior executives say shrinking the work force by 30 percent is not out of the question.Maybe so, but count Kevin among the skeptics of how fast AT&T\u2019s transformation will happen.\u201cI\u2019m proud of my brother,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not going to get rid of this stuff as fast as he thinks.\u201dLong ago, a phone system created wire lines between callers, and operators moved plugs in their switchboards to connect people. Over time, that was automated to become something closer to a computer, with digital fibers and wireless towers. Much of the setup, however, still needed lots of people to tend hardware that had been built for particular tasks, like feeding one neighborhood\u2019s calls into a nationwide backbone of wires, fiber and switches.Mr. Stephenson has concentrated on things related to cloud computing, a technology setup that is more like the computer guts of Google or Amazon than the circuits and switches of a phone company. This cloud system will eventually touch ventures in landline phones, wireless, high-speed online services, cable TV and now satellite, thanks to the DirecTV purchase.Analysts give him good marks but say he has a long way to go. \u201cThey want to be 75 percent done by 2020, and last year they did the first 5 percent,\u201d said Akshay Sharma, an analyst with the research firm Gartner.AT&T wants to build products and services as fast as this competition. Data from satellite TV could be analyzed for viewing habits and someday used, for example, to sell football fans a replay app for their AT&T mobile phones.In 2012, Mr. Stephenson realized, much to his dismay, that his staff was woefully unschooled for the new technology. Vision 2020, as the company calls it, is a program that combines online and classroom-based course work in subjects like digital networking and data science, as well as a look at old skills that can be transferred to new careers.Everything at AT&T is changing, from the services customers are offered to the way they are charged for them. One service called Network on Demand, for example, allows customers to increase the size of their Internet pipes without calling a technician, something that used to take weeks. And Mr. Stephenson\u2019s employees have to be able to deal with all that.\u201cIf we can\u2019t do it, mark my words, in three years we\u2019ll be managing decline,\u201d he said.Inside a glass-walled office where Mr. Stephenson meets presidential candidates and corporate titans, Mr. Thrun gave him a pitch on funding an online master\u2019s degree in engineering that Udacity proposed to teach in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Within five minutes, the two men were cross-legged on the floor, Mr. Stephenson eager to try a physics course.His first online learning began with an unexpected challenge: getting online. AT&T\u2019s own Wi-Fi was too clunky, Mr. Thrun recalled. Eventually they used Mr. Thrun\u2019s smartphone, which ran on the network of T-Mobile, a rival carrier.The building\u2019s Wi-Fi is now said to be better, and elsewhere in AT&T the first employees are getting their online Georgia Tech degrees.Eboni Bell, 24, a product manager for smartphone software in AT&T\u2019s Atlanta office, sees the Vision 2020 retraining as the chance of a lifetime. The company provided tuition assistance for much of her two-year Udacity/Georgia Tech master\u2019s degree in computer science, which it says cost $6,600. Single and childless, she doesn\u2019t mind the hours it takes.\u201cI leave the office at 7 p.m., work at home until midnight, and Saturdays and Sundays are committed to school,\u201d she said.Ms. Bell, who wants to work in software architecture and design, plans to keep taking courses. \u201cI need to know what my competitors are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself staying with one product too long \u2014 it makes me feel like I\u2019m not growing.\u201dSo far most of the people who have taken the new courses are managers, and seem interested in learning very technical skills. Among the most popular courses are web development, data analysis, introduction to programming and writing apps for the iPhone.\u201cIt\u2019s great for those who want to make the transition,\u201d said Mr. Sharma of Gartner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to change, it\u2019s a good time to retire and enjoy life.\u201dAT&T\u2019s workers receive weekly emails and video broadcasts about learning online. Vision 2020 includes an internal website where employees can enter their job titles, see what types of careers might be available in a software-driven company, and what courses they need to take to get them. Over time, their grades are logged, and depending on how they do on the schoolwork, different new courses are suggested. Eventually, performance reviews will include data on what people studied, how well they did and whether, like Ms. Bell, they are willing to keep learning.Eventually, the plan is that desire for learning will be taken into account when promotions are considered.Across the country in Orange, Calif., Patti Cunningham, a 61-year-old technician, is struggling. Ms. Cunningham, who has worked at AT&T for 43 years, has not signed up for any courses, and can barely recall receiving emails about the new plans. (An AT&T spokesman produced dozens of such messages, going back to early 2014.) Essentially, she does not see a place for herself.\u201cThis new concept of training on your own time, everything changing all the time, if you want to keep working, do more things on your own time \u2014 I guess they have to do it,\u201d she said, sitting in a run-down room at her union local. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see a need to be involved.\u201dChristopher Shelton, national head of the Communications Workers of America, said the changes were inevitable, and he believed his people would go along with them.\u201cWe realized a long time ago that you can\u2019t fight technology change and win,\u201d he said. \u201cOur contracts spell out training programs and policies to make sure that members get training to update their skills as technology changes.\u201d Still, he thinks the expectations about home study after a hard day\u2019s work are too much.AT&T will reimburse up to $8,000 a year in tuition; the amount was raised just last month. The company claims that a year into the program, over half of the work force, mostly managers, has started training, sometimes with dozens of short online courses.\u201cPeople are going to have to work hard, but it\u2019s not insane,\u201d said William Blase, who oversees personnel for all of AT&T. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an expectation that your compensation will be tied to continuing to learn. We\u2019re at a crossroads as a business \u2014 and a country \u2014 where education has to keep up with technology.\u201dIf there is one thing on which Ms. Bell and Ms. Cunningham agree, albeit with different sentiments, it is that the change is necessary. Eventually phone calls, texts, sensor data and TV shows, along with much else, will all run on fiber-optic networks and be managed largely with software.Ms. Bell works with a lot of older colleagues. \u201cOne of my co-workers has been looking at the same database for 20 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds harsh, but if she doesn\u2019t adapt, there won\u2019t be room for her.\u201dThat message has not been lost on Jacobie Davis, an 18-year employee in Richardson, Tex., who works in tech support for older-style gear. At 39, he is the youngest person in his office, and is scrambling to study both new networks and data science. \u201cI try to put in 15 hours a week,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2020, my technology will be gone.\u201dIn some ways, cloud computing is not as radical a technology shift as all the puffy language suggests. Big banks of computers still run software, as they have been doing in many industries since the 1960s. They have more power, because their chips have more transistors that enable them to do more, and they connect to more things thanks to fiber-optic cable and wireless.The big difference is something called virtualization, which amounts to software that allows many machines to operate like one piece of computer hardware. This made it possible to run software that in effect interacted with other software instead of hardware. This, in turn, means the possibility of changing functions around rapidly by typing a few lines of code.The new systems also collect more data, quickly analyze information about what people and things are doing, and react. That is how online ads are personalized for you, and increasingly how maps reflect current traffic conditions, or streetlights adjust to suit parking congestion.Now what once took a year of analysis and deployment can instead happen in days, even minutes.These concepts can be tough in some reaches of AT&T, where lives and work have not changed all that much.In Dayton, Ohio, Kirk Warrenburg came out of a job in a bowling alley and started wiring cards for telegraph systems 40 years ago. Now he works on AT&T\u2019s signaling network, which makes sure billions of calls get through.He has taken 16 courses \u2014 Udacity courses and in-house \u201cnano courses,\u201d each about two weeks long \u2014 in the last year. He doesn\u2019t see himself changing jobs, however, because the old machines still need someone to care for them. Younger workers, he thinks, won\u2019t want to be in his dead end.\u201cWriting a telegraph circuit was like writing a recipe for a field technician,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of legacy systems are still around here. I\u2019ll be long gone before they will.\u201dSome other older employees besides Kevin Stephenson think the 2020 target will come and go, but basics won\u2019t change.The 2020 effort \u201cis just a start,\u201d said Kenny Williams, 64, a testing technician and the head of Ms. Cunningham\u2019s union local in Southern California. \u201cI\u2019ve inoculated my people against worrying. They need a fiber network for this that doesn\u2019t exist out here yet. Seventy percent of my folks are safe; the other 30 have to be found jobs, or they\u2019ll take the golden handshake\u201d and retire.As he sees it, much of the urgency comes from the threat of Google. In 2015 Google Fiber, Google\u2019s high-speed Internet service, caused AT&T to do something uncommon in its history: lower its prices because of competition. \u201cIn 40 years here I hadn\u2019t seen that,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cTheir people aren\u2019t in unions \u2014 we\u2019re a lot more on AT&T\u2019s side than theirs.\u201dWhat happens next at AT&T \u2014 and how fast that will happen \u2014 is a matter of disagreement in the Stephenson family.\u201cI go out to houses away from the cities, and there\u2019s not a lot of fiber there,\u201d Kevin said. Fiber would open the way for all that new technology. He takes comfort in looking at patches linemen did on fiber systems decades ago \u2014 from both the jury-rigged craftsmanship and the way they have endured.But Randall said his brother was not necessarily like the rest of the work force because there will always be hard, outdoor tasks for people like him. \u201cThere will be people turning screws and digging trenches. I\u2019ll be long gone before that is over. But other guys I know in Oklahoma will do a skills pivot\u201d with additional training, he said.Besides, it\u2019s not just about his brother. It\u2019s about most of the economy.\u201cEverybody is going to go face to face with a Google, an Amazon, a Netflix,\u201d he said. \u201cYou compete based on data, and based on customer insights you get with their permission. If we\u2019re wrong, it won\u2019t play well for anyone here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because book prices regularly change on the site, visitors to the store scan books using a mobile app to find out how much they cost.Because Mr. Bezos has outsize ambitions for most of the company\u2019s initiatives, the opening of the Seattle location quickly led to speculation about a nationwide chain of Amazon stores. Jennifer Cast, an early Amazon executive and trusted lieutenant of Mr. Bezos, returned to the company to help oversee the store initiative after leaving Amazon more than a dozen years ago.Advertisement"}

The revealer is particularly clever and, remember, if you are having trouble finding it or you are saying to yourself \u201cWhat the heck is a revealer?\u201d, I usually use the revealer as my headline.  And it\u2019s a Thursday-worthy, 66-word puzzle that is fun to solve and has some nice longish entries. If you\u2019re still not sure what just happened to you, look at it this way: The F.A.A., as the revealer at 49 Across says, focuses in part on the investigation of airplane CRASH SITES. But if you take that phrase and look at it as SITES that CRASH into each other, you\u2019ve got yourself a pretty spiffy theme. Also, every single one of those websites is capable of CRASHing, though far be it from me to start any rumors. Here are the CRASHing webSITES:In a theme like this, constructors need to be careful that the resulting theme entry doesn\u2019t stray too far from being a real phrase. Mr. Fagliano pushes the envelope a bit here, particularly with VULTURE GAWKER, but I enjoyed the idea of CRASHing the SITES together, and the theme, overall, has a fresh feel to it. The first theme clue I ran into was \u201c[Insert your least favorite congressman here]?\u201d and I will admit that I got a bit nervous as to where this was going, what with the political climate right now, but it turned out to be my favorite of the theme clues.I also liked the way Mr. Fagliano balanced out the newer website entries with some older pop culture, like \u201cThree\u2019s Company\u201d\u2018s MR.

Having a 66-worder, which is in themeless territory, allowed me to work in a lot of unusual longer fill, which I think makes for a more interesting solving experience.One other thing: Because the theme here skewed young, I tried to keep the rest of the fill more balanced, hence older references like MR ROPER, AUNTIE EM and VOLARE. Overall, I\u2019m very happy with how this turned out, and hope people like it!Let\u2019s move on to the Friday puzzle with the scene that terrified me throughout my childhood.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Embrace of the Serpent,\u2019 Where Majesty Meets Monstrosity", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byThat tricky word \u201ccivilized\u201d connotes enlightenment, behavioral restraint, evolutionary advancement and the suppression of bestial impulses. But what is so civilized about mass slaughter, torture and planetary despoliation in the name of anything or anybody? It shouldn\u2019t have taken a journey up the Congo River for a white man to discover the evil within.The film\u2019s central figure, he is the last survivor of the Cohiuano, an Amazonian tribe killed off by the rubber barons. He is no innocent, noble savage but an angry, morally complex individual with a heart full of grief. He may be in greater harmony with the natural world than any foreign intruder, but he is alone. The film gives full voice to his view of a social order in which the rules of nature assimilated and handed down through the centuries among the Cohiuano must be obeyed, or else.The Amazonian ecosystem, in which everything seemingly preys on everything else, is a continual and endless feeding frenzy. In a signature image, an aquatic serpent devouring another snake is observed by a glowering jaguar.Inspired by the travel journals of Theodor Koch-Gr\u00fcnberg, a.k.a. Theo (Jan Bijvoet), a German ethnologist and explorer, and Richard Evans Schultes, a.k.a. Evan (Brionne Davis), an American biologist considered the father of modern ethnobotany, the film imagines their parallel journeys, decades apart, seeking the yakruna, a sacred healing plant. This miraculous cure-all is a hallucinogen that attaches itself to rubber trees.In Karamakate\u2019s eyes, the European and American marauders who enslaved and destroyed his tribe are agents of an insane culture devoted to genocidal conquest and rapacious destruction. He finds the concept of money laughable; it is just useless paper. He urges the explorers to throw their luggage overboard. Their possessions are \u201cjust things,\u201d he scoffs. To the extent that the film persuades you that he is right, \u201cEmbrace of the Serpent\u201d is potentially life-changing. One thing Evan refuses to relinquish is a portable phonograph on which he plays a recording of Haydn\u2019s \u201cCreation.\u201d Karamakate responds respectfully to the sublime music.The first journey takes place in 1909, when Theo is near death. (Koch-Gr\u00fcnberg actually died in 1924). Accompanied by the young Karamakate (Nilbio Torres), he is escorted by canoe up the Amazon River with a guide, Manduca (Yauenk\u00fc Miguee), who had worked on a rubber plantation and was freed by Theo. In a movie in which nine languages are spoken, Manduca is the cultural mediator and sometime interpreter. Initially reluctant to help Theo find a yakruna, Karamakate agrees to only if Theo will help him locate other surviving members of the Cohiuano, who he says exist.Later, Evan makes the same journey with the older, enfeebled Karamakate (Antonio Bol\u00edvar Salvador), whose tribe is now extinct. Karamakate has lost his ability to communicate with rocks and trees and is weighed down by a resigned sadness. The movie jumps between the two journeys, which follow roughly identical routes.The film\u2019s anger is concentrated in two devastating scenes of tyrannical white intruders. At a Roman Catholic mission, a Spanish priest presides over a flock of boys orphaned by the conflicts between rubber barons and indigenous tribes. Dressed in white robes and forbidden to speak \u201cpagan languages,\u201d the boys are viciously whipped at the whim of this Dickensian monster.Decades hence, at another riverside community, the dying indigenous wife of a self-proclaimed white messiah is healed by one of Karamakate\u2019s potions, and her husband proclaims himself the Son of God. In a delirium, he invites his followers to consume his body and blood. As they encircle him like vultures, the visitors flee.From here, the film moves to mystical higher ground, as abhorrence expands into awe. Instead of \u201cThe horror!,\u201d I would substitute \u201cThe wonder!\u201d\u201cEmbrace of the Serpent\u201d is not rated. In Spanish and Amazonian tribal languages, with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 5 minutes.A film review on Wednesday about \u201cEmbrace of the Serpent,\u201d which is set in the Amazon jungle, misidentified the animal that observes an aquatic serpent devouring another snake. It is a jaguar, not a leopard. (Leopards are not found in the wild in South America.)Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

Short of a patient in a dentist\u2019s chair, it\u2019s hard to find a more captive audience than airline passengers.\u201cIt was a little bit of a surprise to us, early on, how much time people spent shopping,\u201d he said.Airlines are counting on nimbler technology and faster, more reliable Wi-Fi in the air to deliver virtual catalogs, promotions and a host of goods and services.They are betting that passengers will warm to the idea of browsing via the seat-back entertainment console or their own devices at cruising altitude \u2014 and are counting on getting a piece of what GuestLogix, a travel retailing technology company, says is a $5 billion annual business, either directly or through affiliate programs.\u201cWhere we\u2019re starting to see this is in the airlines that have made the big investments in in-flight Wi-Fi,\u201d said Michael Reyes, director of customer centricity at Sabre Airline Solutions.\u201cThey\u2019ve always been chasing ways to find new revenues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big difference now is the connectivity. They can have a lot more data piped up to the plane.\u201dThe onboard retail market is growing at a 13 percent rate, year over year, according to Craig Proud, senior vice president for platform at GuestLogix.\u201cThe technology is there,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on our experience, the market opportunity is still really huge, but merchandising is the key to success.\u201dIn November, LSG Sky Chefs, an airline catering company and a division of Lufthansa Group, acquired one of its partners, the Irish technology company Retail inMotion, to help it expand into what it called the \u201cincreasingly important onboard retail business.\u201d In a release, LSG Sky Chefs said its intention was to sell passengers everything from merchandise to tickets for events or attractions at the flight\u2019s destination.\u201cWe see the growth rate much bigger than the growth of passengers,\u201d said Stefan Patermann, Retail inMotion\u2019s chief commercial officer, estimating the onboard retail market in Europe alone to be worth about 1 billion euros, or about $1.09 billion, a year.Analysts say this evolution was only a matter of time: The unbundling of services and amenities like food and preferred seats in coach cabins made the buy-on-board retail model standard. At the same time, a fast, unbroken Wi-Fi connection eases onboard shopping and allows airlines to process credit card transactions in real time.\u201cCarriers are finding more ways to push more offers through that technology,\u201d said Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant.What airlines see as a new revenue stream, though, some travelers see as an irritant, especially in a market in which airlines are already earning eye-popping profits.\u201cEverybody\u2019s pushing retail at you,\u201d said James Condon, a consultant who lives in the Washington area and travels frequently for work. He said that marketing seemed heaviest on international flights, where the airline\u2019s window of time to make pitches to customers is longest.\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for bespoke and unique products that are exclusive to Virgin Atlantic,\u201d a representative for that airline said via email.Late last year, JetBlue teamed up with Amazon to make Amazon\u2019s library of media available to Prime members as well as to passengers who sign up for a free trial or a subscription to the service, which a surprising number do.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very high uptake of Amazon Prime from people who were not previously Prime,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cIt seems that the carrot of free video streaming onboard is quite an attractive one.\u201dThe airline also has promoted a sweepstakes that passengers enter by signing up for J. Crew\u2019s mailing list, and giveaways from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts for joining the chain\u2019s loyalty program through JetBlue\u2019s platform. By the middle of this year, Mr. Perry said, JetBlue hopes to let members of its frequent-flier program earn loyalty points when they shop on Amazon in flight.Unlike most other airlines, JetBlue offers its basic Wi-Fi free. (Passengers can pay for more speed.) The carrier calculates that its investment will pay off in the long run as more people browse and buy items or subscribe to services, effectively subsidizing the Wi-Fi and earning JetBlue extra revenue.\u201cOnce you have a free model, essentially what you\u2019re monetizing is eyeballs,\u201d Mr. Perry said.Abby Lunardini, vice president for brand marketing and communications at Virgin America, said that a technology upgrade the carrier began last year would let it offer an array of goods and services, along with promotions for media and entertainment providers like Netflix and Spotify.\u201cIt certainly opens up a whole new range of possibilities,\u201d she said, adding that Virgin America wanted to make its offers in an unobtrusive way. For travelers like Mr. Condon, anything that makes the in-flight offers less obtrusive would be an improvement. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s annoying,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially, they\u2019ve taken the SkyMall catalog and put it in electronic format.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The crisis around the Zika virus, which Brazilian researchers link to a surge of birth defects in babies, is no different.When I awoke on my first day in Recife, there was no time to stop at a pharmacy. I had arranged an early morning meeting with women whose infants have abnormally small heads and brain damage, a condition called microcephaly, at the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, a once-polished institution that is now in a state of elegant decay.It was clear, as soon as I arrived at the infant ward where these women had brought their babies to be examined, that my concern about getting bitten by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes paled in comparison with what they and their children were going through.Sitting near a mango tree offering some shade, one mother began sobbing when she described the shock that followed her son\u2019s diagnosis with microcephaly. Another woman stoically told me how doctors had informed her that her daughter would soon start suffering debilitating seizures, a complication from microcephaly.\u201cI\u2019d like to dream this isn\u2019t happening,\u201d Dr. Angela Rocha, the pediatrician in charge of the infant ward, told me in her office.Those words echoed in my mind as I raced back to my hotel to write about the heartbreaking scene at the hospital. After filing my story to the International desk in New York, I found a pharmacy a couple of blocks away and bought a plastic bottle of Off!Zika is new to Brazil; researchers think it showed up here sometime around the 2014 World Cup. As far as mosquito-borne viruses go, Zika was thought to be relatively benign \u2014 until recently. Most people who get it have no symptoms at all; those who do have a rash, fever, itching and perhaps some body aches.During dozens of reporting trips to rain forests in South America, I\u2019ve discovered, however, that even the best repellents are useless in the face of swarming mosquitoes.My precautions were useless. Dozens of persistent mosquitoes bit through the netting, the fabric of the hammock and my clothing. I\u2019m very lucky \u2014 and knock wood as I wrote these words \u2014 not to have had dengue, malaria or Zika, after postings in Rio and Caracas over the last decade.Deadly mosquito-borne diseases aren\u2019t new to Brazil or South America.

{"Headline": "Male Sellers on eBay Have an Edge Over Women, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported bySuccessful sellers on eBay know certain things matter: item description, appealing photos, strong seller ratings and, of course, price.Now, a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances suggested another factor might make a subtle difference: whether the seller is a man or woman. Using data supplied by the company, researchers analyzed some 630,000 auction transactions on eBay in the United States and reported that, on average, when men and women with equal selling reputations sold the same products, women received lower prices than men.The difference was far less pronounced for used items: Women sellers received about 97 cents for every dollar men received. But with new items, where the authors say direct comparison is easier, women received about 80 cents on average for every dollar men sellers received.\u201cThe basic point \u2014 that people have different expectations of women versus men and so we treat them very differently in the world \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating and depressing,\u201d said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who was not involved in the study.\u201cOn eBay, wow,\u201d she added, noting eBay\u2019s fame as a forum where anyone can sell anything. It also does not require that sellers identify their gender. \u201cThis would be kind of the best example where you would think that discrimination would be at its smallest. So we can interpret these data as a lower bound of what we can expect in other environments.\u201dThe study did not paint a universally negative picture for women. For some items, like toys and pet products, women received somewhat higher prices than men. And women tended to have better reputations as sellers, although they tended to have less selling experience.Nor did the study, which controlled for seller reputation, experience, number of photos, use of bold lettering and other elements, indicate that buyers were actively or even consciously discriminating. Male and female buyers appeared to treat women sellers the same, the authors said.\u201cWe actually think that most of it is unconscious,\u201d said Tamar Kricheli-Katz, a professor of law and sociology at Tel Aviv University, who conducted the study with Tali Regev, an economist at IDC Herzliya. \u201cThe fact is that most of us have biases. We hold them unconsciously, and it makes it difficult to change.\u201dBesides analyzing actual eBay transactions, the researchers conducted an experiment to see if people could tell the gender of sellers from user profiles. People guessed correctly in 1,127 of 2,000 cases, wrong in 170 and did not know the rest.In another experiment, the researchers asked people to place value on a $100 Amazon gift card sold by someone named either Alison or Brad. On average, Alison\u2019s gift card was valued at $83.34, while Brad\u2019s was valued at $87.42.Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and expert on gender wage gaps, said the study was intriguing but needed more analysis. \u201cJust perceiving that somebody\u2019s a woman, what exactly does it mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s got to mean something about the quality of the good or service or something that\u2019s not captured in the data that they have.\u201dWithout that additional information, Dr. Goldin said her hunch is that \u201cthe majority of people would be bidding less if they thought that, \u2018This really isn\u2019t a 1948 Rolex\u2019 or \u2018This really isn\u2019t Jackie Robinson\u2019s signature.\u2019 \u201dThe researchers said eBay allowed them access to data on transactions, sellers and buyers, including gender. They evaluated transactions from 2009 to 2012, focusing on the 420 most popular items in eBay\u2019s broader categories, and on auctions because no negotiation is involved. Sellers considered to be stores were excluded.EBay did not provide financing for the study, but set conditions, according to the authors and to editors at Science Advances. The researchers\u2019 contract allowed eBay to approve any study before publication, mostly for potential disclosure of proprietary data and trade secrets; the authors said eBay \u201cended up approving the study without asking us to drop any of our results.\u201dEBay declined to discuss the specifics of the study with a reporter. In a statement, the company did not challenge the results. \u201cThis study, which was based on data from more than four years ago, was not conducted or commissioned by eBay,\u201d the statement said, adding, \u201cWe are passionate about harnessing our platform to empower millions of people by leveling the playing field for them. We do not reveal the gender of our sellers, although they can choose to do that themselves.\u201dA few female sellers said they believed some buyers reacted differently because they were women.Melanie Fodera, 21, a senior at Albion College in Michigan and a seller for about seven years, said when selling a Detroit Lions jersey for \u201c$100 or best offer,\u201d she was offered $50.\u201cI countered $75, and their message to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t know what this is worth because you\u2019re a girl,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Fodera, who usually sells women\u2019s clothes and has an eBay page decorated with roses.In the 631,516 auctions the authors analyzed, women were about 23 percent of sellers. They received, on average, 0.88 fewer bids for the same items, the authors said. New items, where researchers found the largest gender gap, accounted for 78,350 sales. The biggest advantage for male sellers occurred in categories like new video games (the gap was especially huge for Nintendo Wii).The authors analyzed the text sellers used, finding that women used slightly more positive language, saying \u201cworks great\u201d more often than \u201cnever used,\u201d for example, Dr. Regev said. But wording differences did not account for the price gap.Cecilia Ridgeway, a gender issues expert at Stanford, said when reading the study, \u201cI did not think, \u2018Oh, eBay needs to fix this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think this is a key thing we\u2019ve got to do for gender equality.\u201dStill, she said she viewed the study as an indicator of \u201cthe importance of gender as a way of making sense of any human being. That doesn\u2019t mean people endorse these beliefs; they just know them.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a study that found eBay customers tend to bid higher for items sold by men rather than women misidentified the journal that published the study.

Or maybe not \u2014 you can easily imagine the series ending with some or all of the quartet man-free, facing the future together. What we know is that through four of the season\u2019s 10 episodes, all of the women are paired off, in unions old, new, tentative or possibly illusory.True love never runs smooth on \u201cGirls,\u201d of course. Desi\u2019s narcissism is a perennially blooming impediment to Marnie\u2019s happiness, and Fran\u2019s phone holds secrets that the relentlessly nosy Hannah soon uncovers. The only seemingly trouble-free relationship is the one that doesn\u2019t involve any women: Elijah (Andrew Rannells) finds himself dating a television newsman played by Corey Stoll with his customary gimlet-eyed magnetism.Overall, though, the friends\u2019 travails are presented in a kinder and gentler manner than we\u2019re used to, and the balance has shifted away from cringey awkwardness and toward something resembling warmth. The early episodes contain what would normally be a season\u2019s worth of touching moments. Hannah fights tears as she reassures her recently out father, that she\u2019ll always be there for him. When Adam misses a chance to get close to Jessa, Mr. Driver does a funny, lovely corkscrew fall to the floor.There are even moments in the Elijah romance that border on glossy romantic-comedy sentimentality, but maybe that\u2019s on purpose. Ms. Dunham, who wrote the premiere, has Hannah proclaim that the action is \u201clike a really bad rom-com, that\u2019s, like, too obvious and not funny.\u201d You could read that as Ms. Dunham\u2019s Tourette\u2019s-like admission that the show is less angry this season, less in your face.Not that there aren\u2019t jarring, nervy scenes, like Shoshanna\u2019s visit to a Tokyo S-and-M club or an impromptu photo shoot in which Hannah poses on the Cafe Grumpy couch like a Renoir nude. Primarily, though, the season falls back on the talent of Ms. Dunham and her colleagues (including the executive producers Judd Apatow and Jenni Konner) for classic sitcom constructions and dialogue.And it demonstrates once again that Ms. Dunham\u2019s Hannah Horvath, love her or hate her, is an original comic creation, continually fighting for her right to define the world on her own terms. \u201cI worked very, very hard to overcome the challenges of my nontraditional body type and accept myself for who I am,\u201d she says, incensed by the pinup-style photos she finds on Fran\u2019s phone. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be edged out of my own life by girls who don\u2019t even have any interesting fat deposits on them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You can feel this distant person\u2019s breath (hot) and his urgency (hotter), and the sound of him is all over the place \u2014 behind you, before you, to either side of you, close and distant, shouting and whispering, sometimes in several voices at once.This man of many tongues \u2014 his name is Simon McBurney \u2014 is taking you somewhere you\u2019ve never been before. And not just into the rain forests of the Amazon, where most of the story that\u2019s being told here takes place.Yet \u201cThe Encounter\u201d never asks its audience to reach out and touch someone or something, or to walk through site-specific labyrinths, or to engage in conversation with a performer, as is often the way of interactive art these days. The experience of this production is utterly stationary. You simply sit down, don the headset that\u2019s attached to your seat, and let Mr. McBurney and his extraordinary sound designers \u2014 Gareth Fry and Pete Malkin \u2014 play with your ears.Mr. McBurney also remains himself: the actor, writer, researcher, narrator and family man who has assembled this work. He is always fully visible on the stage, which has been reimagined by the designer Michael Levine as a foam-walled broadcast studio, alone with a host of microphones. One of these, shaped like a human head, is binaural, and the source of much of the audio magic worked by Mr. McBurney. There are also many bottles of water, which will be put to inventive use.And before he delves into the central story of \u201cThe Encounter,\u201d Mr. McBurney muses on the nature of storytelling, memory, time and consciousness, as it exists both as part of, and independent of, the brain. We hear snippets of his conversations with experts on these subjects and with Mr. Popescu. We also hear the voice of Mr. McBurney\u2019s 6-year-old daughter, who regularly interrupts her dad while he is at work on this particular project.\u201cThe Encounter\u201d is meant to subvert such fictions, in part, as it reminds us of the destructive encroachments of lucre-minded Westerners into the Amazon. But on its own, much of Mr. McBurney\u2019s script still has an old-fashioned romanticism, idealizing the elemental pureness of a Rousseauvian world.The great privilege of being there, in person, to witness \u201cThe Encounter\u201d comes from seeing a performer, in the sweaty flesh, and a team of technicians working hard to put on a show that somehow transcends what they\u2019re doing in plain view. You recognize, more or less, how they\u2019re achieving the effects they achieve. You\u2019re aware, on some level, of the disjunction between what you see and what you hear.At the same you\u2019re inhabiting a zone that defies such disjunctions. Let yourself go, if you dare, and you enter a world beyond borders of regimented thoughts and senses, one in which the ear sees more than the eye.\u00ad\u201cThe Encounter\u201d continues through March 6 at the Barbican in London; barbican.org.uk.

Minorities are drastically underrepresented in acting roles. Lesbian, gay and transgender characters are almost nonexistent. This is the portrait of an \u201cepidemic of invisibility\u201d in Hollywood described by researchers in a study released on Monday of more than 400 movies and scripted television series from 2014 and 2015.\u201cThe hashtag #OscarsSoWhite should be changed to #HollywoodSoWhite,\u201d the study said, referring to the Twitter protest, \u201cas our findings show that an epidemic of invisibility runs throughout popular storytelling.\u201dThe study found that women and girls made up less than 34 percent of speaking characters in movies and scripted series. The share was worse in films: About 29 percent of the parts went to female actors.Minority groups represented a little more than 28 percent of speaking characters in films and series, about 10 percent less than their share of the general population, according to the study. Just 2 percent were identified as L.G.B.T.Women were heavily outnumbered by men behind the camera, making up about 15 percent of directors, about 29 percent of writers and about 23 percent of series creators, the study found.The researchers said they hoped to broaden the discussion about diversity in Hollywood. Stacy L. Smith, a professor at the University of Southern California and an author of the study, said the findings mapped out an ecosystem of inequality in which the Academy Awards was just one of the most visible outcomes.\u201cIt becomes really important to think about not just the awards but \u2014 from television, streaming and cinematic content \u2014 who gets opportunities onscreen and behind the camera. Who gets hired,\u201d she said.\u201cThis is providing a larger frame around the Academy Awards, and why, at the end of that whole series of decisions, we might see a very, very narrow slice of humanity getting nominated because the entire ecosystem has a problem and that\u2019s what the data speaks to.\u201dThe Annenberg researchers also, for the first time, analyzed 10 major media companies, including old-guard firms like Sony and 21st Century Fox, along with the newcomers Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, and scored them for diversity in five categories. Each one failed to meet the study\u2019s definition of \u201cinclusive.\u201dWomen represented about 20 percent of the companies\u2019 corporate boards, chief executives and executive management teams.Several of the studios, including Time Warner, which fared the worst, declined to comment on the study.Twenty-First Century Fox highlighted its efforts to deepen the diversity of the industry, pointing to its part in setting up the Fox Writers Intensive and the Fox Global Directors Initiative.The study\u2019s authors suggested that media companies grappling with diversity problems would be well advised to start behind the camera. When women are directing or creating the series, casts tend to reflect greater diversity, the study found.\u201cIf we see a tilted view of humanity onscreen, the question becomes, \u2018Who\u2019s getting opportunities behind the camera?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cAnd what we see is there is a tilted opportunity behind the camera as well.\u201dBarbara Schock, a filmmaker and chairwoman of the graduate film program at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, said the challenge of diversifying the ranks of film directors, did not trace to a lack of talented women.Media companies just need to open their eyes, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking.

But the company trails competitors. The streaming device category is dominated by smart TVs, the Roku box and Google\u2019s Chromecast, data from the research firm eMarketer shows.\u201cThere has been such a proliferation of video streaming services and hardware in the past year that the only way Apple can get a leg up in the market is to differentiate with original content,\u201d said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer.But Apple has struggled with content, while companies like Netflix and Amazon already have award-winning original shows.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services, has been trying to put together a bundle of television shows for Apple TV that would be smaller than what cable companies offer, said a person with knowledge of the plan who declined to be identified because the discussions are private. But television and cable companies have balked at a deal. Apple has also held talks with film and television executives about financing original programs to be offered exclusively through Apple TV.Creating a show with Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, would help Apple overcome some of its content difficulties. Dr. Dre joined Apple after it acquired his Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014. In addition to working with Apple Music, he produced the 2015 film \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which is based on his musical career. The television show is Dr. Dre\u2019s project and Apple is backing it, one person said.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the project, but noted that the last quarter of 2015 was the best for Apple TV sales.Apple Music recently signed its own content agreements, including a deal to stream a concert film from Taylor Swift\u2019s world tour.\u201cLike so many Apple products, Apple TV wants to be a self-sufficient ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Verna said. \u201cIf a company has to look within to find entertainment industry talent, thanks to Apple Music and the company\u2019s tremendous entertainment industry contacts, Apple is as well positioned as any company to do so.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Ben Sisario from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}

The research firm eMarketer estimated that last year about five million American households that once paid for TV no longer did, up about 10.9 percent from the previous year. The firm estimated that by 2018, one in five American households will not subscribe to cable or satellite TV.Fret not, brave cord-cutter. I tested several other options, including digital antennas and the Slingbox, a device that can connect to a friend or family member\u2019s cable box to watch the game on a streaming device. The antennas were simple to set up, and the picture quality was excellent. The Slingbox was a bit rougher to set up and will not be an ideal method for watching the Super Bowl, but is a useful device to keep in your back pocket if you are often abroad and don\u2019t want to miss out on live national sports.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.After some experimentation, I found that sticking the antenna to a wall around the corner from my television pulled the clearest signal from CBS. I got about 40 channels, including ABC, various home shopping channels and a station that plays only Korean pop music videos.Consumers will have to do their homework before buying an antenna by looking up their proximity to nearby transmitters. Antennas Direct says that with an outdoor antenna like the 2V, you\u2019ll probably get poor reception if you\u2019re more than 70 miles from transmitters. For indoors antennas like the Eclipse, 35 miles is outside the comfort zone.If you are reasonably close to TV transmitters, the benefits of an antenna make the technology a sound investment. It\u2019s cheap, for one, and when you get a clear signal, the high-definition channels can look even better than digital cable because the image you get with an antenna is raw video broadcast over the air, unlike the compressed video sent over digital cable.\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting the raw video, it might be double or triple the quality of satellite or cable,\u201d said Richard Schneider, the founder of Antennas Direct, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more detailed picture than what you\u2019d get through paid TV.\u201dAntennas and free online streaming of the Super Bowl aren\u2019t viable options for international fans, but the Slingbox is one workaround. If you have friends or family members with a cable subscription, you can hook a Slingbox up to the back of their cable box.The Slingbox pulls in whatever is playing on the cable box, and you can watch the video live on a web browser or on a device that supports the Slingplayer app, like Apple and Android mobile devices, Roku boxes, Chromecast or Amazon\u2019s Fire TV. The Slingplayer apps also have a remote control, allowing you to change the channel on the cable box.I plugged a Slingbox M2 ($200) into a cable box and had a rough time getting the remote control to work inside the Slingplayer app. Still, as long as the cable box is set to CBS, the Slingbox is an easy method for tuning in to the game from abroad.\u201cSlingbox works anywhere in the world,\u201d said Mark Vena, a Sling Media executive. \u201cYou have a right to use it wherever you are\u201d as long as you or your family members are already paying for cable, he added.Email: brian.chen@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @bxchen Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Apple Case Will Grope Its Way Into Your Future", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtFor that, here\u2019s one bet you\u2019ll never lose money on: Digital technology always grows hungrier for more personal information, and we users nearly always accede to its demands. Today\u2019s smartphones hold a lot of personal data \u2014 your correspondence, your photos, your location, your dignity. But tomorrow\u2019s devices, many of which are already around in rudimentary forms, will hold a lot more.Consider all the technologies we think we want \u2014 not just better and more useful phones, but cars that drive themselves, smart assistants you control through voice or household appliances that you can monitor and manage from afar. Many will have cameras, microphones and sensors gathering more data, and an ever more sophisticated mining effort to make sense of it all. Everyday devices will be recording and analyzing your every utterance and action.This gets to why tech companies, not to mention we users, should fear the repercussions of the Apple case. Law enforcement officials and their supporters argue that when armed with a valid court order, the cops should never be locked out of any device that might be important in an investigation.But if Apple is forced to break its own security to get inside a phone that it had promised users was inviolable, the supposed safety of the always-watching future starts to fall apart. If every device can monitor you, and if they can all be tapped by law enforcement officials under court order, can anyone ever have a truly private conversation? Are we building a world in which there\u2019s no longer any room for keeping secrets?\u201cThis case can\u2019t be a one-time deal,\u201d said Neil Richards, a professor at the Washington University School of Law. \u201cThis is about the future.\u201d\u201cIf we care about free expression, we have to care about the ways in which we come up with interesting things to say in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we are always monitored, always watched, always recorded, we\u2019re going to be much more reluctant to experiment with controversial, eccentric, weird, \u2018deviant\u2019 ideas \u2014 and most of the ideas that we care about deeply were once highly controversial.\u201dMr. Richards might sound alarmist, especially to those who believe the F.B.I.\u2019s argument that its request for Apple to hack into one phone is limited to this special circumstance.\u201cBy and large you get very little constitutional protection for data housed by third parties, and that\u2019s mostly a result of a Supreme Court case from the 1960s \u2014 before email, before search engines, before social networks,\u201d said Chris Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\u201cThe court left open the door to surveillance as long as the primary function of the device was intact,\u201d Mr. Soghoian said. \u201cSo as long as Amazon Echo can tell you what temperature it is or can still play music, that case seems to suggest that the government might be able to force Amazon to spy on you.\u201d\u201cWhat we really need for the Internet of Things to not turn into the Internet of Surveillance is a clear ruling that says that the companies we\u2019re inviting into our homes and bedrooms cannot be conscripted to turn their products into roving bugs for the F.B.I.,\u201d he said.Some readers may argue for a simpler solution to this problem: Opt out of the technologies that could be made to spy on you. Don\u2019t buy the Amazon Echo. Don\u2019t put cameras in your house. Don\u2019t use a thermostat that connects to the Internet and can monitor when you\u2019re home and when you\u2019re not.There\u2019s some merit to these arguments, but technology has a way of worming its way into our lives without many of us making a conscious choice to let it in. Smartphones and personal computers were once an indulgence; then, as more people began to use them, they became inescapable.The Internet of Things will follow a similar path. Employers and insurance companies may require you to wear health-tracking devices. It may become impossible to find cars without cameras and sensors. Every fridge will come with cameras inside whether you like it or not.\u201cFrom a historical perspective, we\u2019re entering into a very new era,\u201d said Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. Not long ago, we were living in a world in which surveillance was difficult. \u201cIn the past, you and I would have a conversation in person. No record would be made; nobody would have access to it. I wrote things on paper; I burned them in my fireplace. They were gone forever.\u201dBut in the absence of technical and legal protections, technology is upturning those presumptions.\u201cNow we have a surveillance-enabled world,\u201d Ms. Granick said. \u201cIt\u2019s cheap, and it\u2019s easy.

{"Headline": "In Ecuador, the Frugal Traveler Tries Luxury", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerI was not surprised when applause broke out as the pilot touched down at the Quito airport, high in the Ecuadorean Andes. In five and a half years as the Frugal Traveler columnist, I\u2019ve learned that cheering a safe arrival is a standard (and lovable) practice in some parts of the world.What struck me was how muffled the merriment sounded, through the curtains that separated their cramped quarters from my opulent perch in seat 1A. Apparently, those of us who can afford business class don\u2019t cheer. But why? That\u2019s the sort of mystery I hoped to solve on this journey.I had been separated from the thrifty throngs \u2014 my people \u2014 through the whim of an editor, who, for my final column, decided it would be entertaining to send me on a luxury trip. My counteroffer: I\u2019d do the first half high-end, and close with a frugal flourish.Then again, I\u2019m no absolutist. I\u2019ve been known to drop $30 on an entree in New York after a long solo trip gorging on greasy street food. I\u2019ll admit to sleeping better alone on a plushly appointed king-size bed than on an upper bunk in shared youth hostel quarters.So my trip to Ecuador would be an investigation: In what ways can spending more money make travel better? The country turned out to be an appropriate choice, one so cheap that even budget travelers can opt for moderate luxury.My arrival caused a commotion. One staff member cleared away the cones that protected the precious parking space at the front entrance. Another took my bag; a third came forth with a magenta welcome drink. It was an agua de frescos, brewed from 10 Andean herbs and flowers \u2014 \u201cWhat people offer to guests in southern Ecuador,\u201d I was told, though I wondered if tradition required forcing it on guests before they could even sit down.I was experiencing what I had only previously read about in press releases: a luxury hotel striving to introduce its guests to a stylized version of the local culture. The drink was as delicious as its rushed delivery was preposterous.Waiting for me in my elegant $370 room (taxes included) \u2014 which could be reached directly from the elegant garden via the elegant sitting room \u2014 was a hand-signed welcome note and, on the bedspread, a little hand-knit yarn blob that turned out to be a tropical fish. On the embossed business card next to it was scribbled a note: \u201cTo: Your Inner Child.\u201dPerhaps this is standard luxury treatment, but I found such coddling extraneous, even a bit creepy. The plate of fresh Ecuadorean fruits left by the window, however, was welcome. If only I had read the accompanying instructions before biting through the bitter skin of a tree tomato.I understand why business travelers might appreciate being spoon-fed local culture in the few minutes between meetings, counting on everyone to speak English, having their underwear cleaned for $3 a pair. (Ecuador operates on U.S. dollars.) I get it, I do. In fact, I sent my underwear out the next morning.But I was here to experience Ecuador, not strike a deal. So I took advantage of the hotel\u2019s splendid location and hit the streets, diving into the crowds that had come to the final day of Quito\u2019s annual Fiestas. I went over to La Ronda, Quito\u2019s famously narrow cobblestone street turned humble restaurant row, stopping for a $1.50 canelazo, an alcoholic cinnamon drink, from the wackily named Exquisitas Empanadas de Morocho del Ol\u00edmpico, where the young woman ladled it from a pot on a stove and spiked it. \u201cJust let me know if you need more alcohol,\u201d she said \u2014 not to me, but to a group of Ecuadoreans. Could she sniff the Casa Gangotena on me?After two deep-fried-before-your-eyes 75-cent empanadas, I returned to the hotel\u2019s restaurant for dinner. By all reports Cedr\u00f3n was an excellent place to blow some cash.That turned out to be half right. I ordered the meal-course-size version of locro, an Ecuadorean potato soup presented with avocado, fried corn, cheese, pork cracklings and six house-made salsas, all on the side. Swirling it all together, the soup was a circus of flavors and textures \u2014 a simple classic raised several levels. The service was perfect, if annoyingly deferential.Just one problem: It was a total bargain. The soup was $10, which included not just an amuse-bouche, bread and sparkling water, but also (gasp) tax and service. Just to run up the bill, I ordered a $9.50 dessert trio of alfajores, coconut panna cotta and a dollop of spiced ganache, then added an extra 10 percent to the service.The next afternoon, I met Juan Carlos Guerra, my $40-an-hour tour guide. (For Ecuador, that\u2019s a lot.) His English was polished, his knowledge of the city deep, his car comfortable. On the free walking tours I\u2019ve taken in other cities, I\u2019d tolerated lovable young balls of energy with well-practiced laugh lines but superficial knowledge. If they were student tour guides, Juan Carlos was a tenured professor.We covered precolonial volcano-worship, syncretic elements of the astonishing local churches, the Quito School\u2019s artistic traditions. At the old-fashioned Santa Clara Market, he plucked a yellowish ovoid fruit called a taxo off a fruit stand and cracked it open to reveal countless seeds enveloped in bright orange globules, like alien eggs. A relative of the passion fruit, but sweet rather than sour, it is my new favorite tropical treat.And he pointed out a lot that I would have missed on my own \u2014 candles made of animal fat that he used on his children as a treatment for raw noses, and boroj\u00f3, a fruit added to drinks as an aphrodisiac (\u201cIt\u2019s why there are so many children in Ecuador\u201d). As he took me by the stands selling medicinal herbs, he mentioned that the women working there perform \u201ccleansings\u201d for $5.My frugal instinct took over, though I knew a fancier $49 version could be arranged through my hotel. I was taken by a young woman named Laura to a rundown back area of the market, led into a narrow tile stall decorated with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe and told to strip to my underwear. Then she had at me, slapping my entire body, front and back, with a loose bouquet of herbs and plants, most notably stinging nettles. It felt as if I were running (almost) naked through a field of thorns.Afterward, she told Juan Carlos I had needed the cleansing. \u201cShe said she felt you were under a lot of stress,\u201d he said. Apparently, spending money makes me tense.Was a private guide worth it? Yes, especially at Ecuador prices. But the spoon-fed approach (almost literally in the case of that taxo fruit) was still bugging me. Stinging nettles notwithstanding, the day had felt distinctly adventure-free.We are all people, we are all equal,We were all made of the same materialsWhich is why material things cannot measure your worth.Upon arrival, I was sent to Zazu\u2019s bar to wait for my table, and ordered the most expensive cocktail on the menu, a $16 \u201cGal\u00e1pagos\u201d martini. As if to prove the rapper\u2019s point, the restaurant promptly forgot about me. Almost an hour later, I asked the bartender to check on my table. Though empty tables dotted the restaurant, I was seated without apology.The tasting menu was lovely \u2014 I especially enjoyed Zazu\u2019s replication of the Ecuadorean \u201chelado de paila\u201d process of making ice cream, using liquid nitrogen to whip up a passion fruit sorbet tableside, dolloping it on my lobster dish. But the service was, again, annoyingly deferential, and when you\u2019ve been made to wait alone at the bar for almost an hour, nothing tastes as good as it might otherwise.Hoping to explore the Avenue of the Volcanoes between Quito and Cuenca, I went with the ultimate luxury: hiring someone to take care of literally all my plans and be with me every step of the way.To avoid being further spoon-fed, I decided to seize control of Antonio\u2019s tour, telling him I\u2019d be willing to stop anywhere, endure discomfort, eat by the side of the road \u2014 and that we would be doing this all in Spanish. He acquiesced. (Of course, it was his job to acquiesce.)Our next two stops were impromptu and frugal-friendly. We stopped at a town called Latacunga and ducked into a hole-in-the-wall restaurant for chugchucaras, a local dish of deep-fried pork served with a number of side dishes \u2014 more culturally charming than culinarily compelling. Then we veered away from our route along the Pan-American Highway into Salcedo, famous for its ice-cream-on-a-stick, specifically a version in which four layers of ice cream form the shape of a volcano. The town\u2019s many ice cream shops were empty; Antonio explained that the new highway had decimated a longstanding pit stop tradition. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the traffic jams that formed, especially on weekends,\u201d he said.It had been a packed day, but by the time we pulled into our hotel, I was, curiously, not exhausted. I had sat in an air-conditioned S.U.V. all day and been driven around, told what to do. I had probably learned more about Ecuadorean ecosystems, volcanoes and flower production than I ever would have on my own, but the convenience had been isolating.The next day\u2019s highlight was the ultra-touristy but very impressive switchback train ride down near-vertical Nariz del Diablo mountain, the trickiest point in a route that in 1908 finally connected Quito with the Ecuadorean coast. The stop included an indigenous dance performance, narrated in English by a group member named Jos\u00e9, who told me afterward that he had toiled for nine years in London restaurants before returning to his village.Antonio was great, but the following day I was greatly relieved to board a rattling public bus and head (I hoped) to Cuenca\u2019s long-distance bus station for some real adventure. Relieved to be uncomfortable, relieved to be nervous I might be on the wrong bus.I took a bus to Saraguro, home to the indigenous people of the same name \u2014 which I had read was known for its community tourism efforts. Its square was out of a tourist brochure, full of flowers and well-tended bushes, with elegant U-shaped benches and a church on one end that filled for Mass with men and women in traditional black clothing \u2014 a contrast to more brightly colored shawls and skirts on women of other groups I had seen from Antonio\u2019s S.U.V.I had to bug the hostel staff several times about the homestay \u2014 they said the Saraur-ku director was away \u2014 but the next morning they finally collected $35 from me and sent me in a pickup truck (for $2 extra) to the village of \u00d1amar\u00edn and the Spanish-speaking home of Mar\u00eda Delfina Cartuche and Marcelo Cirilo Nastacuaz. On a slope in full view of Mount Puglia, their solid if haphazardly designed house of tile, brick and concrete block was set amid a little rural paradise. Trees bore oranges, peaches, tree tomatoes, greengage plums, avocados and figs; countless flowers bloomed and one purple-flowered quinoa plant shot straight up from the soil. Squawking hens wore peculiar outfits: white and blue plastic bags that, the family told me, prevented eagles from swooping down and carrying them away.A whole room of the house \u2014 really kind of a separate wing \u2014 had been set aside for visitors, furnished with rustic beds made by Marcelo and covered in thick, coffee-colored blankets made by Mar\u00eda with wool from sheep they kept up the hill behind the house. (Mar\u00eda also sells $10 wool hats and scarves, all colored with natural dyes.)A bit later, the family\u2019s youngest member, 6-year-old Genesis, handed me a leaf to sniff from plants she had picked from the garden. \u201cCedr\u00f3n,\u201d she said \u2014 lemon verbena, and, I recalled, the name of the restaurant at Casa Gangotena. \u201cIt\u2019s for my mother\u2019s horchata.\u201d I sampled the bright red herbal brew later that afternoon; it was warm and welcoming \u2014 and a more pleasant presentation than the agua de frescos I had shoved in my face at the Quito hotel.A smart, delightful couple, Mar\u00eda and Marcelo had met in Quito and moved back to \u00d1amar\u00edn to raise their four children. Their lifestyle was a curious kosher-Mormon-hipster amalgam: They do not drink alcohol or coffee, avoid dairy, don\u2019t touch pork or shellfish, refuse to buy commercial eggs and build their own furniture.But they lived in a truly traditional world. On a tour of the village, Mar\u00eda explained to me how the indigenous justice system \u2014 enshrined in the Ecuadorean constitution \u2014 worked. When issues came up, long meetings were held in the community center that could last into the early hours, as women hand-spun wool into yarn.She recounted how they had even brought down a cattle-rustling ring in the region, eventually punishing the accused with \u201ccleansings\u201d much harsher than the one I had had in Quito \u2014 \u201cwith a much stronger kind of nettle\u201d she said, and drenched in the freezing water from a large waterfall. \u201cIt\u2019s not torture,\u201d she responded, when I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the police that torture people, that hit people. We gave them a cleansing, a purification.\u201dShortly before I left, when I told her I was a writer and might write about them, she rushed to get a business card. Though she worked with Saraurku as well, \u00d1amar\u00edn had its own community tourism initiative. The nightly cost of staying there, with three meals included: $20. That\u2019s $15 less than if you book through Saraurku and, if you\u2019re keeping track, $340-something less than a night at Casa Gangotena.I returned to the Cuenca bus terminal by midafternoon on a Saturday, and tried to figure out how to get to my final destination, the obscure town of Quingeo.The one bus from the terminal to Quingeo that day had already left, I was told, but I could take a taxi to the bus stop \u201cacross from Colegio Garaicoa,\u201d and wait there. Sure enough, I was soon boarding a standing-room-only, music-blasting bus for the one-hour, 65-cent ride to Quingeo.I asked a man named Miguel, who got off the bus with me, lugging a sack of foodstuffs, whether anyone in town rented out rooms. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask the priest,\u201d he said. We walked a few blocks up a dirt road into a tiny town that, were it not for a few modern details (Internet cafe, pickup truck), could have existed a century in the past. Adobe buildings with beams and balconies surrounded the town square; a block beyond were hills and farmland.The priest was nowhere to be found, but Miguel brought me to a woman named Laura Reynoso, who looked as if she had walked out of a coffee-table book on Andean grandmothers. \u201cCould you find a bed for this gentleman?\u201d he asked her. She showed me to a room in one of the square\u2019s more beautiful homes, painted a mustardy yellow with a second-story balcony held up with chocolate brown wooden beams. I asked her what I could pay her. \u201cWhatever you think is right,\u201d she said. \u201cBut tomorrow.\u201dThe lone restaurant on the square, Pap\u00e1 Morales, was closed. But I managed to get invited by Ms. Reynoso to a dinner of pork ribs, rice and llapingachos, potato and cheese patties. Her son, Patricio \u2014 a schoolteacher in Cuenca during the week, owner of a small market on the square on weekends and a big Beatles fan \u2014 later invited me to sit outside with him to drink Zhumir, an Ecuadorean sugar cane spirit, and listen to Paul McCartney. Soon after, we adjourned to a wooden shack labeled BAR, run by his son, Lennon.The next morning, vendors set up a modest market around one half of the plaza; I stopped at one stall run by Pap\u00e1 Morales restaurant (which remained closed) and enjoyed a $2 bowl of encebollado, the restorative Ecuadorean fish soup. Soon, a competitive six-on-six soccer tournament started up, as it did every Sunday, run by Pap\u00e1 Morales\u2019s owner, Jorge Morales, who, as it turned out, I had met at the wooden shack the night before.He kept up a steady patter over a portable public address system as the teams, mostly from surrounding villages, played: \u201cRepresentatives of Barcelona and Real Madrid are here, looking for talent to contract, so get moving!\u201d And a bit later, when he found out I had tried his soup: \u201cSeth from New York is visiting the greatest soccer tournament in the world \u2014 he found it on the Internet and came just to try Pap\u00e1 Morales\u2019s encebollado!\u201dI had probably learned more about Ecuador with my guides, Juan Carlos and Antonio, and maybe even listening to a waiter at Cedr\u00f3n explain the origins of the six salsas on my table.But on my own in Saraguro and Quingeo, I had returned to my natural travel state, one in which challenges, discomfort and sometimes even stress had led (as it had, time and time again in the past) to adventures, new friends and the unmatched rush of feeling at home in a truly foreign place.Does that mean budget travel is inherently better than luxury travel, at least for those driven more by curiosity than a need to relax? To me, it does. But perhaps I simply never learned to travel luxuriously. Maybe, with another five and a half years of practice, I could learn how to incorporate fine dining, attentive guides and comfortable transport into a trip full of street food, local friends, serendipity and adventure.Would anyone like to fund that research? I\u2019m available.Quingeo can be reached by regular buses labeled \u201cQuingeo\u201d that stop across from Colegio Garaicoa (65 cents), above. Express Sigsig (593-7-226-6340) also has infrequent weekend buses to Quingeo from the Cuenca terminal. For lodging there, you\u2019re on your own, but it\u2019s certainly possible to go and come back on the same day. Buses leave Quingeo a block south of the town square.Seth Kugel has written the Frugal Traveler column since June 2010. This is his last column.

{"Headline": "Alphabet, Google\u2019s Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close In on Apple", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byDespite spending $3.6 billion a year on projects like self-driving cars that don\u2019t make much money, Alphabet\u2019s advertising business propelled the company to a strong last three months of 2015, outpacing expectations and sending the stock up in after-hours trading.Now, when Wall Street opens for business on Tuesday, Alphabet will most likely be worth more than Apple, which has been the most valuable company in the world for nearly four years. Apple is still generating enviable profits but is dealing with concerns that its franchise iPhone business is slowing down.If investors are sending any sort of signal to big tech companies, which have taken their lumps from shareholders this year, it is simply this: You are free to spend on side projects so long as your main business is not showing signs of weakness.\u201cThe main thing is the core business,\u201d said Josh Spencer, who manages T. Rowe Price\u2019s Global Technology Fund.Alphabet\u2019s total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014.The revenue rise was attributed to strong growth in mobile search and YouTube, which is significant because investors had long been looking for signs that the core search business was making a smooth transition from desktop computers to mobile phones, and that YouTube was becoming a driver of new growth.\u201cAbove all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google\u2019s range of businesses,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of the Google business, during the call.Net income was $4.9 billion versus $4.7 billion for the same period a year ago, beating Wall Street expectations. The company said its \u201cother bets\u201d category \u2014 the moonshots \u2014 had revenue of $448 million.Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Google\u2019s core business is performing.In fact, many Alphabet investors are hoping that merely disclosing new information will give the stock price an extra lift. In a recent report, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, called segment reporting \u201cthe most identifiable near-term catalyst in Internet land,\u201d which is to say that when companies give investors more information, it makes them more eager to buy in.The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere.Mr. Spencer, of T. Rowe Price, which holds Alphabet shares, said he had been happy with Alphabet\u2019s progress but wanted the company to give back more of its cash pile to investors.\u201cI would like to see more developments in terms of capital return, but not this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBaby steps with this company.\u201dOf course, the reality is that, in revenue terms, nothing about Alphabet\u2019s business has changed. Google began 2015 as a giant advertising company connected to a collection of intriguing science projects. Alphabet ended the year as a collection of intriguing science projects connected to a highly profitable advertising business.Advertising continues to account for the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising.This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Google\u2019s mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.\u201cFor a company of this size to continue to be able to grow at 20 percent a year \u2014 that\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities.What about those other bets, like the self-driving car? Right now they are just big losses. For investors, then, this report was less about the future than it was about reassuring them that the old Google is continuing to grow quickly, and that other products like YouTube are going to pick up the growth when search advertising starts to mature.If one of the moonshots should work out, then great. Cherry on top.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E-Commerce: Convenience Built on a Mountain of Cardboard", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byRuchit Garg, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, says that he worries that something isn\u2019t right with his Internet shopping habit. With each new delivery to his doorstep \u2014 sometimes several in a day \u2014 he faces the source of his guilt and frustration: another cardboard box.A handful of scientists and policy makers are circling the same question, grappling with the long-term environmental effect of an economy that runs increasingly on gotta-have-it-now gratification. This cycle leads consumers to expect that even their modest wants can be satisfied like urgent needs, and not always feel so great about it.The environmental cost can include the additional cardboard \u2014 35.4 million tons of containerboard were produced in 2014 in the United States, with e-commerce companies among the fastest-growing users \u2014 and the emissions from increasingly personalized freight services.Dr. Sperling said that consumers shared as much responsibility for the environmental cost of the deliveries as the companies that provided the speedy services.\u201cFrom a sustainability perspective, we\u2019re heading in the wrong direction,\u201d he said.But measuring the effect of the cardboard economy is more difficult.There are possible trade-offs, for example. As people shop more online, they might use their cars less. And delivery services have immense incentive to find the most efficient routes, keeping their fuel costs and emissions down. For its part, Amazon said that delivering to consumers straight from huge warehouses cuts down the need to distribute to thousands of stores.Ardeshi Faghri, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Delaware, said the increase of various emissions \u2014 which he estimated at 20 percent from 2001 to 2011 \u2014 \u201ccould be due to a multitude of reasons, but we think that online shopping and more delivery trucks are really one of the primary reasons.\u201d\u201cOnline shopping has not helped the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made it worse.\u201dOther scholars say that, at least for now, online shopping appears to be complementing brick-and-mortar shopping, not replacing it.Dr. Wang and other researchers say the demand for instant delivery, in particular, creates challenges for trucking companies trying to be efficient. Instead of taking big truckloads to single retailers they now make more scattershot deliveries.Many drivers deliver just one item. This is often the case for Postmates, which has a fleet of 15,000 freelance drivers signed up to make deliveries of whatever the customer orders \u2014 an Uber-like service, but for deliveries. The cost typically starts at $5, and a 9 percent service fee applied to the cost of the item. (The company says it also has about 5,000 deliverers who go on bike or foot in dense urban areas).And the push for speed from marketers gives shoppers little incentive to wait.Such is the case for Monica Rohleder, who admits to using Amazon Prime so much that \u201cmy husband jokes we keep Amazon in business.\u201dMs. Rohleder, who lives in Los Angeles and works at a public relations firm, said she liked overnight delivery, but \u201cwithin a couple of hours is best\u201d because she is busy with work and her two young children. So she often does not order something until it\u2019s urgent. \u201cThere\u2019s the immediate gratification of getting something and checking it off your list,\u201d she said.One afternoon she received six boxes, from Amazon and Nordstrom, for a Hawaii trip, including bathing suits, workout clothes and coloring books. Some of the clothes did not fit, so she returned them.She thinks more about the cardboard that comes into her house than the truck emissions, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d she added of her mass of weekly recycling.Amazon is aware of the cardboard issue. Since 2009, it has received 33 million comments, ratings and photographs about its packaging as part of its \u201cpackaging feedback program.\u201d Amazon said it used that feedback to make sure that cardboard box size was consistent with the size of the product. It also works with manufacturers to send some products without additional cardboard packaging, said Craig Berman, a company spokesman.\u201cAnd maybe not put a box inside a box inside a box,\u201d he saidAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Love\u2019 and \u2018Togetherness\u2019 Capture the Arc of the Romantic Pursuit", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byIn comedy, they say timing is everything. That goes double for romantic comedy. The genre is built on the tension between fate and circumstance: Two people are meant to be together, but the plot keeps them out of sync until divine order is restored.\u201cLove,\u201d whose first season arrives Friday, is created by Judd Apatow, bard of the pop-savvy rom-com, along with Lesley Arfin (\u201cGirls\u201d) and Paul Rust, who also co-stars. Sweet and awkward, hopeful and cringe-inducing, it slows down the arc of a single romance like a frame-by-frame replay of a car crash and asks whether that collision is a disaster or a happy accident.Mickey is a little self-centered and a lot self-destructive. Gus hides his own nice-guy toxicity under a smooth layer of victimhood. (As he puts it, \u201cSometimes, if a waiter\u2019s really bad, I\u2019ll just tip them like 30 percent, so they go like, \u2018I didn\u2019t deserve this.\u2019\u201d) They make a connection, but if they go together, it\u2019s not like a hand to a glove; more like a foot to a doormat.\u201cLove\u201d is hardly the first revisionist rom-com to hit TV. Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d embraces movie myths while dismantling them, FXX\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst\u201d explores the chemistry of self-destructiveness, Amazon\u2019s \u201cCatastrophe\u201d is a variation on the gimlet-eyed raunch of Mr. Apatow\u2019s movies.But \u201cLove\u201d is a funny, winning version of the format, and the casting is spot on. Ms. Jacobs\u2019s Mickey has a prickly melancholy, like a more naturalistic version of her Britta Perry from \u201cCommunity.\u201d Mr. Rust is well-cast to nerd-connoisseur type: He\u2019s skinny and floppy-haired, like a mop that a wizard brought to life, and carries himself like he would like to have an intense discussion of his ranked list of Coen Brothers films.The season (I\u2019ve seen all of it) brings Mickey and Gus together and apart, together and apart, until they confront the possibility that they really hooked up to satisfy a conception of themselves: he dating the erratic Mickey so he can feel more dangerous, she seeing a \u201cnice guy\u201d so she can feel she\u2019s getting her life together.It\u2019s a heavy recognition, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the end. Sometimes, \u201cLove\u201d suggests, romance doesn\u2019t need candlelight to grow so much as an honest fluorescent glare.But as the show grew, the title seemed to refer to the elusive ideal of any long-term relationship: being in the same emotional space at the same time.In the first season, Brett and Michelle knew their marriage was in trouble, but they were out of sync \u2014 she feeling overwhelmed and neglected, he, lost in a funk. It was as if he were having an affair, but with himself. (Mr. Duplass\u2019s placid manner makes him a good introvert, a personality type TV has a hard time with.) By the time Brett was ready to work on their marriage, Michelle was in a hotel room with David (John Ortiz), a single dad she developed a crush on while working on a charter-school project.\u201cTogetherness\u201d wasn\u2019t an easy series to like at first; it seemed like a show about self-involved whiners (lightened by Mr. Zissis\u2019 and Ms. Peet\u2019s sharp comic turns), but revealed itself as an empathetic story about how circumstances can turn you into a self-involved whiner.This year, \u201cTogetherness\u201d has positively bloomed. (HBO sent critics the full season.) It\u2019s sadder and funnier, welling over with feeling. It\u2019s insightful not just about marriage but friendship; as Alex lands a big movie role, Brett feels them drifting apart, too. Meanwhile, Tina is seeing an older man, who\u2019s simpatico in every way but a big one: She wants kids, and he doesn\u2019t.Like \u201cTransparent\u201d (in which the co-creator Jay Duplass appears), \u201cTogetherness\u201d has a sympathetic eye for its specific breed of Los Angeles bourgeois. Brett, a movie sound engineer, drives an electric car; like him, it\u2019s so quiet it seems to want to efface its existence, and it\u2019s continually threatening to run out of charge.The cast is uniformly strong, but Ms. Lynskey is just staggering. She lets you inside Michelle\u2019s frustration \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t even know how we lost each other,\u201d she says \u2014 and makes the story feel personal, like you\u2019re watching friends go through a rough patch and know them both too well to take sides.For all that, \u201cTogetherness\u201d is no downer. Like \u201cThirtysomething\u201d or \u201cParenthood,\u201d it knows when to leaven its heart-heaviness. (A running story line in which Alex and Brett plan a puppet-theater production of \u201cDune\u201d is a font of great sight gags.)It\u2019s not necessarily the stuff of a mass hit, even by HBO standards, and the season ends on what, if necessary, could be a satisfying, cathartic series finale. Love, \u201cTogetherness\u201d suggests, is not about being constantly together. It\u2019s about having bonds that stretch as you inevitably drift apart, and faith that they might eventually snap back.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bolivian Town Drifts From President Evo Morales, Despite Promises Kept to Left", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosCOBIJA, Bolivia \u2014 When Evo Morales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, took office a decade ago, he vowed to put this impoverished town in the Amazon Basin on the kind of pedestal often reserved for a capital city.He filled its coffers with profits from the country\u2019s natural gas industry. He even seized large estates and handed them to new arrivals like Tania Chao, 19, whose family received a house when it came to Cobija with nowhere to live.Yet when Mr. Morales asked Ms. Chao to vote for him last week, in a referendum to let him run for a fourth term, she did not feel that she could return the favor. The president had improved the town, she said, but he had been in office for longer than most people had lived in Cobija.Latin American leftists like Mr. Morales have suddenly felt their longevity ebb as a tide rises against them.But is the wave of discontent a rejection of the left? Or is it something more personal, aimed at the outsize leaders themselves, not necessarily at the ideas they have promoted?Much as President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the United States and Britain down a more conservative path, leaders like Mr. Morales made a commitment to diminishing inequality that is expected to remain even as governments come and go.\u201cNo leader in Latin America today can afford not to focus on inequality and go back to the neoliberal formulas of the 1990s,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy institute in Washington. \u201cWhatever criticism you might have of the leaders of the left, they put their finger on the legitimate grievance of Latin Americans: that they had been excluded from the political system.\u201dFor some of the opponents now taking power, the question is not about razing the leftist models, but about making repairs and adjustments to them. Then came the perfect storm when oil prices sank last year, creating triple-digit inflation and food shortages. In parliamentary elections, leftists were wiped out after 16 years of control. The opposition rose by criticizing government subsidies, but its plan focuses on cutting them for the wealthy and stabilizing them for the poor. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, agreed to raise the price of gasoline, reducing a subsidy seen as benefiting the car-owning wealthy. No one has suggested making changes that could harm the poor.Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, has enacted sweeping changes that have shifted the country to the center-right, including shrinking the state payroll and reducing electricity subsidies.But Mr. Macri has maintained price control strategies intended to shield people from inflation. He also extended a child benefit program that was the cornerstone of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s social policy.\u201cMacri, as well as the rest of Latin America, now understands that it\u2019s necessary to maintain and improve the social agenda,\u201d said Alejandro Grisanti, a former Latin America economist at Barclays Capital.Here in Bolivia, many point out that while Mr. Morales was blocked from running in the next election, no successor could undo his work in Cobija.This small Amazonian rubber port became a laboratory for Mr. Morales\u2019s project to bring the government to the country\u2019s poor periphery. The portion of Cobija\u2019s annual municipal budget from national gas taxes increased to $40 million today from $1.2 million in 2006, the year Mr. Morales took office, and helped underwrite a public university and a large solar plant in a place where there had been cows, jungle and dirt roads.\u201cI don\u2019t know why other governments never sent any resources here before,\u201d says Luis Adolfo Flores, the governor of Pando, the state that includes Cobija, and a member of Mr. Morales\u2019s Movement Toward Socialism party.Twenty years ago, Alipio Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, 74, lived in an isolated patch of jungle next to a river. Now he has hundreds of new neighbors and an asphalt road with a median in front of his house.He also receives pension under a program established by Mr. Morales.

Only half of the first story was built, and vines are growing on the exposed rebar.On Thursday, protesters here blocked a road, demanding that the city provide water, gas and electricity to a neighborhood they had created after seizing land. Mr. Morales once supported such takeovers but had not supported these people, and they wanted to know why.\u201cWe are in the middle of a city, and we have no lights,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Estera, a 61-year-old teacher.Finally an organizer said the government had relented and would begin installing electricity.\u201cWe will have lights by 6 p.m. tomorrow,\u201d he said to cheers.The protest broke up.\u201cWe have learned from Evo how to do this, and we can use it against them,\u201d one of the demonstrators said. \u201cWhen he was a peasant, this was the strategy that he used.\u201dMaria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela, Jonathan Gilbert from Buenos Aires, and Wilsson Asturizaga from Cobija.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Steve Burke, Old-Media NBCUniversal Shows Off Some New Tricks", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut Comcast startled investors and analysts on Wednesday with earnings that suggested there was still growth potential in old media. Not only did the cable giant stem the tide of so-called cord cutters by adding video subscribers, but results from NBCUniversal were every bit as dazzling as the latest financials from Amazon or Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Universal theme park revenue jumped 39 percent for the quarter and the movie business rose 26 percent. Over all, NBCUniversal revenue rose more than 13 percent. Comcast doesn\u2019t break out earnings for NBCUniversal, but operating cash flow rose 8.7 percent.Since 2009, when Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal from its former parent General Electric (an acquisition completed five years ago), NBCUniversal\u2019s cash flow has doubled. The NBC television network, which had been in fourth place for so long (seven years) that many doubted it could be resurrected, is the leading network for the coveted 18-to-49 age group, powered by high ratings for \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Strong franchises \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d and \u201cToday\u201d have recouped the top spots in the ratings that had been threatened by scandal (Brian Williams at \u201cNightly News\u201d) and a tearful on-air departure (Ann Curry at \u201cToday\u201d).I sat down this week with Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, in his spacious, light-filled office at NBCUniversal\u2019s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Despite the pressures of running a media giant with $28.5 billion in revenue, he looks younger than his age of 57 years. In our conversation, one thing stood out about NBCUniversal, which is true of all old-media companies: It\u2019s all about the people. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s about talent. If you get that wrong, the whole enterprise goes bad very quickly.\u201dMr. Burke grew up in broadcast television \u2014 his father, Dan Burke, was a former president of CapCities ABC, and Steve Burke worked at Disney under the former chief executive Michael Eisner and then at Comcast, where he was president of the cable division, under the chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts.Today much of Mr. Burke\u2019s time seems to be spent courting, coaxing, stroking, cajoling \u2014 and in some cases ejecting \u2014 high-paid, high-profile stars and executives, many with outsize egos. In 2011, Mr. Burke had to replace the prominent NBC Sports head, Dick Ebersol, just four weeks before the rights to the Sochi Olympics were auctioned.Last year, when the NBC Nightly news anchor, Brian Williams, acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in Iraq, Mr. Burke had to put their close friendship aside and deliver an in-person ultimatum to take a six-month leave without pay. (\u201cAgonizing,\u201d Mr. Burke told me.)He flew to California and spent a weekend with Jay Leno to negotiate the delicate transition to Jimmy Fallon as host of the \u201cTonight\u201d show a year before Mr. Leno\u2019s contract was set to expire.Still, dealing with stars like Mr. Leno and Mr. Fallon can\u2019t be delegated. It was Mr. Burke who coaxed Steven Spielberg back to his production roots at Universal Studios. And some deals \u2014 NBC\u2019s multibillion-dollar, nine-year extension of \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d for example \u2014 are so big they require the presence of Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burke\u2019s boss.While Mr. Burke comes across as genial and low-key, he\u2019s a demanding boss. Of the 16 NBCUniversal executives Mr. Burke inherited from G.E., only four remain.Early in his tenure, he summoned the top 200 managers to Orlando and told them they had to do better. \u201cI had to be stern,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cPeople thought everything was fine. It wasn\u2019t. I had to paint reality. I ranked our top 10 businesses based on operating cash flow. Eight of the 10 were in the third quartile,\u201d meaning they woefully lagged their competitors. He charged them to act like owners, not renters \u2014 which means to invest for the long term, to take responsibility and to fix problems themselves \u2014 a mantra now printed on the back of every NBCUniversal business card. It\u2019s also one emphasized by Warren E. Buffett to the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr. Burke serves on the board. (Disclosure: I\u2019m a weekly contributor to CNBC, the NBCUniversal-owned business channel.)Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks & Resorts, has been at Universal for 46 years. \u201cThe previous mentality was, How can we take cash out of the business?\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cComcast encouraged, even mandated, reinvestment. We\u2019ve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers. Steve and Brian have said, \u2018Keep reinvesting.\u2019 The returns are stellar.\u201dUniversal recently acquired 51 percent ownership of Universal Studios Japan, is opening another Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood and is building a new park in Beijing.With NBCUniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders, Mr. Burke has been able to turn his attention to the digital revolution. He said he was looking to hire digital talent, had personally interviewed 25 people in the last month and would probably establish an NBCUniversal digital headquarters in Santa Monica, also known as Silicon Beach. The company has taken $200 million stakes in the digital media companies BuzzFeed and Vox Media, and has started Seeso, a digital comedy channel.\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cBig media made the transition from broadcast to cable. But we were still dealing with channels. Now we have to move to digital. Digital is different. The DNA doesn\u2019t already reside in the company.\u201dInvestors have already declared a winner in this emerging showdown: Comcast stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18; Netflix\u2019s is 324 and Amazon\u2019s is 425, meaning that investors are anticipating much higher growth at those companies.Still, as old and new media converge, and talent increasingly rivals engineering prowess in importance, it may be worth asking how much old-media DNA resides in digital media giants like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet. Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Bezos and Larry Page, their respective chief executives, aren\u2019t primarily known for their people skills, let alone the ability to cultivate Hollywood celebrities and TV stars.Mr. Burke typically shuns the spotlight, and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains NBCUniversal\u2019s recent success and momentum. He said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclical.Still, it\u2019s obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal. \u201cI\u2019m a product of my dad\u2019s influence at CapCities ABC, my time at Disney, and then at Comcast,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cI developed all these theories about how to run a big media company and I finally got an opportunity to try them.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated Mr. Burke\u2019s title at Comcast. He is senior executive vice president, not president.Advertisement"}

Now it wants to do the same thing with the world\u2019s wireless communications technology.On Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, the company planned to announce the Telecom Infra Project, an organization of Facebook and several telecommunications service providers and gear makers that will collaborate on making new technologies, particularly around access to and transmission and management of high-speed wireless data.In addition to Facebook, members of the Infra Project include Intel, Nokia, Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom. Each has its own reasons to work on the project, but in general the carriers are looking for cheaper equipment that can be easily programmed and deployed, while Intel and Nokia are looking to add sales.Facebook \u201cis trying to deliver immersive applications, like video, live-streaming and virtual reality,\u201d Mr. Parikh said. \u201cIt will help us build services we want that are globally accessible.\u201dThere are reasons to see how the project can work. Facebook introduced the Open Compute Project, dedicated to open sourcing hardware and software for data centers, in 2011, and has built out a network of big computing systems that rivals proprietary efforts by Google and Amazon in less time and probably at a lower cost. Facebook claims it saved $2 billion in three years of deployment because of Open Compute.Part of Facebook\u2019s goal is to deliver 5G experiences in the developing world as well as in rich countries. To that end, the move shows that the company is committed to building out its user base and service offerings in every country.The program, called Free Basics, promised a text-only version of Facebook, along with certain news, health, job and other sites. It is offered in 38 countries. By pursuing cheaper connectivity with the Infra Project, Facebook appears to be seeking other ways to grow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Free Tools to Keep Those Creepy Online Ads From Watching You", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byTech FixSAY you\u2019re doing a web search on something like the flu. The next thing you know, an ad for a flu remedy pops up on your web browser, or your video streaming service starts playing a commercial for Tylenol.The content of those ads is no coincidence. Digital ads are able to follow people around the Internet because advertisers often place invisible trackers on the websites you visit. Their goal is to collect details on everywhere you go on the Internet and use that data to serve targeted ads to your computer, smartphone and connected television.This global commercial surveillance of consumers is poised to become more extensive as tech companies expand into the Internet of Things, a category that includes wearable computers and connected home appliances like smart thermostats and refrigerators. Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google can already follow users from device to device because people log in to their services with the same IDs on various gadgets.\u201cOur privacy is completely under assault with all these connected devices,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the founder of WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.Here\u2019s how web tracking works: In general, targeting individuals with digital ads involves a sophisticated ecosystem of third parties \u2014 like online advertising networks, data brokers and analytics companies \u2014 that compile information on consumers.When you visit websites, these companies typically pick out your browser or phone using technologies like cookies, which contain unique alphanumeric identification tags that can enable trackers to identify your activities as you move from site to site. To sell ads delivered to certain categories of consumers, like suburban singles looking for romance, companies may sync these ID tags to pinpoint individuals.The downside is, your browsing history may contain sensitive information about your health concerns, political affiliations, family problems, religious beliefs or sexual habits.The tracker busters generally work in similar ways. You download and install an add-on for a web browser like Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The anti-tracking companies each compile a list of known web domains that serve trackers or show patterns of tracking services. Then when someone connects to a website, the tools prevent the browser from loading any element that matches their blacklist.Scott Meyer, the chief executive of Ghostery, said this had been a deliberate design choice. When trackers are blocked, parts of websites may not function, so it is less confusing to let users experiment and decide which ones to block on their own, he said.\u201cWe block nothing by default,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s in direct contrast to other companies who are saying, \u2018We\u2019re turning everything off and let you turn whatever you want back on.\u2019 That\u2019s way too complex for users.\u201d\u201cWhen you go home, you lock the door and you may pull down the shades at night,\u201d said Abhay Edlabadkar, the chief executive of RedMorph. \u201cYou should have the same level of privacy control over your Internet activities.\u201dIn our tests, RedMorph was the most thorough with blocking trackers. It blocked 22 of them on USAToday.com, whereas Privacy Badger blocked seven, Disconnect blocked eight and Ghostery detected eight.But in the process, RedMorph caused the most collateral damage. It blocked some videos on the websites for CNN, USA Today, Bleacher Report, The New York Times and The Daily News. It also broke the recommended reading list on Business Insider and a Twitter box on BuzzFeed. For people who run into issues loading websites, the company offers an \u201cEasy Fix\u201d button to stop blocking a website\u2019s trackers, but that\u2019s hardly an ideal solution when it causes so many websites to malfunction. Mr. Edlabadkar of RedMorph said the tool was blocking some videos or recommended reading lists because they were loading only after a tracker had been loaded first.\u201cWe really focus on privacy rather than blocking ads that are done in a respectful way,\u201d said Casey Oppenheim, the chief executive of Disconnect. \u201cIt\u2019s important we have the ability for publishers to survive and make money. I think there\u2019s a middle ground.\u201dIn the end, we picked Disconnect as our favorite tool because it was the easiest to understand. It organizes the types of tracking requests it is blocking into different categories: advertising, analytics, social media and content.Mr. Grossman of WhiteHat Security also tested tracking blockers and chose Disconnect for similar reasons. He breaks his online activities into two separate web browsers to make himself more difficult to track: On one browser, he does everyday tasks like reading news articles; on the other browser he logs into accounts that are linked to his personal identity, like online banking sites and Amazon.\u201cWe\u2019re talking megabillion-dollar industries totally designed to track you online,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "ESPN Blesses New Lineup From Verizon", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byESPN, which sued Verizon last year after being excluded from a new basic-cable package, voiced its pleasure over changes announced Friday to the channel lineup.Verizon\u2019s FiOS Custom TV service shifted some channels that are basic-cable mainstays \u2014 such as ESPN, Lifetime, TBS and USA Network \u2014 to category-specific tiers like lifestyle, entertainment, news and sports.At the time, ESPN called the creation of Custom TV a \u201cunilateral decision\u201d and said Verizon had breached its contract with the Walt Disney Company, which owns the sports television giant.The revamped Custom TV now offers two plans: Essentials, which has no sports channels, and Sports & More, which includes ESPN, ESPN2 and Fox Sports 1, as well as TNT, Cartoon Network and CNBC.In a statement, ESPN said, \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes that Verizon has made to Custom TV.\u201d It added that it expected subscribers to enjoy \u201cESPN and ESPN2 as part of the new entry-level Custom TV offering.\u201dA Verizon spokesman said the changes had not been made to settle the lawsuit ESPN filed in State Supreme Court in New York, but to adapt to its customers\u2019 buying patterns.Still, Verizon\u2019s chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, said Verizon was planning to \u201crefresh\u201d Custom TV \u201cin the short term to be in compliance with our contractual relationships.\u201dESPN would not say if it would drop the lawsuit now that Verizon has apparently complied with its complaint. The lawsuit had not gone very far.Custom TV is considered a \u201cskinny bundle,\u201d a trimmer version of more robust and expensive cable subscriptions that have led consumers to cut the cord to their pay-TV providers and pursue Internet options like Netflix and Amazon. By keeping ESPN out of its original Custom TV offering, Verizon was cutting out cable\u2019s most expensive network.Despite its cost, ESPN is nonetheless included in Sling TV, another skinny bundle that was created by Dish Network and costs $20 a month for 23 channels. ESPN2 is also part of Sling, as are other Disney channels like Freeform.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nahnatchka Khan on \u2018Fresh Off the Boat,\u2019 Chinese New Year and Michael Chang", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byAsk a ShowrunnerQ. Why did you initially want to tell Eddie Huang\u2019s story? Why did you decide to do a Chinese New Year\u2019s episode?When we got the Season 2 order, it initially was for 13 episodes. We didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d get a full order, with the back nine. We knew Episode 13 was going to end up around Chinese New Year, so we\u2019ve always had that earmarked. Even if we don\u2019t do any more, we definitely want to hit that, because it\u2019s such an important holiday for so many people. The fact that it hasn\u2019t been represented at all makes it such a great opportunity for our show. Hopefully, this will become part of our show\u2019s canon; every year, we\u2019ll do our Chinese New Year episode.How familiar were you with the holiday\u2019s traditions?The writer of the episode, Sheng Wang, is Taiwanese-American, and he grew up in Houston around the same time that the show is set, so a lot of his experiences were like this. We have Korean writers, Chinese writers, Indian writers, and I\u2019m Persian. Some of us would go to school and explain about our New Year\u2019s and get made fun of by our classmates. \u201cWhat are you talking about? New Year\u2019s is in January.\u201d It was unexpectedly emotional for people to talk about that. Hopefully, after this episode airs, more kids on the playground will know what this is. That\u2019s kind of a cool thing.I feel really satisfied that so many people can relate to it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop feeling like somewhat of an outsider, because my experience is not the majority\u2019s. Being a woman, Persian and gay, I become more and more of an outsider with every click of the microscope. But what\u2019s fun for me is to take the way I\u2019ve seen the world and have it inform the way I write the characters. It feels different to me than maybe the way a white guy experiences the world through his prism.Because of successes like \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d \u201cDr. Ken, \u201cMaster of None\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d there will be more shows like these, and then you can get more nuanced with what you talk about. As far as dealing in stereotypes, you can\u2019t control viewers or know what their inner thoughts or beliefs are, but we are always telling stories from the inside out. The family is not the butt of the jokes. They\u2019re not the ones in the fishbowl being pointed at. We see the world through their eyes. They control the narrative. That is kind of revolutionary.Randall Park is one of the funniest comedic actors working today, regardless of race. I obsessively watched \u201cVeep\u201d for his performance. Randall understands this character, and he knows how to be funny, emotional and real, and how to carry story weight. He\u2019s like a utility knife. He can bring it all. I\u2019m so grateful and lucky that he\u2019s part of this show because of his skills.Constance Wu is such a powerhouse, yet she hadn\u2019t done much comedy before you cast her. Did you see this kind of potential in her?I remember seeing her picture, and she looked so young. She\u2019s got to be the mother of three boys, and I thought, \u201cI\u2019m never going to buy it.\u201d She came in, and from the first second she opened her mouth as Jessica, she nailed it. She inhabited that character. The choices she makes are so unusual, and she elevates everything. She makes it so much funnier than you thought it ever could be.Luckily, we have a lot of Chinese-Americans on staff, from executive producers to writers to cast members. We always try to make sure the show has an authenticity and a specificity, because we want it to feel like these are real people. This is just one family. They\u2019re not going to represent everyone\u2019s experience ever, but we really spend time making sure we get these characters correct.Oh, no, I love the song! It makes me so happy. It doesn\u2019t sound like any other theme song on TV. Some people said, \u201cIt\u2019s a little loud,\u201d and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right.\u201d We have to announce ourselves. We need to make a little noise.Absolutely. I love that show so much. We\u2019re talking about possibly doing some sort of Christmas special. There\u2019s been a lot of interest in it. We felt like we didn\u2019t have enough time with that show. We only got to do 26 episodes, and there are so many more stories we want to tell. I\u2019d love to do it.Always try to stay yourself. When you start out as a TV writer, you get a lot of pressure from outside forces to fit into what they think people want. Writing in another person\u2019s voice is a skill you have to develop when you\u2019re working on someone else\u2019s show. But if you can maintain your perspective, that\u2019s what will make you stand out. And as you move up, that will serve you more and more.What kept you going early on?Just paying the bills. I never had a backup plan. I\u2019ve only been good at one thing. I admire people who are jacks-of-all-trades. That\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve always been passionate about movies, TV and writing, and I\u2019ve been working so hard at it for so long. There were lots of setbacks, but I loved it so much, there was no alternative. I just picked myself up and kept going.Advertisement"}

They include Manaus, the sprawling and isolated gateway to the Amazon, where canals laden with garbage and sewage were evident in places during the 2014 men\u2019s World Cup.Soccer also helps illustrate the conflicted and awkward position in which female athletes can be placed as they consider whether to travel to Brazil and risk possible complications with pregnancy that may be caused by the virus, which is mosquito-borne.History suggests that moving, postponing or canceling the Rio Games is unlikely at the moment. Still, the International Olympic Committee, the United States Olympic Committee and U.S. Soccer, along with other sports federations, have reacted in an unhurried way that critics have viewed as tone deaf.No officials have spoken with particular forcefulness to reassure women that the health risk will be minimized and that they will not be forced to choose between sport and reproductive health.For months, the I.O.C.\u2019s level of concern for the well-being of athletes in Rio has been widely criticized, given the highly contaminated water at venues for rowing, canoeing, sailing and distance swimming events.

The official said that if any player declined to play in the Olympics because of concerns over the Zika virus, she would not be blackballed from future inclusion.\u201cCan you imagine the backlash if a player was cut because she was asking her federation to find out more about this?\u201d said Julie Foudy, a retired captain of the American team.Even so, players may be reluctant to speak up, in fear of losing their spot in the lineup, just as players in various sports are often afraid to admit to concussions, Lapchick said.Some women may worry about \u201chaving the coach look back and wonder if they\u2019re really committed,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf they spoke up as a team, obviously they\u2019d be in a more powerful position.\u201dThomas Bach, the president of the I.O.C., told reporters this week that he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that athletes and spectators would be safe in Rio. He noted that there was no travel ban to Brazil and that the Games would take place in the normally cooler, drier conditions in the Southern Hemisphere winter.That is true, but it rained sufficiently at the Pan American Games in Rio in July 2007 to wash out the bronze medal game in baseball. Impeccable weather is not a guarantee.Two players from the World Cup team, Sydney Leroux and Amy Rodriguez, are pregnant and will miss the Olympics, but those decisions had nothing to do with the Zika virus, team officials said.Referring to concerns about smog ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and terrorism before the 2012 London Olympics, the star midfielder Carli Lloyd told the Dallas newspaper, \u201cEvery time we get there, it\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201dUltimately, the decision about whether to play in Rio should rest with the players, Foudy and others said. They have trained for years for these Games, and some may have no desire to bear children. Still, Foudy added, it was up to the soccer federation to \u201cdo a better job\u201d of educating the players about the Zika virus.\u201cYou want every federation to at least educate and have that conversation and have a plan in place,\u201d Foudy said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hou Hsiao-Hsien Fuses the Formal and the Bloody", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byOn DVDShot on 35-millimeter by Mr. Hou\u2019s regular cinematographer, Mark Lee Ping Bin, in Mongolia and Hubei, a scenic province in China, \u201cThe Assassin\u201d is extraordinarily beautiful. The film\u2019s editing and narrative construction are, however, no less remarkable. For all its exquisitely furnished interiors and fantastic landscapes, \u201cThe Assassin\u201d is far too eccentric to ever seem picturesque. Nor does it unfold like a typical wuxia. Mayhem is abrupt, brief and fragmentary \u2014 predicated on suave jump-cuts and largely devoid of special effects.Adapted from a Tang dynasty story that Mr. Hou read in his youth, \u201cThe Assassin\u201d is set toward the end of the first millennium and concerns a young woman Nie Yinniang (Mr. Hou\u2019s frequent muse, Shu Qi) taken from her home in the province of Weibo and trained by the so-called Princess Nun to exact bloody vengeance on corrupt government officials. One designated victim is the Weibo governor, Lord Tian (Chen Chang, who played opposite Ms. Shu in Mr. Hou\u2019s experiment in multi-temporal romance, \u201cThree Times,\u201d released in the United States in 2006).Yinniang\u2019s mission is emotionally complicated in that Tian is her cousin, to whom she was once betrothed. As in a Freudian ghost story, Yinniang is the return of the repressed. Her silent presence, half-hidden behind flickering candles or silk curtains wafting in the breeze, gives the movie a ritual quality. Tall and sepulchral, she repeatedly materializes as a beautiful apparition \u2014 stoically observing the action but only sometimes intervening. When she does, her efficiency is uncanny.Mr. Hou\u2019s first feature since \u201cFlight of the Red Balloon\u201d (2007), his enigmatic gloss on \u201cThe Red Balloon,\u201d a beloved French film for children, \u201cThe Assassin\u201d required extensive research and a long period of production. Steeped in period detail, it is opaque yet lucid. Seldom has a movie been so easy to watch and so difficult to follow (at least on first viewing). The disconnect is part of the fascination. Writing in Sight and Sound, the British critic Tony Rayns noted that Mr. Hou\u2019s movie presents \u201cthe ancient past as a world that we can observe but never fully comprehend.\u201dThe same might be said of Mr. Hou\u2019s formal strategy, based on the use of controlled improvisation staged amid a rigorously worked-out, museum-quality mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. After the press screening at the 2015 New York Film Festival, Mr. Hou explained through an interpreter that in his desire for realism, he preferred to shoot without rehearsing his actors, while giving the director of photography carte blanche in framing the action.The artist\u2019s method is as mysterious as his material is familiar \u2014 another word for it might be \u201cgenius.\u201dDeveloping a theory of the media in 1970, the German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger wondered why, even though tape recorders and movie cameras were owned by ordinary wage earners, these tools did not turn up in factories, schools and \u201ceverywhere there is social conflict.\u201d They do now, largely in the form of smartphones \u2014 with sometimes enormous consequences. The real question may be why professional filmmakers have been so slow to deploy the technology.They also provide new paradigms for making movies. (The two Blu-rays include production documentaries among their extras.) \u201cAmy\u201d successfully effaces the distinction between onstage and off; \u201cTangerine\u201d is a highly performative movie that achieves a documentary spontaneity and, given its self-invented principals, feels as if it could have been generated by its cast. Mr. Baker stages one confrontation after another on the streets of Los Angeles as the transgender hustler Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) spends Christmas Eve tracking down her unfaithful boyfriend and pimp (James Ransone, featured in Mr. Baker\u2019s previous movie, \u201cStarlet\u201d).\u201cAmy\u201d has one Oscar nomination, for best documentary. \u201cTangerine\u201d has none. Either would have shaken things up with a nomination for cinematography, visual effects or production design, not to mention makeup and hairstyling. Mr. Baker\u2019s two transgender stars, Ms. Rodriguez and Mya Taylor, who plays her best friend \u2014 \u201cboth fluid, forceful screen presences,\u201d as Ms. Dargis noted in her review \u2014 deserve recognition as well.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A. O. Scott\u2019s \u2018Better Living Through Criticism\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Was God the first critic?We tend, of course, to think of him as the first great artist \u2014 or, perhaps, artiste. Certainly the Bible\u2019s description of the circumstances in which Creation was created \u2014 the sudden flash of inspiration, the heroic decision to make something where there had been nothing, the struggle to wrest order out of chaos, the collapse into exhausted rest after a daemonic outpouring of energy \u2014 has colored our romantic notions about creativity and creators ever since. Just as it has, by implication, informed our ideas about critics: as parasites on the body of creativity, as destroyers rather than builders, \u201cthe snake in the garden,\u201d as one eminent practitioner of the art of criticism has put it, \u201cof what should be our simplest pleasures.\u201dAnd yet, as A. O. Scott \u2014 the critic in question \u2014 points out in the first chapter of his lively, often impassioned, occasionally breezy defense of a profession that many see as headed to extinction, the Almighty had barely finished creating when he started in on the activity that is central to criticism, which is judgment. (Scott likes to quote the Greeks, from the poet Hesiod to Plato to Aristotle, but omits to mention their most salient contribution to his subject, which is the word \u201ccritic\u201d itself, derived from the verb \u201cto judge.\u201d) The author reminds us that following each stage of creation, God \u201csaw that it was good.\u201d The question that Scott, a chief movie critic for The New York Times, slyly raises is, \u201cHow did he know?\u201dThat question, in turn, raises still others: What do we mean when we talk about \u201cgood\u201d art? Are there transcendent, objective criteria for evaluating creative works, or are they all subjective and culturally specific? Is criticism merely ancillary to art or its equal? Does it matter when critics are wrong? And who, anyway, gets to pronounce on what\u2019s good and bad? The latter, in particular, has been the object of highly contentious discussion since the advent of the Internet, which, for the first time in the roughly two centuries since criticism became a discrete journalistic enterprise, has allowed nonprofessionals to publish their own reviews, blurring the line between public and private utterance and thereby raising still further questions about authority, \u00adexpertise and professionalism.Scott teases out some answers in a series of six chapters, each addressing one of his core questions: \u201cThe Critic as Artist and Vice Versa,\u201d \u201cHow to Be Wrong,\u201d etc.; these are interwoven with more informal sections that take the amusing form of interviews with himself. In his more relaxed mode, the writer can (to his great credit) turn a withering critical eye on his own enthusiasms \u2014 in his youth, it was \u201ccollege radio, literary snobbery, the conspiracy of the high and the low against the middlebrow\u201d \u2014 reminding you that, as independent as we like to think our taste is, we are all the products of specific cultural moments. The chapters range \u2014 occasionally skate \u2014 over the history of critical thought, from the Hesiod (for whom, as Scott puts it, \u201ceverything already sucked\u201d: an early example of cultural doomsaying) to H.\u2009L. Mencken; from the Roman poet Horace\u2019s \u201cArs Poetica,\u201d the source of the famous advice to begin a story \u201cin medias res,\u201d to Twitter flameouts. \u201cBetter Living Through Criticism\u201d begins, indeed, with a funny example of the latter: In response to the author\u2019s 2012 review of \u201cThe Avengers: The Age of Ultron,\u201d Samuel L. Jackson, one of the movie\u2019s stars, responded by tweeting \u201cAOScott needs a new job! .\u2008.\u2008. One he can actually do!\u201dBut what exactly is that \u201cjob\u201d? Scott\u2019s survey leads him to a conclusion with which, you suspect, most authors, filmmakers, painters and poets who have ever received a stinging review are likely to disagree: that criticism, rather than being a lesser sibling of Art, is its equal \u2014 codependent and symbiotically related to the creative arts, each unthinkable without the other. \u201cCriticism, far from sapping the vitality of art, is instead what supplies its lifeblood, .\u2008.\u2008. not an enemy from which art must be defended, but rather another name \u2014 the proper name \u2014 for the defense of art itself.\u201d An ingenious element of Scott\u2019s argument is that art, like criticism, is more reactive \u2014 more \u201ccritical\u201d \u2014 than many who idolize \u201ccreativity\u201d would acknowledge: Manet is \u201cconducting a passionate argument with Titian and Vel\u00e1zquez,\u201d \u201cLes Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon\u201d is a dialogue with African masks and statuary. Both art and criticism originate in \u201cthe urge to master and add something to reality\u201d; both are characterized by a \u201ctransformation of awe into understanding.\u201dAn excellent proof of this thesis is Scott\u2019s own criticism. There are striking passages here devoted to vivid and penetrating readings of individual works of literature and art that, the author suggests, are models for how we might react to beauty. A fine-grained analysis of Rainer Maria Rilke\u2019s lyric poem \u201cArchaic Torso of Apollo,\u201d in which a headless Greek statue inspires the kind of \u201ccognitive and erotic frenzy\u201d that lies at the heart of aesthetic response, made me wish that Scott, who used to review books for Newsday and The New York Review of Books, could take more time off from blockbusters to write about literature (something he now does \u201cnot as much as I used to,\u201d he rather wistfully remarks at one point). Equally incisive is his critique of Marina Abramovic\u2019s 2010 performance piece \u201cThe Artist Is Present\u201d at the Museum of Modern Art, in which museumgoers were invited to sit across from the artist and stare at her (and be stared at in return). That work, as Scott points out in a terrific chapter called \u201cThe Eye of the Beholder,\u201d has more in common with the German poet\u2019s reverie on an eyeless statue than you might at first think, suggestively destabilizing, as it does, the boundaries between aestheticizing subject and the aesthetic object.These acute exegeses stand in reproachful contrast to the occasionally lumpy quality of the book\u2019s capsule surveys of intellectual history; like many a survey course, this one can feel at once cursory and undigested. It\u2019s odd to whiz through the Wikipedia-like summaries of, say, the 17th century in France (\u201cornate gardens and graceful fountains decorated the grounds of grand, symmetrical palaces\u201d), only to come across unexplained references to the categorical imperative, a key element in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, the great 18th-century theorist of aesthetics. (At one point Scott refers breathlessly to Kant\u2019s \u201cunparalleled career,\u201d a sign, perhaps, that he has seen too many movie trailers.) The least persuasive parts of this book are, indeed, the passages where he reaches for a flippant, \u201cpopular professor\u201d tone: \u201cKant, having nothing better to do in the Prussian city of Konigsberg, set about investigating the fundamental nature of taste\u201d; Giorgio Vasari\u2019s lives of the Italian artists were \u201cmash notes.\u201dThe problem here isn\u2019t just one of tone or style \u2014 although a writer of Scott\u2019s standing should know that both are crucial tools in the critic\u2019s belt. Rather, you sense that the faux-populist diction doesn\u2019t reflect this author\u2019s real allegiances, which are evident in the works he selects for his loving and expert analyses: Rilke and Philip Larkin, Picasso and Henry James. (James\u2019s 1877 novel \u201cThe American,\u201d which begins with a scene in which a successful American businessman is overcome by tiredness in the Louvre, provides an amusing early example of \u201cmuseum fatigue,\u201d a phenomenon that the author investigates during a stimulating and subtle discussion about the difficulty of achieving \u201cinnocent\u201d responses to art.) The admiring references you get here to hip-hop feel dutiful rather than deeply felt \u2014 attempts to demonstrate his pop bona fides.So too with the halfhearted assertion \u2014 the focus of an entire chapter \u2014 that \u201cit is .\u2008.\u2008. the job of the critic to be wrong.\u201d To be sure, critics often turn out to be wrong, as Scott wittily reminds you during a recitation of some notorious critical gaffes: early and wince-inducing takedowns of John Keats\u2019s poetry, of \u201cMoby-Dick,\u201d of \u201cBringing Up Baby.\u201d But those errors of individual taste \u2014 the most crucial, if \u00adindefinable, qualification for serious criticism, along with expertise, both of which Scott (who has both) avoids talking about at length, as if to do so would offend the \u00adAmazon-rankers and cyber-tomato-throwers in his audience \u2014 are hardly proof that the critic\u2019s duty is to be \u201cwrong.\u201d The critic\u2019s job is to be more educated, articulate, stylish and tasteful \u2014 in a word, more worthy of \u201ctrust\u201d \u2014 than her readers have the time or inclination to be; qualities eminently suited to a practice that (as Scott rightly if too glancingly points out) has validity and value only if it is conducted in public.Whatever its occasional pandering, \u201cBetter Living Through Criticism\u201d mostly exemplifies the rhetorical virtues it so enthusiastically celebrates as being peculiar to the critic: attentiveness to detail, alertness to context, a hunger for larger meanings. The critic, Scott declares in the book\u2019s final dialogue, is \u201ca person whose interest can help activate the interest of others.\u201d In an era of reflexive contempt for erudition, taste and authority, qualities that Scott is perhaps too hesitant to name as the sine qua non of great critics, it is no mean feat to help activate, as this book will surely do, an interest in the genre of which he and others of his generation may be the last professional practitioners.BETTER LIVING THROUGH CRITICISMHow to Think About Art, Pleasure, Beauty, and TruthBy A.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Again Puts F.C.C. General Counsel at Center Stage", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Every day for one month last fall, Jonathan Sallet, the general counsel at the Federal Communications Commission, sneaked into a small, windowless office at the agency, its location undisclosed except to senior staff.From 6 a.m. until early evening, with Bach streaming in the background, he worked mostly alone, marking up stacks of law books and standing in front of a lectern. His job: Defend in court the F.C.C.\u2019s most contentious policy \u2014 rules to classify broadband Internet providers as utilities, widely called net neutrality.\u201cI did nothing for one month but prepare,\u201d Mr. Sallet said in an interview. \u201cI talked a lot to the wall.\u201dHis arguments, though \u2014 like nearly all of his actions for the agency \u2014 have had far-reaching reverberations.In his two years as the F.C.C.\u2019s general counsel, Mr. Sallet, 63, has taken center stage in some of the most divisive debates in Washington. He helped shape and then defend the net neutrality law. His input helped kill the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger last year. In recent days, the cable industry has closely tracked his thinking about a merger between Charter and Time Warner Cable, concerned about a similar result.\u201cTypically a general counsel is like an administrator,\u201d said Reed Hundt, a former Democratic chairman of the F.C.C. \u201cBut in Jon you have an administrator who is also a policy maven and political strategist.\u201dMr. Sallet will draw more of the spotlight in coming months, a period that could shape the tech and cable landscape for years to come. The agency is set to take a position on the Charter and Time Warner Cable deal, as well as vote to open the market of set-top cable boxes to new competitors. And the decision in the net neutrality case, the one he prepared so long and hard for, is also expected.Each weekday morning, Mr. Sallet is among a small cadre of top advisers who meet at 8:45 to discuss policy and strategy with Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C. Mr. Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable and wireless industries, knows firsthand how the agency\u2019s actions can be derailed by the pressure of lobbying by the powerful businesses he used to represent.\u201cHe is a multifaceted talent with the ability to see all angles of an issue and provide sage counsel,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said of Mr. Sallet.In the recent interview in his office, where the slim and soft-spoken Mr. Sallet keeps a keyboard and a guitar, he said swift changes in how people communicate and consume media have thrust the agency \u2014 and him \u2014 into the spotlight.For decades, Mr. Sallet has been an inside player in telecom policies. After graduating from law school at the University of Virginia and working as a clerk for Justice Lewis F. Powell, he spent 30 years representing companies like MCI and working on tech policy at the Commerce Department.While at the Commerce Department, he was introduced to the Mosaic web browser by Vice President Al Gore. That was in 1993, the same year Mr. Wheeler showed him a demonstration of a wireless phone.These days, Mr. Sallet said, policies related to smartphones and the Internet get such strong reactions that they require more than a broad view of economics and markets. They also require an ability to navigate pointed political criticism.That climate makes sticking to a set of principles all the more important, he said. For him, those ideas are that networks should be open for consumers and that the F.C.C. should \u201ctake actions to avoid a society of haves and have-nots.\u201dNet neutrality \u201cinvolves competition issues, the mergers are quite clearly about competition,\u201d he said.Mr. Sallet\u2019s stance has not slowed criticism. The F.C.C. recently proposed an overhaul of the TV set-top box market, a move that could open a new area of business for tech giants like Google and Amazon. Cable and media companies are fighting the plan, saying it would erode the core of their business.In addition, some academics criticized the agency\u2019s decision last spring to block Comcast\u2019s merger with Time Warner Cable, after a review led by Mr. Sallet. Critics said the companies did not compete in the same markets and would not reduce the number of options for consumers.The review of Charter\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Cable is expected to yield a decision this spring. Though analysts are generally confident it will be approved, the agency is likely to attach several requirements that ensure the merged company doesn\u2019t use its size to keep programmers from offering content to streaming providers.The harshest criticisms have been for Mr. Sallet\u2019s role in advising and writing up net neutrality policy \u2014 with technology and telecom companies arguing that Mr. Sallet, a Democrat, has made too many decisions based on politics.In October 2014, Mr. Wheeler, also a Democrat, introduced rules that could have let cable and telecom firms carve the Internet into various high-quality and low-quality tiers, according to some legal experts and net neutrality advocates. Top officials at the agency were reluctant to create stronger rules that ban such practices by regulating Internet service providers like utilities.The pressure intensified the next month, when President Obama took the unusual step of saying that broadband service providers should be treated like utilities, subject to rules akin to those placed on phone services. Soon after, Mr. Wheeler directed Mr. Sallet to rewrite the draft rules to more aggressively regulate the Internet service providers.\u201cUltimately Jon is the lawyer and Wheeler is his client,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.To complicate the situation, the rules were almost guaranteed to face strong legal challenges. Telecom and cable companies immediately sued to overturn the regulations, and the case was handed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the same court that had struck down net neutrality rules twice before.Mr. Sallet made his arguments defending the latest rules in December, winning plaudits from all sides for his work in the courtroom. A decision is expected this spring. Other legal challenges to the policy are likely.Mr. Sallet and his supporters said his positions, and those of the F.C.C., should not come as a surprise. Mr. Sallet and top advisers have talked frequently about the agency\u2019s push to keep big telecom and cable firms \u2014 which control the video and broadband pipes into homes \u2014 from stifling new technologies.There are even echoes of this philosophy in a speech he helped write in 1994 for Mr. Gore. In the speech, at University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Gore called for an overhaul of rules for phone and cable communications to encourage the development of the coming Internet economy.\u201cWe look back now and see that was incredibly prescient,\u201d Mr. Sallet said.Advertisement"}

I turn on the television, and I see a land where to be a citizen means to specialize in the venting of spleen.It\u2019s the Year of the Angry Voter, and apparently it\u2019s vitriol itself, rather than any particular strategy for the future, that\u2019s propelling the electorate. \u201cOur country is being run by incompetent people,\u201d Donald J. Trump has said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I\u2019m very, very angry.\u201d Bernie Sanders is angry, too: \u201cI am angry. The American people are angry.\u201dNo wonder they both triumphed in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Everybody is angry, from the left to the right. Everybody, that is, except me.Which is not to say that I\u2019m not upset about many things. The stagnation of wages; police murders of unarmed black youth; continuing resistance to equality for L.G.B.T. people; Google\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s slow devouring of the publishing industry. All of these are issues that I feel passionately about.I want to make the world better, for myself and for my children. But I don\u2019t want to bite any pigs.When I was young, I was taught that anger is a sin, and forgiveness a virtue. In the \u201cInferno,\u201d the Angry dwell in the fifth circle of hell. They thrash it out in the river Styx, where the wrathful struggle on the surface of the water and the sullen drown below.One thing that baffles me is that many of the angriest voters are also those associated with communities of faith. By what logic can the devout commit the sin of anger, and resist the call of its antidotes, the virtues of forgiveness and understanding?As Anne Lamott wrote, \u201cNot forgiving is like drinking rat poison and then waiting for the rat to die.\u201dAnd yet, Testaments Old and New are full of stories of vengeance and wrath. Christ himself throws something of a tantrum when he arrives in the Temple and finds it overtaken by money changers and animals. He overturns tables, lashes a whip and yells about injustice. It\u2019s not exactly \u201cGentle Jesus Meek and Mild,\u201d a hymn that for some reason I always confused with that old advertisement for Palmolive dishwashing liquid, which \u201csoftens hands while you do the dishes.\u201dBut this story used to confuse me. If Christ himself was able to express such unbridled anger, then how could anger be a sin?The Rev. Amy Butler at Riverside Church in New York suggests that there are really two kinds of anger: the kind that is the fruit of our own egos, and the other kind, that is focused outward, on the injustice of the world. In a sermon, she said, \u201cEither our instinctual response to threat is all about us \u2014 who we are, what we want, what we need \u2014 or it becomes about something bigger than ourselves.\u201dIn other words, it\u2019s one thing to be angry because you don\u2019t like one of the moderators at your debate; it\u2019s another to be angry because you think, for instance, that the entire electoral process is rigged to benefit the wealthy. The first kind lands one in the fifth circle of hell, gurgling in the Styx. The second can be a force for good, a possible first step on the road to change.Mr. Trump and others in this election have performed a sleight of hand that makes their own narcissistic anger look like a revolution. They have created an anger transmogrification machine, leading voters to misconstrue the fury of egotists for the transformative anger that helps change the world.But a movement founded upon narcissistic wrath cannot lead to a better future.What we need in the United States is not anger, but forgiveness.When I was a teenager, I decided one summer day that having a shaving-cream-pie fight would be the best use of my time, and since a shaving-cream-pie fight isn\u2019t really much fun if you\u2019re the only one having it, I invited over a large crowd to share in this activity.Things didn\u2019t end well. There were bloody noses and ruined clothes, and enough people jumped or were pushed into a neighborhood swimming pool that the profusion of sudsy froth killed the pool filter.This is what it feels like to be an American right now: a witness to a shaving-cream- pie fight that has somehow foamed out of control.I want to gather together everyone running for office and sit them down before my father, as I was seated, at the end of that long summer day. It would be good for them to hear the counsel my father gave to me, words that other fathers, and mothers, have doubtlessly said since the beginning of time: \u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d he observed. \u201cI\u2019m just terribly, terribly disappointed.\u201dJennifer Finney Boylan is a professor of English at Barnard College, the author of \u201cStuck in the Middle With You: Parenthood in Three Genders,\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Close but Not Quite", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Too often we use a word that sounds sort of like what we probably mean, more or less. That\u2019s not the level of precision we\u2019re striving for. If you\u2019re not absolutely sure you\u2019ve got the right word, you probably don\u2019t. Look it up!A few recent misfires:\u2022\u2022\u2022This isn\u2019t a word. A good clue is the fact that the adjective is \u201cobstinate,\u201d not \u201cobstinant.\u201d The noun is \u201cobstinacy\u201d or, less often, \u201cobstinateness.\u201d\u2022\u2022\u2022\u201cCompunction\u201d means a feeling of guilt or regret. Certainly one might say Trump feels no compunction about some of the controversial things he has said or done. But here we meant something more like \u201ccompulsion,\u201d or, better, \u201cobligation.\u201d\u2022\u2022\u2022As a colleague pointed out, \u201ccovet\u201d means to long for something you don\u2019t have, or that belongs to someone else. That\u2019s not the case here. We meant something more like \u201cvalue\u201d or perhaps \u201ccherish.\u201d\u2022\u2022\u2022This common error is more a misunderstanding of the idiom than of the word itself. We should say \u201cdifficult to overstate\u201d \u2014 that is, Saudi Aramco is so large that it would be hard to exaggerate its size.\u2022\u2022\u2022This may be a closer call. But the context suggests we meant something more like \u201cpointless,\u201d rather than \u201cfeckless,\u201d which can mean either weak or careless.A couple of familiar, and painful, homonym mix-ups from recent stories:\u2022\u2022\u2022Fortunately, this was quickly fixed to read \u201crein in.\u201d\u2022\u2022\u2022\u201cDyed,\u201d of course.\u201cAdvocate\u201d means to speak or work in favor of something. So it\u2019s ungainly, even illogical, to use this word in describing opposition \u2014 it\u2019s like saying someone is in favor of being against something. Yet versions of this crop up fairly often. For example:\u2022\u2022\u2022How about \u201ccampaigning fervently against\u201d or \u201cworking fervently against\u201d or perhaps \u201cfervently fighting poverty, etc.\u201d?\u2022\u2022\u2022An awkward description: someone who is for being against domestic violence.

He has been involved with many of the technologies that have made Alphabet an engineering powerhouse and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.His replacement, John Giannandrea, currently works in artificial intelligence, or A.I., at Alphabet. A.I. has been increasingly important to Google and other companies like Amazon, as they seek to build products that can do things like respond to voice commands, deliver complex alerts about changes to a user\u2019s schedule, or drive a car.In a post to the Google Plus social network, Mr. Singhal indicated that he wished to spend time with his family and intended to give away some of his fortune. \u201cIt has always been a priority for me to give back to people who are less fortunate, and make time for my family,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Singhal, 48, joined Google in 2000 as employee No. 176. A native of India, he has a doctorate in computer science from Cornell and worked at AT&T Labs before Google. One of his earliest jobs at Google was rewriting the initial breakthrough algorithms developed by Google\u2019s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin.Google was one of many search engines, but it distinguished itself both in the quality of its results and in building features like spell check, which could offer correct answers to misspelled queries. The early engineering team also developed search-related tools for its advertising, which quickly turned into a very profitable business.In addition to Mr. Singhal\u2019s stated philanthropic and family interests, it is likely that his skills in building large computer networks and in A.I. will still be in demand.Advertisement"}

Someone had overheard him talking to his court-appointed lawyer.\u201cThey would say, \u2018What are you in for?\u2019\u201d Mr. Riddle, 28, recalled a few days later.He replied, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m the drone guy.\u2019\u201dOn paper, the drone guy seemed harmless enough. According to a criminal complaint, on Feb. 4 at 5:30 p.m., the defendant, Mr. Riddle, \u201coperated said \u2018drone\u2019\u201d in front of a building at 350 Fifth Avenue. Operating the drone created \u201csubstantial risk of physical injury to pedestrians,\u201d the complaint stated, although no one was hurt.Had Mr. Riddle operated his drone a few blocks away, perhaps he would not have spent the night in a holding cell with a new nickname. But 350 Fifth Avenue is not just any building; it is the Empire State Building.At his apartment in Jersey City last week, Mr. Riddle explained.Raised in Indiana, he graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in agricultural biotechnology and moved to New York City in 2012. He discovered his passion was in the nonprofit world.He was hands-on. When he helped plan a Big Blue Christmas event at a bar on West 33rd Street last year, Mr. Riddle wanted blue Santa hats. He bought bolts of blue and white fabric and a Singer sewing machine and turned his apartment into a one-man sweatshop.He had an idea to create an organization that could put people at nonprofits in touch quickly. He decided to make a video to generate interest.The video had a plot: A man is trying to get to an event at a bar in Manhattan. He takes a helicopter over the city. The pilot tells him that to get to the bar on time, he should put on a parachute and jump. Mr. Riddle needed to film the descent from the man\u2019s point of view, with the ground rushing toward the camera.This called for a drone. Mr. Riddle went on Amazon and bought an Ionic 6-Axis Quadcopter Drone with a camera for $69.99. He flew it in his apartment. He said he looked up laws for using drones on Google and, satisfied he was out of the forbidden zone around airports, packed the drone in a duffel bag and took the train to Midtown Manhattan.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best idea,\u201d Mr. Riddle said, \u201cbut I figured I had it in me.\u201dHe saw some police officers standing near Macy\u2019s and approached them. He told them he wanted to fly the drone straight up and let it descend. He said an officer replied, \u201cSounds O.K. to me.\u201dThus feeling empowered with a municipal seal of approval, Mr. Riddle set the drone on the ground by 350 Fifth Avenue.Mr. Riddle said his drone flew up to about the sixth story before the trouble began: \u201cThe wind takes it, and it bumps against the Empire State Building a few times.\u201dNot good.\u201cI let it drop, and it falls onto the first tier, which is like five floors up,\u201d he said. He entered the lobby, approached a security guard and asked to get his drone back.\u201cYou got some ID?\u201d the guard said.Detectives questioned him at length. They had apparently seen his Facebook page, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s BBN?\u201d in a tone, he said, that suggested they thought it might be linked to ISIS.Mr. Riddle spent several hours in the holding cell before he was arraigned and released, he said. His case is pending. His drone is evidence. He returned to the police station to collect his other property, and the officer at the desk asked his name.\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Dude,\u2019\u201d Mr. Riddle said, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m the drone guy.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

The have-nots, which are the companies that are trying to raise now, are going to have to dramatically restructure their companies. The haves will thrive while the have-nots sadly may find themselves put out of business because they found themselves on the wrong side of the fund-raising cycle.\u201dDo you think Schreier is right?Here\u2019s what I think, informed by talking to people much smarter than myself: After the recession, we had a wealth of money flowing in from sources that weren\u2019t there just a few years before: sovereign wealth funds from Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Russia. You have hedge funds and other money managers whose clients want to diversify their investments. For that, they look to tech.On the other side, you have a preponderance of entrepreneurs who, for the last few years, have been able to toss out any stupid idea they wish and get at least a few million dollars thrown at them to pursue it. That behavior, according to the folks I talk to, is abnormal. There are too many start-ups on the market and too many bad ideas still limping along because the money hasn\u2019t dried up yet.So fast-forward to now. Public markets are insane. Investors are getting nervous, and the money faucets are closing off. The window for going through an initial public offering, at least in the next 12 to 18 months, seems to be much narrower than it has been over the last two years. So what does that mean?I like to think of it as \u201cThe Lion King\u201d meets \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\u201d Circle of life, and all that.Obviously, this won\u2019t be welcomed with open arms by all investors or start-ups. But the people I\u2019ve spoken with generally think this is a positive progression for the start-up environment as a whole, and a necessary cycle that will only happen over and over again. It\u2019s like nature. Death begets rebirth, ad infinitum.So things will be bad, but maybe not for everyone. That\u2019s good, right?Anyway, it started snowing again, so I guess my dog doo problem is temporarily fixed. How do people live in this city?See you soon!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Increasingly Muffled Press", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Chinese media have never had much freedom to pursue muckraking stories, or even to dutifully report the facts. Now, President Xi Jinping is going to extraordinary lengths to rein the press in even further.Mr. Xi recently visited the three main newsrooms in the country to convey in unmistakable terms that journalists are expected to behave like apparatchiks. That message, which predictably received fawning coverage, came a few days after the government announced it would further restrict foreign media, too.Under rules Beijing says it will start enforcing next month, foreign companies will be barred from publishing online content \u2014 including text, videos, maps and games \u2014 in China without prior approval from the government. The regulations, which could affect major American companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, are intended to \u201cpromote core socialist values.\u201dThose stifling steps will add to the information barriers Chinese people already face. Major sites, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, which hundreds of millions of people around the globe use, are already blocked in China. The Chinese government began blocking access to the English and Chinese websites of The New York Times in 2012, in retaliation for an article that exposed the hidden wealth of relatives of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister.Mr. Xi may feel pressure to restrict the worldview of his citizens at a time when the Chinese economy is under strain. An article on Monday in the country\u2019s official English-language newspaper, China Daily, said news organizations were \u201cessential to political stability.\u201d\u201cIt is necessary for the media to restore people\u2019s trust in the party, especially as the economy has entered a new normal and suggestions that it is declining and dragging down the global economy have emerged,\u201d the article said.It is during trying times, of course, that societies benefit most from a press that is free to scrutinize questionable policies and expose ineffective leaders.Mr. Xi\u2019s new guidance is likely to make the official press even more docile than it traditionally has been. But the approach will be self-defeating for the government in the long run. In an increasingly interconnected world, it is harder to control the flow of information across borders and within countries. New mechanisms of Internet censorship are typically met with creative tools to bypass them. And each new effort to keep Chinese people ignorant about their government and the outside world will make them only more determined to learn.Advertisement"}

Their positions were selected based on their standing in the delegate race through Nevada, with the top candidate in the center and the others extending outward.I want to tell you how tonight\u2019s debate will work. As moderator, I will guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups, as will Maria Celeste, Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt. Candidates, you\u2019ll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. We have timing lights that are visible to the candidates. Those lights will warn you when your time is up, and as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this.(BELL RINGS)We know you all want to jump and debate these critically important issues, but please wait until you\u2019re called on. These are the rules all of the candidates have agreed to.It\u2019s time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now. You\u2019ll each have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, you\u2019re first.CARSON: If someone had tried to describe today\u2019s America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. It\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s about the American people.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich?KASICH: Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother\u2019s mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English. And I\u2019m standing on this stage. It\u2019s pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you, there\u2019s a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them. Shoot for the stars. America\u2019s great, and you can do it. Thank you, Wolf.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, thank you. This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we\u2019re simply going to become a party that preys on people\u2019s angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it\u2019s been in its story history.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Welcome to Texas.(APPLAUSE)Here, Texas provided my family with hope. Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. CRUZ: When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.And, I\u2019ll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn\u2019t vote for you, but you\u2019re doing what you said you would do. And, as president, I will do the same.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We don\u2019t win anymore as a country. We don\u2019t win with trade, we don\u2019t win with the military. ISIS, we can\u2019t even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me. We will.We don\u2019t win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just don\u2019t win.You look at our borders, they\u2019re like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.We\u2019re going to make a great country again. We\u2019re going to start winning again. We\u2019re going to win a lot, it\u2019s going to be a big difference, believe me. It\u2019s going to be a big difference.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you very much. It\u2019s now time to begin questions. Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So, that\u2019s where we begin.Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. You\u2019ve also promised to let what you call, \u201cthe good ones\u201d, come back in. Your words, \u201cthe good ones\u201d, after they\u2019ve been deported.Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says that\u2019s the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty. Is it?TRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they\u2019ve been debating this every debate that we\u2019ve had.As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking, and you wouldn\u2019t have asked that as the first question if it weren\u2019t for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn\u2019t even be a big subject.But, we either have a country, or we don\u2019t have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back \u2014 some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that\u2019s very fair, and very fine.They\u2019re going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they\u2019re going to come back through a process.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, what\u2019s wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, \u201cthe good ones\u201d come back to the United States?CRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country \u2014 our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what\u2019s happened there \u2014 it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they\u2019re spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That\u2019s who we need to be fighting for.Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that\u2019s why I will do the same thing as president.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, I\u2019m very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama\u2019s. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.Are those claims correct?RUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I\u2019ve been abundantly clear on this. When I\u2019m president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, that\u2019s not just the physical border with Mexico, it\u2019s Visa overstays. That\u2019s 45 percent of the problem right there.RUBIO: It also has to do \u2014 that\u2019s why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, we\u2019re not doing anything else. And then we\u2019ll see what the American people are willing to support.And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he\u2019s now taking are new to him.In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you\u2019ve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.My mom and dad \u2014 my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it\u2019s an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that\u2019s the way I define it, is you\u2019re going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.As far as the people that I\u2019ve hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It\u2019s the up season. People didn\u2019t want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn\u2019t get.Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn\u2019t get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.RUBIO: That \u2014 my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That\u2019s what I criticize Mitt Romney \u2014 I mean, ran...RUBIO: No, he...TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That\u2019s an election that should have been won.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term \u201cself-deportation.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s on the record and people can look it up right now online.But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it\u2019s really important, this point. I think it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if you\u2019re going to claim that you\u2019re the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you\u2019re only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland...TRUMP: No, no, I\u2019m the only one on the stage that\u2019s hired people. You haven\u2019t hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And by the way, I\u2019ve hired \u2014 and by the way, I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You\u2019ve hired nobody.RUBIO: Yes, you\u2019ve hired a thousand from another country...TRUMP: You\u2019ve had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don\u2019t tell me about that.RUBIO: Let me just say \u2014 let me finish the statement. This is important.TRUMP: You haven\u2019t hired one person, you liar.RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...TRUMP: That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s wrong. Totally wrong.RUBIO: That\u2019s a fact. People can look it up. I\u2019m sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. \u201cTrump Polish workers,\u201d you\u2019ll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That happened.TRUMP: I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Let me talk. I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: But I\u2019ve hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That\u2019s existing law.But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the \u201cgang of eight\u201d amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the \u201cgang of eight,\u201d one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you\u2019re funding open border politicians, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I can only say this, and I\u2019ve said it loud and clear and I\u2019ve said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now \u2014 your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they\u2019re packed with you.I\u2019ve had an amazing relationship with politicians \u2014 with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he\u2019s a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You don\u2019t have one Republican \u2014 you don\u2019t have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don\u2019t have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don\u2019t have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he\u2019s elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he\u2019s right. He has supported \u2014 he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn\u2019t be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let\u2019s actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn\u2019t like it.And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that\u2019s not a good attribute for a president.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Here\u2019s a man \u2014 Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn\u2019t even put that he\u2019s borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didn\u2019t talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he\u2019s going to protect the people from the big bad banks.Give me a break.BLITZER: All right. We\u2019re going to move on to Governor Kasich.Governor Kasich...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. He\u2019s been waiting patiently.Governor Kasich, the idea \u2014 you\u2019ve said this, and I want to quote you now: \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it.\u201d Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it\u2019s not feasible to stop them?KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem \u2014 a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it\u2019s done, you don\u2019t have a right to come in. If you come in, we don\u2019t want any excuse. You\u2019re going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it\u2019s practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans \u2014 the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, I\u2019d make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I\u2019d give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to tear families apart. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to ride around in people\u2019s neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don\u2019t think \u2014 first of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical and I don\u2019t think it reflects America.You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn\u2019t get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, let\u2019s be practical. Let\u2019s start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, you\u2019ve been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don\u2019t think Mr. Trump\u2019s plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I\u2019ve already described \u2014 you know, how we can secure the border.We need to secure all the borders, because it\u2019s not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.But in terms of the people who are here already, after we \u2014 after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don\u2019t have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that\u2019s the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.And we have other ways of \u2014 of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don\u2019t feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.TRUMP: (inaudible).BLITZER: It\u2019s about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You\u2019ve said the Mexican government will pay for it.TRUMP: Correct.BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox \u2014 he said today, and I\u2019m quoting him \u2014 he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for that,\u201d quote, \u201ceffing wall.\u201d(LAUGHTER)So if you don\u2019t get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.(APPLAUSE)It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that \u2014 I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn\u2019t include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.We\u2019re going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it\u2019ll end up costing $200 billion.(APPLAUSE)But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 \u2014 you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago \u2014 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it\u2019s a real wall. This is a wall that\u2019s a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you\u2019re looking at. This is a wall that\u2019s going to work.Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...(BELL RINGS)... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It\u2019s a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: If the \u2014 if the Mexicans don\u2019t pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?TRUMP: Well, you know, I don\u2019t mind trade wars when we\u2019re losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We\u2019re losing so much. (APPLAUSE)We\u2019re losing so much with Mexico and China \u2014 with China, we\u2019re losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, \u201cdon\u2019t we want to trade?\u201d I don\u2019t mind trading, but I don\u2019t want to lose $500 billion. I don\u2019t want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They\u2019re building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say I\u2019m not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They\u2019re taking our businesses. I don\u2019t mind.BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he\u2019ll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.RUBIO: But it \u2014 no, it\u2019s not a sound bite. It\u2019s a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. You\u2019ll see it.The second thing, about the trade war \u2014 I don\u2019t understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you\u2019re gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.TRUMP: All right, you know what?RUBIO: Why don\u2019t you make them in America?TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency \u2014 they devalue their currencies...RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.TRUMP: ... that makes it \u2014 well, you don\u2019t know a thing about business. You lose on everything...RUBIO: Well, make them in America. TRUMP: Let me just tell you \u2014 they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.RUBIO: Well then, make them in America.TRUMP: That makes it \u2014 well, you don\u2019t know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.RUBIO: Well, make them in America.TRUMP: Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...RUBIO: And so you make them in China and in Russia.TRUMP: But you wouldn\u2019t know anything about it because you\u2019re a lousy businessman.RUBIO: Well, I don\u2019t know anything about bankrupting four companies. You\u2019ve bankrupted..TRUMP: No, I \u2014 and you know why? You know why?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: I don\u2019t know anything about...TRUMP: You know why?RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that was a fake university.BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: First of all...BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: ... first of all, that\u2019s called a...RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...BLITZER: Hold on. One at a time, Mr. Trump.RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and they\u2019re suing now \u2014 $36,000 to go to a university...TRUMP: And by the way \u2014 and by the way...RUBIO: ... that\u2019s a fake school.TRUMP: ... and by the way...RUBIO: And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...TRUMP: ... I\u2019ve won most of the lawsuits.RUBIO: That\u2019s what they got for $36,000.BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job, but I\u2019ve won most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.TRUMP: Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?BLITZER: You\u2019re allowed \u2014 you\u2019ve been responding.TRUMP: OK. Well let \u2014 no, I haven\u2019t. I really haven\u2019t.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: He\u2019s talked through the whole thing.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Here\u2019s a guy \u2014 here\u2019s a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who\u2019s probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we\u2019re going to have as president.RUBIO: Here\u2019s a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn\u2019t inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?TRUMP: No, no, no.RUBIO: Selling watches in (inaudible)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...RUBIO: That\u2019s where he would be. TRUMP: That is so wrong. We\u2019ll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.RUBIO: Oh, OK. One million.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...RUBIO: Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...RUBIO: Oh, he doesn\u2019t make that money.TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama\u2019s executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.RUBIO: Correct.ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I\u2019m going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to cancel it immediately.So Senator Rubio, what changed?RUBIO: It didn\u2019t change.ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?RUBIO: No, it\u2019s the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will \u2014 we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not compassionate to the plight of a 2 \u2014 someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn\u2019t have the power to do that.(APPLAUSE)And he himself admitted that.ARRASAS: Senator, Senator...RUBIO: I\u2019m sorry, but let me finish my...ARRASAS: ... but you went \u2014 you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.RUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can\u2019t solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie?RUBIO: Because it is not true that I\u2019m not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don\u2019t even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take \u2014 as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there\u2019s a statute of limitation on lies.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you\u2019re right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. CRUZ: You know, we\u2019ve both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, it\u2019ll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn\u2019t plan to end it at all.You know, I\u2019m reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.Marco\u2019s position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.RUBIO: That\u2019s not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I don\u2019t agree with the mandate and the program that\u2019s in place, but I think it\u2019s unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we\u2019re just going to yank it away from them.And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is \u2014 at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.(APPLAUSE)And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?CRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you\u2019re liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.You know, we\u2019ve got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father\u2019s story.Telling my Dad\u2019s story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.RUBIO: I\u2019m sorry I was mentioned...ARRASAS: ... Governor Kasich.RUBIO: Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement.ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the...RUBIO: ... OK. I was mentioned \u2014 just because of the hispanic \u2014 and I\u2019ll be brief.A couple points, number one, I do think it\u2019s amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.Yes, it\u2019s an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I\u2019m going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That\u2019s what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos. Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I\u2019m going to quote it, \u201cif hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn\u2019t want them in the United States they won\u2019t pay attention to our next sentence.\u201dSo, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?KASICH: Well, I\u2019m not going to talk about that. I mean, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don\u2019t like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother\u2019s thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I\u2019m going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven\u2019t changed anything with it.And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.But here\u2019s the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.It\u2019s what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me. And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.It\u2019s time to solve problems.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?CARSON: I didn\u2019t hear the first part of the question?ARRASAS: The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.And one of them was that they shouldn\u2019t feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.CARSON: OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.And the reason that I don\u2019t fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are \u2014 that give liberty and justice to all people.And that\u2019s the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think that\u2019s the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don\u2019t pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race. You keep saying that Hispanics love you.TRUMP: True.(LAUGHTER)ARRASAS: And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.TRUMP: True.ARRASAS: But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you. They don\u2019t like you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you an unelectable...TRUMP: No.ARRASAS: ... candidate in a general election?TRUMP: First of all, I don\u2019t believe anything Telemundo says.ARRASAS: You used to say that you love...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They\u2019re incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.They get it. They\u2019re incredible people. They\u2019re incredible workers. They get it. And I\u2019ve won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn\u2019t maybe win the Telemundo poll.But one thing I\u2019m also going to do, I\u2019m going to be getting \u2014 bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you\u2019re seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.TRUMP: We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one \u2014 the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.TRUMP: New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past. But it is not just a Telemundo poll. We have...TRUMP: I love them. I love them.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: All right. Well, it\u2019s not the only poll.TRUMP: They\u2019re fine. Do you know what? They\u2019re fine.ARRASAS: Just last night \u2014 let me \u2014 let me finish, please.Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you. And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 \u2014 let me finish please \u2014 of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.TRUMP: Why did they take the poll? Why did they...(CROSSTALK)ARRASAS: I am making reference \u2014 I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.TRUMP: I\u2019m just telling you, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision. It was settled. We\u2019re good friends now. It was all settled up.(LAUGHTER)Very happy, very happy. Very good people.I\u2019m just telling you \u2014 I\u2019m just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I\u2019m telling you also, I\u2019m bringing people, Democrats over and I\u2019m bringing independents over, and we\u2019re building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.Hugh?HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.To me, it\u2019s the most important issue. I\u2019ll start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?CRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it \u2014 Justice Scalia\u2019s passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this \u2014 this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I\u2019m certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.I\u2019ve spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they\u2019re asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies \u2014 all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it\u2019s repealed, it was a five-four decision, they\u2019re going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?TRUMP: Yes, I would. And I\u2019ve been there. And I\u2019ve been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it\u2019s not anybody\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not Ted\u2019s fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way \u2014 no way that he should have approved Obamacare.Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don\u2019t want.HEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz\u2019s criticism?CRUZ: Well, listen \u2014 Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, it\u2019s true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And I\u2019ll tell you, Hugh...(APPLAUSE)... you know, it\u2019s interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who \u2014 who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...(BELL RINGS)... and cut a deal.HEWITT: Mr. Trump...CRUZ: So that means on Supreme Court...HEWITT: ... can I...CRUZ: ... he\u2019s going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won\u2019t cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Can I trust you on religious liberty?TRUMP: Well, let \u2014 let me \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted \u2014 and I respected it, but he gets nowhere \u2014 stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that\u2019s going to make deals.It\u2019s wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted\u2019s been very critical \u2014 I have a sister who\u2019s a brilliant...HEWITT: Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?TRUMP: ... excuse me. She\u2019s a brilliant judge. He\u2019s been criticizing \u2014 he\u2019s been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?HEWITT: Let me \u2014 Senator.CRUZ: Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can\u2019t have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You\u2019ve got to be willing to cut a deal.And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald \u2014 Donald Trump.Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.(BELL RINGS)You know what, Donald...(CROSSTALK)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.CRUZ: ... I don\u2019t want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot \u2014 give me a break.HEWITT: Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?RUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here \u2014 the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.Justice Scalia \u2014 in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document \u2014 it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia \u2014 plus there may be at least two other vacancies.So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.Now, if he\u2019s changed, we\u2019re always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don\u2019t have a record there to look at and say, \u201cI feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he\u2019s going to be firmly on our side on these issues.\u201dIn fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he\u2019s not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.HEWITT: Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Well, let \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative \u2014 more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I\u2019m pro-life. I\u2019m totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women \u2014 cervical cancer, breast cancer \u2014 are helped by Planned Parenthood.So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn\u2019t fund it.I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don\u2019t know what percentage it is. They say it\u2019s 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I\u2019m pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty. You\u2019ve been a little bit less emphatic. You\u2019ve said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people? KASICH: Well, you know, , of course. I mean, if \u2014 look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don\u2019t favor it. I\u2019ve always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I\u2019ve moved on. And what I\u2019ve said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?If you\u2019re in the business of selling things, if you\u2019re not going to sell to somebody you don\u2019t agree with, OK, today I\u2019m not going to sell to somebody who\u2019s gay, and tomorrow maybe I won\u2019t sell to somebody who\u2019s divorced.I mean, if you\u2019re in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That\u2019s my view. And if you don\u2019t agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, I\u2019ve appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.And you know what they are? They\u2019re conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don\u2019t make the law. They interpret the law. That\u2019s all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.But let\u2019s just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.HEWITT: Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear?(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Are the positions you\u2019ve heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That\u2019s unfair.And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That\u2019s why we have divided government. And we\u2019re going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person\u2019s life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let\u2019s talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.BASH: Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you\u2019re worried he won\u2019t?RUBIO: The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don\u2019t believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here\u2019s what we need to replace it with.We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.And if you don\u2019t have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn\u2019t just bad for health care, it\u2019s bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people\u2019s hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond?TRUMP: I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I\u2019m referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.I think we need it. I think it\u2019s a modern age. And I think we have to have it.(APPLAUSE)BASH: OK, so let\u2019s talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong?TRUMP: I think they\u2019re wrong 100 percent. What we need \u2014 look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. TRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got \u2014 I\u2019m not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they\u2019re part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.And, actually, the Governor too, let\u2019s just talk about these too, OK?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Because I don\u2019t think the Governor had too much to do with this.But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there\u2019s great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there\u2019s serious, serious competition.BASH But, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... And, you\u2019re going to see \u2014 excuse me. You\u2019re going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they\u2019re making a fortune.(APPLAUSE)BASH: But, just to be specific here, what you\u2019re saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...TRUMP: That\u2019s going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren\u2019t going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say \u2014 they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they\u2019re friends of mine. The top guys, they\u2019re friends of mine. I shouldn\u2019t tell you guys, you\u2019ll say it\u2019s terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They\u2019re friends of mine, there\u2019s some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He\u2019s not laughing so much anymore.Hi.(APPLAUSE)Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we\u2019ll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.RUBIO: Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...BASH: ... Go ahead.RUBIO: You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don\u2019t follow this stuff very closely, but here\u2019s what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. They\u2019re suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.Here\u2019s what you didn\u2019t hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps...TRUMP: ... And, you don\u2019t know what it means...RUBIO: ... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?TRUMP: You don\u2019t know.BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan...TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, I\u2019ll have you know...RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan... TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he\u2019s got is he really doesn\u2019t know about the lines. The biggest thing we\u2019ve got, and the reason we\u2019ve got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...TRUMP: ... You don\u2019t know much...RUBIO: ... So, you\u2019re only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan...TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...RUBIO: ... That\u2019s your only plan...TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done \u2014 not now...RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...TRUMP: ... Excuse me. Excuse me.RUBIO: ... His plan. That was the plan...TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you\u2019ll have many. They\u2019ll compete, and it\u2019ll be a beautiful thing.RUBIO: Alright...(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: So, that\u2019s the only part of the plan? Just the lines?BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: The nice part of the plan \u2014 you\u2019ll have many different plans. You\u2019ll have competition, you\u2019ll have so many different plans.RUBIO: Now he\u2019s repeating himself.TRUMP: No, no, no.(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible)RUBIO: (inaudible)(CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago... RUBIO: ... I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I\u2019ve never seen it in anybody...BASH: ... Let\u2019s stay focused on the subject...TRUMP: ... I thought he came out of the swimming pool...RUBIO: ... I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone\u2019s dumb, he\u2019s gonna make America great again...BASH: ... Senator Rubio...RUBIO: ... We\u2019re going to win, win win, he\u2019s winning in the polls...BASH: ... Senator Rubio, please.RUBIO: ... And the lines around the state.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: ... Every night.BASH: Senator Rubio.(CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell the truth, I tell the truth.BASH: Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you\u2019ve just posed to him...RUBIO: ... Yeah, he\u2019s going to give us his plan now, right? OK...BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more about your plan. I know you talked about...TRUMP: ... We\u2019re going to have many different plans because...BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...TRUMP: ... competition...RUBIO: ... He\u2019s done it again.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies. They\u2019re going to have many, many different plans. BASH: Is there anything else you would like to add to that...TRUMP: No, there\u2019s nothing to add.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: What is to add?BASH: Thank you. Thank you both.RUBIO: Alright.BASH: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said it is, quote, \u201cUn American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition.\u201dBASH: Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?KASICH: No, I wouldn\u2019t. And \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You don\u2019t want any American to lose their house, everything they\u2019ve saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what we\u2019ve heard here tonight. We\u2019re actually running significant health reform in my state.I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don\u2019t want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.And then we\u2019re driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it\u2019s easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.And I\u2019ll tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.BASH: Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate. In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?KASICH: Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tenable. And we don\u2019t need to do that. Again, I\u2019m telling you that we are going to \u2014 we have a proposal, a plan that we\u2019re enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you\u2019re providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint \u2014 some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they\u2019re going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can\u2019t afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We\u2019re actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go \u2014 this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what\u2019s going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.We don\u2019t want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. We\u2019re losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.BASH: Governor Kasich, thank you.KASICH: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?CARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad\u2019s $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody\u2019s going to hide his cigarettes because they\u2019re all interested in what\u2019s going on there.Also, the \u2014 your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, it\u2019s like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What\u2019s the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.CARSON: But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all \u2014 they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.BLITZER: Thank you.CARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don\u2019t get to talk that much. And, you know, let\u2019s...(APPLAUSE)... you can have the money that\u2019s left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that\u2019s probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.BLITZER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let\u2019s talk about the economy. Let\u2019s talk about...CRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?BLITZER: I want to move on, but there\u2019ll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...CRUZ: It\u2019s kind of an issue I have a long history with.BLITZER: I know you do. And \u2014 all right, go ahead.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.KASICH: How do you \u2014 how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You\u2019re very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.(APPLAUSE)On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, it\u2019s killed millions of jobs, and it\u2019s hurting people\u2019s health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.What he\u2019s said is government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you\u2019re a small business owner, Donald Trump\u2019s socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you\u2019re elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it\u2019s been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don\u2019t get that hip replacement, you don\u2019t get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.I\u2019ll tell you this. As president...BLITZER: Senator...CRUZ: ... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it\u2019s going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn\u2019t work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.CRUZ: Donald, true or false, you\u2019ve said the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care.TRUMP: That\u2019s false.CRUZ: You\u2019ve never said that?TRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...CRUZ: But you\u2019ve never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.TRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.CRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you have no heart.TRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I\u2019m president.CRUZ: Have you said you\u2019re a liberal on health care?TRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...CRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.TRUMP: If people \u2014 my plan is very simple. I will not \u2014 we\u2019re going to have private \u2014 we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I\u2019m president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...CRUZ: So does the government pay for everyone\u2019s health care?TRUMP: ... I\u2019m not fine with it. We are going to take those people...CRUZ: Yes or no. Just answer the question.TRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We\u2019re going to make great deals on it, but we\u2019re not going to let them die in the streets.CRUZ: Who pays for it?RUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?BLITZER: Gentleman, please.RUBIO: Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.BLITZER: Gentlemen please. I want to move on.RUBIO: This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...BLITZER: I want to talk about the economy.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentleman, gentleman. All of you have agreed \u2014 Senator Cruz...TRUMP: You know what? Call it what you want.CRUZ: It\u2019s a yes or no.TRUMP: Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.BLITZER: All of you have agreed \u2014 all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. We\u2019re talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn\u2019t saddled with even more debt? TRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We\u2019ll be dynamic again. If you look at what\u2019s going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.It\u2019s shutting off our economy. It\u2019s shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can\u2019t get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.BLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?TRUMP: We\u2019re going to make many cuts in business. We\u2019re getting rid of \u2014 we\u2019re going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education \u2014 Common Core is out. We\u2019re going local. Have to go local.(APPLAUSE)Environmental protection \u2014 we waste all of this money. We\u2019re going to bring that back to the states. And we\u2019re going to have other (inaudible) many things. (APPLAUSE)We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.BLITZER: Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump. If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that\u2019s about $68 billion. If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that\u2019s about $8 billion. That\u2019s about $76 billion for those two agencies.The current deficit this year is $544 billion. Where are you going to come up with the money?TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse.(APPLAUSE)You look at what\u2019s happening with Social Security, you look \u2014 look at what\u2019s happening with every agency \u2014 waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.BLITZER: Governor Kasich.(APPLAUSE)When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had. Can Mr. Trump\u2019s plan work?KASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I\u2019ve done it. I mean, I \u2014 we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington \u2014 every single one of them \u2014 and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you don\u2019t have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won\u2019t get there. You will never be able to do it.Now, I \u2014 I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts \u2014 the biggest of any governor in the country \u2014 and we have a fiscal plan.And it\u2019s not all \u2014 it\u2019s not always cutting. It\u2019s innovating \u2014 it\u2019s producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.And, look \u2014 I\u2019ve got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.I\u2019ve done it \u2014 I did it in Washington \u2014 four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened.(BELL RINGS)I\u2019ve done it in Ohio, we\u2019re growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that.(APPLAUSE)Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, governor.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of taxes...TRUMP: I just want to say \u2014 and I\u2019m a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.KASICH: OK, let me \u2014 let me \u2014 let me just talk about that, because I know that \u2014 that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we\u2019ve created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it\u2019s early-stage.See, what we\u2019ve done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that\u2019s jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.We \u2014 we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon \u2014 their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why it\u2019s happening?(BELL RINGS)Because we\u2019re balanced budgets, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re job-friendly, we don\u2019t raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I\u2019m quoting him now, \u201cthere is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them.\u201dRomney said either you\u2019re not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven\u2019t paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven\u2019t been giving the money to veterans or disabled people. Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?TRUMP: All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form \u2014 almost 100 pages. You don\u2019t learn anything about somebody\u2019s wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements. TRUMP: I filed \u2014 which shows that I\u2019m worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn\u2019t ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.So as far as that\u2019s concerned, I filed it. And that\u2019s where you find out what kind of a company. You don\u2019t learn anything from a tax return.I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn\u2019t file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I\u2019ve been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.Nobody gets audited \u2014 I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I\u2019m being audited now for two or three years, so I can\u2019t do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.BLITZER: Hugh, go ahead.HEWITT: Mr. Trump. You told me...TRUMP: Are you going to ask anybody else that question?CARSON: Yes, amen, amen.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Every single question comes to me?HEWITT: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know I\u2019m here for the ratings, but it\u2019s a little bit ridiculous.(LAUGHTER) HEWITT: Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.TRUMP: True.HEWITT: Are you going back on your commitment?TRUMP: No, I\u2019m not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That\u2019s the good news.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Let me just tell you, let me just \u2014 which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can\u2019t release it while I\u2019m under an audit. We\u2019re under a routine audit. I\u2019ve had it for years, I get audited.And obviously if I\u2019m being audited, I\u2019m not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.HEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns. Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released. And you said, coming out any day momentarily. When are we going to see your returns?RUBIO: Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And there\u2019s nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily I\u2019m not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It\u2019s a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I\u2019ve been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.And I think if we \u2014 the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is \u2014 the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.HEWITT: Thank you, Senator Rubio. But I am...(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: I\u2019m being fair to all of the candidates.Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away. Why haven\u2019t voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?CRUZ: So, I\u2019ve released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes \u2014 you know, Donald says he\u2019s being audited.Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...TRUMP: Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.CRUZ: ... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. They\u2019re going to pick apart his taxes. They\u2019re going to pick apart his business deals.And let\u2019s take, for example, one of Hillary\u2019s great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.CRUZ: The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, \u201cbut gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding.\u201dHe can\u2019t prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can\u2019t risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I\u2019m a businessman. I have, over the years.And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he\u2019s doing well in the polls. Well, I\u2019m beating him in virtually every poll. I\u2019m tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn\u2019t be. But I think I\u2019ll do very well.(APPLAUSE)But a poll just came out \u2014 a Bloomberg poll \u2014 where I am beating him so badly that it\u2019s, like, embarrassing even for me to say I\u2019m beating him that badly.(APPLAUSE)And \u2014 and here\u2019s the thing \u2014 it was sort of funny \u2014 65 percent of the people don\u2019t like you \u2014 I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent...(BELL RINGS)... on another one. That means \u2014 and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly \u2014 that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, \u201cI can\u2019t lose South Carolina.\u201d I beat him in a landslide.Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls. One other thing \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t even started at her. I only had one little interchange...(APPLAUSE)... I only had one little interchange, and that was...(BELL RINGS)... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen.CRUZ: Hold on. He \u2014 he attacked me, Wolf. I get a response.BLITZER: I was about to say \u2014 Senator Cruz, respond.CRUZ: Thank you. Thank \u2014 thank \u2014 thank you very much.You know, it\u2019s interesting \u2014 Donald went \u2014 went on \u2014 on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn\u2019t respond to any of the substance. He has yet to say \u2014 he can release past year\u2019s tax returns. He can do it tomorrow.He doesn\u2019t want to do it, because presumably there\u2019s something in there...TRUMP: Nothing.CRUZ: ... that is bad. If there\u2019s nothing, release them tomorrow.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: They\u2019re already prepared. The only reason he\u2019s not releasing them...TRUMP: You \u2014 you don\u2019t...CRUZ: ... is because he\u2019s afraid that he will get hit.TRUMP: I\u2019m not afraid (inaudible).CRUZ: You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. It\u2019s a fraud case. His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...(BELL RINGS)... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud. You don\u2019t think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?BLITZER: All right (ph)...CRUZ: If \u2014 we\u2019ve got to win this election, and we can\u2019t do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can\u2019t take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.BLITZER: Mr. Trump. Mr, \u2014 hold on. Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... first of all, he\u2019s talking about the polls. I\u2019m beating him awfully badly in the polls.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: But you\u2019re not beating Hillary. You\u2019re not beating Hillary.TRUMP: Well, then, if I can\u2019t \u2014 if \u2014 hey, if I can\u2019t beat her, you\u2019re really going to get killed, aren\u2019t you?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: So \u2014 so let me ask you this, because you\u2019re really getting beaten badly. I know you\u2019re embarrassed \u2014 I know you\u2019re embarrassed, but keep fighting \u2014 keep swinging, man (ph). Swing for the fences.Let me just tell you \u2014 let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a \u2014 it\u2019s a civil case. It\u2019s a case where people want to try and get \u2014 it\u2019s a case that is nonsense.It\u2019s something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don\u2019t want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed \u2014 most \u2014 many \u2014 many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.As \u2014 and believe me, I\u2019ll win that case. That\u2019s an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I\u2019m being audited. It\u2019s a very routine audit, and it\u2019s very unfair, because I\u2019ve been audited for, I think, over 12 years.Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I\u2019m being audited \u2014 which is a very large company.(BELL RINGS)BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: I\u2019m being audited 12 years in a row, at least.Now, until that audit\u2019s done, and I don\u2019t think anybody would blame me, I\u2019m not giving it...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ... the years you\u2019re not being audited? Will you release those years?BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.TRUMP: (inaudible) audited for those years.CRUZ: Which years? Which years are you being audited?BLITZER: Gentlemen...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: ... we actually have rules \u2014 we\u2019re trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed. We\u2019re going to take a quick break. We have a lot more \u2014 many more critically important issues to discuss.Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security. And Mr. Trump, I\u2019ll begin with you.TRUMP: Shocking.(LAUGHTER)BLITZER: You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians \u2014 I\u2019m quoting you now: \u201cLet me be sort of a neutral guy. I don\u2019t want to say whose fault it is, I don\u2019t think it helps.\u201dTRUMP: Right.BLITZER: Here\u2019s the question. How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East?TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think they do under President Obama because I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I\u2019ve received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.As president, however, there\u2019s nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It\u2019s probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn\u2019t help if I start saying, \u201cI am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.And I can\u2019t do that as well \u2014 as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I\u2019m taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.BLITZER: Senator Cruz?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald\u2019s word, between Israel and the Palestinians.Let me be clear. If I\u2019m president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.(APPLAUSE)And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent. When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.Just today, Iran announced they\u2019re going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald\u2019s answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this \u2014 if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I can only say \u2014 look, I can only say I\u2019ve been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I\u2019ve received many, many awards from Israel, as I\u2019ve said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I\u2019m going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.BLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.KASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I\u2019ve been a supporter of Israel \u2014 a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn\u2019t give as much money as Donald gave, but I\u2019ve been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one \u2014 are moving because they\u2019re not sure what we will do.It\u2019s a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.When we stand firm and we let the world know who we\u2019re with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: We\u2019re going to get to North Korea in a moment. But Senator Rubio, what\u2019s wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?RUBIO: Because \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if Donald realizes this. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not his intent perhaps. But the position you\u2019ve taken is an anti-Israel position. And here\u2019s why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here\u2019s what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here\u2019s what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going to sit here and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not on either side.\u201d I will be on a side. I will be on Israel\u2019s side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I\u2019m a negotiator. I\u2019ve done very well over the years through negotiation. It\u2019s very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I\u2019ll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s not going down \u2014 excuse me...RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?RUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.TRUMP: OK, no, no, no \u2014 a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you\u2019re dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?TRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it\u2019s not a real estate deal...TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...BLITZER: ... Senator.TRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.BLITZER: Let\u2019s move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.Let\u2019s be clear. Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?KASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That\u2019s what it means. Even though there\u2019s so much chaos in North Korea right now, there\u2019s a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.But, look, here\u2019s what I think we ought to do \u2014 like, immediately. And, we\u2019ve been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don\u2019t know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they\u2019re not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don\u2019t have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we\u2019re now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.But, when I say regime change, I don\u2019t have to talk exactly what that means. Look, I\u2019ve been involved in national security for a long time. You don\u2019t have to spell everything out, but what I\u2019m telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we\u2019re doing is beginning to work against them.They are the key to being able to settle this situation.BLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...KASICH: ... I\u2019m very well aware of that.BLITZER: A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?KASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I\u2019ll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we\u2019re going to face this sooner or later.But, in the meantime, I\u2019m also aware of the fact that there\u2019s 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don\u2019t just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we\u2019ve got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: One thing I\u2019d like to add to what the Governor\u2019s saying, I think that we are now in a position \u2014 are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it\u2019s going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.You order televisions, you order almost anything, you\u2019re getting it from these countries. Whether it\u2019s a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it\u2019s an air conditioning unit. They\u2019re coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they\u2019re making less, but they\u2019re making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day.(BELL RINGING)We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...BLITZER: Dr. Carson.KASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we\u2019re all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We\u2019re all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.(BELL RINGING)We can\u2019t have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...BLITZER: ... Thank you...KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don\u2019t get time. I\u2019m going to whine because I didn\u2019t get asked about taxes, I didn\u2019t get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you\u2019re going to be fair to everybody, you didn\u2019t ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.Now...BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the whole year. And they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the next year and the next year. They didn\u2019t find anything and they won\u2019t find anything because I\u2019m a very honest person.But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.(APPLAUSE)And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn\u2019t find a single one who didn\u2019t think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it\u2019s like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. We\u2019re going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?TRUMP: I really don\u2019t because it not working and the countries aren\u2019t agreeing to it and the rebels aren\u2019t agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It\u2019s a meaningless ceasefire.I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of \u2014 with a total cessation. But it\u2019s not working, as you know very well. It\u2019s not working. If \u2014 we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.HEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.CRUZ: Well look. We\u2019re certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there\u2019s reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama\u2019s weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as we\u2019re headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry \u2014 Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we\u2019re not in a strong position to win the general election.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.TRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...CRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.TRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that\u2019s concerned. You know it and so do I.CRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.TRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. TRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, he\u2019s saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.If these politicians went to the beach and didn\u2019t do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we\u2019d be \u2014 at least they killed terrorists, all right?And I\u2019m not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it\u2019s a total mess.We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn\u2019t topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?And I argued if it takes a long time, you\u2019re going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s where the term \u201clead from behind\u201d came. And that\u2019s the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn\u2019t appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.I couldn\u2019t imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we\u2019re asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he\u2019s saying these guys need to do more.South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And here\u2019s why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.They can do that very quickly. And that\u2019s what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can\u2019t walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.HEWITT: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...RUBIO: How much?TRUMP: A lot. I\u2019ll negotiate a lot more money than you\u2019ll ever get.As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it\u2019s a disaster for Israel. I\u2019m no fan of John Kerry.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.Senator Cruz.You can see and hear the exact words from Donald\u2019s mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry\u2019s foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That\u2019s why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.And I\u2019ll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?If you care about Israel, you don\u2019t write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: There\u2019s a critical point that needs to be made here.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has a right to respond.TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you\u2019re politicians, all talk, no action.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I\u2019ve been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.CRUZ: Then name one specific thing you\u2019ve done.TRUMP: What I\u2019ve seen up here \u2014 I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...RUBIO: This guy always goes for...TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He can\u2019t do it...RUBIO: This is so typical.TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he can\u2019t do it because he doesn\u2019t know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen.Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please? (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)KASICH: There\u2019s something \u2014 I want to \u2014 I want to point out something here today that is \u2014 it\u2019s so critically important \u2014 about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they\u2019re sitting in the catbird seat.We should have been helping them. I\u2019m thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.Now, let\u2019s talk about Libya. Libya didn\u2019t go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.And let me just say to you \u2014 we have ISIS beginning get \u2014 get a foothold in Libya. We\u2019re gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. They\u2019re on the coast, which \u2014 mostly, it\u2019s desert, but it\u2019s a problem.Then we have ISIS in \u2014 in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq. Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit \u2014 one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...BLITZER: All right...KASICH: ... and we\u2019re going to have to work our way out of it, including...BLITZER: Let\u2019s continue.KASICH: ... the need to arm the Ukrainians. They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...BLITZER: Let us continue.KASICH: ... and assert ourselves as America.BLITZER: Let\u2019s continue the questioning on ISIS. Maria.CRUZ: Hold on, Wolf. You said I got a response.BLITZER: You\u2019ll have a chance. Maria will pick up...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Hold on. He called me a liar. You\u2019re saying I can\u2019t respond to being called a liar?(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Go ahead and respond.CRUZ: You know, what we\u2019re seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington \u2014 the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.And so that\u2019s Donald\u2019s pattern over and over again. He said, for example, seven months ago \u2014 this is Donald speaking, quote \u2014 \u201cI, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment.\u201dThere\u2019s a reason Harry Reid thinks he\u2019s the best Republican up here. There\u2019s a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...(BELL RINGS)... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable. And every time anyone points at Donald\u2019s actual record...BLITZER: Thank you.CRUZ: ... what he said on national television, Donald yells \u201cliar.\u201d Let me tell you something \u2014 falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.CRUZ: ... and it\u2019s something Donald does daily.BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I watched \u2014 I watched...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race \u2014 he has left Iowa and he\u2019s out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful.And got a lot of votes because of that \u2014 a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it.I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, \u201cVoter Violation,\u201d and then it graded you...(BELL RINGS)... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in politics.(BELL RINGS)To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.BLITZER: Senator Cruz...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know politicians \u2014 I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it\u2019s not good.CRUZ: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you\u2019ve been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way...TRUMP: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... the reason is \u2014 you\u2019re welcome to have the check back.TRUMP: I funded this guy. I gave him a check.CRUZ: Yeah, you gave me $5,000.TRUMP: I gave him a check. He never funded me.CRUZ: And \u2014 and by the way, let\u2019s be clear.(APPLAUSE)Donald claims \u2014 Donald claims to care about...TRUMP: You know why? I didn\u2019t want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They\u2019re very confusing.TRUMP: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re doing a great job. I have his book.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Thank you \u2014 thank you for the book. Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.TRUMP: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.(APPLAUSE)Thank \u2014 thank you for the book. I really appreciate (ph).CRUZ: Donald \u2014 Donald, relax.TRUMP: Go ahead. I\u2019m relaxed. You\u2019re the basket case.(CROSSTALK)Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald...TRUMP: Go ahead. Don\u2019t get nervous.CRUZ: (inaudible)...TRUMP: Go ahead.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: I promise you, Donald, there\u2019s nothing about you...TRUMP: I\u2019ve seen you.CRUZ: ... that makes anyone nervous.TRUMP: You\u2019re losing so badly you \u2014 I want to...CRUZ: You know, people are actually watching this at home.TRUMP: ... I \u2014 you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen.CRUZ: Wolf, I\u2019m going to ask my time not be deducted when he\u2019s yelling at me.BLITZER: You\u2019ve gotta stop this.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: The latest debate \u2014 gentlemen, please.CRUZ: Hold on, I\u2019m going to get my answer. He doesn\u2019t get to yell the whole time. BLITZER: I want to move \u2014 I want to move on. These are the rules.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time. Am I allowed to...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Wolf, do I not get a response? Do I not get a response without being interrupted?BLITZER: You\u2019ll get \u2014 you\u2019ll get plenty of response, so stand by.CARSON: My name was mentioned.BLITZER: I want to talk \u2014 I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government \u2014 how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.BLITZER: There\u2019s a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government. The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers. And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge\u2019s order.Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.BASH: Senator Rubio, you say it\u2019s complicated, and that, quote, \u201cApple isn\u2019t necessarily wrong to refuse the court order.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t investigators have everything at their disposal?RUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing \u2014 the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago \u2014 the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, \u201cWe\u2019re being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.\u201d That is not accurate.The only thing they\u2019re being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that\u2019s in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.And I think they should comply with that. If that\u2019s all they\u2019re asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.BASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.RUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.BASH: But just to be clear \u2014 just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?RUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?BASH: Correct.RUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didn\u2019t even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer\u2019s employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all they\u2019re asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn\u2019t want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?CRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. He\u2019s now agreeing with me. And so I\u2019m glad.What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone\u2019s cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn\u2019t have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?CARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.(APPLAUSE)You know, we have the \u2014 we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And that\u2019s why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.So absolutely, I would \u2014 I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don\u2019t comply with that, you\u2019re encouraging chaos in our system.BASH: Mr. Trump...(APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where\u2019s the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don\u2019t litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you\u2019re the president? You lock the door and you say you\u2019re not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.And I\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time. Because as an executive, you\u2019ve got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.ARRASAS: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Thank you.ARRARAS: Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat. You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn\u2019t? Isn\u2019t that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?TRUMP: First of all, you\u2019re talking about a border that\u2019s many, many times longer. You\u2019re talking about a massive border.We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts \u2014 you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn\u2019t think this beautiful place \u2014 it\u2019s beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it\u2019s such a shame to see it.They\u2019re pouring in from the Southern border, so I\u2019m talking about great security. I\u2019m talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I\u2019ll build it on time, on budget. It\u2019ll be a very high wall, a great wall. It\u2019s going to be built, it\u2019s going to be built. It\u2019s going to be paid for by Canada, by the way \u2014 maybe I\u2019ll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.The problem with Canada, you\u2019re talking about a massively long piece. You\u2019re talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we \u2014 it is not our biggest problem. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it\u2019s the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRARAS: I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto Rico\u2019s in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it\u2019s debt of $72 billion dollars. Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that \u2014 the tools to restructure the debt. That is the same debt the other 50 states have.You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection. You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it\u2019s last resort. That that\u2019s where they are now. How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?RUBIO: Sure, because bankruptcy doesn\u2019t work unless you change the way you\u2019re operating, or you\u2019re going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it\u2019s economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.They\u2019re coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it\u2019s too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.This year alone, with all the problems they\u2019re having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they\u2019ve made to future generations to make payments.So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they\u2019re asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you\u2019re going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.They\u2019re United States citizens, they\u2019re obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...BLITZER: ... Senator, thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston. It\u2019s time now for closing statements. All of you will have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, we\u2019ll start with you.CARSON: Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And I\u2019m asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when?(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I\u2019ve done it in Washington, I\u2019ve done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we won\u2019t have to spend time figuring what we\u2019re going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Well, thank you for having us tonight. You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it\u2019s narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.RUBIO: The time for games is over.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.If I\u2019m elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. I will rip to shreds the Iranian \u2014 catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They\u2019re all talk, they\u2019re no action, nothing gets done. I\u2019ve watched it for years. Take a look at what\u2019s happening to our country.All of the things that I\u2019ve been talking about, whether it\u2019s trade, whether it\u2019s building up our depleted military, whether it\u2019s taking care of our vets, whether it\u2019s getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo. We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.Super Tuesday is only five days away.Right now Anderson Cooper picks up our special coverage \u2014 Anderson.COOPER: Wolf, thanks very much.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Delivery Start-Ups Face Road Bumps in Quest to Capture Untapped Market", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byDoorDash, one of a multitude of start-ups with a mobile app that lets people order and get food sent to their doorsteps, relies on contract drivers like Brian Navarro to make the deliveries. The problem is that workers like Mr. Navarro don\u2019t always stick around.\u201cDrivers do jump around,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe general consensus is that drivers really only stick around for three to six months.\u201dThat churn has become expensive for DoorDash. A large number of drivers left the start-up less than a year after they joined, according to two people who have seen the company\u2019s driver data. DoorDash spends upward of $200 in recruitment and referral bonuses for some drivers, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Other delivery companies, like Postmates and Instacart, face similar retention challenges, these people said.The issue is just one headache now troubling delivery start-ups, which have been among the hottest sectors of start-up activity in recent years. Based on a belief that the companies would succeed once they grew to enormous scale, investors poured more than $730 million into delivery firms like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, up more than 1,100 percent from the same period a year and a half ago, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm.But entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to find that the economics of making a delivery service work are far from easy.The problems are rooted in the high operating costs of the start-ups, which typically act as middlemen between consumers and restaurants or grocery stores. The companies not only have to pay for large fleets of drivers, they also have big groups of employees who receive customer orders from the apps and who then manually make calls to the restaurants to order food. At the same time, to attract customers, many of the start-ups offer introductory prices and discounts, often making delivery free for first-time users.As DoorDash\u2019s experience with drivers shows, the start-ups\u2019 costs don\u2019t necessarily decline over time. For some drivers, who are paid a fee per delivery, it can be difficult to make enough deliveries in an hour to make it financially worthwhile for them. And when drivers move on, the companies must spend again to recruit replacements.\u201cEnsuring drivers have the best possible experience on the DoorDash platform is one of our top priorities,\u201d Eitan Bencuya, a DoorDash spokesman, said in a statement. He said the company has proprietary technology that helps drivers increase the amount of deliveries they can make in a single trip, increasing their commissions per hour.\u201cPrivate companies doing last-mile delivery rely on charging high consumer fees, which make the services untenably expensive for the average consumer,\u201d Dean Prissman, an Internet analyst for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note to clients in October.Some investors said the start-ups have the potential to capture a relatively untapped multibillion-dollar market, one that is also being eyed by tech behemoths like Google, Amazon and Uber. The companies see opportunity in bringing delivery to millions of retailers and restaurants that do not now offer it, all for a slice of the fees.Alfred Lin, a partner at the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in DoorDash and Instacart, said the start-ups are also amassing a very valuable asset: consumers\u2019 purchasing data. \u201cThe advent of the smartphone gives a company the ability to track all the information about your purchasing habits, and where you are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dramatic what a company can do to utilize that information.\u201dMr. Lin compared DoorDash\u2019s trajectory to those of Netflix, Amazon and Zappos, which all required huge early spending toward a bet on future growth. He added that DoorDash is seeing a lot of growth now.\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of a premium service,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike the early days of Uber, when they only had black cars.\u201dMr. Lehmann said he imagines a future in which Postmates cuts deals with 60 to 70 percent of the restaurants in its app. As Postmates grows more popular, drivers will be able to make more deliveries to more people in shorter amounts of time, eventually earning them \u2014 and the company \u2014 more money.\u201cWe can and will be profitable as a company in 2017,\u201d he said.Mr. Lehmann added that its drivers do jump to adjacent services from time to time but frequently return to working for Postmates.DoorDash is trying to keep a lid on costs another way: By paying its drivers less per delivery. According to an email from the company to drivers that was reviewed by The New York Times, DoorDash said that starting on Monday, it would change the pay per delivery in Los Angeles to $5, down from $6, excluding tips.\u201cWe know this is an important change, so we want to be transparent about why we are making this adjustment,\u201d DoorDash said in the email. The company said drivers would make up what they lose in fee cuts through an increased order volume.Mr. Navarro, the driver in Los Angeles, said he could make only about two deliveries an hour, though that has increased at peak mealtimes.

Gets Ready to Unlock the Cable Box", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialEvery year, American cable-TV subscribers spend $231 on average to rent cable boxes that they should be able to buy outright, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars over several years. Consumers could soon have that option under an excellent proposal by the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.Mr. Wheeler wants the cable businesses like Comcast and Time Warner Cable and technology companies like Google and Amazon to jointly develop technical standards for cable devices. That would allow consumers to watch cable television on any device that meets those standards. Some manufacturers could build televisions that already incorporate a cable box. Or companies like Apple could refine software that will let people watch all cable TV on their phones and computers. Much of the technology needed to do this exists, and companies like Comcast and HBO are already using it to make some TV shows and movies available online.Regardless of what device people use, it would have to comply with the privacy and copyright protections that apply currently to cable boxes. This approach should make it easier for consumers to choose how they watch television, provided that the telecom and technology companies, which have had a testy relationship, can work together.Not surprisingly, the telecommunications industry is opposing Mr. Wheeler, arguing that his proposal amounts to needless government meddling that will stifle innovation. These are self-serving arguments by an industry that is, understandably, afraid of losing billions in revenue. It is important to remember that Mr. Wheeler\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t require consumers to make any changes. Anybody who is happy renting a cable box, can keep doing so.If the industry had its way, we would still be renting phones from the old Ma Bell. Allowing consumers to buy their own phones was one of the first steps the F.C.C. took in promoting new telecommunications technologies. Requiring cable-TV systems to make room for competing devices should similarly lead to a boom in new types of services and technologies.A new proposal from the F.C.C. would make easier for consumers to choose how they watch television.Advertisement"}

What I mean is: I have no idea what will happen.Here\u2019s the big thing I want to get to: Kanye West. Or more specifically, what Kanye is doing for Tidal, the streaming music service that most everyone thinks is completely doomed, save for Jay-Z, who owns the service, and a handful of pop stars who support it.Kanye teased his newest album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d this week before releasing it more widely through the classic modes of distribution \u2014 namely, the music labels. Tidal got an exclusive window in which the album is only available through its service, something that other stars have pledged to do on Tidal in the future. As a result, Tidal has shot to the top of the download charts on the App Store.So does this make Tidal a viable service? Can it actually have a shot with this celebrity practice of \u201cwindowing,\u201d something that other companies like Vessel are trying as well?About Tidal: Yes, I think that it can have a shot at getting subscribers with these high-profile, short-term exclusives \u2014 but I\u2019ve got to say, I really hate it. I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the terrible future of media: Lots of different services with slightly different libraries of stuff, so that consumers have to either get several of them or just live without access to certain entertainment (or wade into the sin of torrenting).This is already the case with TV. Unbundling and cutting the cord and Internet streaming was supposed to make everything cheap and available, but in fact I probably pay more for media today than I ever have. I like the exclusives on Netflix, Amazon, HBO enough that I subscribe to all three. They\u2019re all getting better, and I don\u2019t see myself relying on any single one of them for all my TV any time soon.That\u2019s probably going to happen with music, too. The highest-profile artists will always have an incentive to offer exclusivity periods to one or two services. We listeners are either going to have subscribe to several or just do without. I really, really, really like Taylor Swift. I agonized for months about whether to go with Apple Music, which has Taylor but an annoying interface and not-great playlists, or Spotify, which has a wonderful user interface and an amazing weekly playlist tailored to a user\u2019s tastes \u2014 but no Taylor.I chose Spotify in the end. But I really miss Taylor.But there is zero indication that structure will ever go away. Even \u00e0 la carte options in the TV world add up to ultimately be much more costly than it would be to buy a cable subscription. I don\u2019t think cord-cutting is worth it, unless you\u2019re willing to go all-in on one or two networks.And that\u2019s sort of the point, right? Independent networks exist because they look for the best content and differentiate themselves based on providing that content as a service. If you find the shows \u2014 or music, or whatever \u2014 good enough, you will pay for it.That\u2019s why I think exclusives and windowing is a fair practice, even if it is a pain for me having to sign up for a new service. In this case, it\u2019s the artists essentially fighting against Spotify and the labels which, in the former case, artists claim they see too little in royalties for each song played. In the latter case, artists see little after the labels and distributors take their cut. The whole reason Tidal exists is to put some of the leverage back in the hands of the artists themselves with their own distribution platform.The big problem with that is that there are not enough artists who create huge enough albums to maintain that leverage in the long term. There is only one Lady Gaga, only one Jay-Z, and so on. And if Apple can cut a deal with Taylor, Tidal loses even more leverage when it sees other huge pop stars work with competing services.In sum, Tidal is doomed, but I do think it is a noble effort. Maybe the artists will figure out a different way to gain leverage in the wake of physical album sales falling and profits from streaming music not able to make up for that gap.Or maybe not. I won\u2019t cry for Kanye. He\u2019s famous.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Have Fallen Faster and Further Than Broader Market", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the United States economy muddled along over the last few years, investors paid handsome sums to get in on high-flying technology companies that were among the few pockets of steady growth. Now comes the payback.As the stock market continues its 2016 slide, technology stocks are falling even further, victims of their own success as well as fears about the global economy and a slowdown in business spending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9.4 percent this year. The index\u2019s technology components are down about 12 percent, and the closely watched so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are down even further, falling 17 percent on average this year after an 83 percent rise in 2015.\u201cThey go faster on the way up, they go faster on the way down. That\u2019s about as simple as I can make it,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners.Shares of Twitter, the popular social media service, for example, are down about 40 percent so far this year. And some analysts worry it could tumble even more after the company announces quarterly results Wednesday afternoon.The overall market has been hit by a slowdown in China and a collapse in the price of oil prices and other commodities.Many technology companies continue to produce strong profits, and for the most part they have strong balance sheets with lots of cash to fund future growth. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for example, added close to $10 billion to its $73 billion cash reserve over the last year.But since these companies\u2019 shares are priced high relative to their profits \u2014 that is, because investors are willing to pay more now in hopes of getting in on future growth \u2014 they become more vulnerable when there is a broader market downturn.\u201cThe market is doing a general sell-off, everybody is looking at things,\u201d said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund. \u201cTech stocks are pretty expensive, so they are more prone to correction.\u201dTake, for instance, the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon and Facebook. P/E, as stock analysts call it, is a measurement of a company\u2019s stock price divided by earnings a share. For Amazon, that number is 388. Facebook? It\u2019s 78. But for the whole S.&P. 500, it is a more modest 17.Wage growth has been slow for years, but consumers always seemed to have enough for a new iPhone or to try out new gadgets like a FitBit, all while shifting more of their spending to online outlets like Amazon and Netflix. Businesses embraced cloud computing and bought ever more ads on Google and Facebook.No doubt, technology stocks were to some extent being lifted by the same low interest rates that had propelled the broader stock market, but they also had good stories to tell their investors, as well as the numbers to back it up.Now some investors are wondering how long they can keep it up in the face of slower growth. The economy ended last year on a whimper, expanding less than 1 percent for a number of reasons including weaker trade and falling business investment.Worried about a broader slowdown, investors have become quick to punish any company that looks as if its upward trajectory is flattening out, particularly if that company looks susceptible to the decline in businesses spending.That thinking helps explain big drops for LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, and Tableau Software, a maker of business software. Both companies have lost more than half their market value after weaker-than-expected revenue forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, the cloud software company, have been caught in the undertow and are down close to 30 percent this year.\u201cPeople are starting to anticipate a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and a slowdown in related technology spending,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.Still, with consumer spending and job growth remaining healthy, the market continues to give special consideration to consumer-focused companies that are making their numbers.Netflix also disappointed Wall Street with American subscriber growth that was lower than investors had hoped. The stock is down about 25 percent this year.What is not yet clear is how the decline in public company shares will affect the herd of tech \u201cunicorns,\u201d or private companies worth more than $1 billion, like the ride-hailing service Uber. Whatever the result, it is unlikely to be good.\u201cThat whole thing that you\u2019re going to hide out from the volatility in the public market \u2014 this is where they are going to find out that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, a technology investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Creating a Computer Voice That People Like", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byMichael Picheny, a senior manager at the Watson Multimodal Lab for IBM Research.When computers speak, how human should they sound?This was a question that a team of six IBM linguists, engineers and marketers faced in 2009, when they began designing a function that turned text into speech for Watson, the company\u2019s \u201cJeopardy!\u201d-playing artificial intelligence program.Eighteen months later, a carefully crafted voice \u2014 sounding not quite human but also not quite like HAL 9000 from the movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d \u2014 expressed Watson\u2019s synthetic character in a highly publicized match in which the program defeated two of the best human \u201cJeopardy!\u201d players.The challenge of creating a computer \u201cpersonality\u201d is now one that a growing number of software designers are grappling with as computers become portable and users with busy hands and eyes increasingly use voice interaction.Machines are listening, understanding and speaking, and not just computers and smartphones. Voices have been added to a wide range of everyday objects like cars and toys, as well as household information \u201cappliances\u201d like the home-companion robots Pepper and Jibo, and Alexa, the voice of the Amazon Echo speaker device.A new design science is emerging in the pursuit of building what are called \u201cconversational agents,\u201d software programs that understand natural language and speech and can respond to human voice commands.However, the creation of such systems, led by researchers in a field known as human-computer interaction design, is still as much an art as it is a science.It is not yet possible to create a computerized voice that is indistinguishable from a human one for anything longer than short phrases that might be used for weather forecasts or communicating driving directions.Most software designers acknowledge that they are still faced with crossing the \u201cuncanny valley,\u201d in which voices that are almost human-sounding are actually disturbing or jarring. The phrase was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. He observed that as graphical animations became more humanlike, there was a point at which they would become creepy and weird before improving to become indistinguishable from videos of humans.The same is true for speech.\u201cJarring is the way I would put it,\u201d said Brian Langner, senior speech scientist at ToyTalk, a technology firm in San Francisco that creates digital speech for things like the Barbie doll. \u201cWhen the machine gets some of those things correct, people tend to expect that it will get everything correct.\u201dBeyond correct pronunciation, there is the even larger challenge of correctly placing human qualities like inflection and emotion into speech. Linguists call this \u201cprosody,\u201d the ability to add correct stress, intonation or sentiment to spoken language.Today, even with all the progress, it is not possible to completely represent rich emotions in human speech via artificial intelligence. The first experimental-research results \u2014 gained from employing machine-learning algorithms and huge databases of human emotions embedded in speech \u2014 are just becoming available to speech scientists.Synthesized speech is created in a variety of ways. The highest-quality techniques for natural-sounding speech begin with a human voice that is used to generate a database of parts and even subparts of speech spoken in many different ways. A human voice actor may spend from 10 hours to hundreds of hours, if not more, recording for each database.The importance and difficulty of adding an intangible emotional quality can be seen in the 2013 science fiction movie \u201cHer,\u201d in which a lonely office worker played by Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with Samantha, the synthetic voice of an advanced computer operating system.That voice was ultimately portrayed by Scarlett Johansson, after the film\u2019s director Spike Jonze decided the voice of the original actress did not convey the romantic relationship between human and machine that he was trying to portray.The roots of modern speech synthesis technology lie in the early work of the Scottish computer scientist Alan Black, who is now a professor at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.Mr. Black acknowledges that even though major progress has been made, speech synthesis systems do not yet achieve humanlike perfection. \u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t have good controls over how we say to these synthesizers, \u2018Say this with feeling,\u2019 \u201d he said.For those like the developers at ToyTalk who design entertainment characters, errors may not be fatal, since the goal is to entertain or even to make their audience laugh. However, for programs that are intended to collaborate with humans in commercial situations or to become companions, the challenges are more subtle.These designers often say they do not want to try to fool the humans that the machines are communicating with, but they still want to create a humanlike relationship between the user and the machine.IBM, for example, recently ran a television ad featuring a conversation between the influential singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and the Watson program in which Mr. Dylan abruptly leaves the stage when the program tries to sing. Watson, as it happens, is a terrible singer.The advertisement does a good job of expressing IBM\u2019s goal of conveying a not-quite-human savant. They wanted a voice that was not too humanlike and by extension not creepy.\u201cJeopardy!\u201d was a particularly challenging speech synthesis problem for IBM\u2019s researchers because although the answers were short, there were a vast number of possible mispronunciation pitfalls.\u201cThe error rate, in just correctly pronouncing a word, was our biggest problem,\u201d said Andy Aaron, a researcher in the Cognitive Environments Laboratory at IBM Research.Several members of the team spent more than a year creating a giant database of correct pronunciations to cut the errors to as close to zero as possible. Phrases like brut Champagne, carpe diem and sotto voce presented potential minefields of errors, making it impossible to follow pronunciation guidelines blindly.The researchers interviewed 25 voice actors, looking for a particular human sound from which to build the Watson voice. Narrowing it down to the voice they liked best, they then played with it in various ways, at one point even frequency-shifting it so that it sounded like a child.\u201cThis type of persona was strongly rejected by just about everyone,\u201d said Michael Picheny, a senior manager at the Watson Multimodal Lab for IBM Research. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the voice to sound hyper-enthusiastic.\u201dThe researchers looked for a machine voice that was slow, steady and most importantly \u201cpleasant.\u201d And in the end, they, acting more as artists than engineers, fine-tuned the program. The voice they arrived at is clearly a computer, but it sounds optimistic, even a bit peppy.\u201cA good computer-machine interface is a piece of art and should be treated as such,\u201d Mr. Picheny said.As speech technology continues to improve, there will be new, compelling and possibly perturbing applications.Imperson, a software firm based in Israel that develops conversational characters for entertainment, is now considering going into politics. Imperson\u2019s idea is that during a campaign, a politician would be able to deploy an avatar on a social media platform that could engage voters. A plausible-sounding Ted Cruz or Donald Trump could articulate the candidate\u2019s positions on any possible subject.\u201cThe audience wants to have an interactive conversation with a candidate,\u201d said Eyal Pfeifel, co-founder and chief technology officer of Imperson. \u201cPeople will understand, and there will be no uncanny-valley problem.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an IBM researcher. He is Andy Aaron, not Aarons.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Embrace of the Serpent,\u2019 Ciro Guerra\u2019s Searching Tale About Invaded Amazon Cultures", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byNearly four decades later, the Colombian director Ciro Guerra, now 35, journeyed into the Amazon with a different approach. He arrived in the jungle with an anthropologist. The men explained the project to a shaman, who spent the night alone in the jungle, where, in Mr. Guerra\u2019s words, the healer carefully \u201cexplained the project to the forest.\u201dWhat some might have called superstition, Mr. Guerra simply sees as the cost of doing business in the Amazon.\u201cThis was not a production that could have entered into combat with the forest.\u201dFew filmmakers have dared to shoot in the Amazon, and those who have done so usually hewed to the theme of the white man who succumbs to madness in the jungle.Separate 20th-century journeys by two Westerners \u2014 Schultes and the social scientist Theodor Koch-Gr\u00fcnberg, who are here depicted in a hunt for a rare Amazonian plant \u2014 are the basis of Mr. Guerra\u2019s film. Their stories are told through the eyes of a skeptical native guide named Karamakate, who is searching for his tribe after a massacre and watches as his culture is decimated by Western invaders.Most of the film\u2019s actors, including Nilbio Torres, who plays Karamakate as a young man, are members of the Cubeo and Wanano, tribes that mostly live in small towns in southern Colombia, along the Brazilian border, and \u201chave a foot in both their world and ours,\u201d Mr. Guerra said. Only one had acted before; Spanish was often their second language, if not their third.Mr. Guerra spent three months training the cast in the art of performance, a process that he said was easier than he imagined because of the storytelling traditions of the tribe and their ability to listen. The script was written in Spanish, then translated \u2014 sometimes partly rewritten \u2014 by the actors into their own languages, nine in all.Sometimes cultures meet gently in this film, as when Karamakate listens to Haydn\u2019s \u201cThe Creation\u201d oratorio, played quietly in the jungle on a portable phonograph. It\u2019s a nod to \u201cFitzcarraldo,\u201d in which the rubber baron blasts opera arias into the jungle as his boat spins out of control.But mostly the cultures clash, a situation that becomes most real when Koch-Gr\u00fcnberg and Karamakate stumble across a group of children orphaned in an earlier massacre by rubber merchants. They are led by an aging monk, who beats Roman Catholicism into them with a whip and forbids their \u201cdemonic languages,\u201d forcing them to speak Spanish.Forty years later, when an older Karamakate returns, the scene is apocalyptic. A crucified body hangs from a tree. Catholicism and Spanish are gone, replaced by evangelical Christianity and Portuguese. The leader of these natives is another white man, who claims to be the messiah and talks of ordering his flock to commit mass suicide.Mr. Guerra said that character and those scenes are based on the history of a 19th-century zealot named Anizetto, whose thousands of followers were put down by the Brazilian military.\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon that has repeated itself many times there,\u201d the director said. \u201cThe Amazon is a spiritual place. People there are deeply spiritual. And when someone strips away the indigenous spirituality that\u2019s already there, it creates a vacuum that gets filled with fundamentalism and insanity.\u201dMr. Guerra said he thought the film would be his first and last set in the Amazon.Mr. Herzog, who returned to the jungle for a 1999 documentary, \u201cMy Best Fiend\u201d (a reference to the actor Klaus Kinski), that recounted his ordeal making \u201cFitzcarraldo\u201d and other films, now plays down the difficulties. In an email, he wrote: \u201cNo one should make a big deal about filming in the Amazon, it\u2019s just another forest.\u201dMr. Guerra has a different take.He spoke of the Cerros de Mavicure, three stone mounds that make up part of an old geological formation called the Guayana Shield in southeastern Colombia. In the film\u2019s final scene, Schultes and Karamakate climb the mounds and find the flowering plant they\u2019ve been searching for. The Amazon forest stretches far into the distance.\u201cI see it as a place that is charged with power,\u201d Mr. Guerra said.Advertisement"}

Appropriately enough, that year was notable for a rise in Hollywood\u2019s interest in American folk heroes, old and new.Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the Washington Post journalists who unearthed the Watergate scandal, became household names with \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men.\u201d Robert Altman cast Paul Newman as Buffalo Bill. Gordon Parks made a film about the folk singer Leadbelly, and Hal Ashby adapted Woody Guthrie\u2019s memoir, \u201cBound for Glory,\u201d with David Carradine starring as Guthrie. (The role had been dangled before Bob Dylan who, according to Mr. Ashby\u2019s biographer, turned it down but offered to direct.)Focusing on four years in the late 1930s, \u201cBound for Glory\u201d opens in a bleak Texas town with Woody haphazardly looking for ways to make a living \u2014 sign painting, mind reading, dabbling in music. In another context, he might have founded a religion. Abruptly, he deserts his wife (Melinda Dillon) and two small children and rides the rails to California, absorbing the vibe, living in migrant camps and entertaining the huddled masses.Shot by Haskell Wexler, who won an Oscar for cinematography that year, \u201cBound for Glory\u201d looks terrific. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful you can get a high from the dust,\u201d Pauline Kael ended her review in The New Yorker. An early use of the Steadicam promoted the illusion of immersion in the vast migrant camp constructed by the production designer Michael Haller. Many movies followed \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d (1967) in visualizing the Great Depression in the style of the photographers Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange. None were more successful in their simulation than \u201cBound for Glory.\u201dCharismatic but hardly likable, Mr. Carradine\u2019s Woody is driven by stubborn, selfish integrity. Even after he gets a radio gig as a hillbilly performer, he continues to sing out for the dispossessed. Resisting commercial (and family) pressures to conform, he quits his radio show, walks out on an audition and heads for New York. The movie sanitizes Mr. Guthrie\u2019s politics a bit and ends before he took New York lefties by storm, introduced as a \u201creal Dust Bowl refugee\u201d at a benefit \u201cGrapes of Wrath Evening\u201d \u2014 but then, the way Mr. Guthrie became an American symbol is the meaning of \u201cBound for Glory.\u201d\u201cBound for Glory\u201d was one of five films in 1976 focusing on the mythology of the hero \u2014 and antihero \u2014 that were nominated for best picture. But in the end, Mr. Ashby\u2019s film, along with \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cNetwork,\u201d which introduced the populist TV demagogue Howard Beale, fell short. The Academy was enamored of a more endearing folk tale: \u201cRocky.\u201dA New Deal inspirational in the tradition of \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d adapted from George Session Perry\u2019s novel \u201cHold Autumn in Your Hand,\u201d Mr. Renoir\u2019s film recounts a year in the hardscrabble life of a Texas tenant farmer (Zachary Scott) and his family. (The parallels to Mr. Guthrie\u2019s posthumously published novel, \u201cHouse of Earth,\u201d are so pronounced that some have speculated it was inspired by \u201cThe Southerner.\u201d)Even as an expos\u00e9 of rural poverty by a left-wing filmmaker, working from an adaptation by a future blacklisted writer, Hugo Butler, \u201cThe Southerner\u201d is notably devoid of politics. Like Mr. Renoir\u2019s 1936 short feature, \u201cA Day in the Country,\u201d or \u201cThe River,\u201d which he made in India after leaving the United States, \u201cThe Southerner\u201d is essentially pantheist.Mr. Renoir described \u201cThe Southerner\u201d as a work \u201cin which things and men, animals and Nature, all would come together in an immense act of homage to the divinity.\u201d (Satyajit Ray was much taken with the film, which in some ways anticipates his first feature, \u201cPather Panchali.\u201d) The landowners and bosses who embody the system are eclipsed as villains by the combined forces of floods, malnutrition and human nature \u2014 embodied by Mr. Scott\u2019s supremely ornery neighbor (J. Carrol Naish) and his feebleminded nephew (Norman Lloyd), a character developed by William Faulkner, who worked uncredited as Mr. Renoir\u2019s script adviser.In a review for The Nation, James Agee characterized \u201cThe Southerner\u201d as \u201cone of the most sensitive and beautiful American-made pictures I have seen,\u201d but he also called the film out for its inauthenticity \u2014 more in sorrow than anger, since he was a Southerner himself. As the author of \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Men,\u201d a document of the Dust Bowl-era American South featuring photographs by Mr. Evans, Mr. Agee took \u201cThe Southerner\u201d personally. He was not alone. The movie was banned in Tennessee and attacked throughout the South. A modest hit, it failed to win any Oscars, but it did take the Gold Lion at the first postwar (and post-Fascist) Venice Film Festival.Mastered from a U.C.L.A. restoration, the Blu-ray is well augmented with two extras: \u201cA Salute to France\u201d (1944), a bit of wartime propaganda made by Mr. Renoir with Garson Kanin, and \u201cThe River\u201d (1938), Pare Lorentz\u2019s influential New Deal documentary on managing the Mississippi.NEWLY RELEASEDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bruised San Bernardino Shows Cultural Stirrings", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported by6 PhotosSAN BERNARDINO, Calif. \u2014 When Juan Delgado, a poet and professor here, thinks about his beloved and beleaguered city, he often turns to the image of a dandelion, the much-maligned flower known for its deep roots and its ability to thrive under adverse circumstances. \u201cThe dandelion is not easily uprooted,\u201d he observes. \u201cIts beauty is persistence.\u201dThree years before the Dec. 2 terrorist attack in San Bernardino that took the lives of 14 people and wounded more than 20, Mr. Delgado, who teaches at California State University, San Bernardino, began collaborating with a photographer and fellow professor, Thomas McGovern, to document this city\u2019s scrappy allure. Their work, which has included exhibitions, a book and a public art project, is leading an effort outside traditional cultural institutions to reinvigorate and redefine the city through the arts \u2014 a movement that has drawn support from many quarters: from longtime residents, from political, cultural and religious leaders and from young art activists.In \u201cVital Signs,\u201d a collection of poems and photographs published by Heyday Books in 2013, Mr. Delgado, now 55, and Mr. McGovern, 58, made their first joint effort to \u201cvalidate that our community is worth knowing,\u201d Mr. McGovern said in an interview. Even before the news media descended, the city was bankrupt, a poster child for urban ills \u2014 the poorest city of its size in California and a haven for gang violence, drug addiction, foreclosures and political dysfunction. San Bernardino has long been known for nightmarish air pollution in which asthmatic children from low-income families breathe diesel fumes from cargo trains and trucks \u2014 what Mr. Delgado describes in a poem as \u201cthe forklift air.\u201dThe poet, who was born in Mexico, and Mr. McGovern, a onetime photo editor for The Village Voice, use artwork to chronicle an alternative San Berdoo, as the city is frequently called. It is the San Bernardino of exuberant Sunday morning swap meets, the one filled with hand-painted signs for butcher shops, groceries or western wear. Its commercial street murals, largely adorning Latino businesses, extend the Mexican muralist tradition to urban precincts in a county that has the third largest percentage of Latino residents in the United States.\u201cWe think of successful cities as makers of beauty,\u201d Mr. Delgado noted in a car ride through town with Mr. McGovern recently. \u201cBut it takes the ingenuity of people in hardship to bring art to our streets.\u201dThe pair\u2019s stubborn regard for their city \u2014 and their decision to stay, a message they give to their students \u2014 has encouraged artists like Michael Segura, 24, of Generation Now, a group of activists under the age of 30 who grew up here.The group started in 2013 in a get-out-the-vote drive in response to the city\u2019s bankruptcy. \u201cWe were miffed and wondering why the city was on a decline,\u201d Mr. Segura said. He and his young colleagues began taking on civic improvement projects, sprucing up parks and other neglected public spaces with murals and brightly painted fences. Mr. Segura now sits on the city\u2019s Fine Arts Commission, which is considering a Dec. 2 memorial to the fallen of their city.The group also provided elbow grease for the San Bernardino cultural center, which recently opened in a vintage adobe building and will house glass and pottery studios and a resident mariachi band.Much of the power of Mr. Delgado and Mr. McGovern\u2019s \u201cphoto-poetics,\u201d as they call it, is \u201ca straight, plain-spoken, handmade quality, which is very much like the city itself,\u201d said Jim Sweeters, the gallery director for California State University, Northridge, which recently exhibited their work.Referring to Mr. Delgado and Mr. McGovern, Patrick Morris, San Bernardino\u2019s mayor from 2006 to 2014, said: \u201cThis is a city that has some image issues, where people are suffering a lot. The two of them have done a brain-lift on us by celebrating the beauty in the landscape. It makes people begin to say, \u2018We have some special assets here.\u2019\u201dIn the poem \u201cWinds: For the People of San Bernardino,\u201d written shortly after the Dec. 2 massacre, Mr. Delgado describes a campus vigil, where five alumni were among those remembered:His poems address the immigrant experience and the needs that so often accompany it. \u201cShe is behind your shoulder, a blind spot, your city\u2019s poverty,\u201d he writes in one poem.Born in Guadalajara, Mr. Delgado moved to California at age 5. He recalls the stigma of wearing \u201cjunk store outfits\u201d as a boy. Now director of the creative writing program at the university and its interim provost, Mr. Delgado and his wife, Jean Douglas Delgado, raised three children here. \u201cMy daughter would come home from school and say, \u2018Dad, we had another pepper spray day\u2019 \u2014 meaning fights,\u201d he explained.From the mountains, where he now lives, the city fans out in perfect symmetry along Baseline, a street named for the original survey line back when this was a Mormon settlement.It is an illusory perspective, he knows: In the San Bernardino of his poetry, a woman dies on a park bench, her death recorded by the cameras mounted on streetlights. Trash bins breed fruit flies that \u201chovered among the tossed-away produce boxes.\u201dYet even amid the overturned grocery carts and wind-tossed plastic bags, Mr. Delgado and Mr. McGovern find much to admire, including telephone poles plastered with notices for boxing matches and lost dogs. \u201cThey\u2019re the first Internet,\u201d Mr. Delgado said.But the charming signs, like a pair of scissors and a comb painted on the side of a beauty salon, are frequently accompanied by graffiti, chain-link fencing and signs of vandalism. Desolation is not nostalgic.Throughout the Inland Empire, as this region of Southern California is known, the country\u2019s e-commerce culture has given rise to an eerie, increasingly anonymous landscape of strip malls and distribution warehouses for Amazon and other companies.Challenging economic times have led to the demise of local establishments like Irene\u2019s Market, where an anonymous street artist recently painted onto a boarded-up window a woman kneeling in prayer. Mr. McGovern is motivate by the disappearance of these hand-painted emblems.Defining the nature of a place is the first step in making it home, Mr. Delgado observed in \u201cWinds.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a new civic identity,\u201d Mr. Delgado said, \u201crather than someone from CNN telling us who we are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Aiken, Who Championed Authors in Digital Era, Dies at 56", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byPaul Aiken, who as executive director of the Authors Guild began parrying digital-era challenges to copyrights and royalties nearly two decades ago, died on Jan. 29 at his home in Manhattan. He would have been 57 two days later.The cause was complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, his wife, Stefanie Rosenfeld, said.In 1993, even before Amazon went online or Google was incorporated, Mr. Aiken, as a dispirited lawyer producing a baseball trivia calendar on the side, joined the Guild and started generating news releases that presaged the portents of electronic publishing.First he criticized a publisher for agreeing to pay authors only 5 percent of proceeds for digital rights. Then he warned facetiously that a page-turning copying machine would take \u201cthe drudgery out of copyright infringement.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s funny,\u201d Mr. Aiken recalled last year in the Authors Guild Bulletin, \u201cis that these two news releases brought up topics that we would revisit again and again over the next 20 years: publishers being cheap and unfair in paying for digital rights, and technology, particularly scanning technology, threatening to undermine the entire book market.\u201dIn 2005, the Guild joined in a suit against Google for scanning copyrighted books without permission, but a proposed $125 million settlement was overturned by a federal judge, who ruled in Manhattan that the scanning constituted fair use under the law.The author Scott Turow, one of seven Guild presidents under whom Mr. Aiken served, said Mr. Aiken \u201cbelieved passionately, like the Framers, that copyright was the key to maintaining the class of independent authors who are essential in a democracy, and he fought with fervor and imagination to bolster writers\u2019 livelihoods and to defend them from the many who scheme to reduce the value of the written word.\u201dIn every case, Mr. Aiken rebutted the argument that copyright impeded progress and defended the principle that creative artists should be rewarded for their works.During Mr. Aiken\u2019s tenure, the Guild also embraced his suggestion to compile an Authors Registry to find authors of so-called orphaned works that publishers and producers sought to mine or reissue.\u201cI can tell you what all authors like,\u201d he said in 2008. \u201cThey like their books to be read, and except for the most financially perverse of authors, they like a good royalty check.\u201dPaul Daymond Aiken was born in Chicago on Jan. 31, 1959. His father, Daymond, was a mathematics professor. His mother, the former Marion Kuebler, taught English. She survives him.Besides his wife and mother, he is survived by his children, Melanie, Wil and Andrew John; his brothers, Greg and Judd; and his sisters, Amy-Jo Zdroik and Deeda Aiken.Mr. Aiken earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in science from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., in 1981, graduated from Cornell University Law School, and worked at Kornstein, Veisz & Wexler in New York, where he met Robin Davis Miller, who recruited him in 1993 after she became the Authors Guild\u2019s executive director.Mr. Aiken succeeded her in 1995. He served until 2014, when he resigned because of his illness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Millennial Men, Gray Hair Is Welcome", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOn two magazine covers the singer Zayn Malik has graced in the last few months \u2014 for Billboard and L\u2019Uomo Vogue (as well as the racy video with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid) \u2014 he looks every bit the young brooding pop star. The requisite smoldering stare, perfectly manicured stubble and bad boy tattoos are all in tow.And then there\u2019s the hair.They\u2019re not alone.\u201cMen are embracing color more in a general way,\u201d said Amie Rau, a stylist at Matthew Morris Salon in Denver, who dyed Mr. Kenworthy\u2019s hair. \u201cThis is an extension of that.\u201dBoth Mr. Malik and Mr. Kenworthy declined to be interviewed for this article.Ms. Rau said that since their first session, Mr. Kenworthy had brought in an image of a young woman with dyed gray hair as inspiration. \u201cHe kept asking me, \u2018Is it crazy that I want to do this?\u2019\u201dGray and silver hair has definitely been trending, said Aura Friedman, a senior hair colorist at Sally Hershberger Salon in New York. \u201cThe demographic of guys who come to me to go gray are doing it more as a fashion statement,\u201d she said, as opposed to a more natural look. Ms. Friedman has dyed the hair of Phillip Picardi, the digital editorial director of Teen Vogue, and Drew Elliott, the chief creative officer for Paper magazine, among others.Interest definitely seems to be up. A representative from Amazon said it had seen a threefold increase in the last year in customers searching for gray hair dye.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an ironic statement, especially when the wearer is noticeably young and probably years away from natural graying,\u201d said Michael Fisher, creative director of men's wear at Fashion Snoops, the trend forecasting agency. \u201cIt\u2019s just another bold way to stand out from the crowd.\u201d\u201cGray is the favorite color I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was unique and fun, but it\u2019s not eye catching in the way that like lilac or mint was. When I had those colors, I felt like everyone was looking at me. With gray, I felt like I was trying on a new look but it was also relatively natural.\u201dCelebrities aren\u2019t the only ones to take the plunge. \u201cI\u2019ve always been confident, but now I feel more fun and cooler,\u201d Michael Vasquez, a 30-year-old senior business analyst, said of his artificial gunmetal hue, now several months old. \u201cI really love it. I feel sexier.\u201dAdmittedly, part of that is because of the positive response he received from friends and on social media, getting 90 \u201clikes\u201d on his Instagram account. \u201cOf course, my mom doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d Mr. Vasquez said with a laugh.Achieving the silver fox look is an involved process. \u201cIn the industry we call it a bleach and tone or a double process,\u201d Ms. Friedman said, referring to a two-part procedure in which the hair is first stripped of its natural pigment and then colored, an undertaking that can last eight hours and is often costly.While there is a range in prices depending on hair length and color, Ms. Friedman estimated that going gray would start at $350 at most salons. (She estimated a session for her services would be $600.) And that doesn\u2019t take into account upkeep. \u201cIt does require a lot of maintenance, going back to the salon for touch-ups and conditioning it at home with the right products in between appointments,\u201d she said.The continued care also requires commitment, Ms. Rau said. \u201cIt\u2019s like owning a pet,\u201d she said.However, because there are so many shades of gray \u2014 from those with bluish undertones to more natural variations \u2014 the color must be versatile enough to compliment a variety of skin tones.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got gray hair, every move you make seems \u2018young\u2019 and \u2018spry,\u2019\u201d Andy Warhol said in his 1975 book \u201cThe Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again)\u201d to explain his decision to dye his hair gray in his early 20s, a look that became his calling card. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re getting a new talent.\u201dWhile there aren\u2019t many precedents for young men co-opting the hoary coifs of their elders, trendsetting women like the fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson, the pop star Grimes and Tilda Swinton have all embraced a faux gray. \u201cIt has nothing to do with wanting to look old,\u201d said Mr. Fisher of Fashion Snoops. \u201cWe are in the midst of a time when guys are breaking their own boundaries and really finding new ways to express themselves. Having gray hair plays right into that.\u201dLike Warhol, men of the Instagram era know that having a visual signature can be beneficial. \u201cIt was never like part of some play for my \u2018brand,\u2019\u201d Mr. Oakley said. \u201cBut as someone in a creative field, I thought, \u2018Well, why can\u2019t I do this?\u2019\u201dThanks to endorsements from style-savvy celebrities and the growing popularity among the fashion cognoscenti, going gray is likely to hit a tipping point. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how many men have contacted me,\u201d Ms. Rau said of the response to Mr. Kenworthy\u2019s gray unveiling on Instagram.Mr. Fisher, however, isn\u2019t so sure of its sustainability as a stylistic movement. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another part of personal expression like bleaching, mermaid hair and even man buns.\u201dMr. Oakley had another reason for thinking the trend might not last: the upkeep. While he has thought about going gray again, nowadays, he said, \u201cI\u2019m too lazy for all that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Streamlining the Universal Remote Device", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byGadgetwiseIF you\u2019re of a certain age, you may recall what you had to do to watch television: You turned the set on.Today, things are much more complicated. With HDTV, separate audio receivers, Blu-ray players, game consoles, streaming media players, and cable or satellite set-top boxes, simply turning on the TV feels like operating a console at NASA\u2019s mission control.The idea of a \u201cuniversal remote,\u201d one device that can control everything in your home theater setup, is not new. But too often, products that have claimed to be universal have failed to deliver.To get them to work, users often have had to manually enter codes for each device. And even when that\u2019s successful, many important commands are buried in a remote screen\u2019s submenus, making them cumbersome to operate.\u201cThat\u2019s not an inaccurate assessment,\u201d said Ian Crowe, director of marketing for Logitech\u2019s Harmony, makers of the most popular universal remotes. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard problems endlessly about how it\u2019s been impossible to program them. A universal remote only made your coffee table look nicer.\u201dMr. Crowe says he believes the company\u2019s current lineup has solved many of the category\u2019s problems. And app developers and television manufacturers have also looked at the category, coming up with different solutions in a world of huge entertainment choices coming from a wide variety of programming sources.The $350 Elite is the flagship product of Logitech\u2019s Harmony line.To set it up, users pair Harmony\u2019s smartphone app or the included remote with the Elite\u2019s hub, a black flying-saucerlike device that sends infrared, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals to a home theater\u2019s various components.Any devices connected to your home network, such as a Sonos system, a Roku streaming video box or a smart TV, are automatically configured in the Harmony remote. Non-networked devices, such as a cable box, Blu-ray player or standard HDTV, are added manually. Once the various devices are recognized, the system automatically assigns functions to different keys.Unlike with earlier Harmony products, the company\u2019s database now includes comprehensive information on home theater products. It knows, for example, how many HDMI inputs one particular receiver has, or how long it takes for a device to power on before it\u2019s ready to accept commands.The Elite can also control other connected home devices, like thermostats, Philips\u2019s Hue lighting system or smart door locks. Activities can then be programmed that combine multiple functions. For example, selecting \u201ccocktail hour\u201d on the remote\u2019s touch screen could automatically turn down the lights, close the curtains and turn on one\u2019s Sonos system to play a cool jazz channel.The Elite can be controlled by the included remote, which also displays icons for favorite channels, or its smartphone app.The smartphone, with its Swiss army knife versatility, seems the perfect tool to use to create a universal remote interface. The problem for iPhone users, however, is that iPhones send only Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals, while standard home theater components communicate using infrared (or IR).The Pronto ($50 retail) solves that problem by acting as a go-between, receiving the iPhone\u2019s (or Android phone\u2019s) signals, and then transmitting mostly infrared ones.The black Pronto, which looks a lot like a salt shaker, is placed within line of sight of one\u2019s home theater components. If it has to be hidden, an IR-receiver wire can be connected to the Pronto and kept exposed.The system is configured using the free Peel app, versions of which are available for the iPhone, Android phones and the Apple watch. Components are added manually to the app and then grouped together to create an activity, such as watching TV or playing a Blu-ray disk.To eliminate the need to figure out what channel a program is on, the Peel app also features an illustrated list of popular shows organized by genre. Touching the image automatically selects the proper channel, based on which cable or satellite system you use.Because the Pronto receives signals from the Peel app using the iPhone\u2019s Bluetooth signal, only one iPhone at a time can be designated the home\u2019s universal remote. If you want to use a second iPhone, you have to unpair the first one.The Pronto transmits only IR signals and it cannot be used with devices that communicate using only Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, like Amazon\u2019s Fire TV.The Peel app can be used without the Pronto interface by owners of certain Android phones, which can transmit IR signals. They include models from HTC, LG, Samsung and ZTE . In addition, the Peel app is introducing direct functionality for certain devices connected to the Internet, such as connected TVs and Sonos Systems.Manufacturers like LG and Samsung are combining the power of their Internet-connected HDTV models and their remotes to provide a degree of unified functions.LG HDTV owners can use the company\u2019s Magic Remote to send voice or text commands to search for desired programs. The Internet-connected TV will display appropriate content regardless of whether it is streaming or broadcast.Users can also set up the supplied remote to control basic functions of common devices, such as set-top boxes, Blu-ray players and audio receivers.Later this year, Samsung will introduce a revamped Smart Control remote for some of its 2016 model TVs. Using the company\u2019s connected Smart Hub technology, the control can be used to tap into multiple sources of programming displayed across its screen.The remote will automatically identify and control different sources, such as a Blu-ray player, TV or video game console.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nielsen Plays Catch-Up as Streaming Era Wreaks Havoc on TV Raters", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byDennis Cheatham said he felt as if he were receiving a message from the past last May when a package arrived in the mail from Nielsen asking him to participate in the survey that for decades has detailed the television viewing habits of Americans. \u201cI just kind of shoved it in there and wrote Netflix wherever I could,\u201d said Mr. Cheatham, 40, a professor of graphic design at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. \u201cIs Nielsen not paying attention to technology? Don\u2019t they notice that something has changed?\u201dMr. Cheatham is not the only one asking that question.The stakes are high. Some $70 billion in advertising dollars are traded in the United States each year based on Nielsen\u2019s ratings, and hundreds of television programs live or die based on that viewership data.Chief among the complaints about Nielsen is that viewers across the country like Mr. Cheatham and his family are streaming billions of hours of video on outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, but that their behavior is not being captured in industry ratings based on Nielsen data.\u201cThe TV ratings system as we know it is outdated,\u201d said Tim Nollen, a Macquarie analyst.Nielsen executives promise that they are paying attention and are ready and able to track the myriad ways people consume media. They also underscore that paper diaries are deployed to measure viewing in local television markets, which account for a small part of the business, and that panels with more sophisticated electronic meters measure national viewing.\u201cWe\u2019re not arrogant about the landscape and about the needs of marketers and media companies and agencies to have better, more comprehensive data,\u201d said Steve Hasker, Nielsen\u2019s global president chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019re much more focused on meeting those needs and executing against our road map than we are looking over our shoulder.\u201dFor a long time, the only real recourse television and ad executives had was to grumble. They still relied on and paid for Nielsen measurement because it was their main option.Whether any of the new players will dethrone Nielsen is unclear. Some industry analysts like Mr. Nollen and other executives said that because of its legacy, Nielsen remained best positioned to provide a single source of ratings data across TV and digital. Others question whether ratings will even be relevant in a not-too-distant digital future, when ads are bought and sold based on specific data about viewers, such as location, occupation, salary and purchases, rather than broad audience metrics.\u201cThe road is littered with the roadkill of companies that have tried to compete with Nielsen over the years,\u201d said Alan Wurtzel, president of research at Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal. \u201cNow, some of these new entities might wind up being able to do things in a way that Nielsen can\u2019t. If they have figured out a better mousetrap, they could give the industry something to seriously think about.\u201dIn the last year, Nielsen has released 69 new products and technology innovations \u2014 most notably introducing a measurement called total audience metric to track TV viewing across video on demand, mobile and streaming.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Yet Nielsen is established on an inherent conflict that can impede the adoption of new measurement methods. Nielsen is paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year by the television industry that it measures. And that industry, which uses Nielsen\u2019s ratings to sell ads, is known to oppose changes that do not favor it. \u201cPeople want us to innovate as long as the innovation is to their advantage,\u201d Mr. Hasker said.Some television and advertising executives have said that Nielsen has started to address their concerns. CBS, for instance, announced in September that it was working with Nielsen to measure viewers across streaming and mobile.Another major initiative from Nielsen was the expansion of its national television ratings panel, which deploys electronic devices to track minute-by-minute viewing. To capture more diverse and splintering audiences, the company increased its panel to nearly 41,000 households, or about 100,000 people, from 21,000 households. Again, some executives said that the change came too late. When it is possible to track the websites people visit, what products they buy and which shows they stream, advertisers say they are seeking much more detailed information.Mr. Hasker said that Nielsen was exploring ways to incorporate more digital data, like Facebook registration information and direct feeds from set-top boxes, into its ratings.The battle between the old and the new measurement establishment already is playing out across the local television market, which is measured separately from the national market. For years, Nielsen deployed its paper diaries to measure viewing. Rentrak entered the market and won a number of clients by offering an alternative: using the data from set-top boxes to measure what people are watching on the television. After closing its deal with comScore, the new company is expected to include more complete and accurate digital viewing data by merging Rentrak\u2019s television metrics with comScore\u2019s digital data. But even that new method is not perfect. Some critics point to holes in Rentrak data, stating that set-top box measurement does not represent the total population.\u201cWe have heard from our clients across the industry, and the message has been very clear: Measurement needs to evolve,\u201d Serge Matta, comScore\u2019s chief, said Monday in announcing the closing of the merger.Nielsen plans to phase out the use of unreliable television diaries \u2014 like the one Mr. Cheatham received \u2014 in the local markets where they are used and replace them with more accurate electronic devices. The decision, Mr. Hasker said, was not spurred by the competition but was made because \u201cusing paper diaries in an increasingly digital world is an incredibly difficult thing to explain and justify.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Unicorn", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital.For a moment, there was no more prestigious endorsement for a technology start-up than joining the so-called Unicorn Club, consisting of more than 150 private technology companies valued at a billion dollars or more. Now, with valuations deflating, it\u2019s often viewed as more of a scarlet letter.However, because the only membership criterion is valuation, the members of this club have about as much in common with each other as a gram of gold has with a barrel of oil.Some private market valuations got ahead of themselves, requiring adjustment. But that\u2019s hardly remarkable; this happens frequently in public markets, too. The issue is that many unicorns are not sustainable; they have a shiny veneer of revenue growth, without a sufficiently durable competitive advantage to create substantial, long-term value.Several well-known Internet companies, particularly the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now a unit of Alphabet \u2014 have built powerful positions. The market recognized this by adding more than $250 billion in market cap to this group over the last 12 months \u2014 even while the broader market was down more than 10 percent.The huge success of the FANG stocks, however, distracts from the reality that the web has ground down the barriers to entry in many technology markets, increasing transparency and competition. For new entrants, lower barriers create opportunity. But they create the same chance for scores of other start-ups, too, making it challenging to build a durable advantage.Just when a firm seems to be getting a dominant foothold, a plethora of start-ups emerge to erode its advantage. Less than a year ago, GrubHub had a market cap of more than $4 billion and seemed to be on the way to a powerful monopoly in food delivery. But myriad start-ups, backed by billions of dollars, have been competing for its market. Investors no longer see GrubHub as a putative monopoly. Accordingly, its stock is down more than 60 percent over the last year.There are limited sources of genuine competitive advantage in Silicon Valley, as with other businesses. Most significant are economies of scale. McDonald\u2019s buys ingredients more cheaply than a stand-alone burger joint, and its marketing costs are spread across tens of millions of customers.For technology companies, the holy grail is a specially durable subset of scale advantage: network effects, virtually unknown in the rest of the economy. The most potent flavor is on the consumer side, where a service\u2019s utility increases as more people use it. That creates a powerful barrier: If one\u2019s friends and family are all on Facebook, an alternative social network, even with superior features, is unlikely to be tempting \u2014 which is why Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users each month, and rising. A Big Mac, in contrast, does not taste any better even with millions of simultaneous consumers.In Silicon Valley, virtually every pitch deck claims network effects \u2014 but they are rarely spotted in the wild. The largest on-demand home cleaning service in any locale may have a cost and speed advantage versus competitors, which helps attract more consumers and more cleaning people.But this virtuous cycle, despite the common misconception, is just a garden variety impact of local scale \u2014 not network effects. A large customer base does not make any service even a smidgen more valuable to someone getting their home cleaned. For a small discount, customers will happily try an alternative cleaning service, on-demand car valet or flash sale. Monopolies in these categories, like most others, are unlikely. In contrast, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it would take to pry Snapchat out of a teenager\u2019s hands \u2014 but it sure wouldn\u2019t be a cheap coupon.It\u2019s not just start-ups that find it hard to build a monopoly. Even in the rarefied air of the FANG stocks, monopolies are hard to come by.Amazon is a powerhouse with substantial scale advantages \u2014 its latest quarterly revenue was $36 billion, and it has increasing customer loyalty, including more than 50 million paying Prime subscribers. But Amazon is far from a monopoly. In retail, beyond a few narrow categories where it dominates (notably: books), Amazon is a leading player in intensely competitive markets. In cloud computing, its innovative Amazon Web Services is the leading player serving start-up customers and is making inroads with enterprises. But it does not have the cloud to itself. It is locked in ferocious competition with Microsoft, Google and several others. Unsurprisingly, in the decade since its debut, the service has cut prices more than 50 times.Similarly, Netflix is the leading subscription video distributor. It has more than 75 million subscribers and is producing hundreds of hours of original content. Netflix has scale advantages and strong customer captivity, but zero network effects; it does not become more entertaining with more subscribers. It is well placed to create enormous value as a long-term leader in this market but is far from a monopoly. It\u2019s too late for start-ups to enter the fray, but there are already formidable competitors, such as HBO and Amazon, driving up content acquisition costs and keeping a lid on consumer prices. Netflix is already on track to spend more than $5 billion on content this year \u2014 more than half its forecast revenue. And other deep-pocketed players, such as YouTube and Apple, have adjacent businesses that are strong enough to be potentially serious future players as well.That Silicon Valley is not all bulletproof billion-dollar companies and \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets is no cause for gloom. The current environment is a reminder of the primacy of business economics and market structure. At least for the moment, investors will revert to saving billion-dollar valuations for exceptionally defensible, growing businesses. That closes the chapter on the ill-fated unicorn experiment, which valued growth at any cost. Hopefully, it also spells the end of the term itself \u2014 which predictably turned out to be as useless a descriptor on the way down as it was on the way up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indie Bookstores Are Back, With a Passion", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byEditorial NotebookThe decades of trauma suffered by independent neighborhood bookstores \u2014 damage from bargain megastores, the ascension of the e-book and Amazon\u2019s flash delivery of cut-rate reading \u2014 hardly hindered Chris Doeblin\u2019s search for the right place to open his fourth independent bookstore in Manhattan.In fact those serial threats across 30 years in the business drove his search for his next \u201cindie\u201d locale. \u201cWe are pushed from behind and driven ahead by the pull of the future,\u201d Mr. Doeblin said last month, explaining why his three Book Culture stores are not enough. \u201cI have 10-year-old kids. You have to reinvent yourself.\u201dA reader might find his determined search a noble but counterintuitive escapade after years of watching the lights sadly go out on small neighborhood bookshops where social warmth was such a part of the browsing. But the good news is that the indies are quietly resurging across the nation, registering a growth of over 30 percent since 2009 and sales that were up around 10 percent last year, according to the American Booksellers Association, the indies\u2019 main organization with more than 2,200 stores.\u201cExisting stores are selling once more to a new generation of owners,\u201d said Oren Teicher, the A.B.A.\u2019s chief executive officer, noting that such stores could never be resold during the gloomiest years, when they were under threat from Barnes & Noble and then later, Internet sales. The indies now find that readers are looking for life beyond their computer screens. They want to embrace books in all three dimensions and to select them in a tactile, less anonymous marketplace. Booksellers are fellow readers who converse knowledgeably and jot down their current favorites on helpful bookshelf notes.\u201cIt\u2019s a more holistic consumerism,\u201d says Mr. Doeblin, describing the bookstore resurgence as part of the explosion of the localism movement that finds young new farmers delivering fresh produce to Main Street markets. \u201cThe computer screen just hurts; you need a real book in your hand,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople become antisocial through technology and social media.\u201dMr. Doeblin relished opening his third Book Culture store in 2014 on the upper West Side only a few blocks from a Barnes & Noble that was reportedly struggling to survive in the face of Amazon. He had giant advance notices emblazoned on the windows announcing: \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail, New York! You\u2019re Going to Get Another Independent Book Store!\u201d He was delighted to find eager customers when it opened, and now has 15,000 people registered for discounts. The store holds various social activities and sells plenty of products like stationery, greeting cards, children\u2019s games and toys, even backpacks \u2014 all part of the merchandise of most successful bookstores nowadays.Mr. Doeblin has no idea what form the competitive threat will take next \u2014 Amazon drones delivering books to Broadway apartments? But he\u2019s been walking through assorted neighborhoods, convinced that a fourth Book Culture store can hold its own among the sorts of customers who savor true community as much as a good read.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sugarplum Fairies and Cavaliers Move Ahead at City Ballet", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byMs. Woodward\u2019s feet have both firmness and bounce: They deliver steps that project far beyond their small space. The sylph jumps with ronds de jambe saut\u00e9s, quivering rapid circles of the foot in the air, with hummingbird speed; Ms. Woodward makes them gleam. She\u2019s not one of the company\u2019s leggy Amazons; but she has both line and brio. At present she has more energy than pathos: her dancing breathes, twinkles, laughs, bounds. Though she makes the sylph\u2019s final gestures vivid, this force of nature seems indestructible.\u201cLa Sylphide\u201d shared a double bill with Balanchine\u2019s \u201cTschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2\u201d (formerly called \u201cBallet Imperial\u201d), whose illustrious central role is among the ballet\u2019s most challenging. It\u2019s a sign of this company\u2019s current strength that it fielded illustrious \u2014 yes, imperial \u2014 performances by three of its foremost principals in the leading role: Teresa Reichlen, Sara Mearns and Ms. Peck.Ms. Reichlen, whose height and length of limb confers thrilling scale on this ballet, was at her most marvelously selfless: She delivers, she reveals, she shines, but she doesn\u2019t comment. This impersonal approach, so alien to many notions of ballet artistry, is often a central part of the Balanchine experience. It\u2019s heartening to see Ms. Reichlen back on top form, freely and coolly powering through the choreography as if reclaiming her birthright.There\u2019s room for dissent. A noted part of Ms. Peck\u2019s art is her ability to play with her music. There are times \u2014 in both this \u201cConcerto\u201d debut and in her prodigious \u201cTheme and Variations\u201d performance in \u201cTchaikovsky Suite No. 3\u201d \u2014 when her phenomenal skill at playfully varying her speed stops her from showing her music\u2019s basic rhythm: She shows more rubato than pulse, toying with the music rather than releasing it. She\u2019s also overfond of showing us her ability to draw an extended leg back in toward herself, letting us know she\u2019s playing with both balance and time.Such talk is luxury. To watch, within a week, three such City Ballet artists deliver this one heroic role with such diversity was a banquet.Advertisement"}
