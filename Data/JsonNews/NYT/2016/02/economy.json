{"Headline": "In Rare Appearance, China\u2019s Central Bank Chief Says All Is Well", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 For the second time since last summer, an avuncular, graying man has stepped out of Beijing\u2019s shadows and calmed financial markets after a Chinese devaluation \u2014 but once again, his assurances came after nearly a month of turmoil and growing worry about the country\u2019s economic health.Mixing folksy charm with deft explanations of economic thought, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China\u2019s central bank, held a rare news conference in Shanghai on Friday morning, as finance officials from around the world gathered for the Group of 20 major economies meeting. Mr. Zhou acknowledged worries about spiraling debt at Chinese corporations and local governments but offered reasons why the Chinese economy might be uniquely able to deal with it for the time being.He also dismissed American hedge funds\u2019 concerns about the erosion of China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and assured the audience that China did not plan to further devalue its currency to increase its already formidable export prowess.China\u2019s supply of foreign exchange reserves \u201cis not an oil field with a static stock of oil. It is like water in a reservoir, so there are constant flows in and flows out,\u201d he said.Following Mr. Zhou\u2019s remarks, the Shanghai stock market rebounded 1 percent on Friday, on the heels of a 6.4 percent plunge on Thursday. The value of the renminbi also steadied on Friday in largely unregulated trading in Hong Kong, although it still dipped slightly against the dollar for the day.What Mr. Zhou did not do on Friday, however, was provide any indication of when he might next offer an explanation of Chinese monetary policy. He also did not announce any plans for the People\u2019s Bank of China to follow other leading central banks \u2014 like the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan \u2014 in holding regular news briefings after important policy decisions.\u201cIt is very clear that he still does not want to talk too much about policy; he wants to leave it a bit uncertain,\u201d said Zhou Hao, the Asia economist for Commerzbank, who is not related to Zhou Xiaochuan. \u201cFrom China\u2019s perspective, if it\u2019s too transparent, then people will expect too much of you.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In contrast with the central banks of other major economies, China\u2019s central bank is to some extent an advisory body instead of an independent, decision-making institution. The final say on major economic decisions, like interest rate moves or devaluations, belongs to the country\u2019s political leadership.On both occasions, Mr. Zhou said fairly little until the next meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors a month later. The last ministerial meeting was in September in Ankara, Turkey; China holds the group\u2019s presidency this year and chose Shanghai for the gathering on Friday night and Saturday.United States Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew added his voice late Friday afternoon to those calling for China to explain policy changes.\u201cThe exchange rate policy is one in particular that needs to be clearly communicated, and it\u2019s important that as they make their transitions, that they do it in an orderly way,\u201d he told a small group of reporters in Shanghai before a meeting with other finance ministers.Although Mr. Zhou spoke for more than an hour at his news conference on Friday morning in a large, tastefully decorated hall on the fourth floor of the central bank\u2019s Shanghai branch office, he said virtually nothing that would limit the political leadership\u2019s options. He did not, for instance, categorically rule out another decline in the renminbi at some point against the dollar.When one question suggested the renminbi was pegged to a basket of other currencies, Mr. Zhou quickly objected. He said instead that the value of the renminbi would be set \u201cwith reference\u201d to a basket of other currencies \u2014 essentially a weighted average. He preserved even more flexibility for China\u2019s leadership by emphasizing that the renminbi would not be measured against just one basket, but against several.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.Mr. Zhou decisively ruled out a depreciation for the purpose of trade advantage, but did not address whether the currency might someday rise or fall for other reasons.\u201cWe will not resort to competitive depreciation so as to boost our advantage in exports,\u201d he said.Mr. Zhou hinted at another Chinese policy effort to strengthen economic growth when he talked about there being room for banks to lend more money for mortgages. Although companies and local governments are heavily in debt, Chinese households generally are not, he noted.The People\u2019s Bank of China recently cut the regulatory minimum for down payments on mortgages to 20 percent of a home\u2019s value, from 30 percent.Mr. Zhou also offered explanations why foreign investors were wrong to worry about China\u2019s rising overall levels of credit, relative to economic output. China has a far higher savings rate than most other economies, so banks have a lot in deposits to lend, he said.China\u2019s stock markets are somewhat small, compared with the size of its economy, forcing companies that need money to rely more on bank loans and bonds, he added. And because China was poor until very recently, many families have not had enough time to accumulate the wealth to start businesses just with their own savings.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a lot of accumulation,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to borrow.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

When she met the residents of Duquesne Court, in Springdale, they told her stories about who had gotten cancer and whose children died young. But she also understood such things could come to seem normal to the residents, for whom moving away was simply not a practical option.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I would say to everyone in Duquesne Court: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, what do you think about those stacks? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right there at the end of your street.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They would look up and say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh. Stacks. Right.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so much a part of the community that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even see them anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Johnson said.It all began almost 10 years ago, when Brian Cohen, an English art historian and photographer, moved his family to the area, after visiting friends there on a beautiful day. When asked if he felt lured under false pretenses, he insisted he loves the city, while admitting, with dry English wit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPittsburgh is not known as the sunniest city in the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cohen was inspired to act in 2010, when his wife, Ilyssa Manspeizer, suggested he seek funding for a project about fracking. His proposal to a local foundation was not successful, but the funding was ultimately found elsewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought about that for a second,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a really good idea. It quickly occurred to me that this is a big, big story. Much bigger than someone like myself could tackle alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought, why not propose a project where a whole group of photographers get together, in the tradition of something like the F.S.A.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 the Farm Security Administration photography program begun during the Great Depression.He enlisted his colleague Laura Domencic, the director of the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, to help organize a six-photographer collective for the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project. The group, which also featured Noah Addis, Nina Berman, Scott Goldsmith, Martha Rial and Ms. Johnson, shot a project about fracking that has been exhibited regularly since 2012.Thrilled by its success, Mr. Cohen suggested another collaboration in 2014, to examine the poor air quality in his adopted city. He combined both endeavors in The Documentary Works, an umbrella organization with a website to archive and support projects focusing on issues affecting the area.For the new venture, Mr. Cohen re-enlisted Ms. Johnson and Mr. Goldsmith, and included Ms. Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend Annie O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill. The resulting exhibition and companion book are a pastiche of styles and narrative techniques, which was intentional, according to Ms. Johnson.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the past, we have the present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Johnson, a National Geographic fellow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have color and black-and-white. We have this smorgasbord of visual solutions that hopefully brings not just the people, but the issues to life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cohen photographed the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial infrastructure in color, and subtly manipulated the images to enhance the \u00e2\u0080\u009cugly beauty\u00e2\u0080\u009d of smoke rising into the sky. Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill used Polaroid Type 55 film to shoot portraits of survivors of a 1948 environmental disaster, in which local residents died because of polluted air trapped in the atmosphere, a condition known as inversion. Mr. Goldsmith shot black-and-white, documentary photographs of local miners organizing, patients in hospital beds, and a train derailment, among other subjects.Initially, Ms. Johnson used her iPhone to shoot mostly landscapes in Cheswick, but soon felt she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting the narrative depth she craved.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a photographer, you have to find a way, emotionally, into the story, into the subject matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happening, so I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go close to the stacks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I went right to the base, and saw, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh my God, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a street, almost exactly opposite to the entry of this plant.\u2019\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite its lingering reputation, Pittsburgh is no longer the industrial hub it once was. Mr. Cohen notes that the economy has begun to roar again, this time because of what is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cEds and Meds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They now have \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology, robotics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle is here. Facebook just opened up a center.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Johnson concurred, surprised to find her city had become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvital, youthful place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she has spent so much of her time on the road. While she agreed that the air quality had improved, she stressed that her group of collaborators was interested in creating dialogue and encouraging the community to stand up for itself. They see themselves as concerned citizens, trying to make a difference, something Ms. Johnson hopes to inspire in others, wherever they live.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook around you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she challenged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want to change? Get your iPhone out and take some pictures. There are no barriers anymore for communication and change. None. Zero.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "Lowe\u2019s $2.3 Billion Deal for Rona Is Expected to Have Smoother Sailing Than Last Attempt", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byAlmost four years ago, the home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s set off a political storm in Quebec with a hostile bid for Rona, a Canadian chain headquartered in that province.On Wednesday, Lowe\u2019s was back again, this time with a friendly deal to acquire Rona for 3.2 billion Canadian dollars, or $2.3 billion, in cash.If so, the acquisition will let Lowe\u2019s overtake the Canadian unit of Home Depot as the dominant home improvement company in the country.\u201cOne of the big differences between this and last time is obviously this time we have the unanimous approval and support of the board of directors of Rona as well as the management team,\u201d Robert A. Niblock, Lowe\u2019s chairman, president and chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re in a much better place than where we were in 2012.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Lowe\u2019s, based in Mooresville, N.C., would pay 24 Canadian dollars a share in cash for each share of Rona\u2019s common stock and 20 Canadian dollars a share for each preferred share of Rona.The latest offer is about double Rona\u2019s closing price on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Rona shares closed up 98 percent, to 23.30 Canadian dollars, roughly matching the bid. Lowe\u2019s latest move to expand in Canada comes shortly after the company abandoned the Australian market, where it had operated a home improvement chain in a joint venture.Mr. Niblock acknowledged on Wednesday that Lowe\u2019s still had not reached its optimum size in Canada since entering the market in 2007. Lowe\u2019s has 42 stores in Canada out of more than 1,845 home improvement and hardware stores in North America, including Mexico.The company is now transforming four locations previously leased by Target, which left Canada last year. The Rona transaction, however, will significantly bolster Lowe\u2019s business throughout Canada and give the company its first locations in Quebec, where Rona is the market leader.Rona operates more than 500 corporate-owned and independent affiliate stores, including many small outlets in rural communities. The combined business would have generated 2015 revenue of about 5.6 billion Canadian dollars. Lowe\u2019s announced several steps to ease political concerns in Quebec.It will continue to operate the stores it is buying under Rona\u2019s brand names. Lowe\u2019s Canadian head office will move to Boucherville, Quebec, Rona\u2019s home, and continue to buy from Canadian suppliers.Lowe\u2019s said that it would continue to employ the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Rona\u2019s staff and management. Sylvain Prud\u2019homme, the president of Lowe\u2019s Canada, will continue in that role after the takeover. Since 2012, Rona has changed most of its senior management and closed several stores.In a news conference, Robert Chevrier, the chairman of Rona, said that the political climate in Quebec had also evolved.\u201cWhy are we selling?\u201d he said. \u201cLet me put it this way: This is a very, very attractive price and a very compelling price.\u201dWhile politicians from both major political parties opposed the earlier bid by Lowe\u2019s, on Wednesday, Dominique Anglade, Quebec\u2019s minister of the economy, sciences and innovation, said that the Liberal government supported the latest bid.But Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, the leader of the separatist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, condemned the deal both on social media and in comments to reporters.While the federal government is expected to approve the deal under its foreign investment laws, its competition bureau may require Lowe\u2019s to sell stores in some parts of the country.Mr. Niblock said there were relatively few markets where the two chains overlap.Canada\u2019s economy has become unsettled by the global collapse in prices of commodities, particularly oil. The fall of the value of the Canadian dollar, which stems from that, makes things particularly difficult for retailers. While the weak dollar has pushed up the cost of imported merchandise substantially, competitive pressures make it difficult for retailers to recover the increase fully through higher prices.But Mr. Niblock said that Canada\u2019s high levels of homeownership and its general stable financial situation, even during the 2008 financial crisis, made it an attractive market for Lowe\u2019s.\u201cThere are a lot of things that set up very well for our sector of retail,\u201d he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day that the offer was roughly double Rona\u2019s closing price. It was Tuesday, not Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Madeleine Albright: My Undiplomatic Moment", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorI HAVE spent much of my career as a diplomat. It is an occupation in which words and context matter a great deal. So one might assume I know better than to tell a large number of women to go to hell.I absolutely believe what I said, that women should help one another, but this was the wrong context and the wrong time to use that line. I did not mean to argue that women should support a particular candidate based solely on gender. But I understand that I came across as condemning those who disagree with my political preferences. If heaven were open only to those who agreed on politics, I imagine it would be largely unoccupied.However, I do want to explain why I so firmly believe that, even today, women have an obligation to help one another. In a society where women often feel pressured to tear one another down, our saving grace lies in our willingness to lift one another up. And while young women may not want to hear anything more from this aging feminist, I feel it is important to speak to women coming of age at a time when a viable female presidential candidate, once inconceivable, is a reality.I have been out of public office for a decade and a half. I have devoted much of my life since to teaching, writing and helping to make sure younger women face fewer obstacles than my generation did. When I speak to groups of women of all ages, I am struck that despite all that has changed, I am still asked the same questions: \u201cHow do you maintain work-life balance? What can I do to succeed in a male profession? What advice should I give my daughter?\u201dWhen I answer these questions, I inevitably reflect upon the difficulties my generation faced. I share these stories not to bemoan how hard my life has been. It\u2019s turned out pretty well. What concerns me is that if we do not pay careful attention to this history, the gains we have fought so hard for could be lost, and we could move backward. I do not have a magic formula for how every woman should live her life, but I do know that we need to give one another a hand.The battle for gender equality is still being waged, and it will be easier if we have a woman who prioritizes these issues in the Oval Office and if the gender balance among elected officials reflects that of our country. When women are empowered to make decisions, society benefits. They will raise issues, pass bills and put money into projects that men might overlook or oppose.Despite decades of progress, women still make less money than men for equivalent work. Paid family leave remains an elusive dream. Sexual abuse against women continues to plague our communities. And many politicians still act as though the top threat to our national security is Planned Parenthood.In the meantime, outdated attitudes persist. To this day, I sometimes feel a squirm of anxiety when I interrupt a discussion in a room with only men. I see women in public office being criticized on television for their hairstyle or tone of voice. And I regularly hear successful businesswomen criticized as \u201ctoo emotional.\u201dVoters must make an informed decision about whom they elect based on the issues that matter most to them, which of course are not limited to those of gender: education, a growing economy, national security. These affect us all, regardless of our sex.Even so, I am concerned by the tone of the debate about the many problems that specifically affect women. We cannot be complacent, and we cannot forget the hard work it took us to get to where we are. I would argue that because of what is at stake, this is exactly the time to have a conversation about how to preserve what women have gained, including the right to make our own choices, and how to move forward together. I would welcome an informed dialogue that crosses generations. We have much to learn from one another.A few years ago, not long after Hillary Clinton succeeded Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, one of my granddaughters asked: \u201cSo what\u2019s the big deal about Grandma Maddy being secretary of state? I thought only girls are secretary of state.\u201dMy hope is that young women like my two granddaughters \u2014 those who have lived in a world where Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, who played school sports thanks to Title IX and who have never had to check \u201cmarried\u201d or \u201csingle\u201d on a job application \u2014 will build on the progress we have made. But that will happen only if women help one another. And for those who do that, there will always be a special place of honor.Madeleine Albright was the secretary of state from 1997 to 2001.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy's Next Generation Takes Hold", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byFor a sector rooted in change, fashion has often proved surprisingly resistant to rewrite.Consider, for example, one beloved refrain of the last decade in boardrooms and backrooms alike: that Milan was the least creative of the four fashion capitals, run by old names, dominated by big money and lacking any support from a crumbling establishment. By contrast, London was considered a breeding ground of edgy young things lauded as faces of the future, and Paris, all creative conceptualism and glamour, the zenith of the seasonal calendar. Pity the poor young Italian designer, struggling to break through.It may be time to rethink the stereotype. Among the 50 Italian names on the Milanese calendar, a constellation of rising stars has emerged over the last five years.By comparison, the Parisian calendar is dominated by international designers (from Belgium, Britain, the United States, Japan and, with the arrival of Demna Gvasalia at Balenciaga, Georgia). And though a clutch of new French names has emerged in recent seasons, including Guillaume Henry at Nina Ricci, Julien Dossena at Paco Rabanne, and S\u00e9bastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant at Courr\u00e8ges, it is in Milan that a next generation of creativity seems to have reached critical mass.Alessandro Michele at Gucci, Rodolfo Paglialunga at Jil Sander and Alessandra Facchinetti at Tod\u2019s have all successfully taken the reins at top-tier Milanese houses, as has Massimiliano Giornetti at Salvatore Ferragamo. Meanwhile fledgling talents including Marco de Vincenzo, Fausto Puglisi, Massimo Giorgetti (of MSGM and Pucci) and Stella Jean are attracting considerable attention \u2014 and acclaim. Two years ago, Alberta Ferretti handed over the reins of her Philosophy line to Lorenzo Serafini.Government funding, coupled with Vogue Italia-driven initiatives such as Who Is On Next, competitions that nurture and showcase the country\u2019s young blood, have helped spark what may be seen as a 21st-century fashion renaissance in Italy.\u201cThings are changing fast, and the issues of the past are now behind us. We are really focused on getting our brands of tomorrow into the spotlight today,\u201d said Carlo Capasa, president of the Camera Nazionale Della Moda Italiana, the industry organization that is spearheading expansion by helping designers with funding, show spaces and contacts.\u201cI honestly believe that Italy today is a great place for a young designer to be,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have the heritage, the manufacturing base, and are working harder than ever to educate emerging talent and absorb them into the ecosystem.\u201dOne factor behind this shift in attitude centers on the recognition of the essential role played by the fashion sector in kick-starting the stagnating Italian economy. Total revenue generated by the Italian fashion industry was more than 61 billion euros, or nearly $68 billion, in 2014. Once the final figures for 2015 are totaled, analysts estimate revenue will have risen 7 percent last year, to \u20ac65 billion.Put another way: Italians don\u2019t have a choice. Fostering the future of Italian fashion will be key to surviving the present rocky macroeconomic climate. So it is no coincidence that Milan Fashion Week will be opened with a lunch hosted, for the first time, by an Italian prime minister. (In this case, Matteo Renzi.)\u201cHistorically, Italy has just not been a place ready for new things. It never has been,\u201d said Marco de Vincenzo, 38, who spent 13 years at Fendi before winning the Who Is On Next? competition and gaining investment for his brand from LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 2014. \u201cIt has always been enamored with the glory of its past \u2014 and not just within the confines of fashion.\u201d\u201cUp until five years ago, the politics around fashion week were next to impossible. There was little way of getting on the calendar, suggesting new ideas or finding investment,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd there had been an unintentional creative devolution, from an Italian design DNA towards trends that emanated from elsewhere, which made the scene feel stale. We didn\u2019t really know who we were anymore.\u201dMr. Paglialunga, at Jil Sander, added that many major design schools were abroad, and that risk-averse small factories and wholesalers in Italy were reluctant to play their part in educating fledgling designers on how to run businesses at home.\u201cThey refused to look beyond their bottom lines, take a chance or spend time on those who needed it,\u201d he said by telephone this month. \u201cAnd many small businesses could fail as a result if they couldn\u2019t deliver on orders or learn about how the system worked.\u201cIt was only when the financial crisis hit that they were forced to accommodate those they had refused to consider previously. And that is finally starting to pay dividends now,\u201d Mr. Paglialunga said. \u201cNot least because we Italians are at a huge advantage as designers by being so close to so many quality manufacturing bases. Young brands can learn faster and better now they have more exposure.\u201dOther designers, like Stella Jean, suggested that the financial and constructive support that media and brand powerhouses began providing several years ago has flowed into the quality of the designs on Milan\u2019s runways. Now, \u201cthere is an ongoing dialog now between the giants and the baby brands like mine,\u201d Ms. Jean said.Ms. Jean, a 37-year-old Haitian-Italian who is based in Rome and known for her bold and bright design sensibility, got her big break in 2013, when Giorgio Armani lent his Armani Teatro space to her during Milan Fashion Week to show a collection to international buyers and media.The dialog with established houses, she said, \u201cis allowing us to construct our own stories, very far from the mainstream. To have that balance on our calendar now, especially at a time when the luxury consumer is looking more and more for unique and individualistic approaches to style, is like our second renaissance.\u201dSome have suggested that the figures who went further afield and eventually reinvigorated big-name fashion houses elsewhere \u2014 think Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy, or Stefano Pilati, who was creative director at Yves Saint Laurent from 2004 to 2012 \u2014 paved the way for those designers who remained at home.Mr. Puglisi, a Sicilian who left for the United States at 22 and got an early break designing costumes for Whitney Houston before assisting the fashion photographer David LaChapelle, said: \u201cFrom Marco Polo onwards, Italian dreamers have fantasized about escape, to places that believe in the power of youth and exoticism and where a fortune can be won. It is built into our mind-set.\u201dDiscovered by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana in 2010, Mr. Puglisi was involved in the Spiga 2 project, a concept store in Milan founded by Mssrs. Dolce and Gabbana to showcase the work of young designers. He became creative director of Emanuel Ungaro in 2012 and started showcasing his own label\u2019s catwalk collection in 2013.\u201cGoing beyond our own borders to understand the size of the global consumer market is an important chapter for many people before they eventually returned home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly was for me and my business.\u201dMr. Puglisi also pointed out that most in the so-called new generation of designers are at least 35. Hardly \u201cyoung in most people\u2019s books,\u201d he said, \u201cbut considerably more so than Mr. Armani and Mrs. Prada I suppose.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the total revenue in dollars generated by the Italian fashion industry in 2014. It was nearly $68 billion, not $68 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Times\u2019s Endorsement of Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:The most important reason to support Hillary Clinton this election cycle is that the stakes are so high. A vote for a Republican candidate this year is more than an indication of support for a set of policy prescriptions. Rather, it is an assertion that many Americans, from President Obama to many of our neighbors and colleagues, are not welcome in their own country.Leading Republicans have actively divided Americans based on their background or religion; others \u2014 with the notable exceptions of Jeb Bush and Gov. John Kasich \u2014 have shown cowardice in the face of this unacceptable rhetoric.Given these stakes, Democrats must bring forward the candidate most likely to win. For good or bad, this candidate is Mrs. Clinton. Despite her many scandals \u2014 sometimes fabricated by her opponents, sometimes self-inflicted \u2014 she represents views acceptable to the broad middle of voters looking for a refuge from those who would divide Americans against themselves.MICHAEL FARZANJuno Beach, Fla.To the Editor:The Times, in its sweeping editorial endorsement of Hillary Clinton and its brushoff of Bernie Sanders\u2019s candidacy, does not reflect its own newspaper reporting about her actual record.Domestically, Mrs. Clinton supported the deregulation of Wall Street. As senator, she failed to face up to the financial industry\u2019s worsening abuses that took down the economy in 2008. She waited until April 2014 to support the modest, staggered $10.10 per hour minimum wage bill of her Democratic colleagues in Congress.Mrs. Clinton voted for the disastrous war in Iraq. Later, she pressed, against the opposition of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, for an unauthorized war on Libya that has led to chaotic violence there and in neighboring countries.Being such a war hawk and Wall Street supporter hardly qualifies for the \u201cconfidence and enthusiasm\u201d The Times has bestowed upon her.RALPH NADERWashingtonTo the Editor:JUDITH ABRAMSNewton, Mass.To the Editor:These women are wrestling with the same question we all try to answer when we vote.

Ms. Sheehy is, of course, entitled to her feeling that she was \u201cbeing shunned as a traitor to the progressive cause.\u201dHis campaign to tell Americans the truth about a rigged system that works for the very few and not the many has already transformed the 2016 election and demonstrated that a different kind of politics is possible.KATRINA VANDEN HEUVELNew YorkThe writer is editor and publisher of The Nation.To the Editor:Gail Sheehy\u2019s essay about Hillary Clinton breaks my heart. There is a deep-seated misogyny in the hearts and minds of too many men (and, sad to say, some women as well). Hillary Clinton has been a target most of her adult life, and yet she has continued to stick her neck out, time and again, to say what she believes is right.The current vitriol aimed at her from most of the Republican candidates is astounding. But, in addition to giving voice to their fear of women, they are also doing something very clever.By attacking Mrs. Clinton so viciously, they are, along with conservative media and financiers, trying to ensure that Bernie Sanders is the Democratic nominee, believing that he will be easier to defeat in the 2016 election. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy is a too rare opportunity to elect someone, of any gender, who stands tall on so many of the important national and international issues of today, including, but certainly not limited to, issues of gender equality.LOIS BLOOMWilliamsburg, Va.To the Editor:I tire of reading about who loves Hillary Clinton \u2014 and about how likable she may be.

{"Headline": "U.S. Plans to Put Advisers on Front Lines of Nigeria\u2019s War on Boko Haram", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 The Pentagon is poised to send dozens of Special Operations advisers to the front lines of Nigeria\u2019s fight against the West African militant group Boko Haram, according to military officials, the latest deployment in conflicts with the Islamic State and its allies.The deployment is a main recommendation of a recent confidential assessment by the top United States Special Operations commander for Africa, Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc. If it is approved, as expected, by the Defense and State Departments, the Americans would serve only in noncombat advisory roles, military officials said.Even as President Obama has drawn down the large American armies sent to Iraq and Afghanistan, he has relied heavily on Special Operations forces to train and advise local troops fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and to carry out clandestine counterterrorism missions.Already, about 50 American commandos are advising fighters battling the Islamic State in eastern Syria. Scores more in a new, secret kill-or-capture unit are hunting Islamic State militants in Iraq. The Pentagon has offered to send American advisers with Iraqi brigades on the battlefield instead of restricting them to bases inside Iraq. Dozens of American commandos are conducting surveillance missions in Libya and counterterrorism missions in Somalia.\u201cRather than entangle U.S. combat forces on the ground, help build the capacity of regional forces to tackle their countries\u2019 security challenges,\u201d said Jennifer G. Cooke, Africa director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who visited Nigeria last month. \u201cTraining and advising and perhaps imparting the lessons we learned the hard way is a good thing.\u201dSince taking office last year, Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has vowed to pursue a military campaign against Boko Haram more vigorously than his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan. His shake-up of the military high command and new cooperation with neighboring countries has proved effective.Mr. Buhari, a former general, has boasted of the military\u2019s successes in wresting control of a huge portion of terrain from the group, declaring a \u201ctechnical\u201d victory late last year. But while the military has killed or captured thousands of militants and put an end to raids of villages by dozens or more fighters, the group has still carried out suicide attacks at a relentless pace in Nigeria and neighboring countries.\u201cDespite losing territory in 2015, Boko Haram will probably remain a threat to Nigeria throughout 2016 and will continue its terror campaign within the country and in neighboring Cameroon, Niger and Chad,\u201d James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told the House Intelligence Committee in Washington on Thursday.To help combat this threat, Mr. Buhari has embraced American assistance, ending several years of tense relations that sank to new lows in 2014 when the United States blocked the sale of American-made Cobra attack helicopters to Nigeria from Israel, amid concerns about Nigeria\u2019s protection of civilians when conducting military operations.Groups like Human Rights Watch say the Nigerian military has at times burned hundreds of homes and committed other abuses as it battled Boko Haram and its presumed supporters.Nigeria\u2019s ambassador to the United States responded sharply at the time, accusing Washington of hampering the country\u2019s effort to defeat Boko Haram. American officials also expressed hesitancy about sharing intelligence with the Nigerian military, fearing their ranks had been infiltrated by Boko Haram, an accusation that further infuriated Nigerian leaders.In December 2014, Nigeria canceled the last stage of American training of a new Nigerian Army battalion that was to take the lead in fighting terrorists.Those days now seem over. This month Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the State Department\u2019s top diplomat for Africa, announced that the suspended training for the Nigerian infantry battalion would resume soon. Nigeria will provide the ammunition.Two weeks ago, Gen. David M. Rodriguez, the head of the Pentagon\u2019s Africa Command, hosted Nigeria\u2019s chief of defense staff, Gen. Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, at the American headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. \u201cTo contain Boko Haram, working together is a priority,\u201d General Rodriguez told his visitor.About 250 American service members have deployed to a military base in Garoua, Cameroon, where United States surveillance drones flying over northeastern Nigeria are sending imagery to African troops. Drone photos recently helped the Nigerian Army avoid a major Boko Haram ambush, according to a senior American intelligence officer.Another breakthrough occurred late last year when General Bolduc, a Green Beret with multiple Special Forces tours in Afghanistan, visited Nigeria. When officials there asked for assistance, General Bolduc quickly sent an assessment team to conduct a 30-day review.Among the team\u2019s main recommendations was to position \u201csmall dozens\u201d of Special Forces in Maiduguri, a major city in the northeast on the edge of the conflict, to help Nigerian military planners carry out a more effective counterterrorism campaign. British special forces are already assisting in the city. (The American military now maintains only a tiny intelligence cell in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital.) Nigerian military officials have embraced the recommendations and are drawing up detailed requests, American officials said.Just last fall, life seemed to be turning back to normal in the areas near Maiduguri, which for years had been the epicenter of Boko Haram\u2019s activities. But after a major military operation uprooted the militants from nearby villages they had seized, many fighters have returned to Maiduguri to launch repeated suicide bombing operations in the city or in villages on the outskirts that have caused dozens of deaths.At the end of last year, fighters attacked the city with rocket-propelled grenades and several suicide bombs. Residents say they eye one another with suspicion, especially women wearing religious gowns, fearful that explosives may be hidden underneath.These relentless attacks have put more pressure on Nigeria and its neighbors to marshal their forces against a common enemy.After taking office last year, Mr. Buhari began forging relationships with the presidents of neighboring countries to establish information-sharing and to build trust between his nation and Niger, Cameroon and Chad. But grouping the four nations together to share information and untangling decades of mistrust among them have proved harder.A regional task force established by the countries last year has largely stalled amid lingering distrust and differing views about the threat. Less than half of the task force\u2019s $700 million budget has been raised, and sinking oil prices have hurt the economies of Chad and Nigeria, Ms. Cooke said in congressional testimony this week.Still, working together has yielded victories.Earlier this month, the Cameroonians teamed up with the Nigerian military as part of a joint operation on Nigerian soil just across the border in the far north, killing more than 160 Boko Haram fighters, dismantling a logistics hub for the fighters and destroying explosive devices, according to officials there.videovideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Democracy Follow Capitalism Into Cuba?", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byTHANKS disproportionately to their mother, my kids have a gratifyingly acute sense of the urgency of addressing the dire straits in which far too much of the world\u2019s population lives.For my part, I wanted them to understand the key role that capitalism, which has brought more people out of poverty than any economic system in history, can play in that important effort.So I took them to Cuba, ranked along with North Korea as the least free economy in the world and one that is described as a \u201cbasket case.\u201dWe marveled at stunning unrestored old buildings (legacies of Cuba\u2019s past prosperity) and droves of colorful American cars from the 1950s that were almost as beautiful. We also saw a country whose per capita gross domestic product is roughly equal to that of Sri Lanka and Swaziland.About three-quarters of Cubans work for the state, earning meager salaries \u2014 a doctor there makes about $75 a month or less.For the average Cuban, access to Western goods is almost nonexistent, as my kids saw when I took them to a shabby \u201cdepartment store\u201d that accepted only pesos, the local currency. Only low-quality, Cuban-made merchandise was on offer.To be sure, Cuba provides a substantial safety net that both ameliorates the low salaries and helps those at the bottom cope with the country\u2019s extreme poverty. But taking care of the needy isn\u2019t incompatible with capitalism, as many European countries have demonstrated.I wanted my children to see firsthand the ineffectiveness of socialism at creating prosperity. And I was eager for them to appreciate that the country\u2019s salvation could be the very system that Fidel Castro decried: capitalism.With its economy crumbling after support from Russia and Venezuela evaporated, Cuba began in 2011 to liberalize very gradually, allowing private enterprise to flourish in certain sectors, particularly those related to tourism, like restaurants.\u201cEither we change course or we sink,\u201d pronounced Ra\u00fal Castro, who succeeded his brother as president.Today, in part because of the opening of relations with the United States, Havana is filled with foreign visitors and abuzz with chatter about the vast potential hordes yet to arrive.The colorful vintage American cars, which were an integral part of the transportation system when I first visited 14 years ago, now seem more a tourist attraction as the streets fill with an increasing number of Hondas, Kias, Volkswagens and even an occasional BMW.Old Havana, whose restored section made up just a couple of uncrowded blocks in 2000, has mushroomed, as those breathtaking old buildings have been refurbished. The picturesque quarter is now jammed with tourists who descend on it from omnipresent sleek Transgaviota tour buses.A free-trade zone has been established in the small port city of Mariel, and the country\u2019s leadership now publishes annual \u201cwish lists\u201d of projects seeking foreign investment, many of them in the health care, tourism and transportation sectors. This year, $8.2 billion is being sought for 326 projects.All of this has been greeted with enormous eagerness by Cubans who work in the private sector, doing everything from running restaurants to selling art to foreign collectors and museums. They get paid in CUCs, Cuba\u2019s convertible currency, and can shop in stores offering an array of better quality foreign-made goods.Excitement about potential real estate development projects \u2014 still more rumor than fact \u2014 is at fever pitch. Representatives from Four Seasons and Marriott have reportedly visited recently to scour sites. As many as a dozen new hotels are supposedly in the planning stages.The burnishing of old structures continues. More than five decades of isolation from American-style development have made Havana ideal for restoration into the ultimate tourist destination \u2014 a theme park that is not merely a collection of facades.The American presence is growing. In a modern restaurant in Old Havana, a waiter took our orders using a gleaming white Apple iPad mini. Airbnb is doing a bustling business. Even golf courses \u2014 banned by Fidel Castro \u2014 have begun to creep back. Coming soon: better Internet access, a condition for the recent deal between the two countries, and along with it, the freer flow of ideas and information.This is the Cuba \u2014 the two Cubas \u2014 that President Obama will see on his planned trip there next month, the first by a sitting United States president in 88 years. Commerce between the United States and Cuba may still be highly restricted, but his visit is one more sign that the American presence and our ideas of economic freedom are growing.Whether political liberalization will occur is at best uncertain. In some ways, Cuba reminds me of China \u2014 a country whose populace seems to put a lower priority on achieving democracy than on prospering economically.With so much of the economy remaining under state control, Cuba has an exceptionally long \u201cto do\u201d list. But while our embargo didn\u2019t succeed in reforming the country, the slow, steady infiltration of capitalism just might.Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and a contributing opinion writer.

Its chief financial officer, Andy Halford, said a decline in income had been partly driven by weaknesses in emerging market currencies as well as by a crash in commodity prices. He noted that the bank had reduced its exposure to commodities by 28 percent.Standard Chartered\u2019s operating income was $15.4 billion in 2015, a 15 percent drop from $18.2 billion the year before. Operating expenses were $9 billion in the period, down 7 percent from $9.7 billion in 2014.The bank said its bad loans increased 87 percent, to $4 billion, because of falling commodity prices and a plunge in Indian financial markets.Partly as a result of the sharp increase in bad loans, the bank is carrying out \u201caccountability reviews\u201d on more than 150 current and former executives and may claw back their bonuses, Mr. Winters added in a conference call after the earnings announcement.Standard Chartered\u2019s \u201cexecutive directors have already paid a price for the underperformance,\u201d Mr. Winters said, referring to cuts in bonuses for senior staff members.\u201cApart from that, we have got a quite a robust system of accountability reviews,\u201d Mr. Winters said, warning that bonus clawbacks could come \u201cpending the conclusion of investigations that we\u2019re doing around the real accountability for some of the mistakes that have been made.\u201dStandard Chartered shares in London initially dropped more than 11 percent after the earnings were published, before paring back those losses to close 4 percent lower.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lord Lucan, Missing Since 1974 Murder, Is Declared Dead (Again)", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 It was a case that riveted the world: In 1974, a dashing British aristocrat and army officer, known for his prowess at backgammon and bridge and his fondness for vodka martinis, powerboats and Aston Martin cars, vanished after the bludgeoned body of his children\u2019s nanny was found in the basement of his family\u2019s house in the affluent Belgravia area of London.A British judge declared Lord Lucan dead in 1999, allowing the resolution of certain estate and inheritance matters, but that ruling did not definitively close the issue. Under a law that took effect in 2014, the earl\u2019s son, George Charles Bingham, asked a court to formally issue a death certificate so that he could inherit his father\u2019s title and become the eighth Earl of Lucan.A High Court justice, Sarah Asplin, granted Mr. Bingham\u2019s request in London on Wednesday. The proceeding, which attracted significant attention in the British media, was surprisingly brief for a case with such a notorious and lengthy history.The disappearance of Lord Lucan riveted Britain. The country, like the United States, was suffering from high energy prices and a sluggish economy, and its Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, had just been voted out of office. In 1973, Britain had joined the European Economic Community, a predecessor of the European Union; in 1976, Britain was forced to apply for an emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund.At a time of flux and malaise, the lurid tale of aristocratic impunity astonished the country.The couple had separated in 1972, and Lord Lucan had moved out of the house to a home nearby. He had heavy gambling debts and was battling his wife for custody of their three children.Inside the house, at 46 Lower Belgrave Street, police officers found the body of Ms. Rivett, who was 29; she had been bludgeoned to death with a lead pipe and placed in a canvas mail bag in the basement. It was not clear why Lord Lucan might have killed her, but one theory is that he had mistaken her for his wife.Soon after, a Ford Corsair that Lord Lucan had borrowed from a friend was found, abandoned and bloodstained, in Newhaven, East Sussex, southeast of London. An inquest jury declared him the killer in 1975.When Mr. Berriman, the victim\u2019s son, raised his objections last fall, he asked the British tabloid The Daily Mail, \u201cWhy on earth would Lord Lucan\u2019s son want to carry on a title that is linked to a possible murderer?\u201dBut Mr. Berriman and Mr. Bingham, who are months apart in age, appear to have reached a reconciliation. On Wednesday, they made conciliatory comments in separate remarks to reporters outside the courthouse.Mr. Berriman said \u201cthe last five years has been a roller-coaster ride of depression and stress,\u201d but struck a conciliatory tone.\u201cI\u2019d like to congratulate George Bingham on his passion for closure,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis is closure and a time to move forward for him and his family. I can understand that he wants to move on with his life, but for me this is something, at this moment, cannot happen.\u201dMr. Bingham, for his part, expressed compassion for Mr. Berriman\u2019s suffering. He said his father\u2019s fate was a mystery.He added: \u201cTo hear that your father is racist, a snob, a poster boy for the aristocracy in the \u201970s didn\u2019t sit very well with the rather charming, rather lovely and kind man that I knew. Nevertheless, people, if they leave a party early, get to be speculated about, don\u2019t they?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israeli Police Officer Is Killed in Attack by 3 Palestinians in Jerusalem", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byThe assault was the latest in a four-month wave of Palestinian attacks against Israeli security forces and civilians. Israeli officials said the officers were attacked after they became suspicious and approached two of the men, asking to see their identity cards. Those two men began to stab and shoot at the officers, the police said, and a third assailant fired at the police from behind.The two police officers who were injured were both female. One \u2014 Hadar Cohen, 19 \u2014 died of her wounds a few hours later at a hospital.The attack took place in a predominantly Palestinian area of East Jerusalem, near the Damascus Gate of the Old City. It was not immediately clear where the assailants were going when the officers approached them.Officials said that the officers had apparently headed off what could have been a much deadlier attack. The pipe bombs the assailants were carrying did not go off at the scene; they were detonated harmlessly later by bomb disposal experts.Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon, a senior Israeli military commander who briefed reporters on Wednesday before the attack, said that the recent surge in violence was not likely to end soon and that the army assumed it would continue throughout 2016.According to the police, the three assailants on Wednesday were all around 20 or 21 and came from Qabatiya, a village in the northern West Bank. Palestinian news media reports identified them as Ahmad Zakarna, Muhammad Kamil and Ahmad Abu al-Rub.\u201cYour men are coming with gunfire,\u201d Mr. Zakarna wrote in his post. \u201cMay you rest in peace in heaven and may God grant us the privilege of becoming martyrs.\u201dAli Zakarna, a cousin of Mr. Zakarna and a spokesman for Fatah, the mainstream Palestinian party, in Qabatiya, said the three Palestinian assailants in Wednesday\u2019s attack were good friends of the man who was fatally shot in November. \u201cOur children\u2019s actions are only a reaction to the continuous harsh Israeli occupation,\u201d Mr. Zakarna said. \u201cThe shooting and killing of their friend,\u201d he continued, \u201cencouraged these youths to seek revenge against the enemy.\u201dLocal officials said the Israeli military had surrounded Qabatiya and was not allowing anyone to enter or leave.General Alon, who heads the military\u2019s operations directorate, said \u201cthe footprints of Hamas,\u201d the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, could be seen in efforts to encourage terrorism, even though most of the assailants were \u201clone wolves,\u201d acting without the assistance of any organization.In a statement on Wednesday, Hamas praised the attack but did not claim responsibility for it. Deal or no deal, he said, the \u201cstrategic challenges to Israel mainly come from Iran,\u201d including Iran\u2019s support for militias like Hezbollah and Hamas and the country\u2019s continued development of longer-range missiles.Still, General Alon said, the Israeli military believes that Iran will have little interest in violating the nuclear accord in the next three to five years. Low oil prices make it \u201cessential for Iran,\u201d he said, to reap the financial \u201cfruits\u201d of the accord instead.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Court Black Voters at Las Vegas Church", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "LAS VEGAS \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Hillary Clinton took their increasingly contentious battle for the Democratic nomination to a predominantly black church in Las Vegas on Sunday morning.Although Mr. Sanders reached out to Victory Missionary Baptist Church first, Mrs. Clinton brought along Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil-rights leader who told the church that Mrs. Clinton was \u201cready to be president Day 1.\u201d Mrs. Clinton followed up by saying she planned to build on the Affordable Care Act, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich has been especially important for African-Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders emphasized his desire to reform and demilitarize police departments, ensuring that officers who broke the law were held accountable and that the departments looked like the communities they served.As both candidates courted black voters in Nevada, the Rev. Robert E. Fowler Sr. welcomed them by telling members of the church, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited that they are here, and I am encouraged that they are willing to sit at the same church, at the same service, at the same time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton sat on one side of the church, accompanied by Mr. Lewis, while Mr. Sanders, who brought his wife, Jane, sat on the other. Mr. Fowler told both candidates that he wanted to them to explain why people should vote for them.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Sanders, your camp contacted us first, so you have the opportunity to go first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fowler said.Mr. Sanders spoke for about 10 minutes, saying that there were competing philosophies in the world and that he wanted to create a government focused on helping all Americans.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of us believe that what God teaches us and what this world is about is that we do not turn our backs on our brothers and our sisters, that essentially we are in this together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have four beautiful kids and seven grandchildren. I want you to worry about my kids, and I have got to worry about your children and your grandchildren. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this church is about, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what our existence is about. But there are people out there today who say what the world is about is me. \u2018I got to make as much money as I can. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to become a billionaire.\u2019\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders added that America had a higher rate of childhood poverty than almost any other major country and a\u00c2\u00a0high unemployment rate among African-American youth, yet gave \u00e2\u0080\u009chuge\u00e2\u0080\u009d tax breaks to the rich.In particular, Mr. Sanders said, Nevada bore the brunt of Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greed as one of the hardest-hit states during the 2008 recession. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis state was decimated,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.He then talked about the need to reform police departments and to give former inmates education, job training and other resources to ensure that they can become employed.Mr. Lewis introduced Mrs. Clinton and said, \u201cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a senator, secretary of state. Look, she is prepared, she is ready.\u201dMrs. Clinton, who like Mr. Sanders repeated several lines from her stump speech, spoke of the common ground she shared with him.\u201cMy esteemed opponent and I agree,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can never let big banks wreck our economy. No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut, Mrs. Clinton added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a single-issue candidate, and this is not a single-issue country.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause if we were to achieve everything about banks and money in politics, would that end racism? Would that make it automatically going to happen that people would be able to get the jobs they deserve, the housing they need, the education their children need to have?\u201dLater in the day, Mr. Sanders spoke to 1,700 supporters at Bonanza High School and repeated that he would focus on income inequality, immigration reform and regulating Wall Street if he were elected.\u201cIf we win here in Nevada, we send a profound message to the entire country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThat message is that people in this country will no longer accept establishment politics and establishment economics.\u201d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "A Fight Over Argentina\u2019s Debt Produces No Winners", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorThe battle over Argentina\u2019s debt is at the end stage, as the hedge funds and the country enter into negotiations to resolve the dispute.The hedge funds may claim victory, reaping billions of dollars on legal technicalities, but there are no real winners in this sorry affair.The fight began after Argentina defaulted on about $92 billion worth of sovereign debt in December 2001.In the past when countries defaulted, there was not much that the holders of the debt could do. Sovereigns are immune from suit in other countries and their home courts. A bondholder can\u2019t just go into court and sue to collect his or her money, leaving the holder stuck unless the country decided at some later date to repay.Still, hedge funds arose specializing in buying this debt at a discount and harassing governments into repaying. The funds would scour the globe trying to find a friendly jurisdiction to seize the country\u2019s assets and sidestep the rule of sovereign immunity. Elliott Management, for example, seized a $39 million shipment of oil from the Republic of Congo to collect on debt the fund had bought for only about $2 million.But this was small beer, and involved only tens of millions as debtor countries for the most remained safe to default.This all changed with Argentina.A number of hedge funds bought this debt, including Elliott and Aurelius Capital. At first the funds tried the old tricks, even briefly seizing an Argentine frigate in Ghana. Today, Argentina\u2019s president flies in a rented plane in order to avoid the embarrassment of having a jet seized.But Elliott has lawyers who specialize in leveraging legal rules. And with Argentina, Elliott again found a successful legal strategy.After the default, Argentina restructured the old bonds, offering 30 cents on the dollar in new bonds. About 93 percent of holders took up this offer, thinking that this discount was better than nothing. But some hedge funds and a number of other holders refused to give in, hoping for a better offer.The hedge funds, however, argued in the United States District Court in Manhattan that this clause also prohibited the payment of the new bonds without paying the old. It was a novel claim and a clever way of getting around the legal obstacle of suing Argentina for payment.Instead of asking for money, the funds were simply asking for the clause to be enforced so that no other Argentinian bonds could be paid unless they were as well.This legal argument was a moonshot, but the funds got Judge Thomas P. Griesa to bite. In a series of rulings, he sided with the funds and issued an injunction stating that if Argentina paid the new bonds, it would have to pay the old ones.The ruling was a shock to many because the clause had never been interpreted this way before. And it seemed odd to create a new precedent amid a battle between a sovereign and hedge funds.But the judge highlighted the fact that Argentina was unusual \u2013 the country\u2019s adamant refusal to pay on the bonds made it subject to special treatment for its inequitable conduct.Indeed, Judge Griesa curiously phrased the battle in ethical terms, calling Argentina \u201cimmoral\u201d for refusing to pay and even holding the country in contempt of court for refusing to repay the hedge funds and other debt holders. Why this would be a moral question was never really clear. Argentina was taking a legal position, just like the hedge funds.This is where Argentina got stuck, however. The judge\u2019s ruling effectively locked it out of the capital markets. And it pitted Argentina\u2019s creditors against each other as the country could no longer pay its new bonds without fear of having the money seized by the hedge funds. Argentina now needs a settlement for the good of its people and economy.With the election of Mauricio Macri as president last year, Argentina is trying to settle old debts. In the last few weeks it has agreed to pay $1.35 billion to individual Italian bondholders who were holdouts (Argentina and Italy have old ties, and many of the bonds were sold to Italian citizens). And Argentina has also settled with two hedge funds, Montreux Partners and Dart Management and offered $6.5 billion to settle the whole affair.But there is still some way to go for a resolution. The negotiations are continuing before a court-appointed mediator and the remaining holdouts appear to be resisting Argentina\u2019s offer, arguing that it favors other funds at their expense.In part this is again because of yet another legal quirk. Some funds, instead of suing on the basis of the pari passu clause, instead sued to collect their debt directly. These funds won a judgment for the face value of their debt, hoping that they could then use it to seize assets of Argentina in other countries. Once the judgment was entered though, the bonds stopped accruing interest according to their terms and instead received court-ordered post-judgment interest at about 0.5 percent.The other hedge funds never enforced their debt, instead suing on the pari passu issue and collecting interest on the face value of the bonds, which they claim exceeded 100 percent a year. The second set of bonds is now worth much more because they accrued more interest.Argentina has responded with different offers. One set \u2013 those who did not sue on the pari passu clause \u2013 were offered 150 percent of their judgment.The second set who have not sued to collect on their bonds but instead sued to enforce the pari passu clause, have been offered up to 72.5 percent of their claims.Let\u2019s just stop here and highlight this absurdity. The hedge funds who sued on the pari passu clause but not to enforce their debt are getting more, but not enough. Merely because of the choice of legal strategy.It all highlights how an entire country has been subject to the vicissitudes of luck and litigation strategy.A representative of Elliott declined to comment on this matter.With its new offer, Argentina also raised the ante. It has brought in new lawyers and made a motion in federal court before Judge Griesa arguing that now that it is willing to bargain with the hedge funds it is no longer a recalcitrant debtor and the court should lift the injunction prohibiting Argentina from paying the new bonds without paying the old bonds under the pari passu clause.It\u2019s hard to see a judge who so many times ruled against Argentina ruling in favor of them. But this is just part of the negotiating strategy \u2013 indeed using the hedge funds\u2019 legal strategies against them. And the judge was once in favor of Argentina, not the hedge funds.Indeed, it is going to be harder for these funds to say this is a moral matter when making claims of more than 100 percent interest. Nonetheless, according to a person close to the creditor hedge funds, the parties are not that far apart \u2014 possibly only as much $200 million \u2014 in their negotiations.That\u2019s a small sum in the scheme of things, and settlement seems so close. After over a decade of litigation, however, it appears as if the parties can\u2019t kick their habit of going to court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton Paints Bernie Sanders\u2019s Plans as Unrealistic", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 Hillary Clinton, scrambling to recover from her double-digit defeat in the New Hampshire primary, repeatedly challenged the trillion-dollar policy plans of Bernie Sanders at their presidential debate on Thursday night and portrayed him as a big talker who needed to \u201clevel\u201d with voters about the difficulty of accomplishing his agenda.Foreign affairs also took on unusual prominence as Mrs. Clinton sought to underscore her experience and Mr. Sanders excoriated her judgment on Libya and Iraq, as well as her previous praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. But Mrs. Clinton was frequently on the offensive as well, seizing an opportunity to talk about leaders she admired and turning it against Mr. Sanders by bashing his past criticism of President Obama \u2014 a remark that Mr. Sanders called a \u201clow blow.\u201dWith tensions between the two Democrats becoming increasingly obvious, the debate was full of new lines of attack from Mrs. Clinton, who faces pressure to puncture Mr. Sanders\u2019s growing popularity before the next nominating contests in Nevada and South Carolina.Mrs. Clinton pounced from the start, after Mr. Sanders demurred in saying how much his proposals would increase the size of the federal government. She stepped in and said that by economists\u2019 estimates, the government would grow 40 percent under Mr. Sanders.A generation gap is emerging over the importance of electing a woman to the White House. We invite you to share your opinion. The Times may follow up with you.And rather than bashing him as she did at their debate last Thursday, she appeared to try to get under his skin by implying that he had not been transparent about the cost of his programs, such as his proposed expansion of government health care.\u201cThis is not about math. This is about people\u2019s lives, and we should level with the American people,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. She then repeated a jab at Mr. Sanders\u2019s reputation as a truth-teller that she would return to during the debate: \u201cYou need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don\u2019t add up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to,\u201d Mr. Sanders responded, insisting that families could come out with savings. \u201cThat is absolutely inaccurate.\u201dMr. Sanders, who has exuded confidence since his New Hampshire win, raising more than $6 million in the 24 hours after the polls closed there, was more pointed and even belittling of Mrs. Clinton at times. He said bluntly that some of her attacks were wrongheaded, and he was dismissive after Mrs. Clinton talked about her plans to increase federal spending by about $100 billion a year. After Mrs. Clinton responded to a question by saying, \u201conce I\u2019m in the White House,\u201d he began his next answer by saying, \u201cSecretary Clinton, you\u2019re not in the White House yet,\u201d drawing some murmurs and jeers.The candidates had one of their sharpest exchanges of the race when the moderators of the debate asked them what is typically a softball question: which leaders they admire. Mr. Sanders named Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, while Mrs. Clinton named Nelson Mandela \u2014 and then used the question to berate her opponent for his complaints about Mr. Obama over the years.\u201cThe kind of criticism that we\u2019ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination.\u201dThe New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Mr. Sanders called the comment a \u201clow blow\u201d and said that while he disagreed with Mr. Obama on occasion in the Senate, the president was a friend.\u201cOne of us ran against Barack Obama,\u201d he fired back at Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI was not that candidate.\u201dThe PBS debate, the sixth of the Democratic race but only the second to include just Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, came at a moment of rising concern among Democrats about the strength of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy and the electability of Mr. Sanders if he becomes the Democratic nominee. Mrs. Clinton fared poorly among key parts of the Democratic electorate in the New Hampshire primary, losing a majority of the women who voted, as well as young people, who expressed mistrust of her on the campaign trail. As for Mr. Sanders, some Democrats believe he is too liberal and his proposed tax increases too toxic to win a general election.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pointed critique of Mr. Sanders was part of a new calculation by her campaign that the debate format, in which Mrs. Clinton excels, was the best way to draw attention to Mr. Sanders\u2019s record and his minimal expertise in foreign policy. The role of commander in chief became another flash point on Thursday, when Mr. Sanders argued that his judgment was better than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s, and more important than her experience. He criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the war in Iraq, her push to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and her consulting of Mr. Kissinger.\u201cI\u2019m proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, saying Mr. Kissinger had enabled genocide in Cambodia under Pol Pot.Mrs. Clinton turned the exchange back on Mr. Sanders, noting that he had sidestepped requests to identify his own foreign policy advisers.\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t Henry Kissinger,\u201d Mr. Sanders snapped back.Mr. Sanders also criticized Mrs. Clinton for telling CNN in 2014 that the children who entered the United States from Central America should be sent back, a statement that made some young Latinos question her commitment to their communities.\u201cI made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. But she said the United States also had to send a message to parents \u201cnot to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.\u201d\u201cThese are children,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we use them to send a message, I think we welcome them into this country.\u201dMrs. Clinton, sensing her rival\u2019s relative inexperience on world affairs, offered a somewhat belittling reply at one point in the exchange: \u201cIt\u2019s a big, complicated world out there,\u201d she said.Mr. Sanders also put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive over donations to the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her, saying that its $25 million haul included $15 million with some connection to Wall Street. Mrs. Clinton countered that she was not involved with the super PAC, but noted that Mr. Obama had also taken money from Wall Street. She rejected the idea that \u201cif you take donations from Wall Street, you can\u2019t be independent.\u201d\u201cThe people aren\u2019t dumb,\u201d Mr. Sanders replied. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around,\u201d he added to applause.Mrs. Clinton responded by repeating her plans to impose new regulations on hedge funds and other firms. Yet Mr. Sanders hit back again, invoking Theodore Roosevelt to argue that big banks had become too predatory against average Americans and needed to be broken up.Throughout the debate, Mr. Sanders, who is seeking to appeal to racially diverse voters in Nevada and South Carolina, demonstrated little capacity to broaden his political message in compelling new directions beyond overhauling the economy, campaign finance and health care.While he noted that his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program would save the average middle-class family $5,000 a year, he did not present his vision in any new way or frame the issue in personal terms for average voters. His advisers said during the debate that his focus was on introducing himself to new voters around the country, who may be intrigued by his candidacy after days of news coverage about his huge win in New Hampshire.At the same time, several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s answers reflected an urgent political imperative: to maintain and energize her deep support among minority voters in order to offset Mr. Sanders\u2019s popularity with young people, liberals and some working-class white voters.In her opening statement, Mrs. Clinton denounced discrimination against African-Americans in employment, education, housing and the criminal justice system. But she was matched by Mr. Sanders as he railed against a legal system in which young people have criminal records because of petty drug offenses while Wall Street executives escaped culpability for the great recession.When asked whether he was potentially blocking a milestone for women by challenging Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, who would be the first Jewish president if elected, said, \u201cI think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well.\u201dHe also asserted that race relations would be better under a Sanders administration than they had been under Mr. Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWhat we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they\u2019re not hanging out on street corners.\u201dAmy Chozick reported from Milwaukee, and Patrick Healy from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Lost Nearly a Million People in 5 Years, Census Says", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s population shrank by nearly a million during the last half-decade, official census figures confirmed on Friday, an unprecedented drop for a society not ravaged by war or other deadly crisis, and one that helps explain the country\u2019s persistent economic woes.It was the first time since Japan began collecting census data in 1920 that a nationwide count recorded a decline in the population, though surveys based on smaller samples have shown a downward trend for years.The population stood at 127.1 million in 2015, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said, down by 947,000, or 0.7 percent, compared with the last census in 2010.A shrinking population creates ripples that are felt from the economy to politics.With one of the lowest birthrates in the world and little immigration, Japan has seen this milestone coming for years, if not decades. Yet efforts by the government to encourage women to have more children have had little effect, and there is little public support for opening the doors to mass immigration.\u201cThese numbers are like losing an entire prefecture,\u201d Shigeru Ishiba, a cabinet minister in charge of efforts to revitalize Japan\u2019s especially depopulated rural areas, said at a news conference. A handful of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures, administrative districts similar to provinces or states, have populations of less than a million.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe responded to the census report by reiterating a long-term goal of keeping the population from falling below 100 million. Projections by the government and international bodies like the United Nations suggest that will be difficult, however. The latest United Nations estimates suggest that Japan\u2019s population will fall to 83 million by the end of the century, down 40 percent from its peak.Mr. Abe\u2019s goal depends on raising the birthrate to 1.8 children per woman, up from 1.4 now and higher than it has been since the early 1980s. Rates have, in fact, risen slightly compared with a decade ago. But with women marrying later \u2014 in part, demographers say, to avoid pressure to give up their careers \u2014 a more decisive turnaround looks far off.Japan will not necessarily suffer just because it is smaller. Many countries with fewer people are just as prosperous, and in a country known for jam-packed rush-hour trains, there may even be benefits. Japan\u2019s economic output has been stagnant for years, but the picture looks less dire, economists say, once a shrinking work force is taken into account.The real problem, experts say, is less the size of the familiar \u201cpopulation pyramid\u201d but its shape \u2014 in Japan\u2019s case, it has changed. Because the low birthrate means each generation is smaller than the last, it has flipped on its head, with a bulging cohort of older Japanese at the top supported by a narrow base of young people.One-quarter of Japanese are now over 65, and that percentage is expected to reach 40 percent by 2060. Pension and health care costs are growing even as the workers needed to pay for them become scarcer.The population is shrinking more in some places than others. The biggest cities, like Tokyo, are still growing, while rural areas struggle to cope with abandoned homes and shuttered shops. The imbalance has created political tensions: The most depopulated areas send three times as many representatives to Parliament, per capita, as urban ones do.The Supreme Court has declared the situation unconstitutional, but Mr. Abe\u2019s conservative governing party \u2014 which has strong support in the countryside \u2014 has dragged its feet on redrawing electoral districts.The government made several small adjustments last year, but Mr. Abe said in Parliament on Friday that a more ambitious realignment would wait until the next census in 2020.An article on Feb. 27 about Japan\u2019s loss of nearly a million people in the last five years, an exceptional drop for a society not ravaged by war or other deadly crisis, referred imprecisely to the population decline. Although the term \u201cinflection point\u201d can be used colloquially to mean a \u201cdramatic change,\u201d in mathematics, the term means the point in a curve at which the shape changes concavity, bending up instead of down, for example. Under that definition, Japan\u2019s inflection point occurred in the late 1970s, when its rate of growth slowed \u2014 not in 2015. While the error was promptly corrected online, editors failed to follow through on this print correction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Analysts Question Viability of Deep Tax Cuts Proposed by Republican Candidates", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The tax plans of the Republican presidential candidates would cut federal revenues as much as $12 trillion over a decade, a post-World War II record eclipsing the deep tax cuts of George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy. And they would come just as America faces the costs of its aging baby-boom generation.The combination of the tax cuts\u2019 size and timing has many tax and budget policy analysts questioning their viability. The Republican rivals routinely denounce the current $14 trillion debt, but none has said how he would offset the revenues lost to his tax cuts, beyond unspecified cuts to domestic programs and repeals of some existing tax breaks.Each candidate has said his tax cuts are needed to promote work, saving, investment and faster economic growth.Tax policy groups agree generally, but only if the revenue losses are offset by budget savings that avoid piling up more debt that would be counterproductive to spurring the economy.\u201cThe candidates need to present real specifics for how they would address our record levels of debt,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\u201cMassive tax cuts and few specifics for what spending to reduce will only make the challenges much worse,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd miraculous growth projections and \u2018waste, fraud and abuse\u2019 are just not credible solutions.\u201dAlso, at a time when many Americans lament the growing gap between rich and poor \u2014 and the shrinking middle class in between \u2014 the Republicans\u2019 plans would mostly benefit the richest individuals and corporations, according to analyses by research groups that lean left, right and center.What is indisputable is the sheer size of the proposed tax cuts. The four most detailed proposals would easily eclipse the reductions under Presidents Bush, Reagan and Kennedy, compared with the size of the economy.\u201cThe 2016 primary contenders make those guys look like pikers,\u201d said the economist Leonard Burman, the director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington and a Treasury official in the Reagan and Clinton administrations.\u201cIt\u2019ll simplify the tax code. It\u2019ll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn\u2019t seen for decades,\u201d Mr. Trump said in September, dismissing any concerns over cost.Even the least of the loss estimates would mean a cost of nearly $4 trillion over the first decade \u2014 the price tag that the Tax Foundation put on the Cruz plan.

John Kasich of Ohio and Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, also have proposed deep tax cuts, but without enough detail for many economists to analyze in depth.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.The Tax Foundation has separate estimates showing that all the Republican plans would have lower budgetary losses if the economic growth they would spark was counted in the cost.However, \u201cwe assume that the tax cuts are appropriately financed by, for example, spending reductions,\u201d said Kyle E. Pomerleau, the director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation. \u201cIt is certainly the case that having significant deficits well into the future would have an adverse impact on the economy.\u201d\u201cOne, they are enormous tax cuts relative to anything we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d said William Gale, an economist at Brookings. \u201cTwo, the candidates don\u2019t specify how they\u2019re going to pay for these tax cuts.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd three, they are hugely regressive\u201d \u2014 that is, the higher a person\u2019s income, the bigger the tax cuts that taxpayer would receive, both in dollars and as a percentage of income.If the candidates \u201cever do get around to specifying how they\u2019re going to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Mr. Gale added, the budget savings are \u201cgoing to come from low- and middle-income households\u201d because those Americans benefit more than the rich from the government\u2019s domestic spending programs.Many economists favor consumption taxes over income taxes because they provide incentives to save and invest. But critics counter that consumption taxes fall harder on lower-income wage earners, who can save little.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harsh Tone in Campaigns Bodes Ill for Governing", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byLetter From WashingtonThere is a red and blue political divide in the United States that this election is only exacerbating, with consequences for governing.Presidential campaigns are about choices, differences, especially between the parties. The 2016 divide between Republicans and Democrats is more intense and polarizing than usual.Two of the leading contenders, Senator Ted Cruz, on the Republican side, and Senator Bernie Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, openly declare that this is a \u201cbase\u201d election focused more on bringing out hard-core committed supporters than on trying to persuade more independent-minded folks. Their impressive showings in the Iowa caucuses \u2014 Mr. Cruz won, and Mr. Sanders almost did \u2014 reinforce that. And among Donald J. Trump\u2019s attributes, political consensus-building doesn\u2019t seem to be at the top of the list.Even after the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday winnows the field, Hillary Clinton will remain the favorite to win the Democratic nomination, and Marco Rubio will be one of the three or four Republican finalists.Both claim that they could govern effectively. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s central case against her liberal opponent, Mr. Sanders, is that she could get things done. Mr. Rubio, the freshman Florida senator, emphasizes that he wants to be president of the \u201cUnited\u201d States.Any Republican is probably going to claim that Mr. Obama is a failed president presiding over a weak economy with no wage growth and pursuing a feckless foreign policy that has caused America to lose respect around the world. They will most likely say that Mrs. Clinton was a failed secretary of state with lots of political baggage.If, 49 weeks from now, President Rubio is sworn in, Democrats will remember that he came close to calling Mr. Obama anti-American and Mrs. Clinton a crook and a liar \u2014 a case the congressional committee investigating the Benghazi attacks failed to make.Mrs. Clinton has been almost as harsh in denouncing Republicans. Although she has stopped short of suggesting criminal behavior, her attacks have been sharper than those waged by Mr. Obama eight years ago or Bill Clinton before that.Moreover, for all the talk about animosity specifically directed at Mr. Obama, many Republicans harbor as much resentment toward Mrs. Clinton, who they believe plays by different rules. If she gets to the White House and Republicans retain control of Congress, the honeymoon may last just hours before the investigations commence.Mrs. Clinton does talk some about searching for governing consensus, as do several Republicans. Jeb Bush, after going through the Obama policies he would undo his first day as president, says he might also call the Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer.Drawing on extensive experience in Congress and as Ohio governor, John R. Kasich Jr. contends that a bipartisan approach is essential: \u201cSerious issues in this country cannot be solved by one party.\u201d He says Social Security is one example of a problem that could only be fixed through cooperation: \u201cRepublicans would be so freaked out by the Democratic claims of throwing Grandma out on the street that they\u2019d never get it done.\u201d But few expect Mr. Kasich or Mr. Bush to win the nomination. The harder messages of Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz resonate much more.Mr. Obama said last month that one of the \u201cfew regrets of my presidency\u201d was that \u201cthe rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.\u201d If the tone and substance of this campaign don\u2019t change, the next president may express the same regret.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Battered by War, Iraq Now Faces Calamity From Dropping Oil Prices", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byBAGHDAD \u2014 Iraqis seeking to withdraw money from banks are told there is not enough cash. Hospitals in Baghdad are falling back to the deprivation of the 1990s sanctions era, resterilizing, over and over, needles and other medical products meant for one-time use.But Iraq, where nearly eight million people rely on a government salary or pension, will probably be forced to make crippling budget cuts. The economic shock, they fear, could lead to large-scale social unrest even as the country is pulled apart by war, displacement and sectarian animosities.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.He worried that come summer, when temperatures soar and electricity shortages spread, there will be \u201ccivil disobedience all over the country.\u201dIn a country increasingly fragmented along ethnic and sectarian lines \u2014 Shiite and Sunni Arabs and Kurds \u2014 and with a widening gulf between the public and a political class widely viewed as corrupt and ineffective, a government salary or pension is perhaps the last link between citizen and state.\u201cCutting the salaries would represent the full destruction of the Iraqi people,\u201d said Salman Najam, 37, an administrator at Kirkuk University. \u201cWe cannot accept cutting off our salaries because the salaries are the main source of our living, and we do not have another alternative.\u201dMr. Najam added that cutting salaries would be \u201cthe bullet that hits the Iraqi state and the unity of Iraq.\u201d In fact, he says, \u201cIt might completely destroy it.\u201dAhmed al-Rubai, a local politician in Diyala Province, where farmers are struggling to get paid by the government, said, \u201cWhat we are afraid of in this economic crisis is the inability of the government to pay salaries for millions of employees because this might lead to a social earthquake with dangerous results.\u201dWhen Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi proposed late last year to slash salaries, protests in the streets forced him to back off, for the time being.In many ways, the fall in oil prices is forcing a painful reckoning with how Iraq has conducted its economic affairs. When oil was selling at $90 to $100 a barrel, the norm in recent years, the cash fed a corrupt political system based on patronage. Instead of investments in public services, the money fed an unsustainable expansion of government payrolls, and with it a rise in consumer spending, highlighted by shopping malls that have sprouted up in Baghdad in recent years.Luay al-Khatteeb, an adviser to the Iraqi government and founder of the Iraq Energy Institute, said the country needed radical reforms that \u201ctouch on every single aspect of the economic system and the social structure of Iraq.\u201dAlready there have been painful budget cuts. Across the country, the landscape is blighted by stalled construction projects \u2014 hospitals, schools, factories and a soccer stadium. The Health Ministry is proposing to charge fees for health care, essentially dismantling the free system established by the Baath Party in the 1970s. Growth in luxury spending that propelled the economy in better times is slowing drastically, and the owner of the local Jaguar dealership said he may be out of business soon.In Mr. Khatteeb\u2019s view, many of the most profound changes under consideration by the government have become necessary: a tax system, the substantial whittling of government payrolls, and a reduction in the fuel subsidies and monthly food rations \u2014 sugar, tea, rice and cooking oil \u2014 that every Iraqi citizen receives.Any of these steps, if taken, would represent a fundamental reordering of a society in which citizens rely on the government for a livelihood.\u201cIt\u2019s the culture in Iraq,\u201d said Mudher Mohammed Salih, Mr. Abadi\u2019s adviser for financial policy. \u201cEveryone is looking for a free lunch.\u201dThis culture will make it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to establish a tax system, as it is trying to do in an attempt to expand revenues beyond oil.\u201cI would not pay taxes,\u201d said Fadil Yaseen, 55, a retiree in Baghdad. \u201cPay for what? The state is not giving us any services, and not improving any sector or aspects of our lives. When the state improves and develops the country, then I would pay.\u201dIraq will also try to sell savings bonds in the coming months to Iraqi citizens, in an effort to raise more than $4 billion, and appeal to national unity in its sales pitch. That will be a tough sell in a country where most people keep their money in cash at home and have little trust in government.Still, Mr. Salih said, even as the government pursues these measures, it is also preparing for what he said is the worst-case scenario: that oil prices fall further and the country faces economic conditions reminiscent of the sanctions period of the 1990s, which devastated the economy.He said that if there is one thing the government is determined to keep spending money on, it is war.\u201cThe priority is war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of our existence.\u201dSpeaking to reporters recently, Hoshyar Zebari, the finance minister, said, \u201cThe tremendous decline in oil prices will sadly continue.\u201dHe noted that in recent years, when oil prices were high, the country could count on nearly $8 billion per month in oil revenue, compared with less than $3 billion last month. Salaries alone cost the government close to $4 billion per month.\u201cI\u2019m not a man of denial,\u201d Mr. Zebari said. \u201cIf the situation is not good, we must say it\u2019s not good.\u201dReporting was contributed by Falih Hassan and Ahmed Salah from Baghdad, Kamil Kakol from Sulaimaniya, and employees of The New York Times from Kirkuk, Najaf, Hilla and Diyala Province.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Era of Big-Program Liberalism Over?", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBERNIE Sanders and the policies he advocates may represent the future for many Democratic primary voters, but his basic theory of government is very traditional, dating to the New Deal.That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and it\u2019s deeply embedded in Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach. His proposals for single-payer health care, free college tuition and paid family leave financed through a small payroll tax reflect the view that successful programs should be universal and create a connection between individuals and government.That\u2019s in sharp contrast to the policy approach of the Obama administration since about 2011, and also to Hillary Clinton and most of Mr. Sanders\u2019s congressional colleagues. Their agendas are most interesting and novel for the absence of big, universal programs that require legislative action. Instead, they test the limits of what government can do by rearranging the pieces of existing programs, using regulations, incentives to states, tax credits and \u201cnudges\u201d informed by behavioral economics in place of direct spending.What does that say about the future of big programs? Unless Mr. Sanders can sweep to power with a mandate and wide congressional majorities that share his view \u2014 the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d he promises \u2014 the future of social and economic policy will involve, for better or worse, these complex, incremental and often invisible changes, instead of big programs.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ccompact\u201d for college tuition assistance, which costs a fraction of what Mr. Sanders\u2019s free college plan costs, illustrates the new method. There is no single new program. Instead, she promises, for example, to provide grants to states to help them provide free tuition at community colleges; to expand regulation of predatory loan servicers and education programs; to enact a \u201cBorrower Bill of Rights\u201d; and to allow students to refinance their loans at lower rates.It\u2019s all a lot more complicated \u2014 and for candidate Clinton, especially in the primary, a tougher sell \u2014 than a single new program in which government takes most of the responsibility. But it fits well with the methods employed by the Obama administration in the years since the president realized that he could not expect to achieve an ambitious program with a deeply partisan Congress and a Republican House.It\u2019s more than just congressional intransigence and polarization that led liberals to move beyond big new programs. Passage of the Affordable Care Act finally put in place the last big piece of the New Deal\u2019s agenda. And the cautiousness of most Democratic candidates about taxes makes it difficult to push for new programs. While Mr. Sanders acknowledges that his new programs will require tax increases, he uses the same rule as Mrs. Clinton and President Obama \u2014 no tax increases on households under $250,000 \u2014 in several of his initiatives, and claims that he will pay for the cost of others through taxes on the \u201cbillionaire class.\u201dBut without new programs, it really is possible to deny the need for broader tax increases, as Mrs. Clinton does. There is no need for revenue to reduce future budget deficits; the best way to keep deficits under control is to keep the economy growing and to reduce health care spending, which again means more tinkering.These policy machinations should not be confused with \u201ctriangulation\u201d \u2014 the modest, symbolic gestures adopted by the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s to show a recognition of conservative values. These are intended instead to make progress toward big goals by putting together various moving pieces.There are many downsides to building policy this way. It\u2019s unlikely that the MyRA, for example, will be enough to meet the shortfall in Americans\u2019 retirement savings or reduce inequality of wealth.But if this is the only way to drive reform \u2014 and in the current political configuration, it is \u2014 then politicians in both parties will have no choice but to find ways to achieve big change without big new programs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Despite Pledges, Tax Reform Remains an Elusive Goal", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 From a distance, tax reform reflects the shimmering frontier of American economic policy: bold plans from Republican presidential candidates, hints of interest from the White House and Hillary Clinton, bipartisan whispers in Congress.Up close, however, the picture dims. For reasons both economic and political, the idea of a fundamental overhaul that closes loopholes, lowers rates and simplifies the tax code faces a deeply uncertain future regardless of who controls the White House and Congress in 2017.The first grim sign came in 2014. Dave Camp, a broadly respected Republican and, at the time, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, spent months crafting a bipartisan plan bounded by two core requirements.One was remaining \u201cdeficit neutral,\u201d since budget red ink has alarmed so many Americans since it increased in the Great Recession. The other was ensuring that the overhaul would be \u201cdistributionally neutral,\u201d meaning it wouldn\u2019t deliver outsize benefits to the wealthy amid rising concern about income inequality.The plan collapsed immediately. Just as so often in the past, those who fared worse under the plan (like large Wall Street firms facing a new \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d tax) outshouted those subject to lower rates.The second sign has come from the presidential race. As Republicans scrambled to raise campaign cash last year, they proposed sweeping overhauls. Jettisoning the limitations that constrained Mr. Camp, they looked to cut the top income tax rate of 39.6 percent to as low as 10 percent, which Senator Ted Cruz of Texas proposed under a flat rate.But as on-the-ground campaigning intensified in Iowa and New Hampshire, those plans were elbowed aside. Republican candidates rely increasingly on working-class voters, who have less interest than donors in cutting rates for top earners. Terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., suddenly placed security fears at center stage.Thus, in the Republican debate last week, candidates referred to \u201cISIS\u201d 44 times. The phrase \u201ctax reform\u201d was uttered once, by Mr. Cruz.A third splash of cold water came last week from the White House, which has long been lukewarm about efforts to change the tax code. In a speech, a top adviser for President Obama explained why: Potential benefits are not worth the immense political trouble. Jason Furman, who leads Mr. Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said that a commission appointed by President George W. Bush estimated in 2005 that a fundamental tax overhaul would add less than 1 percent to long-run national economic output.By contrast, increases since 1986 in tax credits for low- and moderate-income workers and parents, which hardly simplify the tax code, have increased by 7 percent the take-home pay for the bottom 40 percent of earners. The allure of simplicity itself, Mr. Furman argued, is largely a chimera.\u201cMost of the complexity in the tax code derives from efforts to accurately measure\u201d income, he explained, rather than from deductions for things like mortgage interest and charitable contributions.Some Republican experts have urged party leaders to turn away from rate-slashing overhaul plans.With the number of people collecting Social Security projected to swell to 65 million in 2025, from 49 million in 2015, that hurdle will grow higher.Mr. Furman acknowledged that overhauling business taxes \u2014 the United States\u2019 corporate tax rate of 35 percent is the highest of any advanced economy \u2014 carried the potential for greater benefits.Mrs. Clinton sees similar benefits. But while denouncing the \u201cperversion\u201d of corporate tax avoidance to campaign audiences, she hasn\u2019t outlined a plan to overhaul corporate taxes and may not do so this year.Republican leaders in the House and Senate have made overhauling corporate taxes a major goal. But they disagree on when and how to move forward.The last comprehensive tax overhaul in the United States came 30 years ago. The next one won\u2019t come soon, or easily.Advertisement"}

But that is Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest defense for making closed-door, richly paid speeches to big banks, which many middle-class Americans still blame for their economic pain, and then refusing to release the transcripts.A televised town hall on Tuesday was at least the fourth candidate forum in which Mrs. Clinton was asked about those speeches. Again, she gave a terrible answer, saying that she would release transcripts \u201cif everybody does it, and that includes the Republicans.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton further complained, \u201cWhy is there one standard for me, and not for everybody else?\u201dHer conditioning her releases on what the Republicans might or might not do is mystifying. Republicans make no bones about their commitment to Wall Street deregulation and tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Mrs. Clinton is laboring to convince struggling Americans that she will rein in big banks, despite taking their money.Besides, Mrs. Clinton is not running against a Republican in the Democratic primaries. She is running against Bernie Sanders, a decades-long critic of Wall Street excess who is hardly a hot ticket on the industry speaking circuit. The Sanders campaign, asked if Mr. Sanders also received fees for closed-door speeches, came up with two from two decades ago that were not transcribed: one to a hospital trade association, and one to a college, each for less than $1,000. Royalties from a book called \u201cThe Speech,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s eight-hour Senate floor diatribe against President Obama\u2019s continuation of Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy, were donated to the nonprofit Addison County Parent/Child Center in Vermont.Public interest in these speeches is legitimate, and it is the public \u2014 not the candidate \u2014 who decides how much disclosure is enough.

China has 46,377 glaciers, and about 47 percent of the national ice reserves are in Xinjiang, a rugged region of deserts, forests and soaring mountains that shares borders with more than half a dozen countries.The report said that \u201cglobal warming, grazing, mining and tourism have accelerated destruction of the glaciers, and led to water shortages in several areas.\u201dIt quoted Chen Xi of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as saying that glaciers in the Tianshan range have receded 15 to 30 percent in the last three decades.Glaciologists have observed glaciers in retreat across western China. In Gansu Province, the Mengke Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the Qilian range, and two others have been retreating at an accelerating rate since the 1990s, according to a report by a local research center. That rate tripled from the 1990s to the 2000s, the report said. That has resulted in floods in recent years.

{"Headline": "Amid Iraqi Chaos, Moktada al-Sadr, an Old Provocateur, Returns", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byBAGHDAD \u2014 They came from the slums of this city\u2019s underclass, the alleyways and the simple halls of the seminary in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, and the outer reaches of the rural south.They waved Iraqi flags and demanded change. The crowd packed Baghdad\u2019s Tahrir Square on Friday morning, chanting by the tens of thousands against corruption and for decisive reforms in how politics is conducted here, as they waited for their man to appear.\u201cNo, no to thieves! Yes, yes to reforms!\u201d\u201cAfter today, the prime minister has to act!\u201d he said. Referring to the barricaded heart of the central government, he said, \u201cToday we are at the door of the Green Zone, and tomorrow the people will be inside!\u201dMr. Sadr and his fearsome militia were once a primary enemy of the United States, and he played many roles in shaping Iraq after the American invasion: populist cleric, Iranian proxy, Iraqi patriot, political kingmaker. In seizing a chance on Friday to return to the political spotlight, he positioned himself as a nationalist in the face of Iran\u2019s growing role in Iraqi affairs, and as a source of aid for a weak prime minister.\u201cToday I am among you to say to you, frankly and bravely, that the government has left its people struggling against death, fear, hunger, unemployment, occupation, a struggling economy, a security crisis, bad services and a big political crisis,\u201d Mr. Sadr told the crowd.Above all, it was a reminder of the confused state of internal Shiite politics that even as he was seeking to harness public rage against the political elites, he had actually called the street rally to support the reform policies of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.Mr. Abadi\u2019s proposal to tackle corruption and install technocrats in the country\u2019s ministries has stalled over the opposition of powerful militia leaders and some pro-Iran politicians. For his part, Mr. Sadr has offered to have his ministers resign in protest to lend Mr. Abadi\u2019s agenda some steam. Despite that, and the support of the most senior Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, it remains unclear whether Mr. Abadi\u2019s agenda will be able to win the help of any other political blocs.If nothing else, Mr. Sadr\u2019s appearance in Baghdad on Friday was a chance to \u201cget himself back in the center of things,\u201d said Kirk Sowell, an analyst based in Amman, Jordan, who publishes the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics.Mr. Sadr was once at the very heart of things in Iraq, but in recent years had receded somewhat from the public eye.When the United States invaded in 2003, Mr. Sadr was just shy of 30. But he drew on the political inheritance of his father, a pivotal and immensely popular Shiite cleric assassinated on Saddam Hussein\u2019s orders in 1999, to emerge as a powerful voice for the Shiite underclass.He forged a movement that melded martial, political and social elements. His militia, the Mahdi Army, once fought the Americans and the Iraqi state, and it was blamed for atrocities during the sectarian civil war of 2006 and 2007.Nowadays his militiamen are largely under the control of the government, and his anti-Americanism, once a defining issue for him, is less ardent. Recently, through his contacts among Shiite militia leaders, he helped secure the release of three Americans kidnapped in Baghdad. At the rally there was some bashing of the United States, but it felt more perfunctory than strident.Once an open client of Iran, Mr. Sadr has in recent years gone his own way, and is widely seen these days as an Iraq-first advocate of cross-sectarian unity. His militia, reconstituted after the extremists of the Islamic State captured Mosul in the summer of 2014, was renamed the Peace Brigades.Today, as he seeks to redefine himself once again, Mr. Sadr, now 42, has positioned himself as a backer of Mr. Abadi, who is seen as increasingly weak in the face of the growing influence of Iran. Tehran supports Mr. Abadi\u2019s political rivals, who command militias.\u201cAbadi, as a person, is kindhearted,\u201d said Saad Thamer, 37, a supporter of Mr. Sadr\u2019s who attended the rally. \u201cBut he is very weak.\u201dThe militias have become exceedingly popular among the Shiite public, challenging Mr. Abadi\u2019s authority, because they are seen as the protectors of the Shiite majority against the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State.It has also been a challenge to Mr. Sadr, who has lost of some of his support at the grass-roots level as young men flock to other militias seen as more powerful. His embrace of the Iraqi state has also sometimes worked against him by contradicting his image as a populist figure.\u201cFrom an anti-establishment young leader, he compromised his stance by working more with the Iraqi political establishment, which cost him a loss of some popularity among his followers,\u201d said Maria Fantappie, the Iraq analyst for the International Crisis Group.Iraq is a place where everyone has his enemies, and Mr. Sadr has his share. One of his chief critics is former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who once counted on Mr. Sadr\u2019s support to secure a second term after national elections in 2010.Mr. Sadr later broke from Mr. Maliki and tried to oust him from the prime ministry. In a recent interview, Mr. Maliki said Mr. Sadr was seeking to exploit Mr. Abadi\u2019s weakness to re-establish his own influence. \u201cHe\u2019s supporting Abadi, but in his own way,\u201d Mr. Maliki said. \u201cHe wants to control Abadi.\u201dDuring his time in office, especially in 2011 when the Arab Spring uprisings set off a protest movement in Iraq, Mr. Maliki feared what would happen if Mr. Sadr commanded his followers to take to the streets. He did not, and the protests died out.But Mr. Maliki said Mr. Sadr\u2019s re-emergence presented dangers for Iraq, and warned, \u201cHe has power and weapons.\u201dFalih Hassan and Ahmed Salah contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End an Unfair Restriction on College Aid", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe student aid restriction grew out of the drug war hysteria of the late 1990s. At the time, Congress believed that the drug problem was confined mainly to poor, minority neighborhoods and thought that the country could arrest and punish its way to a solution. Under the initial law, people convicted of state or federal drug crimes became ineligible for aid for specific periods of time \u2014 and in some cases permanently \u2014 based partly on the number of offenses. Incredibly, the law did not distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors.The restriction is unnecessarily punitive. It disproportionately affects minority young people, who are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. It unfairly penalizes people a second time, after they have already been punished by the courts, and it discourages many people who would be eligible for aid from applying at all. And by preventing people with convictions from getting the college degree that has become the price of admission to the new economy, it surely contributes to recidivism.Since the change Congress made in 2005 took effect, only people who are enrolled in school and receiving federal aid at the time of their offense are disqualified. This means fewer people now lose aid, but it makes the law no less unfair. Although the House and Senate bills would both repeal the whole provision, the Senate bill would take another welcome step. It would bar the education secretary from allowing any questions about drug convictions on the federal application for financial aid, known as the Fafsa, that is filled out by more than 20 million people each year.By eliminating the issue entirely, the government would ensure that people who are eligible are not deterred from applying for aid and clear a path to college for more young people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. and A.: Steps Toward Settling Puerto Rico\u2019s Debt", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byHow much of Puerto Rico\u2019s overall debt is because of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority?Puerto Rico\u2019s total debt, most of it in the form of municipal bonds, has a face value of about $72 billion. Of that amount, about $9 billion was issued by the power authority.What are the next steps to help the authority get out from under the debt?After the authority came to the brink of default in 2014, creditors agreed to work with it on a restructuring plan. The parties have now agreed on such a plan, which would reduce the principal amount by 15 percent and slow the payment schedule.They must now wait for Puerto Rican legislators to approve it and for a new regulatory body to authorize crucial elements. Puerto Rico\u2019s government has begun calling for relief on most of its other debts, adding tremendous legal and political uncertainty.What happens if creditors and the island\u2019s government can\u2019t agree on what to do about the debt?On July 1, the authority has a scheduled debt payment of about $423 million, which it does not have the cash to pay. The consequences of missing the payment are unpredictable, but they could include widespread power disruptions on the island, which would set back economic activity and cause other hardships.Is Congress going to help the island? If so, when and how?Committees with relevant jurisdiction \u2014 over bankruptcy, government finances and territorial affairs \u2014 have been taking expert testimony on available options, but a consensus has yet to emerge. One idea now being discussed is putting Puerto Rico\u2019s finances into the hands of a federal control board.But there are concerns that such a board might improperly curtail self-government on the island. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican and the speaker of the House, has set an end-of-March deadline for a House proposal to aid Puerto Rico.What are the next big moments coming up for Puerto Rico and its debt troubles?The power authority\u2019s July 1 payment is just one of almost $2 billion in debt payments due on that date from various branches of the Puerto Rican government. Puerto Rico is widely presumed to not have the cash, raising the prospect of a disorderly default.As a territory, Puerto Rico has no access to bankruptcy, and much of the negotiating going on now is seeking some alternative to bankruptcy that would also have the effect of holding off creditor lawsuits.How real is the idea of a major default? Or is this just a scare tactic?Puerto Rico\u2019s credibility has taken a beating in the last few months because it has not released its overdue audited financial statements for 2014. But basic indicators show that its economy is contracting and its population is shrinking, meaning its big debt burden is being increasingly borne by fewer, and poorer, people \u2014 a classic death spiral.What harm would a major default do to the people who live there?Puerto Rico\u2019s government plays a big role in the island\u2019s economy and it needs to be able to borrow to provide normal public services. A big, disorderly default would put any borrowing beyond reach, and public service cutbacks, which have been bearable so far, would worsen, eventually jeopardizing residents\u2019 health and safety. Many Puerto Ricans would presumably move to the United States mainland; thousands are already doing so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Much of Your Nest Egg to Put Into Stocks? All of It", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byRetiringLET\u2019S say you were persuaded by my argument in last week\u2019s Retiring column \u2014 contrary to the advice offered by most financial experts \u2014 that you should not reduce your exposure to the stock market as you grow older. Or you\u2019re at least willing to listen to this contrarian advice.But now what? Whatever your age, how much of your investments should be in equities? Should it be 30 percent? 60 percent? 90 percent?No less an authority than Warren E. Buffett has stated that 90 percent is the right answer. That\u2019s a level of investment in stocks that many investors, not just older ones, find dangerously uncomfortable, particularly when the stock market is as volatile as it has been lately. Yet Mr. Buffett, the most renowned investor of our time, established a trust for his wife that puts 10 percent of his bequest in short-term government bonds with the remainder invested in a broad-based stock index fund.But even Mr. Buffett\u2019s advice may be too conservative. Indeed \u2014 except for known, near-term financial obligations like a large tax bill that you might owe on April 15 or a down payment on a house you\u2019re buying in the next few months \u2014 the best asset allocation, nearly all the time, is 100 percent stocks.You may wonder if I put my money where my mouth is. I do. As long ago as the late 1970s, I was investing 95 percent to 100 percent of my liquid assets in common stocks. This didn\u2019t change even when I ran the bond department at my old firm during the 1980s. And it remains true today.If one of my clients happened to ask me what I thought their proper asset allocation should be, I would tell them that, despite my job, I was almost 100 percent invested in stocks myself. I even suggested that they take away the money we were managing and turn it over to our firm\u2019s equity money managers.Many investors simply cannot stomach the volatility that a 100 percent equity portfolio entails. Perhaps that is why Mr. Buffett tempers his advice and suggests \u201conly\u201d 90 percent stocks. (In his heart of hearts, I suspect, Mr. Buffett is probably a 100 percent kinda guy.)And, so, what I actually say to people who ask my advice is this: Put as much money into the stock market as you can stand. One hundred percent is best, but even if you are very risk-averse, allocate at least 75 percent to stocks.There are reams of data showing the superior performance of the stock market over many generations. In the last 90 years, according to Morningstar, stocks have outperformed long-term Treasury bonds, on average, by 4.4 percentage points a year. They have done even better against intermediate- and short-term Treasuries, 4.8 and 6.6 percentage points.That kind of performance edge (compounded) really adds up. Let\u2019s say you invest some money in stocks halfway through your working career (say, at age 45) and spend those particular savings halfway through your retirement (say, at age 75). If your investment does 4.4 percentage points better per year than the next person\u2019s, you will have more than three and one half times as much money to spend as they will.Looking at rolling 30-year periods, stocks have always outperformed Treasury bills and intermediates, and have only rarely underperformed long-term Treasuries. Even for periods as short as five years, stocks have done better than the various fixed-income categories 71 to 76 percent of the time.Of course, \u201cpast performance,\u201d as we are constantly reminded, \u201cis not necessarily indicative of future results.\u201d And that\u2019s true: For a variety of reasons, I believe you should not expect a broad portfolio of stocks to outperform bonds by as much in the future as they have in the past.He was exaggerating to make his point \u2014 countering those who would claim they have a large and statistically unassailable sample size simply because they have 90 years of consistently superior stock market performance. All that data, after all, covers only 15 business cycles, merely three generations and as Professor Samuelson said, just \u201cone history of modern capitalism.\u201dSo, is there some other justification besides the reams of data? Are there sound reasons to believe that it is necessarily true that stocks will win over the next generation and the one after that? Yes.My argument for full equity exposure rests not only on their historical and empirical superiority but their logical superiority. Consider this:\u25a0 Money invested in a United States total stock index fund will be used to buy shares of thousands of companies in dozens of industries. At this writing, every $2 million represents an ownership interest of approximately one ten-millionth of almost the entire United States economy.\u25a0 Economic potential never drops because knowledge \u2014 the main source of per capita growth \u2014 always rises. Technology (knowledge embedded in machines) gets better because we invest in research and development and never (at least intentionally) replace a good machine with an inferior one. Moreover, the capability of the average worker (knowledge embedded in our brains) keeps rising because average educational and training levels continue to rise.\u25a0 As a consequence, the intrinsic value of your equity investments rises over time. This isn\u2019t true for every single company, but it is surely true for all companies taken collectively.The economy, of course, does not grow every quarter or year. Just six and a half years ago, we emerged from the 11th recession since World War II. But the potential of the economy always grows, which is why after virtually every recession, the economy attains heights never reached before.To be sure, the path of equity market valuation is far more erratic than the economy \u2014 stocks often require a number of stock market cycles to attain new inflation-adjusted highs \u2014 but the long-term trend is inevitably rising.Inevitable? O.K., perhaps I\u2019m exaggerating a bit. None of this has to happen. Theoretically, we could (collectively) choose to substitute inferior technologies for superior ones. Inferior technologies sometimes \u201cwin\u201d because of superior marketing (think V.H.S. vs. Betamax), but that is the rare exception, not the rule.It is also plausible, given that American educational levels are so high, that they could stop improving, or even slip. But that is not really conceivable on a worldwide basis \u2014 at least for many generations \u2014 since the developing world is so far behind.But what if the absolute worst happened? A pandemic of epic proportions, a nuclear holocaust or the Earth is hit by an asteroid?Yes, your stocks will collapse but your bonds will be worthless, too. If there is no functioning modern economy, the government will not be able to pay its debts. And if you\u2019re still around, you\u2019ll have bigger things to worry about.The upshot is this: Both the historical record and logic argue very strongly for stocks over bonds. Yes, stocks are more volatile, but if you recognize that the \u201cinvestment horizon\u201d is always long and always receding into the future, your best bet is to put virtually all of your liquid assets into the stock market.David A.

{"Headline": "Ethanol Mandate, a Boon to Iowa Alone, Faces Rising Resistance", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byAMES, Iowa \u2014 Tim Recker has been growing corn in this state his whole life, and using his crops to make ethanol almost as long, at first by the jar for his trucks, now by the barrel for the nation. That is in large part because Congress in 2005 mandated that oil refiners blend ethanol into gasoline.\u201cWhen I look out my window and see farms that have built and expanded and improved, it\u2019s because of the ethanol mandate,\u201d Mr. Recker said from his farm in Arlington, Iowa. Mr. Recker, a Republican, said his decision at the presidential caucuses on Monday would be driven by what candidates have said about the 2005 law, which created the Renewable Fuel Standard.But beyond the borders of a state with outsize importance in the selection of presidents, ethanol may be losing its grip on the body politic. Energy policy experts, advocates in the fight on poverty and even other farmers say a law that has been a boon for Iowa has been a boondoggle to the rest of the country. The ethanol mandate has driven up food costs while failing to deliver its promised environmental benefits. Rising domestic oil production and a global energy glut have all but nullified the pitch that ethanol would help wean the country off foreign oil.And now a powerful coalition including oil companies, environmentalists, grocery manufacturers, livestock farmers and humanitarian advocates is pushing Congress to weaken or repeal the mandate. As soon as this week, the Senate could vote on a measure to roll back the Renewable Fuel Standard, just days after the Iowa caucuses close and the issue largely goes to rest for another four years.Even here, as Iowa urbanizes and diversifies, ethanol may be losing its once-powerful hold, some political consultants say. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, one of the Republican front-runners in Iowa, has called for an end to subsidies for all forms of energy, as well as a five-year phasing out of the renewable fuel mandate that created the ethanol economy here.That position drew an unusual repudiation from Iowa\u2019s governor, Terry E. Branstad, a Republican who has not endorsed any candidate. \u201cIt would be a big mistake for Iowa to support him,\u201d Mr. Branstad told reporters at a forum held by the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. At the same forum, the other front-runner, Donald J. Trump, said he was \u201c100 percent\u201d behind the ethanol mandate and would even support increasing it further.\u201cCulturally, anything that supports corn is seen as good,\u201d said Bruce Babcock, an economist at Iowa State University, pondering whether ethanol\u2019s grip here was slipping. \u201cBut if Ted Cruz wins the caucus, there\u2019s your answer.\u201dBeyond presidential politics, the weight of opinion is swinging against ethanol, sometimes virulently.\u201cNo genuine Republican would be in favor of increasing an artificial, demand-creating, crony-capitalism measure like the Renewable Fuel Standard,\u201d said Thomas Elam, the president of FarmEcon, an independent economic consulting firm in Carmel, Ind. \u201cIt\u2019s a socialistic, left-wing liberal position. That is so far against fundamental Republican principles of market economics, it shows that Donald Trump will say whatever it takes to get votes in Iowa.\u201dWhen the Renewable Fuel Standard was enacted, lawmakers hoped to ease the nation\u2019s dependence on foreign oil while promoting a low-carbon, climate-friendly alternative. It was viewed as such a success that Congress increased the mandate in 2007: The nation\u2019s gasoline refiners must buy and blend an increasing amount of ethanol every year, rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022 from 15 billion now. Only the first 15 billion gallons are supposed to come from corn. The rest of the ethanol is mandated to come from nonfood crops like switch grass, to prevent ethanol from driving up food costs.But doubts are growing. A number of scientific studies have shown that the environmental benefits of corn ethanol are limited, reducing carbon dioxide only slightly compared with conventional gasoline, partly because a large amount of fuel goes into growing corn, including in fertilizers and farm equipment.Since the law\u2019s passage, breakthroughs in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have led to a boom in domestic oil production. The United States is now exporting oil. But no similar breakthrough in ethanol technology has advanced the industry. Last year, corn ethanol producers easily met the 15-billion-gallon production requirement, but refiners have not been able to make cleaner, noncorn biofuel on a cheap, commercial scale.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a standard that is not able to be met,\u201d said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, the chairwoman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \u201cSo you either reform it or get rid of it.\u201dIn Iowa, the mandate has attracted major employers like Dow and DuPont, which produce ethanol. Nearly all of the state\u2019s approximately 40 ethanol refiners use locally grown corn to produce about four billion gallons annually. Since the law\u2019s passage, the price of corn has more than doubled, to an average of $4.11 per bushel in 2014 from an average of $1.96 per bushel in 2005. Between 2011 and 2013, it climbed to $6 per bushel.\u201cIf you live in Iowa in a nice house, and send your kids to good schools, it\u2019s because of ethanol,\u201d said Eric Hakmiller, the president of Lincolnway Energy, an ethanol plant in Nevada, Iowa.But high corn prices have raised the cost of livestock feed, and in turn have made meat and dairy more expensive for consumers.\u201cIt\u2019s a tax on people who eat food,\u201d said Todd Simmons, the chairman of the National Chicken Council and the chief executive of Simmons Foods, a poultry producer in Siloam Springs, Ark.A 2013 report by FarmEcon, Mr. Elam\u2019s consulting firm, said that in the eight years since the passage of the Renewable Fuel Standard, the average annual cost of groceries for a family of four had grown by about $2,000.\u201cMandates for food-based biofuels like corn ethanol increase hunger,\u201d said Kelly Stone, a policy analyst with ActionAid USA, a nonprofit advocacy group working to end poverty.An already subsidized farm economy has found another subsidy. The Environmental Working Group, a Washington advocacy organization, says Iowa corn farmers received $15 billion in federal farm subsidies between 1995 and 2012.\u201cThe ethanol mandate is obsolete,\u201d said Scott Faber, the group\u2019s vice president of government affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s the toothpick on the subsidy club sandwich.\u201dIowa has become less dependent on ethanol, and voters who are not directly dependent on ethanol appear to be less concerned about the fate of the mandate.\u201cIt\u2019s created a lot of jobs,\u201d Michael Johnston, a truck driver and an independent, said over a beer at Dottie\u2019s Landmark Bar and Grill in Polk City, discussing his caucus vote. \u201cI like it the way it is. But ethanol wouldn\u2019t be the deciding factor. It\u2019s only one part of the economy. I care about taxes, national security.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The outcome, though, is far from assured.The plan is the brainchild of the European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the European Union. The digital single market involves a raft of new policies that would come into force \u2014 if everything goes according to plan \u2014 by the end of the decade. The proposal has been championed by many political leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission.By allowing anyone from Ireland to Bulgaria to tap into the same digital marketplace, policy makers argue, Europeans could access a more diverse \u2014 and often cheaper \u2014 set of online services, from discounted online shopping to video-on-demand programming. Right now, for instance, someone in Spain cannot legally view (or buy) digital movies or sports events that are streamed online by companies based in other European countries.For a new generation of politicians here, the goal \u2014 despite the absence of bonhomie among many countries \u2014 is nothing short of a digital United States of Europe. \u201cThere are going to be no easy victories,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, a former Estonian prime minister who is leading the European Commission\u2019s digital campaign. \u201cIt will be an uphill struggle.\u201dAs a straight-talking Estonian, Mr. Ansip does not do exaggeration. And he\u2019s right about the obstacles, given renewed anxiety about the global economy and the growing number of migrants on Europe\u2019s doorsteps. After all, if politicians can\u2019t agree on who should be let across their borders, some question how much time they will spend on ensuring that Amazon purchases or iTunes subscriptions are delivered efficiently.And many vested interests could still scupper the plans. National television producers, for example, have long supported regulations that restrict people in France, say, from buying video-on-demand services from neighboring Germany. \u201cAs soon as you go across a border, it becomes complicated and costly,\u201d said Paul Todd, head of eBay\u2019s European operations, adding that basic hurdles like high shipping costs limit people from reaching new customers. \u201cThere are annoying barriers to doing business.\u201dA potentially deeper problem is that basic Internet skills \u2014 along with other essential services like high-speed mobile networks \u2014 vary drastically among European countries, as does understanding of e-commerce and general familiarity with the online world.As a result, experts say, those countries accustomed to living in an online world may well plow ahead with Europe\u2019s plans for a digital single market, while less tech-savvy neighbors \u2014 including Portugal and Spain \u2014 could easily be left behind.\u201cEveryone says we need a single digital market,\u201d said Giuseppe Recchi, chairman of Telecom Italia, the country\u2019s former telecom monopoly. \u201cBut how do you make that happen so that everyone prospers?\u201dMark Scott is the European technology correspondent for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Battered Bank Stocks Reflect Not Just Jitters, but Mistrust", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byFair GameThe bear market in big United States financial stocks has many people wondering: Are we headed for another banking crisis?The KBW Bank Index, made up of 24 money-center institutions and top regional banks, certainly signals pain for this industry. The index has tumbled 19 percent this year and 26 percent since its peak in July.Some individual stocks have fared even worse. In recent days, shares of Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have hit 52-week lows. Bank of America has lost around 29 percent and Citi around 27 percent, year to date, while JPMorgan is down 13 percent.Clearly, the decline in bank shares reflects turmoil in the commodities markets, the economic downturn in China and renewed banking troubles in Europe. How much these woes will damage big banks\u2019 balance sheets and income statements remains uncertain.Investors seem to believe steep loan losses lie ahead. This message comes through loud and clear when you compare some banks\u2019 market capitalizations with their book values, or their net worths. When investors anticipate loan losses, they price bank shares below their corresponding book values.That uncomfortable position is where some of the nation\u2019s largest banks currently stand. For example, Citigroup shares are trading at 61 percent of its tangible book value, a measure of a bank\u2019s equity that excludes items that are difficult to assess, like good will. And Bank of America stock trades at 75 percent of its tangible book value, down from a slight premium late last year. Even the mighty JPMorgan trades at 19 percent above its tangible book; at year\u2019s end, the stock represented a 38 percent premium.Investors clearly expect loan losses at these institutions to mount. But they have also been rattled by the possibility that the United States might experience negative interest rates like those found in Japan. Such rates would drive down banks\u2019 profit margins, a reversal from the previously accepted view that banks\u2019 margins would increase this year as the Federal Reserve Board raised rates.This is a relatively new fear; few bank analysts have cut this year\u2019s earnings estimates for the sector.Now, however, Mr. Peabody says the selling in some big banks\u2019 shares has been overdone. While he foresees declining earnings at these institutions this year and next, he said he did not expect the level of loan losses that the stocks are signaling.For the banks, Mr. Peabody said in an interview, \u201cthe losses aren\u2019t going to be such that they can\u2019t absorb them in the norm of their earnings streams.\u201dThat means the discounts to book values have grown too large. \u201cI think the U.S. banks will come out of this downturn with their book values actually growing somewhat,\u201d Mr. Peabody said.So why have bank shares continued to fall? Mr. Peabody contended that excess selling pressure was a result of investors being forced to unwind big bets made in these stocks last year when it was widely believed that interest rates would rise and fuel bank profits.\u201cYou had huge money flows into dedicated bank stock funds \u2014 they doubled in size from $1 billion to $2 billion last year,\u201d Mr. Peabody said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re having now is a mechanical margin call by these funds, creating selling that has nothing to do with the fundamentals.\u201d\u201cAny number of statistics would validate the fact that banks today don\u2019t have the risks they had either in 1990 or 2008,\u201d Mr. Bove said, recalling two of the worst periods for banks in recent history. \u201cThe stocks are selling at such deep discounts to book value that they are telling you the book values are not valid.\u201dThis view, which Mr. Bove does not agree with, reflects investors\u2019 severe mistrust of both the banks and their regulators, he said. After instituting hundreds of new rules to strengthen the banking system and protect against disastrous losses, regulators have still not convinced investors that these institutions are sound.\u201cNobody believes that the industry has changed,\u201d Mr. Bove said. \u201cNobody believes that what the government has done has been effective.\u201dBank investors have good reason to be doubters. In the years leading to the financial crisis, regulators repeatedly stated that subprime mortgage losses would not be large enough to harm the overall economy. (Remember all the references to the subprime problem being \u201ccontained?\u201d) Then, in the aftermath of the mess, investors learned the hard way about losses at these institutions that far exceeded their reserves.The current psychology \u201cis you can\u2019t believe anything the government says because the government is not prone to telling the truth,\u201d Mr. Bove said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t believe anything the banks say because we know they\u2019ve lied to us repeatedly.\u201dThis view represents a \u201cmassive failure of government regulation,\u201d Mr. Bove recently told his clients. Investors don\u2019t believe central bankers are effective and they fret that bank balance sheets are \u201cblack boxes.\u201dAfter a recent in-depth analysis of balance sheets, Mr. Bove concluded that banks are far safer than investors seem to think.The only thing that could really wreck banks\u2019 financial positions is \u201ca recession that is as bad as 2008,\u201d Mr. Bove contended. \u201cForget all the other stuff \u2014 consumer loan losses will shake the banks and will cause banks to run into negative earnings.\u201d Mr. Bove is not forecasting such an event.Our nation\u2019s top financial regulators and its big bank managers must be frustrated by the deep skepticism investors hold toward them and their work. But the financial crisis destroyed much of the trust earned by these institutions over the years. Eight years later, investors seem to be telling them, \u201cYou have yet to win it back.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Haryana State in India Proposes New Caste Status in Bid to Quell Protests", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byNEW DELHI \u2014 A state government in India promised to introduce a bill to grant coveted \u201cbackward\u201d status to a relatively prosperous caste group, officials said Monday, in an effort to quell protests that have raged for the past four days.The protesters, members of the Jat caste group, had blocked roads around the capital, set fire to railway stations and cars, and temporarily shut down a crucial canal that is a major source of the city\u2019s water. Nineteen people were killed in the violence in surrounding Haryana State, and fears of water shortages led New Delhi to close its schools to conserve its supply.The main thoroughfare in the area, Grand Trunk Road, which had been reopened on Sunday, was blocked again by fighting on Monday morning, the police said. Still, a state official said, 80 percent of the roads that had been closed were open again on Monday morning.Roshan Shankar, an adviser to the Delhi government, said the authorities had regained control of a canal that supplied water to New Delhi, though the canal was badly damaged. For now, he said, the government was using existing reserves and other water bodies to meet the need. He said severe, widespread shortages had not been reported so far.Nevertheless, he added, officials were \u201ctrying to get people to ration.\u201dA Jat leader, Satpal Singh Sangwan, a retired government official, said in an interview that officials had assured him that the Jat group would be added to a list of more than 2,000 other groups considered \u201cbackward,\u201d making their members eligible for quotas in government jobs and university admissions.\u201cWe\u2019re not 100 percent satisfied, but it\u2019s a beginning,\u201d he said.A year ago, another relatively prosperous caste group, in the state of Gujarat, also demanded, unsuccessfully, to be part of the \u201cbackward classes.\u201d Yet the latest caste protests are only the most violent and visible in what has been a steady stream of requests from different caste groups claiming to be \u201cbackward.\u201dIt is one of the country\u2019s major paradoxes that a population that has been trying for decades to rid itself of the caste system finds so many groups demanding to be ranked lower on the socioeconomic ladder in order to advance themselves economically.Experts say the trend is being driven by increasing numbers of Indians who fear being left behind in the rapidly modernizing economy and who see government quotas as the only tangible way they can gain influence to help better themselves economically.Vast numbers of Indians now \u201cfeel totally helpless with regard to the economy and private capital,\u201d said Satish Deshpande, a sociology professor at Delhi University.\u201cThere\u2019s a disillusionment,\u201d said Harsh Pant, a professor of international relations at King\u2019s College in London, because \u201cthe private sector is now passing them by.\u201dDespite the economic liberalization that began here in the 1990s, many people still lack jobs and educational opportunities, intensifying the competition for the age-old staple of government jobs. Almost half of government jobs and university seats in the country are reserved for members of special groups.India\u2019s Constitution guarantees equality to all, but it also enshrines caste-based affirmative action for the lowest social group, the Dalits, known in legal terms as scheduled castes, and for indigenous forest-dwellers, known as scheduled tribes. In time, the government created a third group, the Other Backward Classes.In many cases, groups flex their electoral muscles to induce the government to add them to the list of groups considered backward.The Jats started on that path. In 2014, as national elections approached, the incumbent Congress party agreed to their demand for backward status. But the Supreme Court struck down the decision last year, noting that a commission set up to review the program had refused to recommend such a step for the group.Even as the Haryana State government on Monday was announcing its intention to allow the Jats to be considered among the \u201cbackward classes,\u201d P. K. Das, the additional chief secretary of Haryana, which adjoins New Delhi, said in an interview that the path was complicated by the legal issues already raised by the Supreme Court. But he said the government would have to try to draw up a plan that passed legal muster this time around so the Jats could be included.Mr. Das said the decision was made in a meeting Sunday between the state and central government, both of which are run by the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.After the announcement of the deal, state and federal government officials said the violence that escalated over the weekend had subsided in most parts of Haryana, although sporadic episodes continued. Protesters on Monday set fire to the car of a magistrate in one area and burned several cars of a freight train, the Haryana police said.The Jat protests became so out of hand over the weekend that the Indian Army had to be called in. Mr. Das said several protesters were killed in clashes with another caste group whose property was being burned. Other people were killed when law enforcement officials fired at protesters who had turned violent, he said. At least 19 people in all have been killed, Mr. Das said.The riots also disrupted businesses. Maruti Suzuki India, the country\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, said over the weekend that it had suspended manufacturing at two area factories.Suhasini Raj contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Newly Elected Central African Republic Leader Faces Hard Realities", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byBANGUI, Central African Republic \u2014 A former prime minister, Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra, has won election as president of the Central African Republic, according to preliminary results, setting the stage for the first elected government in three years for a poverty-stricken country that is just emerging from a devastating civil war.Mr. Touad\u00e9ra was declared the winner after receiving nearly 63 percent of the votes in a runoff election, the National Elections Authority said late Saturday. The results still need to be confirmed by the country\u2019s constitutional court, but are expected to stand after Mr. Touad\u00e9ra\u2019s main rival said he would not contest them.On Sunday morning, as some of his supporters marched in the streets, beating drums and singing, Mr. Touad\u00e9ra said he would focus on building the battered economy of a country that is one of the poorest in Africa.\u201cWe, Central Africans of all regions, religions, social status and generations, are going to transform our country into a vast workshop that offers job opportunities to young people and creates wealth that is redistributed equally,\u201d the president-elect said.Anicet-Georges Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9, who led after the first round of voting in December, conceded the election an hour after the results were announced. He said the balloting had been marred by widespread fraud, but urged his supporters to remain peaceful and \u201caccompany the new president in his endeavor to rebuild the country.\u201d Election monitors said that although some fraud occurred at some polling stations, it would not have altered the final vote.Mr. Touad\u00e9ra ran as an independent candidate, styling himself as a man of the people, traveling to the provinces by road instead of booking private flights as his rivals did.During the election campaign, Mr. Touad\u00e9ra said one of his main priorities was \u201cto attract investors so that Central Africans and foreigners alike feel welcome to do business in the country.\u201d He said he planned to develop remote provinces, especially in the north, that lack primary infrastructure after years of neglect by previous governments.But huge challenges remain. Armed groups stemming from the Seleka and gangs affiliated with the anti-Balaka still control parts of the country where the state has virtually no presence.Disarming the armed groups will not be easy, analysts say.Thibaud Lesueur, the crisis group\u2019s senior analyst for the Central African Republic, said, \u201cThough some leaders have shown a willingness to negotiate, hard-liners will probably seek to destabilize the new government.\u201d Mr. Lesueur added that French troops brought in to support a United Nations force would gradually leave this year, \u201cand this augments the risks of post-electoral violence.\u201dThe constitutional court will rule on the results of the presidential vote on March 11, and the new president should be inaugurated by the end of that month. Parliamentary elections, which were postponed last year because of widespread irregularities, should be completed by the end of April.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michigan Democrat Opposes Trans-Pacific Pact", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A senior House Democrat who is among his party\u2019s top voices on trade came out against the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership on Thursday, further darkening the congressional outlook for the landmark agreement.The opposition of the Democrat, Representative Sander M. Levin, who represents suburban Detroit, was not a big surprise, given the objections to the pact by the Ford Motor Company and organized labor. But he had worked with the administration throughout the yearslong negotiations, and his arguments will provide grist for other Democrats to reject the agreement, one of the president\u2019s top priorities.The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was signed by the countries\u2019 trade ministers this month after negotiations were completed in October, is not likely to come to a vote in Congress until year\u2019s end, if then. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, opposes bringing it to a vote in his chamber before the November elections. People in both parties say the agreement, which would be the largest regional trade alliance in history, currently lacks sufficient support.Speaking to reporters at a gathering sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor, Mr. Levin said that while his position \u201chas never been \u2018no T.P.P.,\u2019 \u201d he believed that the agreement fell short, particularly in four areas. He cited weaknesses in the protection of worker rights; penalties for nations that manipulate their currencies to underprice their exports; rules that would guard against the use of materials like auto parts from nations \u2014 primarily China \u2014 that are not parties to the agreement; and a dispute-resolution system that corporations have used to challenge countries\u2019 environmental, health and labor safeguards as anti-trade.As Mr. Levin pointed out in his remarks and in a four-page statement, the accord is the first comprehensive trade pact that would bind the United States both to developed economies \u2014 including Japan, Canada and Australia \u2014 and to a communist nation, Vietnam. The other parties are Mexico, Chile, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.He was especially critical of Mexico, Vietnam and Malaysia for \u201cabhorrent abuses of fundamental worker rights,\u201d including the right to form independent, effective unions. Mr. Levin said he could not be confident that the nations would comply with far-reaching side agreements that the administration negotiated with Vietnam and Malaysia, requiring them to change laws and take other reformist actions.Matthew McAlvanah, a spokesman for Mr. Obama\u2019s trade ambassador, Michael B. Froman, said that \u201cwe\u2019re disappointed but not surprised\u201d by Mr. Levin\u2019s opposition, given his votes against some recent trade bills. \u201cIn T.P.P., we\u2019ve made historic progress on issues important to House Democrats and look forward to continuing to work on a bipartisan basis to move legislation forward,\u201d Mr. McAlvanah said.Advertisement"}

Poland\u2019s new right-wing government, in particular, has made the deployment of NATO troops in the region a major foreign policy goal.This summer\u2019s NATO summit meeting will be held in Warsaw, and the American proposal anticipates some of the demands likely to be raised.\u201cRussia is still strongly perceived as a threat, and bolder U.S. moves and capabilities would be most welcomed,\u201d said Radu Magdin, a political analyst in Bucharest, Romania. Romania, Poland and the Baltics have been especially vocal in criticizing Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its continuing support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.Not everyone will react positively to a larger American military presence, analysts said. In some countries, like the Czech Republic, where some leaders have increasingly made overtures to Moscow, the move may be seen as counterproductive.In Moscow, analysts tried Tuesday morning to predict Mr. Putin\u2019s reaction. They agreed that it would almost certainly involve increasing troops and equipment along the country\u2019s western border.Mr. Korotchenko agreed that new weapons systems would probably be deployed in the region, but he did not expect there to be a major increase in Russian military spending \u2014 something the Kremlin might be hard-pressed to support with low oil prices and international sanctions hobbling the Russian economy.\u201cWe remember well how the arms race ended for the Soviet Union,\u201d Mr. Korotchenko said. \u201cWe will not make the same mistake twice.\u201dReporting was contributed by Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow; Hana de Goeij from Prague; Joanna Berendt from Warsaw; Kit Gillet from Bucharest, Romania; Richard Martyn-Hemphill from Riga, Latvia; and Miroslava Germanova from Bratislava, Slovakia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Doubts in Asia Over Whether New Sanctions Against North Korea Can Work", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byThe draft contained the most comprehensive and toughest sanctions against the isolated country that the council has ever considered. There was no doubt that they would squeeze North Korea\u2019s ability to raise funds for its weapons programs, depending on how vigorously China, the North\u2019s single largest trade partner, enforced the sanctions, analysts said.If adopted, the resolution would require United Nations member states to inspect all cargo passing through their territories to or from North Korea for illicit goods. It would also attempt to limit North Korea\u2019s sale of minerals, especially coal and iron ore, two of its most important exports.But the draft contained no effective sanctions against a booming trade across the relatively porous 870-mile border between China and North Korea \u2014 a lifeline not only for the impoverished North Korean people but also for their government\u2019s ability to earn cash. Nor did it require countries, especially China, to cut off oil exports to the North.It would also not affect tens of thousands of North Korean workers at factories, construction sites and logging camps in China, Russia, Africa and the Middle East. According to some estimates, they send home $200 million to $300 million a year, most of which human rights groups contend ends up in the coffers of the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un.\u201cThese sanctions will certainly hurt the North,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they will hurt them enough to abandon their nuclear weapons.\u201dAnalysts in China said Beijing\u2019s approval of the sanctions proposed by the United States was the result of a complex calculus by Communist Party leaders. A factor that has loomed large for them in recent weeks is plans by Washington to deploy an antiballistic missile system, called Thaad, in South Korea. Chinese officials are seeking ways to prevent that from happening.\u201cIf it was not for the Thaad issue, there might not be such cooperation between China and the U.S.,\u201d said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cBy doing this, it is still possible for China to dissuade the Americans from deploying Thaad at China\u2019s doorstep.\u201dChina\u2019s agreement to limit imports of North Korean coal and iron ore, for example, came with an important caveat: It should be demonstrated that such imports would support illicit North Korean activities. North Korea\u2019s minerals, mainly its coal and iron ore, accounted for 53 percent of its $2.8 billion in exports to China in 2014, according to data compiled by the government-run Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.But because of a slowing Chinese economy and sharp declines in global prices, those coal and iron ore exports have been decreasing since 2013. North Korea has already begun making up for the shortfall by exporting more workers abroad, the analyst Lee Seok said in a report published by the Korea Institute last month. The workers have therefore become an increasingly important source of cash for the North Korean government.Nor would the proposed sanctions affect North Korea\u2019s growing business of making clothes on contracts from Chinese companies. North Korean textile exports to China expanded to $741 million in 2014 from $186 million in 2010, and the goods are made mostly at factories run by the North Korean military or the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, analysts and officials in Seoul said.\u201cThere are still too many loopholes for us to predict that they will lead to North Korea\u2019s denuclearization,\u201d said Chang Yong-seok, an analyst at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. \u201cThese sanctions are more like a warning to the North about how much more it could suffer if it conducted another nuclear test, and an inducement for the country to return to the negotiating table.\u201dCurrently, an estimated 75 percent of North Korea\u2019s foreign trade, including almost all of its oil imports, is with China, providing Beijing with unique economic leverage over the North. The two-way trade amounted to $5.5 billion last year, according to figures from Chinese customs authorities.But China\u2019s approach on how to solve the North Korean problem is fundamentally different from that of the United States or South Korea. It insists that sanctions should not aim to push North Korea toward instability but to induce it back to the negotiating table.After negotiating the proposed sanctions with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday that North Korea could ultimately have a peace agreement with the United States \u201cif it will come to the table and negotiate the denuclearization.\u201dNorth Korea has been hit with a series of ever-tightening sanctions because of its nuclear tests and rocket launches since 2006. But the effect on one of the world\u2019s least trade-dependent economies has been limited, especially when China has opposed crippling penalties.The government has learned to shift the pain of international sanctions to its people by squeezing the resources available for the poor, while the elite has remained intact, defectors from the country have said.Still, the proposed sanctions, especially mandatory inspections of all cargo, would make it harder for North Korea to raise funds and import technology for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, analysts said. Until now, countries were required to inspect North Korean cargo only if they had reasonable grounds to believe it contained illicit items.The proposed resolution would also ban countries from selling to the North all small arms and other conventional weapons, as well as dual-use nuclear and missile-related goods and items like trucks that could be converted for military use. It would also ban the sales of aviation and rocket fuel to hurt the North Korean military\u2019s ability to conduct regular drills. The resolution is also expected to expand the list of luxury goods countries are banned from selling to the North.\u201cThis could be bad because most of the parts for the nuclear facilities could only come from the outside world,\u201d Wang Junsheng, a researcher on North Korea at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said about the mandatory inspection of cargo.Mr. Wang said negotiations between the United States and China over the terms of the sanctions had dragged on for seven weeks because Washington had wanted Beijing to cut off more trade. That included exports of oil and imports of coal, he said.But although China was fed up with Mr. Kim\u2019s aggressive and unpredictable behavior, it refused to enshrine those trade limits in the sanctions because energy supplies are tied to the well-being of civilians in North Korea and China \u2014 especially important during the harsh winter, he said. \u201cCutting off the trade could trigger a mass-scale humanitarian crisis,\u201d Mr. Wang said.Choe Sang-Hun reported from Seoul, and Edward Wong from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona Shifts Focus From Immigration Debate", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byPHOENIX \u2014 When Doug Ducey ran for governor of this border state, he accused President Obama of \u201cdithering far too long\u201d on immigration and vowed to \u201cfight back\u201d against illegal border crossers, pledging to use every resource at his command: \u201cfencing, satellites, guardsmen, more police and prosecutors.\u201d\u201cI want this state to be known for what it is, the land of opportunity,\u201d Mr. Ducey said in an interview. \u201cSo our main focus is our economy and our education system.\u201dBut he may soon have to wade into the divisive immigration debate, which is again coloring Arizona\u2019s legislative session and bringing angry crowds of protesters to the Capitol\u2019s lawn and hearing rooms.One bill would punish communities that offer sanctuary to unauthorized immigrants facing deportation; those communities\u2019 share of state revenues would be withheld. Another measure would require judges to sentence undocumented immigrants to the fullest possible term in prison for whatever crime they committed. A Senate committee approved both on Feb. 3 in party-line votes.A third bill, which would impose citizenship and legal residency requirements for municipal identification cards, cleared three Senate committees in three weeks with blanket support from Republican lawmakers, underscoring their priorities here in an election year.\u201cIt\u2019s tough to propose new illegal immigration bills in Arizona, because we\u2019ve pretty much done them all,\u201d said State Senator John Kavanagh, a retired Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police officer who found a second calling as a leading conservative in Arizona.Mr. Kavanagh was among the crucial supporters of the measure, which Mr. Ducey\u2019s predecessor, Jan Brewer, approved. The legislation divided a state already scarred by years of targeted enforcement against Latinos, who make up one-third of the population.The municipal identification bill, which Mr. Kavanagh also sponsored, \u201cis primarily to protect the integrity of government ID cards,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it does have an impact on illegal immigration, because it prevents illegal immigrants from getting one of those cards.\u201dMr. Ducey has not said a word about this or the other immigration bills. But people on both sides of the immigration debate are eagerly awaiting any action he might take on the measures. They could serve as a litmus test for his positions on the subject, which, as governor, he has deftly avoided articulating.He also proposed spending $31.5 million to send 200 state troopers after drug smugglers along the border, the only border-related program he has championed so far. The scope of the effort is a far cry from the $800 million that Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, also a Republican, secured from his state\u2019s Legislature last year to extend indefinitely the deployment of National Guard troops and air and ground surveillance along the Rio Grande Valley, which has faced questions over its cost and results.\u201cOur goal, because of limited resources, was going after what was most hurtful, and that was why we went after the drug cartels,\u201d Mr. Ducey said in the interview, drawing a distinction between his and Mr. Abbott\u2019s approaches.\u201cWhere there\u2019s an opportunity to work together to get results for the citizens of the state of Arizona, to increase public safety,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that\u2019s my responsibility as governor to take advantage.\u201dMr. Ducey had the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, R. Gil Kerlikowske, an Obama appointee, by his side when he announced the border program from the State Capitol in November. That was a clear departure from Ms. Brewer, who is still well remembered for wagging a finger at Mr. Obama on an airport tarmac.In an interview, Ms. Brewer said her successor should use his bully pulpit to \u201ctell the federal government to secure our border, then we can deal with all the other problems that are upon us as a country.\u201dHe has been handing out olive branches instead.When Mr. Ducey met Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson early last year, he said by way of introduction, \u201cThis is a new administration, and I\u2019d like a fresh start.\u201d In June, Mr. Ducey led a trade mission to Mexico City, the first Arizona governor to do so in a decade, then traveled to Sonora, Mexico, three months later to attend the inauguration of his counterpart across the border.Immigration advocates have been cautiously watching from the sidelines, unsure what to make of him just yet.\u201cAt least he isn\u2019t using the hate speech we heard so often from Governor Brewer,\u201d said Viridiana Gonz\u00e1lez, who leads a coalition of community groups opposing Mr. Kavanagh\u2019s bill, after a protest of the legislation last month.State Representative Bruce Wheeler, a Democrat from Tucson who is assistant minority whip, said in an interview, \u201cI don\u2019t know if what we\u2019re witnessing is a change in substance or a change of style, but I\u2019m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.\u201dMr. Ducey made no mention of illegal immigrants as he outlined his border proposal, which he carefully framed around the heavy toll heroin addiction has exacted in Arizona.\u201cThis is not Arizona\u2019s problem,\u201d Mr. Ducey said. \u201cThis is America\u2019s problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That threatens to slow commercial truck traffic and other cross-border business, and presents a significant economic risk, particularly if there is a surge in migration this year.\u201cThere is a high cost for our economies if Schengen would be at risk,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, told a news conference.Government investment in accommodating migrants and enhancing border security could lift growth in some European countries by up to 0.5 percent, Mr. Moscovici said. But it is too early to make any forecasts about the net effect of the influx, he said.In China, efforts by the leadership to rebalance the economy away from low-end manufacturing have put markets around the world on edge. That has helped to stir concerns about a \u201cdisorderly adjustment in China,\u201d the commission said in a short statement accompanying its forecast.The commission\u2019s statement also warned of risks from a further interest rate increase in the United States that could cause disruption in financial markets, and from a further fall in oil prices that could hurt oil exporting countries and crimp demand for European exports.Mr. Moscovici played down the risks that Britain \u2014 the second biggest economy in the European Union last year after Germany \u2014 would vote to leave the bloc in a referendum that is expected to be held as soon as June.\u201cI\u2019m not talking about Brexit because we are all fighting to avoid that risk,\u201d said Mr. Moscovici, using the shorthand for a British vote to exit the bloc. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not in these forecasts, because it\u2019s not in our minds.\u201dAs a result, the commission\u2019s growth forecast was only slightly more pessimistic than its previous predictions.The commission said that the economy of the 28-member European Union grew 1.9 percent last year \u2014 in line with its previous forecast, in November. But it lowered its forecasts by 0.1 of a percentage point in 2016, to 1.9 percent, and by the same amount in 2017, to 2 percent.The United States economy has been growing faster than that of Europe in the past few years \u2014 by 2.4 percent in 2015, for example \u2014 although it, too, has shown signs of slowing.The European Commission estimated on Thursday that the 19-member eurozone grew 1.6 percent last year, and that it would grow 1.9 percent in 2017. Those figures were in line with its previous forecasts. But the commission slightly lowered its prediction for eurozone growth this year, to 1.7 percent of gross domestic product, from 1.8 percent.Such a slight decline would represent a reduction in the eurozone\u2019s G.D.P. of about 11 billion euros, or $12 billion, the commission said.Advertisement"}

Polarizing ads have raised awareness (no Matthew McConaughey jokes here, I promise), and new product is filling showrooms.In the white-hot crossover segment, the 2016 MKX and MKC should be rainmakers for the brand. The previous MKX looked like a Ford Edge wearing a fancy grille and taillamps, an approach that simply doesn\u2019t work today.

A raised center console with cavernous storage bins in which to misplace things gives the cabin a cocoonlike vibe. Early production vehicles got the outgoing Sync 2 user interface; insist on the revised and much improved Sync 3.The MKX begins at $39,185, but the all-wheel-drive model I drove \u2014 lavished with all the major options \u2014 creeps up on $62,000.

And it uses standard grade gas. Lincoln is stingy, with the gears offering only 6 speeds where competitors get 8. Opinions vary on the push-button selector, but at least it\u2019s straightforward. All MKXs have adaptive suspension; all-wheel-drive models add adjustable dynamics, but the feature is buried in a menu.Torque rich, the turbo motor whispers from 0 to 60 miles an hour in about six seconds. Using the same tech used in noise-canceling headphones, the MKX is as hushed as it is powerful. The absence of road noise spotlights faint wind noise at higher speeds.This Lincoln is appropriately comfortable. Soft and floaty? Not so much. Modern safety technology, like blind-spot warning, automated parking assist and auto braking, is available.The government rates the fuel economy of the 2.7-liter engine at 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 on the highway with all-wheel drive. I saw about 20.Added to the available luxury features of the killer Revel sound system, heated steering wheel and supportive vented seats is a massage feature for the front chairs strong enough to give a masseuse pause.MKX is a five-seat proposition with no third row available. Space isn\u2019t an issue in the back seat. The bench doesn\u2019t slide fore and aft, but the backs recline. Heated seats and a 110-volt outlet make life easier for passengers. Outboard riders can be protected with belts featuring integrated airbags.The MKX offers the auto opening trunk feature. Wave your foot under the bumper, and the liftgate opens. Seat releases in the cargo hold are handy. Too bad the X doesn\u2019t have 40/20/40 split seats. At 37.2 cubic feet, the trunk is a bit larger than many in this class.The genteel look and feel of this Lincoln may snag a few Lexus RX owners put off by the severe redesign. Time to start revving up those quirky McConaughey ads.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Video Review: The BMW X5 xDrive40e, a Hybrid for the Future", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byDrivenINEXPENSIVE gasoline has fueled sales of the crossovers and sport utility vehicles that Americans love. That\u2019s good for the automakers\u2019 bottom line, but it also presents a challenge as fuel economy standards get stricter.It would appear that this technology is the way to go for the foreseeable future, since batteries that take cars hundreds of miles are expensive (looking at you, Tesla) and there is no refueling infrastructure yet in place for cars using hydrogen fuel cell technology.With a pure battery range of 14 miles, the 40e is no Volt. It charges in three hours on 220-volt current, seven hours on 110. It can reach 75 miles an hour on battery power alone; the gas engine assists from there. It does not have to be charged up to operate, but that defeats the purpose, right?In total, there are 308 horses and a healthy 332 pound-feet of torque. The lithium-ion battery pack is beneath the cargo floor where in the X5 35i, the 40e\u2019s fully fossil-fuel sibling, the third row of seats would live. The 40e is strictly a five-seat affair.There are three drive modes: Max, Save and Auto. Max provides pure electric power; Save forces gas operation and even charges the battery a bit. Most owners will use Auto, in which the 40e behaves much like any hybrid. The difference is that the smooth electric-to-gas transition happens at higher speeds, up to 45 miles an hour.Impressively, the 40e drives much like a standard 35i.The brake pedal feels a touch disconnected, common with hybrids. From inside the cabin, the quiet 4-cylinder engine seems as if it\u2019s in the next county.Quicker than a Prius, the 40e bolts from zero to 60 miles an hour in 6.5 seconds with a standard all-wheel-drive system that\u2019s always active. It drives well, though at 5,220 pounds, it\u2019s around 430 pounds heavier than the 35i, and that mass is felt. The hippopotamus ballerinas from \u201cFantasia\u201d come to mind. It\u2019s an S.U.V., not an M3.Fuel economy depends on how it\u2019s driven and how frequently it\u2019s charged. If you understand the government rating of 56 miles per gallon equivalent, you\u2019re smarter than average. I saw everything from 57 m.p.g. (driving carefully in urban conditions) to 21 m.p.g. with a hard foot and a spent battery. My total average for the week was 31 when I plugged it in nightly.Whatever the fuel economy, occupants will enjoy the interior. Soothing accent lighting bathes the entire cabin. Seats are bolstered for a wide range of posteriors. The 40e is most efficient when a destination is set on the navigation system (by drawing letters and numbers on the iDrive function knob) since the eDrive takes into consideration the topography of the route. Be aware that the drivetrain turns off if you open the front door. It\u2019s a safety feature.In the rear, a low-profile drive shaft tunnel keeps the back seat spacious. Two adults can stretch out; three smaller passengers should be comfortable. The seats split 40-20-40. The battery pack eliminates the cargo area available in the 35i without the back seat option, but the trunk space remains the same size.Today\u2019s cheap gas makes it tough to break even financially. The car starts at $63,095 (the version I tested was $71,995) and the eDrive hybrid system is $5,000 more. A $4,668 federal tax credit nearly covers that bill, but don\u2019t forget the charger installation. Still, if plug-in hybrids are the future of efficiency, we could all do a lot worse than drive something as well engineered as the X5.http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/automobiles/autoreviews/video-review-the-bmw-x5-40e-a-hybrid-for-the-future.htmlAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sheltering Campus: Why College Is Not Home", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byNotebookErika Christakis used to teach a course at Yale titled \u201cThe Concept of the Problem Child,\u201d a discussion of child development and socialization in a historical and modern context. The course was a seminar of 20 participants, and it was popular; she had planned extra sessions this semester to accommodate the hundreds of interested students.Then came the notorious email \u2014 subject: \u201cDressing Yourselves\u201d \u2014 that she sent to students in the residence hall where she and her husband serve as masters. In it, she criticized a detailed memo from administrators advising sensitivity in choice of Halloween costumes and activities. The essential point in the email: The university\u2019s memo infantilized the students. The term, in developmental psychology, refers to a parenting approach that uses a level of assistance and control more appropriate for much younger children; ultimately, such behavior can hinder capacities to develop independence and resilience.Despite Ms. Christakis\u2019s nuanced argument, an open letter denounced her views as degrading to marginalized people and garnered nearly a thousand signatures, and a video of students confronting and verbally assaulting her husband went viral.We helped organize an open letter of our own, defending Ms. Christakis\u2019s contribution to campus discourse; it was signed by 88 current or retired Yale faculty members. But as a result of the harsh reaction she experienced, she announced in December that she would no longer teach at Yale, eliminating an important educational option for undergraduates.While this dramatic incident raised concerns about free speech and civil debate on campus, it is also worth analyzing it from a developmental perspective. After all, universities are the settings for the transition to adulthood for a large segment of American youth.The college years \u2014 a time for important growth in autonomy and the consolidation of adult identity and life goals \u2014 have evolved into an extended period of adolescence during which many of today\u2019s students are not saddled with adult responsibilities.For previous generations, college was a decisive break from parental supervision; guidance and support needed to come from peers and from within. In the past two decades, however, continued family contact and dependence, thanks to cellphones, email and social media, has increased significantly \u2014 some parents go so far as to help with coursework.At the same time, the rise in protective committees and procedures (like trigger warnings) ensure that students will not be confronted with course materials that might upset them (even classics like Ovid\u2019s \u201cMetamorphoses\u201d and \u201cThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\u201d). Instead of promoting the idea of college as a transition from the shelter of the family to adult autonomy and responsibility, universities like Yale have given in to the implicit notion that they should provide the equivalent of the home environment.Small wonder that among the angry expressions flung at the Christakises was the plaintive cry, \u201cIt is your job to create a place of comfort and home.\u201d But college is a different kind of community than a family, and its primary job is education of the student and adaptation to independent community living.To prepare for increased autonomy and responsibility, college needs to be a time of exploration and experimentation. This process entails \u201ctrying on\u201d new ways of thinking about oneself both intellectually and personally, which is possible only if a certain degree of freedom is allowed. While we should provide \u201csafe spaces\u201d within colleges for marginalized groups, we must also make it safe for all community members to express opinions and challenge majority views. Intellectual growth and flexibility are fostered by rigorous debate and questioning.Learning to navigate the social world is equally important. Because a college community differs from the family, many students will struggle to find a sense of belonging and a meaningful sub-community of peers. If students are overly managed and come to rely on administrators to regulate their interactions and perceptions, they are not facing the challenge of finding an identity within a larger and diverse community.Moreover, the temptation for universities to monitor and moderate student behavior runs up against another characteristic of young adults: the response to being controlled by their elders.Adolescence is a charged time, with rapid hormonal changes coinciding with moral development and emotional energy in need of an outlet. If acceptable social behavior is too strictly defined and controlled from above, the insensitive or transgressive behavior that administrators are seeking to minimize may actually be stimulated.Such feelings may have played a role in recent incidents, such as the disrespectful behavior of students toward a distinguished professor at Yale or the vandalism of photos of eminent minority faculty members at Harvard Law School.It is not surprising that young people are prone to lash out, particularly when there are sociologic reasons to do so. Our generation rallied around clear issues: the war in Vietnam and governmentally sanctioned discrimination based on race and gender. ISIS, Newtown, a changing economy with fewer good jobs and stable career paths create anxiety without generating a unifying moral vision. What is lacking in today\u2019s understanding is the conflict between adolescents\u2019 desire for autonomy and their perception of an unsafe world. Hence the desire for their dorms to be surrogate homes and not places to experience intellectual growth.There are real safety issues for college students, such as sexual assault and substance abuse, which require in loco parentis supervision. But social norms are increasingly being set by college authorities, not students.As Erika Christakis wrote in her email: \u201cAre we all O.K. with this transfer of power?\u201dThe encroachment of behavioral guidelines into the social and even intellectual spheres comes at a cost. Every college discussion about community values, social climate and behavior should also include recognition of the developmental importance of student autonomy and self-regulation, of the necessary tension between safety and self-discovery.A.

{"Headline": "What Happened to the Great Divergence?", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Beginning in 2014, we saw confident predictions of a coming strong divergence in monetary policy among the major economies. To date, there has been less policy divergence in reality than had been predicted. This observation raises the question of whether there may be limits on policy divergence in current circumstances. Such limits might reflect common forces buffeting economies around the world or the powerful transmission of shocks across borders through exchange rate and other financial channels that may have the effect of front-running monetary policy adjustments in the vicinity of the zero lower bound. Put differently, predictions that U.S. monetary policy would chart a notably divergent path have been tempered by powerful crosscurrents from abroad.Not to keep you in suspense, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the punchline: the US economy reaps the bulk of the gains from rising demand relative to other countries if and only if that relative rise is perceived by markets as temporary.

Most sectors \u2014 from consumption and housing investment to exports \u2014 deteriorated.The decline in Japan\u2019s gross domestic product was the second in three quarters, and was sharper than most private sector economists had forecast. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a contraction of 0.8 percent, on average.With concerns about the health of the global economy sending shudders though the financial markets, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing what may be the toughest test yet of his three-year-old campaign to lift Japanese growth rates and end two decades of deflation.One crucial pillar of that campaign \u2014 a weaker currency \u2014 has lately begun to crack. The yen dropped by about 40 percent against the dollar from the time Mr. Abe took office in late 2012 until the end of last year, as the Japanese central bank carried out an aggressive program of monetary stimulus.The devaluation of the yen enriched automakers and other big companies that earn most of their revenues abroad, and sent the Japanese stock market soaring. It helped nudge consumer prices higher, too, another central goal of Mr. Abe\u2019s economic agenda, known as Abenomics.But since late last year, a flight to safe assets by global investors has reversed the yen\u2019s direction. Stocks have tumbled \u2014 the Nikkei 225 average lost 12 percent last week, its worst weekly performance since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. Inflation has slipped back to around zero.In response, the central bank \u2014 the Bank of Japan \u2014 announced last month that it would take the unusual step of cutting its benchmark interest rate below zero, joining a group of European countries that are also struggling with deflation.The Nikkei surged more than 5 percent in early trading on Monday despite the gloomy economic report, possibly reflecting a slight easing in the yen after Asian markets closed on Friday.Mr. Abe\u2019s governing coalition faces an election for the upper house of Parliament this summer. Analysts and advisers say he has been counting on public support for his economic policies to extend the coalition\u2019s majority there. The strategy now looks less bankable, though it is unclear whether Japan\u2019s weak collection of opposition parties can capitalize on any voter backlash.For all of 2015, the Japanese economy eked out growth of 0.4 percent, the government data released on Monday showed.Japanese G.D.P. data are often subject to sharp future revisions. The low growth rate, meanwhile, means those changes can easily make the difference between an economy that appears to be growing and one that is shrinking. Last quarter, for instance, the government initially said the economy was in recession, having contracted for two straight quarters, only to declare a few weeks later that output had actually grown.Even so, the economic contraction measured by the government\u2019s data on Monday took place as the recent financial market turmoil was only beginning. Should the volatility continue, analysts say, Japan could fall into recession for real this time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End of the Road May Be Near for Side Mirrors", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byWheelsBEFORE engineers dreamed of eliminating drivers in cars, they imagined eliminating the side mirrors. The protuberances are ugly, create aerodynamic drag, and their associated blind spots are the bane of parking-challenged drivers everywhere.But now, a long-sought solution looks closer to finally stripping cars of their Mickey Mouse ears, as many automakers demonstrate video systems that replace side mirrors with cameras.Continental, a major parts and systems supplier to automakers, calls them digital mirrors.In a customized Mercedes-Benz CLS, Continental demonstrated how its system would work. Thumb-size video cameras on the exterior of the car replace the side-mounted mirrors and use interior screens on the left and right side of the dashboard to deliver views of what is next to and behind the car.The screens are near where a driver would normally look to check a mirror, and the camera views are wider than what a physical mirror can provide, eliminating blind spots along the side of the car. The cameras, which can automatically adjust to reduce glare from sunlight or increase brightness at night, are also helpful in tight parking spots.\u201cNo matter where someone stands behind you, you can see them,\u201d said Philipp Hoffmann, BMW\u2019s project manager for camera monitor systems, as we backed up in a crowded parking lot during the International CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas last month.We were in an exotic-looking BMW i8 sports car with tiny cameras on stalks instead of side mirrors. Together with a camera just above the rear window, the three views can be displayed on a high-resolution monitor that replaces the rearview mirror. A glance up gives the driver a picture of what is beside and behind the vehicle.Mr. Hoffmann pushed a button and the rearview monitor image transformed into a virtual panoramic rear view that electronically stitched all three camera pictures into a seamless image. The resulting live image made it appear as if nothing was behind the driver to obscure the view.Mr. Hoffmann also demonstrated how the video cameras, which can recognize and gauge the speed of objects around the car, can be tied into automatic braking, parking and collision systems to protect the driver and the i8\u2019s glossy finish.Because of the potential benefits, other technology suppliers, like Valeo and Visteon, are also keen on mirrorless systems and hope that regulations requiring old-fashioned physical mirrors will be amended.Mr. Hoffmann said he expected to begin road testing of the mirrorless systems in Europe this year, quickly followed by additional testing in Asia. He remained hopeful that the United States would follow suit soon.Rearview cameras provide a precedent. Those that eliminate the blind spots directly behind vehicles are already deemed a significant safety improvement and will be mandatory in cars and light trucks in the United States by 2018.LaneWatch uses a camera on the passenger side to give the driver a video view in the dashboard screen of the right side lane whenever the turn signal is activated. Mr. Zuby said there was a correlation between the LaneWatch system and a reduction in accident insurance claims, although further study was needed.Using cameras instead of physical mirrors could also end dangling damaged mirrors. To replace a typical mirror, which features built-in defrost, turn signal and blind spot sensors, can be expensive, as much as $946 on a 2015 Acura RLX, according to the insurance institute. Mr. McConnell at Continental noted potential savings in building cars that no longer need the structural support for side-mounted mirrors.Still, the mirrorless demonstrations from Daimler, BMW and Continental show that the systems will present a challenge to drivers. Unlike other safety systems that are installed and applied without the drivers\u2019 knowledge or input, like electronic stability control and airbags, digital mirrors require training and practice to use.Looking up into the rearview mirror, for example, to see what is beside you in the BMW i8 is not instinctive for a driver trained to perform shoulder checks.\u201cYes, it may require some driver training,\u201d Mr. Hoffmann acknowledged. Further refinements need to be worked out, too. The BMW\u2019s panoramic video mode has a slight fun-house mirror effect, for example. .On the other hand, having a single panoramic video view may be an improvement over the combination of old and new technology now deployed in cars that use a rearview camera and traditional side mirrors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Orphaned \u201990s", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byIN one theory of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, before political reality intruded, she was going to have the best of two worlds.For voters satisfied with Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, she would represent continuity, staying the course, the line of Democratic succession. But for voters dissatisfied with a slow recovery and stagnant wages, she would represent a throwback \u2014 a return to the Clintonian 1990s, the last era of broadly shared prosperity.But for now, in the early Democratic primaries, the \u201cchange\u201d vote is mostly left wing and trending socialist, and it wants nothing to do with what it remembers as the compromises and sellouts of the last Clinton era. (If it remembers those years at all, since the core Bernie Sanders demographic was in grade school when Bill Clinton left the White House.)It will do Hillary no good to have a conservative columnist defend her husband\u2019s record. But it\u2019s still strange to see her running away from historical Clintonism, and to hear her husband\u2019s eight years cast as a nightmare from which liberalism has struggled to awake.The blessings he lists include several major trends normally dear to liberal hearts. Liberals aren\u2019t satisfied with mere G.D.P. growth: They want racial equality, equal opportunities for women, a just wage for the laboring class. And the last decade of the 20th century delivered on all of these counts.It was the only recent era when the black-white income gap actually shrank. It sustained the steady post-1970s narrowing of the male-female wage gap (which hasn\u2019t narrowed since). And it featured a real surge in labor\u2019s share of national income \u2014 the only such surge in the last 35 years.But the Clintonian synthesis has been orphaned for ideological reasons, not because it was tested and found to fail. Liberals simply don\u2019t want to believe that low-income Americans, black and Hispanic as well as white, might benefit from public paternalism in welfare policy, soft \u201cvalues\u201d rhetoric on marriage and family, and restrictions on illegal immigration \u2014 even though the working class\u2019s best recent decade featured a Democratic president who embraced all three.Not that conservatives have been all that interested in learning from Clintonism either. Two decades after the G.O.P. insisted, wrongly, that any tax increase on the rich would devastate the economy, the Republican tax agenda is still founded on a supply-side absolutism the \u201990s boom should have laid to rest.This leaves our politics in a peculiar place. Within the memory of everyone save the youngest Bernie Bros and social socialists, there was an era that delivered something for the many, that put almost every trendline on a better arc.Yet the politics of that era are orphaned \u2014 so much so that not even a Clinton will defend Clintonism anymore.Advertisement"}

What office jobs are next?Supported byNadler couldn\u2019t have double-checked all this analysis if he wanted to. It was based on thousands of numbers drawn from dozens of databases. He just wanted to make sure that Kensho had pulled the right number \u2014 the overall growth in American payrolls \u2014 from the employment report. It was the least he could do, given that within minutes, at 8:35 a.m., Kensho\u2019s analysis would be made available to employees at Goldman Sachs.In addition to being a customer, Goldman is also Kensho\u2019s largest investor. Nadler, who is 32, spent the rest of the morning checking in with some of the bank\u2019s most regular Kensho users \u2014 a top executive on the options-and-derivatives-trading desks, a fund manager \u2014 then took an Uber down for a lunch meeting at Goldman\u2019s glass tower just off the West Side Highway in Manhattan. While almost everyone in the building dresses in neatly pressed work attire, Nadler rarely deviates from his standard outfit: Louis Vuitton leather sandals and a casual but well-cut T-shirt and pants, both by the designer Alexander Wang. Nadler owns 10 sets of these. His austere aesthetic is informed by the summer vacations he spent in Japan while pursuing a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard, mostly visiting temples and meditating. (\u2018\u2018Kensho\u2019\u2019 is the Japanese term for one of the first states of awareness in the Zen Buddhist progression.) He also wrote a volume of poetry \u2014 imagined ancient love poems \u2014 that Farrar Straus & Giroux will publish later this year.I met with Nadler later that day in his own office, across the street from the Goldman building, on the 45th floor of 1 World Trade Center. His dozen or so employees shared a large room decked out in typical start-up style, including an aquarium and large speakers playing electronic music. Nadler has an office off to the side with little more than a large desk, made out of reclaimed telephone poles, and a large upholstered leather chair with matching ottoman. After closing the door, Nadler, who has curly dark hair and pale skin, sat on the ottoman, folded his bare feet under him and told me about the day\u2019s feedback from Goldman. This included some tips on what they wanted in the next report, and a good dose of amazement at Kensho\u2019s speed. \u2018\u2018People always tell me, \u2018I used to spend two out of five days a week doing this sort of thing,\u2019 or \u2018I used to have a guy whose job it was to do nothing other than this one thing,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Nadler said.This might sound like bragging. But Nadler was primarily recounting those reactions as a way of explaining his concern about the impact that start-ups like his are likely to have on the financial industry. Within a decade, he said, between a third and a half of the current employees in finance will lose their jobs to Kensho and other automation software. It began with the lower-paid clerks, many of whom became unnecessary when stock tickers and trading tickets went electronic. It has moved on to research and analysis, as software like Kensho has become capable of parsing enormous data sets far more quickly and reliably than humans ever could. The next \u2018\u2018tranche,\u2019\u2019 as Nadler puts it, will come from the employees who deal with clients: Soon, sophisticated interfaces will mean that clients no longer feel they need or even want to work through a human being.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m assuming that the majority of those people over a five-to-10-year horizon are not going to be replaced by other people,\u2019\u2019 he said, getting into the flow of his thoughts, which, for Nadler, meant closing his eyes and gesticulating as though he were preaching or playing the piano. \u2018\u2018In 10 years Goldman Sachs will be significantly smaller by head count than it is today.\u2019\u2019Goldman executives are reluctant to discuss the plight of their displaced financial analysts. Several managers I spoke to insisted that Kensho has not yet caused any layoffs, nor is it likely to soon. Nadler had warned me that I would hear something like that. \u2018\u2018When you start talking about automating jobs,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018everybody all of a sudden gets really quiet.\u2019\u2019Goldman employees who lose their jobs to machines are not likely to evoke much pity. But it is exactly Goldman\u2019s privileged status that makes the threat to its workers so interesting. If jobs can be displaced at Goldman, they can probably be displaced even more quickly at other, less sophisticated companies, within the financial industry as well as without.According to the Oxford paper and subsequent research, employment prospects vary significantly by industry. In health care, for example, where human interaction is vital, automation threatens fewer jobs than it does in the labor market as a whole. Taxi and truck drivers, though, face a bleak future given recent advances in self-driving cars. Among better-compensated professions, the Oxford researchers took into account software that can analyze and sort legal documents, doing the work that even well-paid lawyers often spend hours on. Journalists face start-ups like Automated Insights, which is already writing up summaries of basketball games. Finance stood out in particular: Because of the degree to which the industry is built on processing information \u2014 the stuff of digitization \u2014 the research suggested that it has more jobs at high risk of automation than any skilled industry, about 54 percent.The Oxford study received plenty of criticism \u2014 understandably, given the patina of exactness that it tried to apply to a speculative exercise. Nevertheless, the financial industry is taking automation very seriously, both as an opportunity and as a threat. It is one thing to make a few analysts redundant, but automation could put whole business models in peril. Investments in what is known as fintech, or financial technology, tripled between 2013 and 2014 to $12.2 billion, and start-ups are now taking aim at nearly every line of financial business. Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check. So-called robo-advisers create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers. Nearly every Wall Street firm has put out research reports on the tens of billions of dollars of revenue that might be lost to these upstarts in the coming years. Banks are trying to fend off the newcomers by making their own investments in start-ups like Kensho, which has raised more than $25 million so far.The skilled industries that form the bedrock of New York City\u2019s economy have so far largely avoided this sort of transformation, because the work of financial analysts, publishers and designers hasn\u2019t been easy to automate. But to look at a company like Kensho, and the sort of conversation it generates across the financial industry, is to see the degree to which these trends are now confronting industries that used to be thought exempt from this sort of disruption. Last fall, Antony Jenkins, who was dismissed a few months earlier as chief executive of Barclays, the giant British bank, gave a speech in which he said a coming series of \u2018\u2018Uber moments\u2019\u2019 would hit the financial industry.\u2018\u2018I predict that the number of branches and people employed in the financial-services sector may decline by as much as 50 percent,\u2019\u2019 Jenkins told the audience. \u2018\u2018Even in a less-harsh scenario, I expect a decline of at least 20 percent.\u2019\u2019 This process could, in at least some cases, help do away with some of the expensive bloat in the financial system, providing more transparent services with fewer hidden fees. It could also be seen as a satisfying blow against the titans of an industry that only recently almost crashed the world economy. But so far the burden of job losses is stopping just short of the executive suites, even as the gains in efficiency are worsening already troubling levels of income inequality.Some of the venture capitalists backing Kensho have told Nadler that he would be wise to stop talking about the potential job losses at the same banks he is trying to secure as customers. Nadler has told them that he needs to carry on, partly to maintain his intellectual integrity. He often connects his discussion of jobs to his political fund-raising on behalf of candidates who call for a more robust social-safety net. But he also says that his awareness of what his business is both creating and taking away sets him apart as an entrepreneur: It\u2019s his \u2018\u2018edge\u2019\u2019 in a business that is all about competing to predict the future more accurately.Now a sales representative can simply click an icon and access the Kensho interface, which consists of a simple black search bar. Nadler walked me through the process on his own laptop. Type in the word \u2018\u2018Syria,\u2019\u2019 and several groups of events related to Syria\u2019s civil war appear, in much the same way that Google recommends queries based on past searches. Here, among the top event groups, are \u2018\u2018Advances Against ISIS,\u2019\u2019 which includes 25 past events, and \u2018\u2018Major ISIS Advances and Brutal Atrocities,\u2019\u2019 with 105 events.Kensho\u2019s software is constantly tweaking and broadening these suggested search terms, all with little human intervention. In some ways, this is the most sophisticated part of the program. In the past, a trader or analyst would have to search Wikipedia or a news database using whatever keywords came to mind. Kensho\u2019s search engine automatically categorizes events according to abstract features. It has figured out, for instance, that ISIS\u2019s seizure of Palmyra and France\u2019s first airstrike in Syria were both escalations in the civil war there but also that in one of those cases, ISIS was the aggressor while in the other case, it was on the defense. The software also looks for new and unexpected relationships between events and asset prices, allowing it to recommend searches that a user might not have considered. For this feature, Nadler said, he hired one of the machine-learning whizzes who worked on Google\u2019s megacatalog of the world\u2019s libraries.Back on the trading desk, after picking out one group of events \u2014 the 27 incidents of \u2018\u2018Escalations in the Syrian civil war,\u2019\u2019 say \u2014 a sales trader can pick from a series of drop-down menus that narrow the search to a specific time period and a specific set of investments. The broadest set includes the world\u2019s 40 or so major assets, including German stocks, the Australian dollar and a few varieties of crude oil. They can then click on the green Generate Study button, and a few minutes later they\u2019ll have a new page full of charts. Nadler clicked to demonstrate. The top chart showed that the prices of natural gas and crude oil have underperformed in the weeks after past escalations in the war, while Asian stocks and the United States and Canadian dollar pair has outperformed. Scrolling down, we could also see how each event in Syria played out and begin to structure an optimal set of trades based on that history.Nadler closed his laptop. The whole process had taken just a few minutes. Generating a similar query without automation, he said, \u2018\u2018would have taken days, probably 40 man-hours, from people who were making an average of $350,000 to $500,000 a year.\u2019\u2019Kensho\u2019s main office is still in Cambridge, Mass., two floors above an old barbershop, with windows looking out onto Harvard Yard. The 30 or so employees in the large main room look like the kind of bright-eyed kids who in years past might have gone to work for Goldman Sachs. Here, though, they work at standup desks, wear jeans and enjoy the benefits of a Zen room, with pillows and tatami mats for meditation, as well as a game room with chessboards and a poker table.I visited the Cambridge office in December, shortly before Christmas. When I arrived, most of the employees were doing their Secret Santa gift exchange; their laughter frequently trickled back to the conference room where I sat with Nadler and a few of his top deputies. Curious to know how much they all talked about the larger implications of their work, I asked the deputies how quickly the topic of automation and job loss had come up in their relationship with Nadler.\u2018\u2018Pretty much the second sentence,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Taylor, the chief technology officer, who, at 38, is one of the senior citizens of the company.\u2018\u2018This was Day 1,\u2019\u2019 said Martin Camacho, Kensho\u2019s 20-year-old chief architect, who entered Harvard as a freshman when he was 15.Camacho remembered going home one night to Nadler\u2019s apartment during their first summer working on Kensho. They watched the science-fiction film \u2018\u2018Oblivion,\u2019\u2019 about a world populated by alien-generated human clones, and stayed up talking about the socioeconomic implications of the story. More recently, Nadler invited his engineering team to a dinner at one of Cambridge\u2019s nicest restaurants, Henrietta\u2019s Table, for a group conversation about the more distant implications of automation. Nadler said he anticipated some form of strong artificial intelligence, whereby computers in the far future would be smart enough to anticipate our needs and usher in an era of abundance. For the next few decades, though, he predicted a more complicated time \u2014 an interregnum in which the computers are not as smart as people but smart enough to do many of the tasks that make us money.Camacho was less pessimistic than his boss. When computer-assisted math proofs were invented a few years back, he said, it didn\u2019t lead to any decline in the number of math-research jobs. \u2018\u2018I think there will be plenty for everyone to do,\u2019\u2019 Taylor said, agreeing.When I raised the topic of automation with executives at Goldman and beyond, I often heard a similarly optimistic belief that all the new software will free up employees in the financial industry to do other, more valuable things; that it would also create new types of jobs that don\u2019t exist right now. Several executives I spoke with argued that when A.T.M.s were widely deployed, you didn\u2019t suddenly see bank branches disappearing.This is a common criticism of the Oxford report on automation: Even if 47 percent of all current jobs end up being automated, that does not mean that 47 percent of the working population will not have jobs, as many newspaper articles on the report concluded. Cars once displaced lots of coachmen and stable boys but created many more new jobs laying out highways and attending service stations. Nowadays, software that provides financial advice has automated the work of some stockbrokers, but it is also expanding the number of people getting financial advice and the demand for cheap investment products.The lead author on the Oxford paper, Carl Benedikt Frey, told me that he was aware that new technologies created jobs even as they destroyed them. But, Frey was quick to add, just because the total number of jobs stays the same doesn\u2019t mean there are no disruptions along the way. The automation of textile work may not have driven up the national unemployment rate, but vast swathes of the American South suffered all the same. When it comes to those A.T.M.s, there has, in fact, been a recent steady decline in both the number of bank branches and the number of bank tellers, even as the number of low-paid workers in remote call centers has grown.Chavez said Kensho itself was unlikely to displace many employees. The software, he said, was doing something that was previously so time-consuming that it was seldom attempted. (Some users also told me that there were still significant limitations on the sort of events the software could search.) But whatever the impact of Kensho, Chavez\u2019s larger efforts to digitize more of Goldman\u2019s operations are already changing the number and the type of employees at the firm. Over the last few years, the number of campus recruits coming to Goldman from science-and-technology majors has gone up 5 percent each year, while the total head count has barely budged. (Goldman is one of the few companies on Wall Street at which the total number of employees hasn\u2019t dropped significantly.) \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure there are going to be new jobs 10 or 20 years from now that none of us could even imagine today,\u2019\u2019 Chavez said.Stock trading, one of the earliest areas to go electronic, provides an interesting precedent for how automation can play out in an institution like Goldman. On the company\u2019s trading desks, stocks are now bought and sold by computers instead of people. Chavez says that the advent of computerized trading over the last two decades has reduced the number of Goldman employees who buy and sell American stocks the old-fashioned way \u2014 over the phone \u2014 to four from around 600, but the change in the number of traders tells only part of the story. Some of the traditional traders were replaced by programmers who design and monitor the new trading algorithms. Beyond that, there are now new jobs in the data centers where the high-speed trading takes place.Goldman doesn\u2019t provide numbers on any of this. But Paul Chou, who worked on Goldman\u2019s electronic-trading desks from 2006 to 2010, told me that he would guess that the company probably needed one programmer for every 10 of the old-school traders who lost their jobs. In one sign of the shrinking work force, Goldman moved the last trader out of one of its four Manhattan trading floors last year.The progression of Goldman\u2019s stock-trading operations also illustrates that automation is not an on-off switch. When Chou first joined Goldman, after graduating from M.I.T., part of his job involved logging onto dozens of trading systems and checking on what the algorithms were spitting out to make sure they weren\u2019t making any mistakes before the trades were executed. Chou sat near a woman who had been doing phone-based trading for years. She helped Chou and his young colleagues learn what to look for in a good trade. Over time, though, the programs proved themselves more error-proof than the humans. The woman left Goldman. And then Chou himself created a new program that logged into all the trading systems and pulled everything into a single screen. When he first got it going, he remembers his boss, a programmer himself, turning to Chou and saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even know why I show up to work anymore.\u2019\u2019The software Chou designed made it possible for him to dedicate himself to higher-level work, researching new trading strategies for the computers. This was more satisfying than all the monitoring he had been doing, but eventually it became too repetitive as well. Chou left Goldman in 2010 for Silicon Valley and now runs LedgerX, an options exchange that he founded with his wife and two others. The team he left at Goldman was smaller than it was when he arrived.Over the course of my conversations with Nadler, he backed away from the notion that Kensho will destroy jobs at Goldman itself. But he said he had no doubt that Kensho and other financial start-ups would eliminate jobs as they expanded across the industry and that the pace of the losses would be much faster outside Goldman than inside. After the end of Goldman\u2019s period of exclusivity with Kensho last summer, Nadler signed contracts to roll out the software at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.The number of jobs that these banks will support in the future will be influenced by much more than just software. Banks are currently cutting back in response to slower-than-expected economic growth and new regulations since the financial crisis. But these factors are also encouraging all the banks to look for any place where they can find a cheaper and more transparent way to do jobs that are currently being done by expensive and unreliable humans.When I asked Chavez whether the job losses were likely to continue to outpace the gains, he reacted with what seemed like genuine uncertainty. \u2018\u2018That is one of the most interesting questions of our time,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2018\u2018Technology is becoming more labor-saving and less job-creating,\u2019\u2019 Frey said.One theory for why this might be happening is that many of the recent technological advances have been in software rather than hardware. While a company like IBM or Dell needed employees to build each new computer for every new customer, software like Facebook and Kensho can be replicated endlessly, at near-zero marginal cost. When Chou came up with the software that automatically logged onto dozens of trading systems, it could essentially have been rolled out across all of Goldman\u2019s trading desks around the world the next day. This is very different from the 1970s, when Detroit would need to retrofit its car-manufacturing plants one at a time, after the robots themselves were actually built. The difference is what convinced Chou, after his time at Goldman Sachs and in Silicon Valley, that this phase of automation would play out differently from past ones.\u2018\u2018We are not coming up with new jobs as fast as we are replacing them,\u2019\u2019 Chou told me.This observation appears to be borne out by Kensho. In less than three years, Nadler\u2019s company has expanded to serve three of the world\u2019s largest banks and has needed only around 50 employees to do so, just enough to fill two relatively small offices. Recently, Nadler\u2019s New York staff moved to a bigger office in 1 World Trade Center. It has more room for desks so that Kensho can expand. But most of the additional space is taken up by a kitchen, a pool table and a putting green.The growth has made Kensho worth hundreds of millions of dollars and turned Nadler into a millionaire many times over, at least when his stake in the company is taken into account. But it\u2019s not clear how beneficial his company will be to the American labor market as a whole. Back when I first met Nadler, for a lunch last summer, he wasn\u2019t too proud to admit this. \u2018\u2018The cynical answer that another tech entrepreneur would give you is that we\u2019re creating new jobs, we\u2019re creating technology jobs,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve created, on paper at least, more than a dozen millionaires.\u2018\u2018That might help people sleep better at night,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u2018\u2018but we are creating a very small number of high-paying jobs in return for destroying a very large number of fairly high-paying jobs, and the net-net to society, absent some sort of policy intervention or new industry that no one\u2019s thought of yet to employ all those people, is a net loss.\u2019\u2019Nathaniel Popper is a financial reporter for The Times and the author of \u2018\u2018Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tough Start to the Auction Year", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byA \u201ccorrection,\u201d economists generally agree, is a decline of at least 10 percent in the value of a stock, commodity, bond or market index. By this definition, the art auction market has already undergone a significant correction from the highs it reached in 2015.Last week, sales totals at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s evening auctions of contemporary art were, respectively, 50 percent and 44 percent less than last year\u2019s. This month, the take from the auction houses\u2019 evening sales of Impressionist and modern art fell 35 percent at Christie\u2019s and 50 percent at Sotheby\u2019s.\u201cThe market peaked in the first half of 2015 and the second half saw a softening,\u201d said Todd Levin, an art adviser in New York. \u201cI expect that to continue in 2016.\u201dThe main reason for the slump, experts said, is that buyers have been unnerved by financial turbulence in the wake of slowing growth in China.This was, of course, only the first big round of auctions this year. And there were a number of sales that indicated if the artist, the work, the provenance and the estimate ticked the right boxes, bullish prices could still be achieved.At Sotheby\u2019s Impressionist and modern art sale on Feb. 3, for example, the 11.6 million pounds, or about $16.7 million \u2014 almost double the low estimate \u2014 paid by Ben Frija, an Oslo dealer, for Rodin\u2019s 1890-91 bronze \u201cIris, Messag\u00e8re des Dieux\u201d showed what wealthy collectors were prepared to pay for the few large-scale casts made in the sculptor\u2019s lifetime that remain in private hands.And there was even a cheeky \u201cflip\u201d at that Sotheby\u2019s sale. Picasso\u2019s 1933 charcoal drawing \u201cLe Peintre et Son Mod\u00e8le\u201d had been bought by its seller in October for about $1.2 million from the New York dealer Richard L. Feigen at the Frieze Masters Fair in London. Five months later, it managed to find a telephone buyer for \u00a31.4 million with fees, about $2.1 million.There was also successful profit-taking at Christie\u2019s contemporary auction on Feb. 11 when two telephone bidders pushed Peter Doig\u2019s 1991 painting \u201cThe Architect\u2019s Home in the Ravine\u201d to the evening\u2019s highest price of \u00a311.3 million with fees, against a low estimate of \u00a310 million. Guaranteed to sell by a third party, the work had been acquired by its European owner for \u00a37.7 million three years earlier at Christie\u2019s.Such individual successes might have created a sense in the goldfish-bowl environment of the salesrooms that it would be business as usual. But then cracks appeared in the glass.Christie\u2019s failed to find a buyer for Yves Klein\u2019s 1960 \u201cAnthropometrie Sans Titre,\u201d estimated at \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. Sotheby\u2019s most highly valued work the previous evening had been a 1990 Gerhard Richter, \u201cAbstraktes Bild,\u201d valued at \u00a314 million to \u00a320 million, which two dealers with knowledge of the matter said was owned by the London collectors Eskander and Fatima Maleki. The work was withdrawn just before the sale for fear of being \u201cburned\u201d by failure at a public auction, according to dealers.Neither the Klein nor the Richter were protected by financing from the auction house or a third party, as they might well have been early last year.At last February\u2019s evening sale in London, for example, Christie\u2019s guaranteed the sale of a Cy Twombly painting valued at \u00a316 million. This February, the company guaranteed just two lots with a combined low estimate of \u00a3240,000.\u201cSome of the blockbuster lots are going to return to the private market,\u201d said Mr. Levin, the New York art adviser. \u201cThe lessening of guarantees will impact on the auctions. A softer market favors private sales.\u201dHe added that owners were fearful of damaging the value of their artworks by unsuccessful exposure at auction, and that often, for various reasons, they did not want to be seen to be selling their art.A far more significant test of the market will come in May, when Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips hold a \u201cgigaweek\u201d of marquee auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. Last May, Christie\u2019s evening sales of 20th- and 21st-century art raised a total of $1.4 billion, including $179.4 million for Picasso\u2019s 1955 \u201cLes Femmes d\u2019Alger (Version \u2018O\u2019).\u201d More than half of the 117 lots offered in those Christie\u2019s sales were supported by guarantees.\u201cGuarantees distorted and inflated the top end of the market,\u201d said the London dealer Alan Hobart, who has been a prominent buyer of trophy-quality 20th-century works at auction. \u201cBut there are still going to be sales in May, and there will still be deals to be done.\u201dOther sectors of the auction market showed similar dips this year.Sales of classic cars were down 14 percent, to $250.6 million, at the annual series of specialist auctions in Arizona in the last two weeks of January. On Feb. 5, the Paris auctioneer Artcurial sold a 1957 Ferrari 335 Sport Scaglietti to an American collector for a low estimate 32.1 million euros, about $36 million \u2014 a salesroom high for any car in Europe. But other auctions held during the French capital\u2019s \u201cRetromobile\u201d week this February struggled with oversupply. Bonhams sold just 58 percent of the 130 cars it offered on Feb. 4 at the Grand Palais.And even when sales seemed robust, they came with a caveat. Sotheby\u2019s New York old masters sale late last month raised $97.5 million, the auction house\u2019s highest total for a New York \u201cMasters Week\u201d in five years.But almost a third of the total came from the $30.5 million paid by the J. Paul Getty Museum on Jan. 28 for the Orazio Gentileschi painting \u201cDanae.\u201d A selling rate of just 50 percent for the remaining 60 lots in that evening sale was a reality check.Sotheby\u2019s, which in January spent around $85 million to acquire the advisory company Art Agency, Partners, has had the sobering experience of trying to claw back the $515 million it paid to auction the collection of a former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, who died in April. It recouped $437.8 million last year and on Jan. 27, a sale of Mr. Taubman\u2019s old masters added an additional $24.1 million.On paper, then, Sotheby\u2019s has lost at least $50 million on the Taubman collection. But by including the value of unsold lots, the auction house estimates the shortfall at just $6 million, plus a further $6 million in \u201csale related\u201d expenses, according to a Jan. 21 Securities and Exchange Commission filing.The auction house\u2019s stock price has fallen by more than 40 percent (it closed at at $22.88 on Thursday in New York) since Tad Smith\u2019s appointment as president and chief executive in March 2015. Profits have been hit by the Taubman guarantee and by downturns across a range of collecting sectors.Melanie Clore, Sotheby\u2019s chairman of Europe and worldwide co-chairman of Impressionist and modern art, said on Monday that she would be leaving the company after almost 35 years. Her departure comes after 80 employees took voluntary buyouts late last year, at a projected cost to Sotheby\u2019s of about $40 million. Ms. Clore said in an email that she informed Sotheby\u2019s in the fall that she wanted to leave.There is at the moment an enormous amount of uncertainty in the global economy, and this is affecting the art market.A report issued on Tuesday by Citi Private Bank\u2019s art advisory and finance division predicted that the slowdown in China would have an impact on the top end of the Impressionist, modern and contemporary markets. But, the report said, \u201cart remains a valuable asset.\u201dWe are likely to discover just how valuable over the next few months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Battles Bernie Sanders, Chick Magnet", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 HILLARY CLINTON first grabbed the national spotlight 47 years ago as an idealistic young feminist, chiding the paternalistic establishment in her Wellesley commencement speech.So it\u2019s passing strange to watch her here, getting rebuffed by young women who believe that she lacks idealism, that she overplays her feminist hand and that she is the paternalistic establishment.Bernie Sanders may be a dead ringer for Larry David, but Hillary is running the \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d campaign. She can\u2019t fire up young voters by dwelling on what can\u2019t be done in Washington and by explaining that she\u2019s more prose than poetry.She\u2019s traveling around New Hampshire with a former president who could easily layer in some poetry, and a handful of specific snappy plans for the future, to her thicket of substance and stack of white papers. But somehow, Hill and Bill campaign side by side without achieving synergy.Is it that he\u2019s as tired as he looks or does she feel too competitive with him to ask for that kind of help?As one Hillary booster in Hollywood marveled: \u201cThere\u2019s no chance her husband doesn\u2019t understand the problem. The look on his face during her speeches evokes a retired major league All Star watching his son strike out in a Little League game. This is so fixable.\u201dHillary is like a veteran actor who doesn\u2019t audition well. Bill could tell her not to shout her way through rallies, that it doesn\u2019t convey passion but just seems forced, adding to her authenticity problem. Her allies think mentioning her shouting is sexist, and sexism does swirl around Hillary, but her campaign cries sexism too often. In 2008, Barack Obama used race sparingly.Even after all this time watching Bill and Barry, she still has not learned the art of seduction on stage. She\u2019s surrounded by former Obama and Bill Clinton strategists, but they are not helping her achieve \u201cthe goose bump experience,\u201d as Lily Tomlin called it. Hillary has ceded the inspirational lane to the slick Marco Rubio, who\u2019s more like the new John Edwards than the new Obama.In the MSNBC debate on Thursday night, Hillary huffily said she could not be an exemplar of the establishment, as Sanders suggested, because she\u2019s \u201ca woman running to be the first woman president.\u201dBut she is establishment. So is Nancy Pelosi. So was Eleanor Roosevelt. Hillary must learn to embrace that and make it work for her, not deny it. As a woman, as a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, she\u2019s uniquely equipped to deliver a big, inspiring message with a showstopping speech that goes beyond income inequality, that sweeps up broader themes of intolerance, fusing the economic, cultural and international issues at stake.She could, as one talented political speechwriter riffed, say something like this: \u201cWe\u2019re a stronger country when more people have higher incomes; when women get paid the same as men; when we draw on the diverse talents of immigrants; when we show the world that America is a place that embraces all religions, that offers refuge to the persecuted and the terrorized. When a few old rich white men are the only ones who succeed, that\u2019s not just unfair, it\u2019s untenable.\u201dHillary\u2019s most poignant moment came during the CNN town hall on Wednesday night when she said that, as a young woman, she had never expected to run for president herself, given that her husband was \u201ca natural.\u201d It was her misfortune in 2008 to run into another natural. She was not \u201clikable enough\u201d that year.But it was at least fathomable. She was running against the Tulip Craze Barack Obama. Now she\u2019s running against a grumpy gramps, a stooped socialist with a narrow message, brusque manner and shaky grasp of world affairs. But the Clintons are still leveling the same charges, that her opponent\u2019s stances are fairy tales and that his idealism masks tough tactics.Lyndon Johnson said that the two things that make politicians more stupid than anything else are sex and envy. With Hillary, there are three things: sex, money and the need for secrecy.The Nixonian obsession with secrecy by the woman who was once an idealistic lawyer on the Watergate committee staff \u2014 on Whitewater, health care and her State Department emails \u2014 caused her to unnecessarily damage herself and leave Democrats perennially spooked.While she was giving three speeches to Goldman Sachs for $675,000, her party was changing. As the economy slowly healed, Democrats were seething with anger over the big banks that never got punished for wrecking the economy and the reckless billionaires who are still living large. A tone-deaf Hillary was there sucking at the teat and that rubs people the wrong way.When Anderson Cooper asked why Hillary had taken the obscene Goldman Sachs windfall, she gave a stupefyingly bad answer to a predictable question. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, throwing up her hands and shrugging. \u201cThat\u2019s what they offered.\u201d She was reluctant to release the texts of her \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m one of you\u201d speeches.As with the Chappaqua email server, Hillary is not sorry she did it. She\u2019s only sorry people are making a fuss about it.Typical of the Clintons, she tried to drag in others to excuse her own ethically lax behavior, noting that \u201cevery secretary of state that I know has done that.\u201d After the Monica scandal broke, Clinton aides cited Thomas Jefferson, F.D.R. and J.F.K. to justify Bill\u2019s Oval Office cavorting.But the other secretaries of state were not running for office, Cooper pointed out.\u201cTo be honest I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t committed to running,\u201d Hillary said.It\u2019s that sort of disingenuous answer that has spurred so many Democrats to turn to the straight-shooting, Wall Street-bashing Sanders.When Hillary accused Sanders during the debate of doing an \u201cartful smear\u201d on her, charging him with insinuating that she engaged in pay-for-play with Wall Street, drug companies and other special interests, some Republicans predicted that the moment would go down as a Gary Hart-style challenge that would come back to haunt her.They said that surely Matt Rhoades, the Hillary oppo-research expert at America Rising, must already be plotting ads slamming the disturbing cat\u2019s cradle of foreign money that came into the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was at State, and the unseemly tentacles of Teneo, the global firm run by Bill Clinton\u2019s former body man, Doug Band, where Huma Abedin, Hillary\u2019s closest aide, worked while she was at State.Sanders\u2019s populist surge \u2014 he raised $20 million last month, $5 million more than Hillary \u2014 has led some top Democrats to wonder if President Obama will have to step in and endorse her.Wouldn\u2019t that be rich?

National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it.Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances.These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe\u2019s more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies.\u201cWe will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday.The new deal \u201cis a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201dIt provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy.\u201dBoth sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April.But the deal\u2019s first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union.Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people\u2019s digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans\u2019 data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday.The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe.\u201cThe problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement.In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans\u2019 data.The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data.Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency\u2019s surveillance of foreign citizens.During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies\u2019 use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states\u2019 national security practices, had demanded written guarantees.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a one-off decision by the commission,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. \u201cWe have achieved effective protection of Europeans\u2019 rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Plan for Puerto Rico Favors Pensions Over Bondholders", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 If it\u2019s up to the Treasury Department, public employees in Puerto Rico who were promised pensions could be better off than investors who bought the island\u2019s bonds.A broad plan being put forward by the Treasury Department to ease Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis would put pension payments to retirees ahead of payments to bondholders \u2014 a move that some experts fear could rattle the larger municipal bond market.The proposal was being driven by evidence that Puerto Rico\u2019s pension system is nearly out of money, leaving retirees who are dependent on it financially vulnerable.\u201cThe major problem is, the entire pension system is close to being depleted,\u201d said Antonio Weiss, counselor to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary. \u201cBut 330,000 people depend on it. It\u2019s unfunded, and they have to be protected.\u201dShielding retirees from pension cuts, the thinking goes, would not only protect thousands of older residents on the island, but it might also encourage younger retirees to stay there, rather than move to the United States mainland in search of new jobs and incomes.Out-migration is considered a prime cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial tailspin, because it shrinks the island\u2019s economy, leaving fewer people and fewer dollars to support the crushing debt.Puerto Rico is said to have about $72 billion of financial debt outstanding, most of it in the form of municipal bonds. By some estimates, it has incurred an additional $43 billion in unfunded pension obligations.But deciding that pensioners\u2019 interests should be put above those of bondholders \u2014 if a choice must be made \u2014 is not without certain risks.Some public-finance experts say they fear that if Puerto Rico can renege on promises to pay debts to investors, while sparing retirees, other municipalities might try to do the same, casting a pall over the larger market in municipal bonds, where American towns and cities have gone for decades to get the money they need to build roads, schools and other public works.If Puerto Rico gets special treatment, \u201cyou have huge contagion risk to the entire municipal market,\u201d Andrew N. Rosenberg, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, said at a recent gathering of creditor representatives.Treasury officials said such concerns were unfounded. The framework they are proposing would be designed only for distressed United States territories, like Puerto Rico, and could not be used by states or municipalities on the mainland.Officials pointed to a report by an investment firm, Nuveen Asset Management, which said, \u201cWe believe most institutional investors understand Puerto Rico\u2019s unique situation and the coming debt restructuring will not create widespread credit implications.\u201dStill, moving public pensions to the top of the stack would infuriate at least some bondholders \u2014 especially those who paid close to face value for their bonds years ago, when they were still rated investment grade, and who had expected to hold them to maturity and get all their principal back.Although the bondholders have often been portrayed as deep-pocketed vultures since Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis began, many of them are small investors, themselves trying to save for a comfortable retirement.\u201cMost Puerto Rican debt is held by individuals,\u201d said Thomas Moers Mayer, a lawyer representing two large mutual fund companies, Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds, which together own about $10 billion in Puerto Rican debt securities. \u201cThey are mostly over 65, and they mostly have incomes of less than $100,000 a year. They are not vulture funds. They are your friends and neighbors.\u201dSome Republican senators \u2014 notably Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah \u2014 whose constituents are among the bondholders, have expressed similar views. Puerto Rico\u2019s debt is unusually widely held because it offered above average yields and interest that was exempt from federal, state and local taxes, no matter where the buyer lived.Treasury officials have said they are willing to work with Congress to find a suitable way of handling the different categories of creditors.Financial help for Puerto Rico will be the subject of a hearing on Thursday by the House Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. Weiss is scheduled to be the sole witness.Any rescue plan would need congressional approval and various committees in the House and Senate are weighing ways to help the island reduce its debt and better manage its economy.Paul D. Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, has set a deadline of March 30 for a House version of a bill. A version of Treasury\u2019s plan was outlined in a draft bill presented to a Senate committee; it has not been voted on.The draft, obtained by The New York Times, also calls for a five-member \u201cfiscal reform assistance council\u201d appointed by the president to hold the island to meaningful budgeting, disclosure and fiscal reform practices. The board would have the power to make across-the-board budget cuts if necessary.Members of Congress, especially Republicans, have expressed concern about whether Puerto Rico has the wherewithal to manage its future finances, even if it gets help in the short term. Credit markets have also been reluctant to invest further in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds without some assurances that the island\u2019s finances will be better managed in the years to come.The idea of an oversight board has rankled residents, however, who say it has overtones of colonialism.The part of the proposal that gives priority to pensioners has received little attention. Currently, Puerto Rico\u2019s laws and Constitution give top priority to general-obligation bonds \u2014 the type backed by the government\u2019s \u201cgood faith, credit and taxing power.\u201dPuerto Rico is not unique in this respect; for decades, the general-obligation bonds of all the states have been marketed as virtually default-proof, safe enough for widows and orphans. The concept was developed after the Civil War, as a way to rebuild investor trust after a number of notorious bond defaults.Public workers\u2019 pensions, the center found, fall on a second hierarchy altogether, which sets priorities for the government\u2019s operational disbursements. Here again, however, payments due on general-obligation bonds come first, followed by payments due on legally binding contracts. Outlays for pensions come third.That means that under existing law in Puerto Rico, if there is not enough money to pay both general-obligation bonds and public retirees\u2019 pensions, the money would go to bondholders.But the Treasury\u2019s proposed restructuring framework would change that. It would require that the restructuring plan \u201cnot unduly impair the claims of any class of pensioners.\u201dGeneral-obligation bondholders, on the other hand, would get such protection only \u201cif feasible,\u201d according to the draft that outlined the plan.This new legal framework is being created because Puerto Rico, as a United States territory, has no access to bankruptcy laws, where complicated claims by creditors can be worked out in a court under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge.Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its bonds. More payments are due in May and June. Bonds are now nearly impossible to sell, and members of Congress, especially Democrats, as well as financial experts say the island\u2019s troubles will become increasingly enormous if some kind of restructuring framework is not approved soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "South Carolina Church Bridges Racial Gap, but Not Political Divide", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byGREENVILLE, S.C. \u2014 The members of Redemption church, a bracing blend of black and white with a smattering of Latinos, flowed into their arena-size sanctuary on one of the last Sundays before the South Carolina primaries. They prayed side by side in the glow of the animations streaming across a million-dollar video wall. They sang together, arms raised, to carefully calibrated worship music that fused strummy, sentimental rock with melismatic soul. They mingled afterward in the church\u2019s Higher Grounds Caf\u00e9 & Coffee Bar, standing in line for chicken-wing lunches.What they all scrupulously avoided, however, was any discussion of politics, even as they knew that the political center of gravity had shifted to South Carolina. Avoiding such talk is an unwritten rule, scrupulously followed: \u201cA taboo,\u201d said Tamara Mangle, 30, an African-American who works at the gym and favors Bernie Sanders.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re at war with each other,\u201d said Becky Greene, 68, a white receptionist at the church offices who supports Senator Ted Cruz. \u201cIt\u2019s like the conservatives and the liberals, and never the twain shall meet.\u201dThe motto of this Pentecostal megachurch is \u201cWhere Many Become One,\u201d and its members are proud of their racial progress. \u201cThis,\u201d Ms. Greene said, \u201cis how it\u2019s going to be in heaven.\u201dBut heaven will have to wait. As the presidential road show heads to the South, Redemption is a reflection of one of the region\u2019s most persistent divides. Despite the unmistakable, sometimes startling gains that Southern blacks and whites have made in working, living and even praying together, when it comes to voting and politics, the gulf between them is so vast it can barely even be discussed.Pastor Ron Carpenter Jr., the charismatic, verbally dexterous country preacher who founded Redemption a quarter-century ago, said the political divide largely followed racial lines. Mr. Carpenter, who is white, said that for the most part, \u201cwhites are Republicans, and blacks are Democrats.\u201d In Greenville, the church\u2019s flagship campus, he estimated that 60 percent of churchgoers were black. The rest are mostly white, with a few Hispanics.As the praise music leaked in from the sanctuary, Beth Rainey, 46, was behind the bar at the church \u201clounge,\u201d serving Pepsi and candy bars. Ms. Rainey, who is white, grew up in tiny Blackville, S.C. \u201cTrue to its name,\u201d she said, chuckling, it was a majority-black town. Multiculturalism is what she has always known, she said.Her politics are conservative. She said she was trying to decide between Senator Marco Rubio and Ben Carson. Mr. Carson, the sole black candidate in the Republican field, had been her first choice, though she was worried that he has been falling behind.\u201cHe professed to be a Christian and a family man,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need that.\u201dBeyond earshot of other church members, she opined on what had brought President Obama to power. \u201cA lot of people probably voted for him as a black man, not knowing who he was or what he stood for,\u201d she said.A moment later, Evelyn Barton, 53, a church janitor who is African-American, wandered in. The two women, longtime friends, greeted each other warmly. Ms. Barton is a reliable Democratic voter, one who will probably vote for Hillary Clinton this year. In a phone interview later in the week, she also recalled quite specific reasons she had voted for Mr. Obama in 2008: \u201cI felt like he could turn the economy around,\u201d she said, \u201cand bring our boys home from the war.\u201dMr. Carpenter, 47, whose father was also a Pentecostal preacher, grew up in a rural South Carolina community called Possum Kingdom, where he played high school sports and made many black friends. Today, the church has 21,000 active attendees spread across seven campuses in the Carolinas and the Dominican Republic.It has survived heartbreak and scandal: A few years ago, businessmen came to the church and bilked numerous parishioners in a mortgage-fraud scheme. In 2013, Mr. Carpenter revealed to his flock that his wife, Hope, a pastor and co-founder of the church, had committed adultery and was seeking psychiatric help.Mr. Carpenter does not always shy from controversial topics: This summer, he preached that \u201cmuch of homosexual activity is an iniquity.\u201d But he is keenly aware that too much politics can be a threat. He recalled the moment in 2007 when Mr. Obama, at that time a senator running for president, asked to speak at the church.\u201cI put him in a room and said, \u2018Senator, I\u2019ve been here 20 years building this, and you can kill me today if you come out here and do a liberal Democratic campaign speech,\u2019\u201d Mr. Carpenter said. \u201c\u2018I tell you, I\u2019ll be cleaning it up for five years.\u2019\u201dIn the cafe, Budd Allison, 57, a white worker at a plant that makes plastic cups and bowls, said the church\u2019s multicultural atmosphere was part of the appeal from the first day he visited. \u201cI knew it was different,\u201d he said, \u201cand I knew it was right.\u201dMr. Allison said he was a longtime conservative whose political ideas were based largely on his experience in the world of commerce. \u201cAs long as the rich man\u2019s making money, the poor man\u2019s going to have a job,\u201d he said.This year, Mr. Allison said, he is intrigued by Donald J. Trump \u201cjust because he\u2019s not a politician.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019m so sick of politicians.\u201dA few seats away, William Brown, a black church member who is an electrician, said he, too, admired Mr. Trump for his business skills. \u201cIf he was not a Republican,\u201d Mr. Brown said, \u201che\u2019d be the No. 1 choice for me.\u201dBut Mr. Brown, 55, said he would be supporting Mrs. Clinton, largely because of the good economic times he remembers during her husband\u2019s tenure in the White House. \u201cI just find, economically, I always did better when there was a Democratic president,\u201d he said.Mr. Carpenter boasts that his church\u2019s work force is just as diverse as its congregation. The next morning, in the privacy of their offices, the employees spoke about their political divisions, and the unwritten rule to stay mum.Kathryn Tucker, 47, an executive assistant to the church\u2019s chief financial officer, said being a Republican \u201ckind of came naturally\u201d as she was raised in a white Republican household. She said she liked Jeb Bush, but also found Mr. Trump to be refreshing. His idea of temporarily barring Muslims from the country, she said, \u201cseems like a good idea,\u201d especially after the terror attacks on American soil. But she could never imagine bringing up such matters at Redemption.\u201cI\u2019ve never been one to come up to someone I work with and ask hard questions of them,\u201d she said.Regina Webb, 49, an assistant director of one of the church ministries, was one of a handful of black conservatives in the leadership ranks who felt that Republican candidates could be better trusted to govern on Christian principles.She said the church would not feel truly integrated without a more open discussion of politics and policy. \u201cI think that we should be able to come to a place where as a body of Christ we can say, \u2018O.K., I like this candidate or this policy,\u2019 without going away enemies,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Are We?", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byI find this election bizarre for many reasons but none more than this: If I were given a blank sheet of paper and told to write down America\u2019s three greatest sources of strength, they would be \u201ca culture of entrepreneurship,\u201d \u201can ethic of pluralism\u201d and the \u201cquality of our governing institutions.\u201d And yet I look at the campaign so far and I hear leading candidates trashing all of them.Donald Trump is running against pluralism. Bernie Sanders shows zero interest in entrepreneurship and says the Wall Street banks that provide capital to risk-takers are involved in \u201cfraud,\u201d and Ted Cruz speaks of our government in the same way as the anti-tax zealot Grover Norquist, who says we should shrink government \u201cto the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d (Am I a bad person if I hope that when Norquist slips in that bathtub and has to call 911, no one answers?)I don\u2019t remember an election when the pillars of America\u2019s strength were so under attack \u2014 and winning applause, often from young people!Trump\u2019s famous hat says \u201cMake America great again.\u201d You can\u2019t do that if your message to Hispanics and Muslims is: Get out or stay away. We have an immigration problem. It\u2019s an outrage that we can\u2019t control our border, but both parties have been complicit \u2014 Democrats because they saw new voters coming across and Republicans because they saw cheap labor coming across. But we can fix the border without turning every Hispanic into a rapist or Muslim into a terrorist.Trump seized on immigration as an emotional wedge to rally his base against \u201cthe other\u201d and to blame \u201cthe other\u201d for lost jobs, even though more jobs, particularly low-skilled jobs, are lost to microchips, not Mexicans.Just to remind again: We have twice elected a black man whose grandfather was a Muslim and who defeated a woman to run against a Mormon! Who does that? That is such a source of strength, such a magnet for the best talent in the world. Yet Trump, starting with his \u201cbirther\u201d crusade, has sought to undermine that uniqueness rather than celebrate it.Sanders seems to me like someone with a good soul, and he is right that Wall Street excesses helped tank the economy in 2008. But thanks to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, that can\u2019t easily happen again.I\u2019d take Sanders more seriously if he would stop bleating about breaking up the big banks and instead breathed life into what really matters for jobs: nurturing more entrepreneurs and starter-uppers. I never hear Sanders talk about where employees come from. They come from employers \u2014 risk-takers, people ready to take a second mortgage to start a business. If you want more employees, you need more employers, not just government stimulus.In short, we\u2019re not socialists.Unlike Sanders, Ted Cruz does not have a good soul. He brims with hate, and his trashing of Washington, D.C., is despicable. I can\u2019t defend every government regulation. But I know this: As the world gets faster and more interdependent, the quality of your governing institutions will matter more than ever, and ours are still pretty good. I wonder how much the average Russian would pay to have our F.B.I. or Justice Department for a day, or how much a Chinese city dweller would pay for a day of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or Environmental Protection Agency? Cruz wraps himself in an American flag and spits on all the institutions that it represents.America didn\u2019t become the richest country in the world by practicing socialism, or the strongest country by denigrating its governing institutions, or the most talent-filled country by stoking fear of immigrants. It got here via the motto \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d \u2014 Out of Many, One.Our forefathers so cherished that motto they didn\u2019t put it on a hat. They put it on coins and then on the dollar bill. For a guy with so many of those, Trump should have noticed by now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Black Church in South Carolina, Bernie Sanders Struggles to Get an \u2018Amen\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byWEST COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 The problem began as soon as Bernie Sanders walked into the dining room of the revered and predominantly black Brookland Baptist Church here. Instead of flocking to him, as supporters do at his large college rallies, many of the church\u2019s 780 members present looked up for a moment, then quietly went back to eating their Sunday feast \u2014 unmoved as Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, tried to work the room.Mr. Sanders delivered remarks at a microphone next to a buffet table offering chicken, collard greens and dinner rolls.\u201cWe have, in America today, a broken criminal justice system,\u201d Mr. Sanders said at the microphone, pausing briefly after this line from his stump speech, which is usually met with applause. Here it garnered very little, and the line for the food kept moving. Brookland Baptist Church proved a tough crowd.His visit here underscored Mr. Sanders\u2019s challenge in strengthening his support among black voters in South Carolina, where the majority of Democrats casting a ballot in the state\u2019s primary on Saturday will be black and where his rival for the presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton, seems to be holding on to a sizable lead.As Mr. Sanders moves on from a loss in the Nevada caucuses, now more than ever he must expand his base beyond the young and working-class whites who pack his events. Mr. Sanders and his campaign aides stress that they have not given up on winning South Carolina, but they also say they are realistic about their chances and plan to focus on states beyond, like Virginia, Michigan, Ohio and Colorado.That decision has raised questions about Mr. Sanders\u2019s commitment to courting black voters and whether he is moving resources to states where his message of a rigged economy will do better with young and working-class whites. Still, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, powered by four million individual donations, has the resources to remain in the race for some time.Despite those numbers, Mr. Sanders said he would fight to win delegates in South Carolina.\u201cNo state is a lost cause. We have made enormous ground up in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Sanders said last week when asked whether he was giving up on the state. \u201cPrimaries and caucuses are not winner take all.\u201dTad Devine, a senior campaign adviser, said he understood that Mrs. Clinton had an advantage in the state. But, Mr. Devine added, the Sanders campaign has invested heavily in advertising targeting black voters in the state, with $711,000 spent on television and cable advertising and $381,000 on black radio stations.\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to say we have given up on the black vote in South Carolina because we are campaigning in states, like Virginia, which have an event three days after South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Devine said. \u201cThis race is turning from a state campaign to a multistate campaign.\u201dMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, added that the events on Sunday, which included a rally in Greenville of about 5,200 mostly white supporters in addition to his appearance at Brookland Baptist Church, illustrated that the senator was committed to competing in the state.\u201cHe said all along that it is a matter of going from state to state to state, picking up delegates, it\u2019s going to be a long haul,\u201d Mr. Briggs said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got resources to go for a while.\u201dAdditionally, Ben Tulchin, a pollster for the Sanders campaign, said Mr. Sanders was focused on making sure he got to states with large black populations in the Midwest and in battleground states that would be crucial to winning the general election.\u201cSouth Carolina is a deep red state, but Bernie is doing better in battleground states with large African-American populations like Michigan, like Illinois, like Ohio, which have real bearing on this race and the primary but also have real bearing in the general election,\u201d Mr. Tulchin said. \u201cThe reality is South Carolina is not a battleground state in the general election, right? So even if we can\u2019t close it there, it has no bearing whatsoever in the general election, right?\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.While the state may not go to Democrats in the general election, it may help Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Sanders.At the church here on Sunday, several tables of black women who said they were supporting Mrs. Clinton quietly continued eating as the senator and a surrogate, Benjamin T. Jealous, a former N.A.A.C.P. president, went around shaking hands.Bernadette L. Rogers, a 67-year-old retired social worker, said that Mr. Sanders seemed sincerely interested in issues facing blacks but that she thought Mrs. Clinton\u2019s experience made her the better candidate.\u201cI just feel like this go-round, it is her time,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cShe has a good connection with the black community, and I do believe we will continue to support her.\u201dMr. Jealous, who introduced Mr. Sanders to the church, also failed to get the applause the team is accustomed to from crowds of mostly white voters.\u201cThere are people who will say to you there is a dreamer who is running for president,\u201d Mr. Jealous said, \u201cand his dreams are so big, y\u2019all shouldn\u2019t dream that big. But in our community, when they tell us not to dream, we say, \u2018Yes, we can.\u2019 And so I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to dream big?\u201d\u201cAmen,\u201d said one woman, Karen Brooker, 46, who later said she was undecided.Mr. Jealous tried again.\u201cNo, no, no. Are you ready to dream big?\u201d Mr. Jealous said.\u201cYes. Fired up,\u201d a few more in the crowd offered. Most continued to eat silently.Advertisement"}

If the regulators then decide that the new agreement with the United States does not protect Europeans\u2019 privacy rights, the national officials would have the power to investigate \u2014 and potentially fine \u2014 companies.

The agreement was reached after three months of tense negotiations between American and European Union officials.Such data is the lifeblood of modern international business and digital commerce. Billions of dollars in trans-Atlantic trade hang in the balance, for online companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as for more traditional multinationals like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial company General Electric.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin\u2019s group of privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the current data transfer system would remain in place at least until the end of February. But the deadline raises questions of what would happen if the region\u2019s privacy regulators could not be reassured that the new Privacy Shield pact provided sufficient protection of personal data.\u201cI am 100 percent sure we received concrete assurances from the Americans,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner who was in charge of Europe\u2019s negotiating team, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, she conceded, \u201cthe current situation isn\u2019t ideal.\u201dThe main provisions of the Privacy Shield included written guarantees by the United States that its national security agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans\u2019 data when it is transferred to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The deal also calls for the creation of a data privacy ombudsman within the State Department as the first point of contact for Europeans seeking redress for privacy complaints. These provisions would be reviewed annually to ensure that they met European privacy standardsSome of them, including Ms. Falque-Pierrotin in France and her counterparts in Germany and Spain, have sent letters to companies warning them that the current trans-Atlantic data transfer system is on shaky legal ground. But others \u2014 particularly officials in Britain and Ireland, where many international companies have headquarters \u2014 have said they favored the current data transfer approach.This divide, legal experts warn, could lead to some agencies pursuing investigations into companies\u2019 activities, on the behalf of citizens who believe their data may have been misused. Others, in contrast, are likely to permit companies to continue moving digital information almost unfettered between two of the world\u2019s largest economies.\u201cBusinesses will want to be cautious about signing up to Privacy Shield given the potential legal challenges,\u201d said Marc Dautlich, a data protection lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London.Wednesday\u2019s developments are the latest chapter of a bitter dispute.On one side are companies and government agencies in Europe and the United States that favor unfettered data transfers.On the other side are consumer advocacy groups in Europe, backed by some national data protection agencies, who are skeptical that Europeans\u2019 privacy rights will be upheld when their personal data is transmitted to the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a big concern about this agreement,\u201d said Estelle Mass\u00e9, a policy analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group in Brussels. \u201cWill it hold up in court?\u201dComplicating the issue are security concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about the rise of international terrorism. American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not want Europe\u2019s tough data privacy protections to prevent them, when necessary, from gaining access to the online communications of terrorism suspects, among others.This standoff is the result of a ruling last year by European judges that local citizens\u2019 digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. The judges also demanded that Europe\u2019s data protection authorities take a more active role in policing how information leaves their national borders.Even as they agreed on the broad outlines of the new accord, American and European policy makers knew they still had to fill in the details. Now, the national data regulators have given them a deadline.Victoria A. Espinel, president of the Software Alliance, a trade group in Washington, underlined the implications the deal could have.\u201cHalf a trillion dollars of trade is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still expect that cool heads will prevail.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poorest Areas Have Missed Out on Boons of Recovery, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byThe gap between the richest and poorest American communities has widened since the Great Recession ended, and distressed areas are faring worse just as the recovery is gaining traction across much of the country.From 2010 to 2013, for example, employment in the most prosperous neighborhoods in the United States jumped by more than a fifth, according to the group\u2019s analysis of Census Bureau data. But in bottom-ranked neighborhoods, the number of jobs fell sharply: One in 10 businesses closed down.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you are looking at two different countries,\u201d said Steve Glickman, executive director of the Economic Innovation Group, which created a new tool called the Distressed Communities Index.The organization, based in Washington and founded last year with backing from several well-known technology entrepreneurs, includes economists on its advisory board from both the left and the right. Beyond its research functions, the group also supports greater private investment in struggling communities.While the problems in many poorer cities predate the recession, what has felt like a real recovery for Americans in healthier cities and towns has left the worst-off locations \u2014 many of them concentrated in the nation\u2019s old industrial heartland \u2014 even further behind.\u201cThe most prosperous areas have enjoyed rocket-shiplike growth,\u201d said John Lettieri, senior director for policy and strategy at the Economic Innovation Group. \u201cThere you are very unlikely to run into someone without a high school diploma, a person living below the poverty line or a vacant house. That is just not part of your experience.\u201dBy contrast, in places the recovery has passed by, things look very different.In the nation\u2019s most distressed communities, the average house dates to 1959, 30 years older than the typical structure in the wealthiest ZIP codes. Population growth is flat or falling, not rising as it is in wealthier areas. More than half of adults don\u2019t have a job, and nearly a quarter lack a high school diploma.As the most prosperous communities in the United States have gotten richer since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, economic conditions in many distressed areas have deteriorated even further.In the most prosperous ZIP codes, many of which are in the Sun Belt, only 6 percent of adults dropped out of high school and 65 percent are employed.\u201cThey are enjoying a boom that camouflages what\u2019s going on at the bottom,\u201d Mr. Lettieri said.Communities between these two extremes have managed only to tread water in recent years, the study found. Employment in communities in the median ZIP codes increased only slightly and the number of businesses did not grow at all.Many experts have attributed this disconnect to stagnant wage growth for most workers, and a lower level of employment among prime-age Americans in recent years, especially for those who don\u2019t have a college degree.The new study suggests other factors are at work as well. In distressed areas, economic conditions continue to resemble those seen during a recession.\u201cZIP codes mere miles apart occupy vastly different planes of community well-being \u2014 and few people are truly mobile between them,\u201d the study concludes. \u201cIt is little surprise that many Americans feel they have been truly left behind.\u201dAt the same time, the authors say, once a downward spiral begins, it is very difficult for residents or local political leaders to reverse the slide. \u201cWhen businesses close and there is no investment, the tax base erodes,\u201d Mr. Lettieri said. \u201cLocal governments can\u2019t invest their way out.\u201dTo come up with the rankings in the Distressed Communities Index, analysts focused on seven factors: the prevalence of adults with a high school degree, home vacancy rates, adults in the work force, the percentage of people living below the poverty line, median income as a percentage of the state average, change in employment and change in the number of businesses.Many of the worst-off small and midsize cities on the index are synonymous with poverty, deindustrialization and other maladies affecting older urban areas. Camden, N.J.; Cleveland; Gary, Ind.; Youngstown, Ohio; and Hartford top the list.Over all, the South is home to more than half of the 50.4 million Americans living in distressed ZIP codes. It is also the only region in which more people live in distressed locations than in prosperous ones.The most prosperous cities also tend to be among the newest and fastest-growing in the country, with a heavy concentration in the West. Five of the index\u2019s most prosperous cities were in Texas, for example.In some cities, especially those in the South and Southwest, booming newer areas coexist uneasily with poorer zones, creating what the Economic Innovation Group terms \u201cspatial inequality.\u201dEven as suburbs of Dallas, Austin and Houston were thriving, Texas over all had more people living in distressed ZIP codes than any other state.In San Antonio, ranked as the most spatially unequal city in the country, life in the northerly ZIP code 78258 has almost nothing in common with that of the ZIP code 78207, just west of downtown and the familiar Alamo Plaza.In the poorer location, nearly half of adults did not have a high school diploma and 42 percent lived below the poverty line. Total employment and the number of businesses have both declined there.Drive 30 minutes north on Route 281 to the wealthier ZIP code, however, and the poverty rate in 2014 was 4 percent. Only 2 percent of adults there lacked a high school diploma. Employment and the number of businesses jumped more than 20 percent since 2010.Over all, the poorer San Antonio area scores a 97.8 on the Distressed Cities Index while the wealthier neighborhood\u2019s reading is just 0.5.In San Antonio, many of the surrounding suburbs are enjoying \u201cexplosive growth,\u201d the report noted, but \u201cit appears to be doing little to raise the fortunes of those living closer to the city center.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In the days leading up to the address, Mr. Zuma, who has typically handled his critics by mocking them, made a point of listening to South Africans: meeting with business leaders in Cape Town and talking to drivers and customers at a taxi stand in Pretoria.During Mr. Zuma\u2019s address on Thursday, opposition lawmakers demanded that he explain his firing in December of a well-respected finance minister who had clashed with one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s closest allies, and replacing him with a little-known lawmaker. It was a decision that further eroded investors\u2019 confidence in the country\u2019s economy and the health of its institutions.On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court, the nation\u2019s highest, heard arguments from two opposition party lawyers that Mr. Zuma had acted illegally by defying an order to pay back part of expensive upgrades to his private home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The court has yet to rule on the case, which for many has come to symbolize widespread corruption inside the A.N.C., the party that has held power since the end of apartheid in 1994.But opposition parties are now seeking a court ruling that the president violated the Constitution, in a bid to start impeachment proceedings against him. Any impeachment attempt would likely fail, given Mr. Zuma\u2019s control of Parliament, but it could hurt his party in important municipal elections later this year.\u201cThe president should himself expedite the process of his removal from office by doing the honorable thing and resigning,\u201d Mr. Maimane said.Members of the second-largest opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, repeatedly interrupted Mr. Zuma\u2019s speech, delaying its start by nearly an hour.\u201cZuma is no longer a president that deserves the respect from anyone,\u201d the party\u2019s leader, Julius Malema, yelled as he and his members were eventually expelled from the parliamentary chamber. \u201cHe has stolen from us, he has corrupted the economy of South Africa, he has made this country a joke and after that, he has laughed at us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oxford\u2019s Halley Professor on How the Climate Challenge Could Derail a Brilliant Human Destiny", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "The common\u00c2\u00a0context\u00c2\u00a0is the importance\u00c2\u00a0of sustained engagement on a big challenge \u2014 whether it is intellectual, as in revealing\u00c2\u00a0spacetime ripples, or potentially existential, as in pursuing ways to move beyond energy choices that are reshaping Earth for hundreds of generations to come.The core conclusion:Humans have been burning fossil fuels for only about 150 years, yet that has started a cascade of profound changes that at their current pace will still be felt 10,000 years from now.Climate change makes stringent demands on thinking about our future. We need two-sided reasoning to contend equitably with the risks of climate change and the risks of \u201csolutions.\u201d We need to differentiate the future 500 years from now and 50 years from now. This essay explores three pressing climate change issues, using both the 500-year and the 50-year time frames: sea level rise, the nuclear power \u201csolution,\u201d and fossil carbon abundance.The day of the release of the spectacular LIGO gravitational wave discovery is a good time to be pondering human destiny, the great things we can achieve as a species if only we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do ourselves in, and the responsibility to provide a home for future generations to flourish in. It is beyond awesome that we little lumps of protoplasm squinting out at the Universe from our shaky platform in the outskirts of an insignificant galaxy can, after four decades of indefatigable effort, detect and characterize a black hole merger over a billion light years away.This is just one of the most dramatic examples of what we are capable of, given the chance to be our best selves. In science, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rate the revolution in detecting and characterizing exoplanets way up there as well. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no limit to what we can accomplish as a species.But we have to make it through the next two hundred years first, and this will be a crucial time for humanity. This is where Destiny Studies and our paper on the Anthropocene come together. The question of why we should care about the way we set the climate of the Anthropocene is far better answered in terms of our vision for the destiny of our species than it is in terms of the broken calculus of economics and discounting.For all we know, we may be the only sentience in the Galaxy, maybe even in the Universe. We may be the only ones able to bear witness to the beauty of our Universe, and it may be our destiny to explore the miracle of sentience down through billions of years of the future, whatever we may have turned into by that time. Even if we are not alone, it is virtually certain that every sentient species will bring its own unique and irreplaceable perspectives to creativity and the understanding of the Universe around us.Thinking big about our destiny, think of this: the ultimate habitability catastrophe for Earth is when the Sun leaves the main sequence and turns into a Red Giant. That happens in about 4 billion years. However, long before that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in only about 500 million years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Sun gets bright enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse effect and turn us into Venus, sterilizing all life on Earth. We waste half the main sequence lifetime of the Sun.However, if we last long enough, technology will make it easy to block enough sunlight to save the Earth from a runaway, buying us another 4 billion years of habitability. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only kind of albedo-modification geoengineering I could countenance, and by the time that is needed, presumably we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the wisdom to deploy it safely and the technology to make it robust.But we have to make it through the next 200 years first.If we do what humanity has always done in the past, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to burn all the fossil fuels, and then have a hard landing at a time of high population, with an unbearable climate posing existential risks, at just the time when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing the crisis fossil fuels running out. That will hardly make for ideal conditions under which to decarbonize, and there is a severe risk civilization will collapse, leaving our descendants with few resources to deal with the unbearable environment we will have bequeathed them.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been pointed out that fossil fuels came in just about when we had run out of whale oil, but the whales had been hunted to the brink of extinction when that happened. If we do the same with coal, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to make for a pretty transition. With regard to the Anthropocene, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that given a thousand years or so \u00e2\u0080\u0094 if technological civilization survives \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it becomes likely that we would develop ways to remover CO2 from the atmosphere and accelerate the recovery to more livable conditions. But if things get bad enough in the next two hundred years, we may never have that chance.The alternative future is one where we decide to make the transition to a carbon-free economy before we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re forced into it by the depletion of fossil fuels. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to run out anyway, and will need to learn to do without fossil fuels, so why not get weaned early, before we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve trashed the climate? If we do that, we might not just buy ourselves a world, but a whole Universe.Shorthand summary: Can we do better than bacteria smeared on agar?We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re essentially in a race between our potency, our awareness of the expressed and potential ramifications of our actions and our growing awareness of the deeply embedded perceptual and behavioral traits that shape how we do, or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, address certain kinds of risks [or time scales].Is there a moral argument for some threshold of environmental conditions that we must preserve for future generations?Here are other relevant past pieces:FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fashion Week Today: For Hood by Air, Pilgrimage on a Collision Course", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byOne of the Hood by Air models, Hirakish, a musician and performer.We\u2019ll be bringing you highlights from the shows, from the extravaganzas to the scrappy upstarts. Here is day 4.They came tripping out in thigh-high waders, some perched on shiny patent heels, men and women alike, some steadier on their feet than others. At Hood by Air, balance and stability are not givens. Momentum, often irresistible, is.The collection was called Pilgrim, which explains the 18th-century curl of their wigs, if not the shirtwaist wimples several of the models wore over their heads. This being a modern pilgrimage, each seat had a Hood by Air plane ticket, and models carried bags wrapped in airport-style protective plastic. One model was plastic wrapped, too \u2014 fur coat and all.It was a rich collection for the label, long on leather, patent and fur, and put on \u2014 as might once have seemed unimaginable \u2014 at one of fashion week\u2019s most professional \u201cofficial\u201d venues. But rebellion remains the order of the day. After clomping to the front of the runway and back, models veered into the stands, bounding up and down stairs, nearly colliding with one another in the process. It was hard to look away.One model, a musician and performer who goes by the name Hirakish, never left. Up and down he stalked, sprinting and sashaying, as others went barreling by. One fellow model he wrapped in a clinch; at another tantalizing point, he looked poised to swoop down onto a stern brace of Vogue editors seated front row. He was, as they say, living. A better avatar of Hood by Air\u2019s unapologetic maximalism you couldn\u2019t hope to find. A star is born.MATTHEW SCHNEIERWhile much of New York spent the weekend discussing the death of a conservative Supreme Court justice and what it meant for the upcoming presidential election, the fashion world engrossed itself with a slightly less worldly matter: the V.I.P. sneak peak of Barneys New York on West 17th Street.For much of the \u2019 80s and \u201990s, this was their clubhouse, the place to buy sky-high platform boots from Dirk Bikkembergs and S&M inspired ready-to-wear from Helmut Lang.Things have changed since then. Financial types have replaced artists as the city\u2019s ruling class. Drag queens are no longer the only people wearing six-inch pumps.And so Barneys gave itself a Champagne-toast shopping party on Sunday afternoon, as the ribbon was cut for fashion editors seeking a break from the shows and a chance for a little shopping. (The store opens to the public on Monday morning.)In the lobby, just through the entrance, were handbags by Givenchy, Christian Louboutin and Proenza Schouler. Around a corner was the jewelry department selling bling from Jennifer Meyer and Sidney Garber, whose showstopper piece is a serpent-shaped necklace in rosegold, with white diamond eyes, that retails for $10,900.Ed Filipowski, head of the public relations firm KCD, as well as the spouse of Barneys president Mark Lee, fondly recalled his first big purchase at the Chelsea location back in the \u201990s, when he was in his 20s. It cleaned out his bank account. \u201cI was eating a slice of pizza and I spent like $5,000 during lunch on a Gaultier motorcycle jacket,\u201d he said.Nearby was a giant white spiral staircase made of fiberglass that goes from the basement all the way to the fourth floor. Downstairs is a Mila Moursi treatment room along with a barber shop in back, where beard trims cost $25 and haircuts are $50.Upstairs on the second floor are women\u2019s shoes (Ala\u00efa, Fendi, Chanel, Manolo Blahnik) and women\u2019s ready-to-wear, including a $3,095 backless Givenchy vest made from fox hair, near a Valentino champagne-colored tulle dress with floral beading (retail price: $12,500).\u201cGorgeous, just gorgeous\u201d said the store\u2019s creative ambassador, Simon Doonan, as he headed through the store with Jonathan Adler and their two-year-old mutt, Foxylady.On three, Nick Wooster was buying a Saint Laurent leopard-print trenchcoat. At $2,750, it was a relative bargain, at least compared with the Gaultier motorcycle jacket Mr. Filipowski bought all those years ago. Plus, Mr. Wooster said as a salesman took his American Express platinum card, \u201cit\u2019s understated, like me.\u201dIf he was kidding, he still couldn\u2019t resist it. \u201cThis is a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Barneys. It\u2019s the seminal New York retailer, and it\u2019s back home whence it came. I realize it\u2019s not the same world it was 20 or 30 years ago, but come on.\u201d\u201cWould you like the coat in a shopping bag,\u201d the salesman asked.\u201cYes, please,\u201d Mr. Wooster said.JACOB BERNSTEIN\u201cI was so excited to get to fall and to be at Brooks Brothers,\u201d Zac Posen said of his second full presentation as creative director for the venerable New York store. He was surrounded by models on risers in a 21st-floor showroom overlooking downtown Manhattan that was jammed with attendees. \u201cYou know: tweeds, suitings, autumnal colors, lodens, greens, blacks, camels.\u201dThe collection also included Mr. Posen\u2019s first foray into evening wear for the label, including two men\u2019s wear-influenced tuxedos and a shimmering brocade coat. But he wanted to make sure he didn\u2019t stray too far from the brand\u2019s heritage.\u201cWhat\u2019s incredible about Brooks is that it is not about trend,\u201d Mr. Posen said, taking a moment to wave goodbye to Nina Garcia, the creative director of Marie Claire, as she headed back into the crowd. \u201cIn today\u2019s economy, when people are looking to invest, they want to invest in something that is trendless, that lasts and that is classic and high quality, and that is what is, for me, very exciting about working at Brooks Brothers.\u201dSTUART EMMRICHThe runways have seen all sorts of accessories. Still, the vape pen is rare. You may have missed them as they came down the Baja East runway Saturday night; they didn\u2019t catch the eye like the label\u2019s new collaborative sneakers and shower slides with Fila did. But then one model breathed out an expressive mouthful of smoke.It only makes sense, both for the burgeoning e-smoking movement and Baja East, which has always channeled a freer-spirited, less-inhibited muse. (The show\u2019s notes described an atmosphere borrowed from \u201cthree days at Berghain,\u201d the anything-goes, all-night Berlin club, and \u201ca detox in the desert.\u201d)\u201dNot every client could handle that,\u201d said Cindy Krupp, who handles communications for the label and who brokered the deal between Baja East and sponsor Blu, which supplied the vapes. \u201cThey can.\u201dMATTHEW SCHNEIERSunday was Valentine\u2019s Day for the real world, but in fashion land no one had the night off. Not one show made reference to the most important date night of the year, although no one in the front row seemed at all bothered. Even Diane von Furstenberg, who offered guests prosecco and heart-shaped watermelon vodka jellies at her supermodels-prepping-for-the-disco presentation, appeared to be endorsing independent women going out on the town rather than a night in with your one true love.\u201cWe don\u2019t celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d said the model Coco Rocha. Her husband, James Conran, nodded in agreement from one row behind her.Victoria Beckham said that she had to get straight to work on her campaigns, although her children had given their mother \u201csome beautiful flowers,\u201d and she bought them balloons.The model Emily Ratajkowski said, albeit with a wink, that her main focus would be trying to stay warm. No rest for the wicked, it would appear.ELIZABETH PATONCheck out all of our New York Fashion Week coverage here.Check out our complete New York Fashion Week coverage here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Planet on the Ballot", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byWhy do I say this?Yet that partisan divide would not, in itself, be enough to make this a truly crucial year. After all, electing a pro-environment president wouldn\u2019t make much difference if he or (much more likely) she weren\u2019t in a position to steer us away from the precipice. And the truth is that given Republican retrogression and the G.O.P.\u2019s near-lock on the House of Representatives, even a blowout Democratic victory this year probably wouldn\u2019t create a political environment in which anything like Mr. McCain\u2019s 2008 proposal could pass Congress.But here\u2019s the thing: the next president won\u2019t need to pass comprehensive legislation, or indeed any legislation, to take a big step toward saving the planet. Dramatic progress in energy technology has put us in a position where executive action \u2014 action that relies on existing law \u2014 can achieve great things. All we need is an executive willing to take that action, and a Supreme Court that won\u2019t stand in its way.And this year\u2019s election will determine whether those conditions hold.The result is that we\u2019re only a few years from a world in which carbon-neutral sources of energy could replace much of our consumption of fossil fuels at quite modest cost. True, Republicans still robotically repeat that any attempt to limit emissions would \u201cdestroy the economy.\u201d But at this point such assertions are absurd. As both a technical matter and an economic one, drastic reductions in emissions would, in fact, be quite easy to achieve. All it would take to push us across the line would be moderately pro-environment policies.And as I said, no new legislation would be needed, just a president willing to act and a Supreme Court that won\u2019t stand in that president\u2019s way, sacrificing the planet in the name of conservative ideology. What\u2019s more, the Paris agreement from last year means that if the U.S. moves forward on climate action, much of the world will follow our lead.I don\u2019t know about you, but this situation makes me very nervous. As long as the prospect of effective action on climate seemed remote, sheer despair kept me, and I\u2019m sure many others, comfortably numb \u2014 you knew nothing was going to happen, so you just soldiered on. Now, however, salvation is clearly within our grasp, but it remains all too possible that we\u2019ll manage to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. And this is by far the most important issue there is; it, er, trumps even such things as health care, financial reform, and inequality.So I\u2019m going to be hanging on by my fingernails all through this election. No doubt there will be plenty of entertainment along the way, given the freak show taking place on one side of the aisle. But I won\u2019t forget that the stakes this time around are deadly serious.

So we lowered prices to get more people using Uber, which is good for drivers because it means less time waiting around for trips.\u201dUber said that when it cut prices previously, the amount of time drivers spent waiting for fares fell, meaning drivers did more business and ultimately earned more money.But outside the Uber headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a taxi drivers\u2019 union, said the unilateral move to cut prices did not take into account the opinions of the drivers on whom the company relied.\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask them for input,\u201d Ms. Desai said. \u201cIt gives the message that those fares are binding, and nonnegotiable. They gag you, and then they starve you.\u201dThe mood of the rally was far different from the one at City Hall in July, when Uber drivers gathered to oppose an effort by the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio to limit the number of Uber vehicles operating in New York.Mohsin Alvi, 28, said he has driven for Uber for three years. He said the fare cuts had come at a particularly inconvenient time: Last month, the city was hit by a huge snowstorm, which meant fewer rides for drivers. \u201cNobody in America wants to work more and earn less,\u201d Mr. Alvi said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201dMr. Alvi said he would turn off his phone for the rest of the day, refusing to drive for Uber.Other drivers, he added, had pledged to turn their phones off for three days. \u201cThat\u2019s how we hurt Uber,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Managed by Q\u2019s \u2018Good Jobs\u2019 Gamble", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueForgoing the gig-economy model, a start-up bets on a strategy that puts cleaning-service workers on a professional path.Supported byOr \u2014 to take an example in which many more livelihoods are at stake \u2014 consider office cleaning. In the future, there might be new solvents, new cleaners, better scheduling software. But at the end of the day (usually literally), someone will still have to run a vacuum over a rug, run a rag over a table, empty smaller trash cans into bigger ones. Because of this, it\u2019s almost simple logic that the only ways for an office-cleaning company to make more money will always stay the same: charge clients more or pay workers less. In a big city, filled with competitive office-cleaning companies and a seemingly endless supply of desperate workers, this means that office cleaners as a rule will never make much more than the minimum wage.Which is why, just over a year ago, Guillermo Garcia was perplexed by a job opening he heard about. He had been unemployed for six months \u2014 unable to find even minimum-wage work \u2014 when his counselor at Madison Strategies Group, a job-training-and-placement firm for low-income people in New York City, told him about the office-cleaning jobs that a brand-new company had listed. The company was called Managed by Q, and it was paying $12.50 an hour, or more than 40 percent above the city\u2019s minimum wage. Even more unbelievable, the job offered full health care benefits and a 401(k) plan.A few weeks after hearing about the improbable job at Managed by Q, Garcia had it. And today, just over a year later, Garcia\u2019s pay is up to $14.50 an hour, and a remarkable $21.75 when he works overtime, which he does as often as he can. His supervisor is talking to him about a promotion that would come with a higher salary. There are even rumors of stock options. His life has been transformed, almost as if he won the lottery.The chief executive of Managed by Q, Dan Teran, wants to be clear: His company is not a charity. Its plan is to become enormous and highly profitable. A little more than two years old, the company now cleans more than 2.1 million square feet of office space in New York City. (The fanciest two tiers of buildings, referred to as \u2018\u2018trophy\u2019\u2019 and Class A in corporate-real-estate speak, typically hire their own in-house cleaning services, but Managed by Q currently cleans more than 1 percent of the rest, the so-called Class B and Class C offices.) In addition to cleaning, the company offers a whole suite of other services to its clients \u2014 maintenance, I.T. support, security, supplies and others. It has expanded its operations to San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles, with the eventual goal of conquering every major city in the United States and, eventually, the world.The company pays its staff, like Garcia, considerably more than prevailing market rates not solely because its founders want to be kind to them, but because Teran sees it as crucial to his business model. Teran believes that most American businesses, and especially fast-growing start-ups like Uber, have mistaken short-term gains for long-term value, undercutting the share of revenue that flows to workers in a way that will perversely hurt their bottom line. He believes, even more radically, that decades of rising inequality and stagnant wages in America are not an inevitable byproduct of capitalism; instead, they come from a simple misunderstanding about how best to deploy workers and recognize the value they bring to a company. The future of jobs in the United States would be very different if Teran\u2019s ideas catch on. But first, of course, he has to prove that they actually work.The business would first present itself to new clients as a cleaning company. That\u2019s because potential customers already know what a cleaning company is, and they\u2019re often looking for a new and better one. But once the clients were sold on the high quality of the cleaning service, they would come to realize that Q (as employees call it) could do so much more. Every new client was given a wall-mounted iPad with an intuitive app. Someone could request through the iPad, say, more paper towels or an exterminator or furniture assembly or a wall\u2019s being put up or taken down. Q would take care of all the details, quietly and quickly.At first, Teran was worried that his new idea would force him to make a horrible choice. He wanted to create a company that could pay a solid living wage to its workers and offer them good benefits. But he couldn\u2019t figure out how to make the numbers add up. After seeking advice from anyone he could find, he found himself talking to Dervala Hanley, who was then the vice president for global strategy at Starbucks. She told him that the answers to all of his questions were in a book: \u2018\u2018The Good Jobs Strategy,\u2019\u2019 by Zeynep Ton, a professor of operations management at M.I.T. The book offers a careful study of a handful of large companies that have been able to pay their workers well above prevailing wages while also keeping overall costs down and earning a healthy profit. Typically, companies see workers entirely as a cost, something that reduces profit; as a result, many try to minimize the number of workers and the amount they are paid. But as Ton points out, when a company deploys its workers in smart ways, those workers can become a source of profit instead of just a cost. Q is a perfect example: Teran doesn\u2019t see his cleaners as simply cleaners. Instead, they are the essential link between Q and its clients.Teran told me that the best way to see this was by looking at a spreadsheet he had asked his chief financial officer to create. It was a simplified version of Q\u2019s own profit-and-loss statement alongside that of a fictitious competitor, based on standard industry data. The spreadsheet assumes that Q and its competitor, Non-Q, each begin with 100 clients, meaning 100 offices to clean every day. Non-Q pays $9 an hour for its \u00adworkers; by hiring them as independent contractors rather than as salaried employees, Non-Q is also able to avoid paying Social Security taxes, overtime and other costs. Q, by contrast, pays $12.50 an hour plus benefits and Social Security taxes. This means that Non-Q realizes a total profit, per office, of $9,660, while Q makes a profit of only $7,980. It seems, at first blush, that Q has a terrible business model. The more customers it has, the further Q will fall behind the competition.But over time, the picture changes. The cleaning industry is famous for steep turnover in employees and customers; as with many commoditized, low-cost businesses, the end of every contract is an opportunity to see if someone else can do the job more cheaply. Industrywide, roughly half of a cleaning company\u2019s customers will choose a different firm every year, and it frequently costs about $1,750 in marketing and sales to acquire a new customer. Also, roughly half of a cleaning company\u2019s employees will leave in any given year, and it costs around $150 in advertising and human resources to refill each slot. Teran believes that by paying workers more \u2014 and training them to stay in close contact with customers to make sure they are satisfied \u2014 he can drastically reduce both turnover numbers.Nancy Gonzalez, cleaning operations supervisor.\u00a0Previous job: Bakery co-owner.So far, it has worked: Only around 10 percent of clients leave each year, and only 5 percent of employees leave. This means Non-Q has to pay a lot of money every year just to keep the same number of customers and employees. Q can funnel that spending into expansion, acquiring more clients. Teran points out that on the spreadsheet, Non-Q does better in its first year of operation: It makes a net profit of $871,000, compared with Q\u2019s $709,450. It is only after a few years that the advantage of Q adds up. By the fifth year of operation, Q is bringing in 62 percent more profit than Non-Q.The real secret to Q\u2019s business, though, comes with the other services that it offers and facilitates through its app \u2014 maintenance, I.T. support, security and so on, some of which enjoy a significantly higher profit margin than its cleaning services do. With these allied services, Q functions as a matchmaker between its clients and a marketplace of service providers, working with a few carefully screened firms and connecting its clients with them quickly; Q then receives a percentage of their fee. Already, 30 percent of the company\u2019s revenue comes from services other than cleaning.The whole model works only if the clients trust Q. And the main contact with Q is that cleaner, or operator, who goes to the office every day. One reason Q pays its cleaners so much is that they effectively become a sales rep, smuggled every day inside the office of the customer. The better the cleaner is \u2014 the better trained and motivated and paid \u2014 the more effective a representative she can be, and the more money she can generate.When I asked what he meant, Teran suggested I spend a shift with Nancy Gonzalez, one of the most successful workers at Q. She is now a supervisor, which means she visits several different offices each night to check on the operators and offer help. She also works with the administrative staff, matching operators to clients. For example, one of her accounts is quite meticulous, she said, so she always makes sure the operator assigned to it is quiet and diligent; another account, by contrast, prefers a more engaging operator with a bigger personality.Teran remembers when Gonzalez came in to interview; he was still able to meet all new recruits at the time. He gathered a group of recruits in a circle and asked them to describe a deeply negative experience. Gonzalez talked about facing the collapse of the bakery that she and her boyfriend owned in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The goal was to see what kinds of words she used to describe the fallout of the negative experience \u2014 to see if she was able to think positively even when recalling the most painful time in her life. Gonzalez\u2019s answer scored quite highly for optimism.After that, she was invited to a group exercise to explore her ability to work well with others. Several potential employees were asked to describe embarrassing incidents from their past. As Teran explained, the real goal of the exercise was to see how others behave when a person is presenting themselves in a vulnerable way. Gonzalez consistently showed enormous empathy, leaning forward, nodding along, unconsciously saying quiet, encouraging words. So she got the job, despite that fact that she had no \u00adcleaning experience, other than cleaning up her bakery and a home with seven kids.Her first assignment, when she joined in September 2014, was at the offices of a growing health-and-wellness company. The firm had a regular cleaning company that did a thorough job each night and used Q only for supplemental tidying during the day. Teran says the revenue from the firm was around $400 a month. The Q app allows customers to rate an operator\u2019s performance on any given day and, right away, Gonzalez was receiving the highest grades every day \u2014 five stars, five stars, five stars. The client would put notes in the review about how Gonzalez was a joy to be around, how she repeatedly went beyond the call of duty. Twice, she spent her cleaning shift filling in for a sick receptionist. Soon, the client replaced its nighttime firm with Q. Then it asked Q to clean its other offices, as well as provide other services, like maintenance and supply management. Today, the client pays around $7,000 a month to Q over all. So, in this one case, Gonzalez was central to bringing in an additional $79,200 in revenue per year.This is how lousy jobs and stagnant wages arrive. Each company makes a series of relatively small decisions, based on what competitors are doing and what customers and investors are demanding. Soon, a new, lower norm is established, and the pressures are on everybody else to follow. In standard economic models, it\u2019s simply assumed: Wages fall to the point where supply meets demand. This is why Teran plans that by the time Q is publicly traded \u2014 if it ever is \u2014 he will have so fully built out the model that even the most hardheaded successor will continue to implement it. And it\u2019s why he is also working hard to persuade other chief executives to take his ideas seriously.This month, I sat in on a phone call Teran had with Colin Barceloux, the chief executive of ConvoyNow, a service that sends I.T. workers to private homes to fix computer emergencies. Barceloux had assumed that he would use the Uber model, allowing independent I.T. professionals to receive a message any time somebody wanted help. Barceloux explained to Teran that his company is so new that he has no idea how much demand there will be in any given city at any given time, so he can\u2019t hire people and pay them a fixed wage.But Teran countered that Barceloux was thinking about the issue in the wrong way. If his customers had a different I.T. person each time they used the app, and the providers didn\u2019t end up giving the same level of service, the customers would fall away. To follow the Q strategy, Teran acknowledged, Barceloux might need to rethink his business: Focus on fewer cities, or even start with just one, and build up the model locally. Perhaps there were other related services that ConvoyNow could provide, to take advantage of its trained workers.I followed up with Barceloux a few weeks later. He was still convinced by Teran\u2019s argument, and he hoped to shift his business to a model closer to Q\u2019s, in which the people serving customers are employees, not independent contractors. But he wouldn\u2019t be able to offer those employees full-time work, or maybe even predictable schedules. As he pointed out, the peculiarities of the cleaning business \u2014 that it\u2019s a service that clients contract for every day, on a regular basis \u2014 are crucial to why Managed by Q can offer truly good jobs. Will the strategy really work for other industries, including his own? Barceloux was not entirely sure, but he planned to spend this year trying to figure out if it can.An article on Page 40 this weekend about a start-up, Managed by Q, that tries to put cleaning-service workers on a professional path refers incompletely to the legal status of Guillermo Garcia, one of its employees. While he and his parents do not have formal legal status in the United States, he is permitted to work legally and is protected from deportation because of executive action taken by President Obama in 2012.Adam Davidson is co-host of the podcast \u2018\u2018Surprisingly Awesome\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Praises Colombia\u2019s Peace Efforts With Rebels and Seeks Big Aid Increase", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama welcomed President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia to the White House on Thursday for a buoyant celebration of the $10 billion, 15-year American effort to help Colombia vanquish its violent drug cartels and end its festering guerrilla war.It was also a chance for two leaders who reached out to longtime enemies to savor their success \u2014 Mr. Obama for his opening to Cuba, and Mr. Santos for his peace talks with his country\u2019s guerrilla movement, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.Speaking in the East Room, Mr. Obama said that \u201ca country that was on the brink of collapse is now a country on the brink of peace.\u201d He announced that he would request $450 million in new aid for Plan Colombia, the program under which the United States has supplied Colombia with military equipment, training and economic assistance. That is an increase over the $300 million the White House had previously budgeted.Plan Colombia, Mr. Obama said, will be renamed Peace Colombia to reflect its new purpose of helping the country keep the peace, rather than wage war. \u201cIn Colombia today,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is hope.\u201dMr. Santos described how Colombia had rebounded from the chaos of the 1990s, when large parts of the country were under the control of the guerrillas or paramilitary groups. Today, he said, it has a thriving economy and an effective policy for cracking down on the drug trade.He recalled that Mr. Obama was one of the first leaders in whom he confided his plans to negotiate with the guerrillas. \u201cYou not only believed it was possible,\u201d Mr. Santos said, \u201cyou encouraged me to go ahead and gave me your full, enthusiastic support.\u201d Speaking for all people who live \u201csouth of the Rio Grande,\u201d Mr. Santos thanked Mr. Obama for his \u201caudacity in re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba.\u201dMr. Santos was vocal in prodding the United States to end its half-century estrangement from Cuba, citing his own efforts to make peace as an example. A fluent English speaker with a graduate degree from Harvard, Mr. Santos made a persuasive case that the United States needed to make a move.\u201cSantos is such a trusted guy that when he talks to Barack Obama about Cuba, it\u2019s easy for Obama and Ben Rhodes and other aides to listen to him,\u201d said Julia Sweig, a senior research fellow at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin.Cynthia Arnson, the director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said Mr. Santos had been \u201ca close ally at the same time that he has struck out on his own, in ways that have sometimes been inconvenient for the U.S.\u201dPlan Colombia has not been without detractors. Particularly in its early years, some critics said it was weighted too heavily toward military aid over civilian aid. The Colombian government was also criticized for disregarding human rights as it stepped up the war against the guerrillas.Human rights organizations raised concerns about a tribunal that will be set up to try people accused of war crimes or human rights violations. Under the terms of an agreement between the government and the guerrillas, nobody who is found guilty will serve jail time.\u201cA sustainable peace agreement requires a strong and credible justice component,\u201d said Sarah Margon, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cSo while it may be a clich\u00e9 to say there\u2019s no peace without justice, it is still true.\u201dThere are also lingering questions about the role played by the United States in backing Colombian officials who colluded with right-wing militias to fight the guerrillas. As Colombia exhumes its wartime history, investigators are likely to seek the declassification of documents in the United States that could shed light on some of these relationships. Administration officials suggested that the United States would decline such requests.\u201cWe have had no requests, nor have we had any discussion to release documents,\u201d said Bernard Aronson, who has been the special envoy to the Colombian peace process since last February. \u201cI suspect most of those are privileged and would not happen.\u201dThe meeting with Mr. Santos begins what is expected to be a busy year of Latin American diplomacy for Mr. Obama. The White House hopes that as early as March, he will make a landmark visit to Cuba. That trip could include a stop in Colombia. In November, he is scheduled to travel to Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Look Down the Line", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byBig CityBut building additional ferry stops, like extending subway lines, is not something the city can do on its own. The streetcar program can evolve, as Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen put it, without getting \u201ccaught up in a big jurisdictional mosh pit.\u201d Opponents immediately argued that the $2.5 billion the system would cost could be better spent elsewhere; to extend the Second Avenue subway line, or add service in Queens. But the project is steeped in a kind of Catch-22 economy, with the capital expense offset by the money the city would gain in property taxes, which would increase in response to the desirability of the streetcar itself. Other funding could come from grants handed out by the federal government, which has tried to incentivize streetcar development in other cities around the country.The streetcar project also allows Mr. de Blasio an opportunity to deflect the criticism that he is unable to understand or implement visionary urban planning (or any urban planning at all). If completed, the Brooklyn Queens Connector would give him a visible legacy. Part of the challenge his administration has faced is that certain of its actions \u2014 the funneling of more resources into public housing, for instance \u2014 have simply never made it onto the radar of the many liberal affluent white voters who don\u2019t like him. They cannot count what essentially they cannot see; a light-rail system on an increasingly populated, and increasingly glamorous, waterfront is hard to ignore.The de Blasio administration has been careful, of course, not to sell the project as a party train for 32-year-olds in tortoiseshell glasses. Of the 400,000 people who currently live on or near the waterfront corridor between Astoria and Sunset Park, the end points of the streetcar\u2019s route, about one-tenth reside in public housing. In the city\u2019s imagining, the streetcar will also serve as a combat vehicle in the war against inequality, able to deliver, say, a woman living in the Queensbridge Houses to her job in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Over the next several years, approximately 7,000 new jobs are expected to be created there, and how workers might get there easily is a question the city has been grappling with.But are the kinds of jobs becoming available going to go to public housing residents? Much of what is already at the Navy Yard and much of what will come fall within the realms of media, production and what is called \u201cadvanced manufacturing,\u201d the making of rarefied home furnishings, artisanal foods and so on. Steiner Studios, already in the Navy Yard, is going to open the first back lot in the city (meaning that if everyone on \u201cGirls\u201d decided to go to Los Angeles for the weekend, it would be possible to simulate the city on a soundstage right here). In other words, there will be plenty of work for Oberlin graduates.More than 60 percent of residents of public housing in New York work in health care and social services; education; public administration; and low-wage retail jobs \u2014 none of which offer much in the way of preparation for designing shagreen side tables or other sorts of creative-class employment.Another potential hindrance to broad ridership on the streetcar system is the matter of our antiquated parking laws. The city still operates, in many instances, under mandatory parking laws dating from 1961, meaning that a certain number of parking spaces must be created when new residential buildings are constructed. Many of the new units going up on the waterfront, including the affordable units, are subject to these laws. And the easier it is to park and to drive, the less likely it becomes that people might use a light-rail system of the kind under review.At the community board level in New York, the biggest obstacle to developing affordable housing is the commitment to, or even obsession with, parking. As a recent City Council hearing made evident, even members from impoverished districts question restrictions on parking, despite the fact, that according to city figures, for every three parking spaces subsidized by taxpayers we forgo the building of two affordable apartments. However implausible it may seem in the year 2016, in many ways the idea of mass transit still requires a marketing effort.EMAIL: bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Judge Deals Setback to Holdouts in Negotiations With Argentina", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byA federal judge presiding over a long-running battle between Argentina and a group of New York hedge funds said on Friday that he would lift an injunction that had locked Argentina out of international markets.The ruling represents a sharp turnaround by Judge Thomas Griesa of the United States District Court in Manhattan, who had previously prevented Argentina from raising new money or paying its creditors before paying investors holding its defaulted debt.These investors \u2014 known as holdouts \u2014 include a group of hedge funds led by NML Capital, a unit of the billionaire Paul E. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management. They have battled with Argentina for more than a decade in a fight that stems from 2001, when the country defaulted on nearly $100 billion of debt.Argentina later offered twice to restructure the bonds for new and cheaper ones, but the holdouts refused and won a series of victories in the United States courts in recent years. Friday\u2019s ruling now weakens the hand of the holdouts in negotiating with Argentina.In his ruling on Friday, Judge Griesa said he would drop the injunctions after Argentina repeals domestic laws that prevent the country from making payments to the holdouts and makes full payments to bondholders who settle with Argentina by Feb. 29.Ms. Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her administration called the hedge funds \u201cvultures\u201d and \u201cfinancial terrorists,\u201d and went as far as denigrating Judge Griesa.All those years, Argentina \u201cnever seriously pursued negotiations toward settlement,\u201d Judge Griesa wrote in his ruling on Friday.\u201cAll that has changed,\u201d the judge added, referring to the newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, who has pledged to resolve the debt dispute as part of a bigger plan to overhaul Argentina\u2019s economy.In recent weeks, Mr. Macri\u2019s administration has moved to settle with several other holdouts, striking a $1.35 billion settlement with a group of Italian investors, among several other deals. On Feb. 5, after a week of intense negotiations with the group of six holdout hedge funds, it offered to pay $6.5 billion in an effort to put the battle behind it.Two hedge funds \u2014 Montreux Partners and Dart Management \u2014 accepted the proposal, which would amount to three-quarters of a $9 billion claim on defaulted bonds.The four others funds, which include NML Capital and Aurelius Capital Management, a hedge fund run by the former Elliott trader Mark Brodsky, have continued to reject the proposal.If the court were to refuse to vacate the injunctions now, \u201cit would unfairly deny those plaintiffs the opportunities to resolve their disputes amicably with the Republic,\u201d Judge Griesa wrote on Friday.He added that \u201cvacating the injunctions serves the public interest by encouraging settlement to resolve disputes generally \u2014 particularly such protracted ones \u2014 as well as the concern for finality in this particular litigation.\u201dThe ruling is also conditioned on a federal appeals court giving Judge Griesa the green light to go ahead.\u201cTo think that after all that Elliott\u2019s been through, that they could be outfoxed at this late hour \u2014 incredible, Macri\u2019s a genius,\u201d said one hedge fund manager who has not been involved in the dispute, but has watched it closely and has investments in Argentina.Aurelius declined to comment, as did a spokesman for NML Capital.Argentina had hoped to get the injunctions vacated first, so it could raise new money to pay the settlements it is reaching. But referring to Judge Griesa\u2019s decision that the government pay the bondholders as a condition for his lifting the injunctions thereafter, Yael Bialostozky, the chief spokeswoman for Argentina\u2019s Finance Ministry, said: \u201cThere was no surprise here. We keep progressing to close out agreements with the greatest possible number of bondholders.\u201dJonathan Gilbert contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Like other automakers, Land Rover uses a fluid called urea, which mists the exhaust to knock down emissions, turning harmful nitrogen oxide into plain old nitrogen. The urea tank gets filled every 10,000 miles or so. There\u2019s low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation, too, but then I\u2019d be getting all technical on you.The Td6 packs 254 horsepower and enough soul-satisfying torque to drag Lucifer back to Hades, 440 pound-feet to be precise.

To be straight-up honest, my practical Midwest upbringing once saw the luxurious appointments of a Range Rover to be a little much. Who pushes a vehicle that begins at $85,945 through knee-deep mud on the way to boulder-strewn paths? I now find the amalgamation of opera house refinement and mountain goat ability perversely appealing.The $1,500 premium for the diesel engine is a wise investment, less for the fuel economy than its driving pleasure.

Across the country in Nevada, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton tried to lock down supporters in the fiercely contested caucuses there.The poll had Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in second place with 23 percent, followed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in third place with 15 percent, and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, in fourth place with 13 percent. Ben Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio each had 9 percent.As the Republican field winnows, nearly all of the remaining contenders need to deliver strong performances. A big victory by Mr. Trump would give him momentum that could add a sheen of inevitability to his candidacy heading into the crucial March 1 contests, when 12 states vote, many of them in the South. The winner in South Carolina will take 29 of the 50 delegates; the remaining 21, divided among the seven congressional districts, will go to the winners in those districts.The stakes are just as great in Saturday\u2019s voting in Nevada, where Mr. Sanders held three rallies in cities hundreds of miles apart. \u201cI hope we have a very large, very very large, voter turnout tomorrow,\u201d he told hundreds of people at a gym in Elko. \u201cShow the world that democracy is alive and well here in Nevada.\u201dMrs. Clinton held one public rally and several smaller meetings in the state Friday to get her supporters out to the caucuses. But unreliable polling and a history of lower turnout in Nevada made the outcome of Saturday\u2019s caucuses uncertain. Mrs. Clinton had once considered Nevada a firewall, but Mr. Sanders has made recent inroads in the state following his strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.On the Republican side, Mr. Cruz, the winner of the Iowa caucuses, is eager to prove his appeal is broader than that of the previous winners, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, who struggled to attract voters beyond their base of evangelical support. In recent days, Mr. Cruz\u2019s rivalries with Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have turned particularly heated, producing a hail of negative advertising, semi-substantiated attacks, threatened litigation, accusations of doctored images and persistent charges of foul play among the three men.In a series of rallies on Friday \u2014 which included a chat with the television host Sean Hannity, an endorsement from Representative Mark Sanford and extended monologues from Phil Robertson, a Cruz supporter and \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star \u2014 Mr. Cruz made a play for the folksy.\u201cI can shoot me a bird,\u201d he boasted in Charleston. He later detailed the parallels between South Carolina and his home state of Texas, invoking \u201cthe South Carolinians who went down to Texas and spilled their blood at the Alamo.\u201dA look at the latest results for Iowa and New Hampshire, and how this year compares to previous election seasons.But Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump also ensured that their escalation of hostilities continued apace \u2014 a bitterness that has seeped deeply into the feelings of voters.Mr. Cruz mocked Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for generalities. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say \u2018make America great again,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he told supporters in a room overlooking the ocean. \u201cDo you understand what made America great in the first place?\u201dHe also expressed astonishment at Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he would stay \u201cneutral\u201d in disputes between Israel and its enemies. \u201cI have no intention of being neutral,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.Mr. Rubio, for his part, sought to rise above the fray, even as his campaign continued to hammer Mr. Cruz as dishonest. One news release on Friday was titled: \u201cRubio Campaign Warns SC Voters: Beware Primary Day Tricks By Cruz.\u201dEager to rebound from a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, Mr. Rubio held forth in downtown Columbia, S.C., presenting his campaign themes and his army of big-name supporters.\u201cWe have a chance to be the authors of the greatest chapter in the story of America, and that is why I\u2019m asking you for your support tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.In a show of force intended to underscore his message of ushering in a new generation of Republican stars, Mr. Rubio was flanked by the political leaders here who have endorsed him \u2014 a diverse lot that included Gov. Nikki R. Haley, an Indian-American; Tim Scott, a United States senator who is black; and Trey Gowdy, a popular congressman who is white.\u201cThe new conservative movement looks like a Benetton commercial,\u201d Ms. Haley shouted to the crowd, which she beckoned to join her and Mr. Rubio on stage.The generational pitch was a sharp contrast to Mr. Bush\u2019s nostalgia-tinged push. During his three-stop swing through the northwest part of the state, Mr. Bush was joined by his mother, Barbara Bush; one his sons (Jeb Jr. \u2014 or \u201c2.0,\u201d as he is called); his wife, Columba; and his two younger brothers, Neil and Marvin.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cYou like Bushes?\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, a Bush supporter, asked the crowd here. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a pile of Bushes.\u201dMr. Bush is under increasing pressure from donors and supporters to drop out if he does not place in the top three, or finishes far behind Mr. Rubio.The family matriarch urged voters to give her son a longer look.\u201cJeb has been a great son, a great father, a great husband, married well, and is one of my four favorite sons,\u201d Ms. Bush, 90, said on Friday morning. \u201cHe\u2019s steady, he\u2019s honest, he is modest, he\u2019s kind, he is good.\u201dIn Myrtle Beach, Mr. Trump cited polls that showed him having the most support on the economy, national security and immigration. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m a little weak on,\u201d he said, \u201cis my personality, but who the hell cares?\u201dMr. Trump held three rallies on Friday in coastal communities \u2014 Myrtle Beach, Pawleys Island and Charleston \u2014 that are rich in moderate Republicans and independents.

After a town hall-style forum in Columbia, Mr. Kasich appeared to take expectation management to the extreme.\u201cPeople thought we would get, you know, like, maybe two or three votes,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do better than that.\u201dAshley Parker reported from Spartanburg, and Matt Flegenheimer from Greenville.

But their numbers have multiplied across the country in the last few years, filling a niche for those who need more than a cafe, but less than an office.These have been joined by even newer and hipper co-working spaces, including RVCC, which stands for the Reserve Vault City Club. This club occupies the old Federal Reserve Bank in downtown Los Angeles, costs $88 a month, offers free coffee and feels more like a speakeasy than an office space. (Sticking with that secret feel, RVCC proudly doesn\u2019t have a social media presence or a website.)Before you rush out to join a co-working space, there are pros and cons to consider.This is where co-working spaces seem to fit in.NeueHouse, for example, has two restaurants, a coffee shop and meeting rooms. There are also rows of desks equipped with headphones for those who want to work alone, and open offices for those who want to work in a collaborative setting.When I spent some time at NeueHouse last week, I saw waiters rushing to and fro with coffees and pastries, dropping them off at members\u2019 desks or offices. It looked like a hotel with room service, but no beds. The space seemed open and simple, as in, there wasn\u2019t a lot of fuss (unlike some other spaces I\u2019ve tried out). Though I could see the $7 parking fee at NeueHouse easily adding up.\u201cGiven the changes in the economy, and the changes in the attitude around work, we felt like it was the ideal time to pull out a blank piece of paper and rethink what the ideal work space would be for people,\u201d said Joshua Abram, a founder and chief executive of NeueHouse. Mr. Abram added that he sees NeueHouse as not only a place for people to work, but also a place to network and interact with other creative minds.If NeueHouse is about connecting people, then RVCC is the opposite. The founder, Chris Adams, said that \u201cwe now live in a world of over-connections,\u201d and he wanted to create a \u201csanctuary-like space\u201d that allowed people to work in solitude.\u201cThese days, our culture is changing so much,\u201d Mr. Adams said. \u201cThere are no regular work hours anymore, or socializing hours, so we wanted to set a platform for whatever you want to do. So if you\u2019re working late at night, and no cafes are open, you can come here and get a cup of coffee or an old-fashioned, and just work.\u201dAfter trying out of dozens of spaces in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, I realized I want to join them all.

That percentage has declined but still hovers between 52.5 percent and 54 percent in polls conducted after the North\u2019s latest nuclear test on Jan. 6.\u201cIf we give up securing our own nuclear deterrent for fear of international opposition and depend unilaterally on the United States, we will become nothing but a chess piece manipulated by big powers,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, south of Seoul.\u201cWe need to arm with nuclear weapons so as not to become sandwiched between the United States and China,\u201d he said.Some advocates of a South Korean nuclear program acknowledge they want to put pressure on China, as frustration grows with Beijing\u2019s inability \u2014 or unwillingness \u2014 to rein in its North Korean ally.After the North\u2019s latest nuclear test, Ms. Park did not publicly admonish or discourage the hawkish wing of her party, though she did reaffirm South Korea\u2019s commitment to nuclear nonproliferation.\u201cI fully understand why some go so far as to argue that we should have tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d she told a news conference last month. \u201cBut I have emphasized many times that a nuclear-free world should start in the Korean Peninsula and that there should be no nuclear weapons there.\u201dSouth Korean officials and analysts alike have long said that the country had too much to lose if it decided to go nuclear. Its exports-dependent economy would founder under international sanctions if it left the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. And it could trigger an arms race in the region.Such warnings aside, the fear of being abandoned by the Americans has deep roots here. From an early age, South Koreans are taught that Korea was betrayed by the former Soviet Union and the United States after World War II, leading to a divided Korean Peninsula.In the 1970s, when South Korea feared the United States might withdraw troops from Asia after its pullout from Vietnam, its then-dictator, Park Chung-hee, Ms. Park\u2019s father, set out to build nuclear arms. He recruited expatriate Korean scientists from the United States and signed a contract with France to build a nuclear reprocessing plant to make bomb fuel.Washington learned of the program and forced Mr. Park to give it up, warning that his nuclear ambitions jeopardized the alliance and American aid. Although Mr. Park reportedly vowed to build a nuclear weapon by 1981, it remained unclear how far South Korea had gotten before it abandoned that goal.Mr. Park, remembered for his mantra of \u201cself-reliant defense,\u201d remains a revered figure among the South Korean conservative establishment. Although the country has since repeatedly disavowed a desire to join the nuclear club, its scientists had transgressed International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards by experimenting with reprocessing in 1982 and with enrichment in 2000.Mr. Cheong, the Sejong Institute analyst, said at this point South Korea could build a nuclear weapon within 18 months.Some nationalists have argued, unsuccessfully, that if the United States will not permit South Korea to have nuclear weapons, it should at least allow it to acquire a plutonium stockpile and sensitive nuclear technology to maintain a recessed weapons capability.Now that the North has abandoned that deal, some South Koreans say Washington should at least ensure a nuclear balance on the peninsula by reintroducing tactical atomic weapons. This week, some conservative civic groups began a signature-collecting campaign to urge the government to start negotiations with Washington.Mr. Pollack said the United States regarded such weapons as essentially irrelevant to contemporary security requirements. And Han Min-koo, the South Korean defense minister, told Parliament this week that the combined allied deterrent, including the \u201cnuclear umbrella\u201d the Americans provided, was enough to protect the country.\u201cIt is unnecessary because the United States is absolutely committed to South Korea\u2019s security and to its defense,\u201d Antony J. Blinken, deputy secretary of state, said in a recent interview. \u201cI think the international community would not look favorably on it.\u201dYet many here doubt Washington\u2019s allegiance. The recent contention by Donald J. Trump, the Republic presidential candidate, that South Korea was not paying enough to help maintain 28,500 American troops here has only fueled those misgivings.\u201cWe must ask ourselves whether the United States will save Seoul at the risk of sacrificing L.A. or San Francisco,\u201d Chung Mong-joon, a former head of the governing party, wrote in a widely circulated blog post, warning of the North\u2019s potential for striking the United States with a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile.An editorial in the Chosun Ilbo this month advised South Korea to study the path Israel took to becoming a de facto nuclear power. \u201cWe can no longer depend on the uncertain American nuclear umbrella,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton Easily Top New Poll in South Carolina", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton hold commanding leads in South Carolina ahead of the primary election there, according to a poll released Tuesday.The poll shows Mr. Trump\u2019s support remaining steady in South Carolina since October, while Mr. Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses and performed well in New Hampshire, is on the rise. The Republican primary is on Saturday. Republicans by far see Mr. Trump as the strongest candidate to handle the economy, illegal immigration and fighting terrorism. They also see him as the most likely to win in a general election. On social issues and foreign policy, Mr. Trump holds only slim leads over Mr. Cruz. Mr. Trump has been facing attacks in recent days as his rivals look to blunt his momentum. The vitriol between him and Mr. Cruz has been especially pitched, as the Texas senator has sought to portray Mr. Trump as a fake Republican while Mr. Trump has questioned Mr. Cruz\u2019s mental stability.On the other side, 56 percent of likely Democratic voters in South Carolina support Mrs. Clinton, compared with 38 percent who back Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mrs. Clinton wins handily on all issues, with vast advantages on health care policy and race relations. Mr. Sanders does manage to keep it close on gun policy, an issue that some Democrats say he has been weak on.  With Democrats holding their South Carolina primary on Feb. 27, Mr. Sanders has just over 10 days to narrow the gap with Mrs. Clinton. Although time is short, only 43 percent of likely voters say they have definitely decided upon a candidate. The poll of Republicans has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. The margin of error for Democrats is plus or minus 6 percentage points. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "30 Years After Revolution, Some Filipinos Yearn for \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of Marcos", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byBut in the decades since Marcos was ousted and fled the country, the outrage has faded for many Filipinos. Despite the accusations of widespread corruption and human rights violations, none of the Marcos family members have been jailed. The family has quietly returned to politics \u2014 Mrs. Marcos is a now member of Congress, while her daughter Imee Marcos is a governor.The family\u2019s political resurgence is led by Marcos\u2019s son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., known as Bongbong, a popular senator who is tied for first place in the vice president\u2019s race for the May 9 national election, according to a recent survey.Mr. Marcos has built a coalition from his father\u2019s remaining supporters and young people who were not alive when martial law was declared in the 1970s. He is also backed by the well-funded families who benefited from the Marcos presidency, according to Ramon C. Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform in Manila.Mr. Marcos has also drawn close to popular politicians. He often appears at rallies with the boxer Manny Pacquiao, a senatorial candidate who is loved by millions of Filipinos. Miriam Defensor Santiago, who is running for president with Mr. Marcos, has a large following among young people on social media.On the campaign trail, Mr. Marcos usually discusses his plans for the future, but he has also touched on what his father\u2019s supporters consider the \u201cgolden age\u201d of the Philippines.Imelda Ordu\u00f1a, a 70-year-old retired schoolteacher living in the city of Caloocan, north of Manila, who attended one of his recent political rallies, said she remembers well the time of Marcos when there was no traffic, police officers did not extract bribes and criminals were on the run.\u201cLife was easier under Marcos,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had peace and order and corruption was minimal. We have to tell our children and grandchildren about these times.\u201dMr. Marcos was campaigning and not available for an interview, his staff said, but during a television interview in August he said he would not apologize for his father\u2019s administration.\u201cWhat am I to say sorry about?\u201d he said during the interview, adding that under his father thousands of miles of roads were built, the country had one of the highest literacy rates in Asia, and it was an exporter of rice \u2014 the country\u2019s staple food \u2014 not an importer, as it is now.But, he noted during a Feb. 17 news briefing, the issue of martial law and his father\u2019s human rights record does not come up that often on the campaign trail.\u201cPeople no longer ask about martial law,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThey are interested in the current problems of the country, such as jobs and traffic.\u201dMichelle Pulumbarit, 31, a customer service operator who lives north of Manila, said Mr. Marcos was putting forward a proposal for the future that will bring back the best of the Marcos years. She is not concerned about martial law and human rights violations, she said.\u201cFor me, those are things of the past,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a time when our economy was booming. Even Imelda did a lot of good things. She shared our culture with the world. I can forgive her for having so many shoes.\u201dFor others in the Philippines, the idea of a Marcos \u201cgolden age\u201d is not supported by the facts. In her recent book, \u201cMarcos Martial Law: Never Again,\u201d the journalist Raissa Robles estimated that more than 3,200 people were murdered by the government during the Marcos years, and about 40,000 were tortured.\u201cIt was a \u2018golden age\u2019 if you were politically aligned with Marcos,\u201d said Mr. Casiple of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. \u201cThe cronies and the warlords of Marcos lived well and got the best of everything, but not the rest of society. Our school textbooks don\u2019t reflect the agony of what was taking place during that time.\u201dOn Tuesday, a spokesman for President Benigno S. Aquino III told reporters that the country is more successful now than it was under Mr. Marcos. \u201cIt took us three decades to return our country\u2019s honor,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now known as Asia\u2019s rising star, an investment-grade economy and an example of good governance.\u201dLisandro Claudio, a professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University, said the Marcos family has changed the political narrative over time, focusing on the glamour and high-profile achievements of the Marcos years.\u201cThey have poured a lot of money into this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have engineered this resurgence for decades and it taps into something genuine: that Filipinos don\u2019t think they are respected in the world anymore. They feel they are globally insignificant.\u201dThe Philippine government estimates that Marcos and his associates spirited away $5 billion of government funds by moving the money to overseas bank accounts, as well as buying lavish works of art and jewelry.Some fear that the election of Mr. Marcos could slow the recovery of that fortune; Mr. Casiple noted that the court system is overwhelmed and in some cases judges are not motivated to rule against associates of the Marcos family.\u201cSome of the people in the courts were appointed by Marcos during martial law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a statement of the residual power of the Marcos family. All of the administrations that have followed Marcos have had a very difficult time prosecuting them in the courts.\u201d\u201cDuring the time of martial law, the Philippines was disciplined,\u201d Ms. Buiza said as she gestured toward a group of jaywalkers dodging vehicles and blocking traffic. \u201cPeople don\u2019t even know how to cross the street now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And despite some expectations management, Mr. Devine betrayed some high confidence when he said that a convincing showing here, especially one that drew on independents and young people, would demonstrate to the Democratic establishment that it was Mr. Sanders who was able to bring new voters into the process. It would be very hard, he said, for the Clinton campaign to knock Mr. Sanders off of a message that was drawing such enthusiastic support. That said, he acknowledged that there was a threshold of negativity from the Clinton campaign that would force the Sanders campaign to respond. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet there is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we are going to try and avoid making that happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor now, anyway.

{"Headline": "How a Medical Mystery in Brazil Led Doctors to Zika", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "A sudden, sharp increase in babies with \u201cno foreheads and very strange heads\u201d was baffling doctors in Brazil. That set off a search for answers that led to a little-known pathogen, the Zika virus.Supported bySomething strange was happening last August in the maternity wards of Recife, a seaside city perched on Brazil\u2019s easternmost tip, where the country juts into the Atlantic.\u201cChildren with normal faces up to the eyebrows, and then you have no foreheads and very strange heads,\u201d she recalled, referring to the condition known as microcephaly. \u201cThe doctors were saying, \u2018Well, I saw four today,\u2019 and, \u2018Oh that\u2019s strange, because I saw two.\u2019\u201dAside from their alarming appearance, many of the babies seemed healthy.\u201cThey cried,\u201d Dr. Turchi said. \u201cThey breast-fed well. They just didn\u2019t seem to be ill.\u201dDoctors were stumped.They did not know it then, but they were seeing the first swell of a horrifying wave. A little-known pathogen \u2014 the Zika virus, carried by mosquitoes \u2014 had been circulating in Brazil for at least a year. It would later become the chief suspect in the hunt to work out what had happened to those newborns.And the children stricken with microcephaly, or abnormally small heads, have doctors everywhere asking: What is this virus? How could it have been around for almost 70 years without us realizing its power? What do we tell our patients about a bug that can hide in a mosquito\u2019s proboscis and a man\u2019s semen, even in human saliva or urine? What do we tell young women who ask if their unborn babies are safe?\u201cWith Zika, we\u2019re seeing new twists and turns every week.\u201dTo doctors in Recife, whatever was striking the babies seemed to have fallen like a bolt from the blue.In reality, it had been building for months. It had even been frequently discussed among clinicians \u2014 but no one had realized what was on the horizon.A year earlier, doctors say, the first patients had started trickling into public hospitals in Natal, capital of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, about 200 miles up the coast from Recife.It was a few weeks after the 2014 World Cup, and Natal had been one of the host cities of the soccer championship, which draws fans from all over the world.Many patients lived on the city\u2019s margins, others in settlements dotted across the sert\u00e3o, northeast Brazil\u2019s arid hinterland.\u201cThat scared some patients and doctors, and my team,\u201d said Aline Bezerra, a nurse and the municipal epidemiologist. \u201cWe knew nothing other than that it might be some kind of light dengue.\u201dTests ruled that out, along with other common viruses, but the patients kept coming. One day in January 2015, 100 showed up at the state\u2019s hospitals.\u201cWe alerted the federal authorities that we were dealing with something urgent and new,\u201d said Dr. Kleber Luz, an infectious diseases specialist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. \u201cBut their reaction was sluggish.\u201d\u201cPeople were claiming it was polluted water,\u201d said Dr. G\u00fabio Soares, a virologist at the Federal University of Bahia in Salvador. \u201cI began thinking it was something transmitted by mosquitoes.\u201dWorking in his modest lab with a colleague, Dr. Silvia Sardi, Dr. Soares kept testing blood samples.Other doctors were doing the same. Over 6,800 samples were tested, according to news reports, from victims ranging from 4 months to 98 years old. Parvovirus, dengue, chikungunya and other suspects were all ruled out.Finally, in April, Dr. Soares and Dr. Sardi were sure: It was Zika.\u201cI actually felt a sense of relief,\u201d Dr. Soares said. \u201cThe literature said it was much less aggressive than viruses we already deal with in Brazil.\u201dIn the capital, Bras\u00edlia, the health minister at the time, Dr. Arthur Chioro, felt the same way.\u201cThe arrival of Zika virus in Brazil is not good news,\u201d wrote Thomas M. Yuill, an emeritus professor of veterinary science and wildlife ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Not only did Brazil have \u201cabundant mosquitoes and a large population of susceptible people,\u201d he wrote, but so did much of the Americas.Two weeks earlier, an American mosquito disease expert working in Rio de Janeiro had scoffed on ProMED about an unconfirmed report that it was Zika. The virus fit the symptoms, he wrote, but it was circulating only in Africa and Asia, and in the South Pacific, half a world away, in a different ocean.He was right about where the virus had been, but not about where it was now.For years, virus hunters on ProMED and other outbreak alert networks had been watching, fascinated, as Zika made long, slow and erratic progress eastward across the Pacific, island-hopping as American forces had done during World War II, albeit in reverse.In 2007, it hit Yap Island, in Micronesia, east of the Philippines and north of Australia. It could have come to Yap from anywhere in Asia.In October 2013, the Zika virus raced through the many islands of French Polynesia, including Tahiti and Bora Bora. In early 2014, it bounced to the Cook Islands, just to the west, and New Caledonia, close to Australia.It also leapt to Easter Island, home of the giant stone heads, its official arrival in the Western Hemisphere.It is still island-hopping. American Samoa and Tonga are having outbreaks now.Scott C. Weaver, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, wrote an article in 2009 warning that Zika was approaching the Americas. The virus was so obscure that, trying to be helpful in an interview, he explained: \u201cIts closest relative is Spondweni\u201d \u2014 a virus named for a place in South Africa that is no longer even on maps.Back in Brazil, on May 14, it was definite. The mysterious outbreaks \u2014 by then in cities all over Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro \u2014 had all been caused by Zika.Who had brought the virus to Brazil? There are two theories.The first, offered by Brazilian scientists who analyzed airline flight patterns, was that it arrived in the crowds of soccer fans who had flocked to the 12 host cities in the 2014 World Cup. If the Natal outbreak was truly the first, that theory has credence.Since the virus is believed to persist in the blood for up to 10 days, it presumably came from an island then having an outbreak. But in a world as interconnected as ours has become, it may be spread not by a foreigner from faraway lands, but by any international traveler.Air travel has been a factor in the spread of Zika virus, but some countries are better at detecting and preventing the spread of diseases.The first case of Zika infection detected in New York City was found in December 2013 \u2014 six months before the virus is thought to have reached Brazil \u2014 in a 48-year-old traveler who lives near Central Park but has asked to remain unidentified.When he walked into Traveler\u2019s Medical Service on Madison Avenue, he had just returned from a long trek through Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Easter Island and Hawaii, with a stopover in French Polynesia.Dyan J. Summers, the nurse practitioner who first saw him, said he pulled his shirt out of his bluejeans and peeled it off, exposing a pinkish rash he said he had had for 11 days.Ms. Summers was startled: \u201cI\u2019d heard of Zika, but nobody was thinking about Zika.\u201dIn researching Zika, Ms. Summers said, her very bright patient had found an article about a scientist in Colorado who had infected his wife with the virus after returning from Africa.\u201cBecause of that paper, I advised him not to have unprotected sex with his common-law wife,\u201d she said.Their exchange was strangely prescient.It is an autoimmune attack on nerve cells that can be triggered by several viruses or bacteria. It is usually temporary, though it can last for weeks; but if the paralysis reaches the muscles powering the lungs, and the patient is not quickly put on a respirator, it can kill.Ms. Summers\u2019s caution was right: Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave similar advice about unprotected sex to all Americans.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.In May, after it was confirmed that Zika was circulating in Brazil, it took only a few weeks for doctors to suspect that Dr. Chioro, the health minister, had been mistaken. There were hints that the virus was anything but benign.In Macei\u00f3, Recife and other cities, cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 began to spike. Dr. Mar\u00eda L\u00facia Brito, a neurologist in Recife, saw 50 patients with it in 2015, up from 14 the year before.\u201cIt was obvious \u2014 a shift occurred when Zika cases started to rise,\u201d she said.In September, the Hospital Bar\u00e3o de Lucena, the public hospital in Recife where she works, saw a surge in cases: five microcephalic babies were suddenly in her care.The same thing was happening elsewhere. The hospital where her mother was a pediatric neurologist suddenly had seven cases.\u201cThat\u2019s when I thought, \u2018Something is terribly wrong,\u2019 \u201d Dr. van der Linden said.She soon learned that several of the mothers remembered having the \u201cmystery disease\u201d \u2014 the Zika rash \u2014 early in their pregnancies.But tests of the infants for the Zika infection were all negative. Their mothers had been ill months earlier, and in adults the virus usually disappears in 10 days or less. It is still unclear how long it persists in a fetus.In early October, the national health ministry asked Dr. Turchi, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation epidemiologist, to investigate. She went to hospitals, including those in Recife. Doctors were running tests for various viruses, but they were all coming up blank.\u201cThe pediatricians were saying, \u2018We\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cThese kids are different. This is something new.\u201dDr. K\u00e1tia Petribu, a hospital psychiatrist in Recife, remembers the mothers. They were ghosts \u2014 mute, expressionless figures in corridors holding babies whose foreheads seemed to have vanished.Many of the mothers were young, one just 14. \u201cThey were in a state of shock,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were unable to talk.\u201dDr. Petribu had trouble sleeping. She could not get them out of her mind.\u201cThey come with nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cNo food. They travel by bus for hours, arrive at 7 a.m., and wait for hours to be seen.\u201dMany were young rural women with no understanding of why their children looked so different. A 16-year-old showed up with her own mother, who was worried about missing a perfect day to sell cold drinks on the beach.Dr. Mauricio L. Nogueira, a doctor from southern Brazil who had seen no cases in his region, which is as far from the tropical north as Quebec is from Miami, remembers visiting a hospital in the northern city of Salvador. He is still haunted by what he saw: 25 microcephalic children, all born in the previous 10 days.That was \u201creally shocking for me,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil then, I was just reading reports.\u201dOne mother, he said, looked up at him and asked, \u201cHey, doctor, his head is going to grow, right?\u201d\u201cIt was really painful,\u201d he said.Frustration was growing, too, for Dr. Turchi, the epidemiologist. \u201cIf we had known what was going on, that would have been one thing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there was no book to follow. We had no map.\u201dShe shelved her work on the dengue virus and skipped Christmas with her mother.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep for several weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the most important thing I have seen in my entire career. It was a tragedy, but it was like we were seeing history in front of us, day by day. It was a living history, and we were part of it.\u201dZika\u2019s connection to microcephaly was suspected but very difficult to confirm. Dr. Turchi set up a quick \u201ccase control\u201d study, the epidemiologist\u2019s classic tool, comparing babies born with the condition and those without it.Dr. David L. Heymann, chairman of the World Health Organization committee that recommended the declaration of the public health emergency, said in an interview last week that very tool \u2014 a case control study following two sets of pregnant women, some who had Zika and some who did not \u2014 was what his committee needed to prove whether Zika causes microcephaly, and whether it does so alone or requires a cofactor like a prior infection with dengue.\u201cSorting out a rare event will take a lot of women,\u201d he said, and they must be followed for months.But Dr. Turchi did not have months.She called every scientist she knew, and they came from all over Brazil. One flew in from London. Dr. Turchi gave the group a name: MERG, the Microcephaly Epidemic Research Group.\u201cIt was like a house on fire \u2014 everyone grabs a bucket and does what they can,\u201d she said. Some scientists stayed in her apartment, talking late into the night. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you like something and you have people who like the same thing, you can talk for hours without feeling tired,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like discussing football. You never stop talking. It\u2019s an obsession.\u201dA turning point came in early November: Dr. Adriana Melo in Para\u00edba State, just north of Recife, had drawn amniotic fluid from a pregnant woman and found Zika virus in it. Then brain tissue from two stillbirths was tested. Again, Zika.\u201cAt last we had a road to follow,\u201d Dr. Turchi said. \u201cA map.\u201d\u201cIt was the kind of call where you dropped everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThere had never been a congenital malformation by mosquito before, not ever. It was totally outside our experience.\u201dWith the discovery of Zika in malformed fetuses, Dr. Turchi\u2019s team has been able to turn to the kind of task Dr. Heymann described. They have recruited about 1,000 pregnant women with Zika symptoms, and are following healthy and microcephalic newborns in the same areas. They work nights and weekends, eating sandwiches from the institute\u2019s shop or meals of rice, beans and chicken provided by a research assistant\u2019s mother.There are now so many reported cases of microcephaly that a new problem has arisen: too many false alarms.Brazil has already changed its definition of a small head, to 32 centimeters around from 33 centimeters, and may revise it again soon.Dr. Turchi defends those decisions, saying a broad net had to be cast at first because so little was known.\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to get just the severe cases; we wanted to look at the broadest possible spectrum of the disease,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we can narrow it later.\u201dLoosed on a continent where no one is immune, Zika has the potential to infect tens of millions of people. It is now being transmitted in 33 countries with about 600 million inhabitants, the W.H.O. says. Health officials in Brazil are investigating thousands of reported cases of microcephaly that may be linked to the virus.Now a bright spot has appeared.In Recife, and Pernambuco State around it, microcephaly cases have been declining for about three weeks. It is unclear exactly why, but researchers are starting to wonder if the epidemic has peaked.\u201cIt looks like a perfect epidemic curve,\u201d Dr. Turchi said. \u201cYou see where it started, then went up, and now it\u2019s going down.\u201dBut that decline, and the general sigh of relief it portends, is occurring only in the one spot in the hemisphere where transmission of the virus hit earliest and was most intense.Zika was just getting started there a year before the microcephaly cases began. And now the virus is virtually everywhere south of Florida and Texas.And Guillain-Barr\u00e9, the harbinger of microcephaly, is being spotted farther from the epidemic\u2019s epicenter in Brazil.Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname and El Salvador, where mosquitoes thrive year-round, all have reported Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases. Colombia has \u201can explosion\u201d of them, its health minister said, with three deaths.Air travel maps show the United States\u2019 potential to be a kind of viral pincushion; Zika may arrive from anywhere. Since four out of five victims never have any symptoms, there is no way to spot it at the border.The C.D.C. thinks it is all but inevitable that there will be at least small outbreaks here. But how far they spread will depend on how aggressively mosquitoes are killed.Now that the world is alert to the danger and is fighting back, and women are even contemplating delaying pregnancies, scientists say it is unlikely that Brazil\u2019s national nightmare will be repeated elsewhere on such a scale.In Recife, Dr. Turchi was hopeful.\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable now,\u201d she said. \u201cI see so many people working as a team and so much international concern. Now it has become clear to the whole world.\u201dAn article on Sunday about the Zika virus misstated the location of Yap Island, in Micronesia, which suffered an outbreak of the virus in 2007. It is east of the Philippines, not west.Donald G. McNeil Jr. reported from New York; Simon Romero from Recife, Brazil; and Sabrina Tavernise from Washington.Advertisement"}

So the company wants to help many more businesses get off the ground.Determining eligibility requires little more than filling out a form. After that, Stripe will incorporate an entrepreneur\u2019s company as a business entity in Delaware, and provide the entrepreneur with a United States bank account and Stripe merchant account to accept payments globally.The target audience is all of the entrepreneurs outside the United States who want access to the country\u2019s well-developed banking infrastructure and business services. Stripe is particularly interested in attracting entrepreneurs from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia, among other regions.\u201cA majority of the growth over the next 10 years will come from these underserved markets,\u201d Patrick Collison, co-founder and chief executive of Stripe, said in an interview last week. \u201cThat includes about 6.2 billion people we don\u2019t reach yet, and that\u2019s a huge missed opportunity if we didn\u2019t try to do so.\u201dEligible entrepreneurs will also be offered access to basic tax and legal consulting and business services from partners like PricewaterhouseCoopers, and will receive free credit to run their online business on the Amazon Web Services hosting platform.Atlas is to begin on Wednesday in an invitation-only beta test; entrepreneurs can apply for the program through Stripe or one of the 50-plus start-up accelerator programs that the company has teamed up with globally. The beta program\u2019s cost is $500.It seems like a fine deal for fledgling entrepreneurs, and considering the cumulative value of the services offered, it essentially is. It is also potentially lucrative for Stripe, which processes digital payments for small and medium-size online businesses. More businesses using Stripe means an increase in payments processed over all. Stripe takes a small percentage of each transaction processed.For Dana Khater, the 22-year-old founder of Coterique, a digital platform based in Cairo for little-known international designers who want to sell their clothing online, setting up Atlas will help solve a problem as seemingly simple as paying her stable of designers.\u201cRight now, everything is very manually operated,\u201d Ms. Khater said. \u201cI need to go to the bank, withdraw money, then go to an exchange rate site, go back to the bank and set up the wire transfer. It\u2019s a huge tax on my time and effort.\u201dMs. Khater will also be saved the cost of traveling to the United States \u2014 which often requires more than one trip \u2014 to set up the services herself.There has been a retrenching in doling out venture capital in Silicon Valley and other start-up hubs like New York, and for months, global markets have been in turmoil, causing some investors to become more risk-averse. That could affect the number of entrepreneurs willing to start a small business.What\u2019s more, Stripe is potentially luring away entrepreneurs to incorporate themselves in the United States instead of, say, their home countries. That means fewer tax dollars for the nations these entrepreneurs reside in, which could irk local governments.Mr. Collison said the time horizon for Atlas is focused less on Day 1 than on Day 1,000.Stripe said Atlas would help entrepreneurs incorporate in countries outside the United States over time, but said there would still be a positive net effect on local economies in host countries if entrepreneurs incorporated in America succeed.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have Atlas, the business may not get off the ground in the first place,\u201d said Benjamin M. Lawsky, former superintendent of financial services for New York State, who now sits on the advisory board for Atlas. \u201cOr the innovator will get up and move out of the country to where the advanced economy is \u2014 like in the U.S., for example.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Drivers and Others in the Gig Economy Take a Stand", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byLast September, Dallas-area drivers for UberBlack, the company\u2019s high-end car service, received an email informing them that they would be expected to start picking up passengers on UberX, its low-cost option.The next day, when the policy was scheduled to go into effect, dozens of drivers caravaned to Uber\u2019s office in downtown Dallas and planted themselves outside until company officials met with them. Many had taken out loans to buy luxury vehicles that cost upward of $35,000, and worried that the modest per-mile rate for UberX passengers would barely cover gas and wear and tear, to say nothing of their car payments.The standoff stretched across nearly three more tense days until Uber allowed them to opt out of the policy. \u201cThey thought we were just going to give up, walk away,\u201d said Kirubel Kebede, a leader of the group. \u201cBut we said, \u2018No, this is our livelihood.\u2019\u201dIn the rapid growth of the online gig economy, many workers have felt squeezed and at times dehumanized by a business structure that promises independence but often leaves them at the mercy of increasingly powerful companies. Some are beginning to band together in search of leverage and to secure what they see as fairer treatment from the platforms that make the work possible.\u201cWe started realizing we\u2019re not contractors, we\u2019re more like employees,\u201d said Berhane Alemayoh, one of the UberBlack drivers in Dallas. \u201cThey tell us what kind of car to drive. They kick you out if a customer accused you of not having a clean car. They started to tighten the rope. Gradually, we can\u2019t breathe any more.\u201dPerhaps the most prominent effort was a measure to give ride-hailing drivers the right to unionize in Seattle, which was approved by the City Council in December.But while many campaigns by alienated workers have shunned this more traditional labor-organizing approach, they have highlighted a basis for advancing the interests of gig economy workers collectively.\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of workplace identity and group consciousness despite the insistence from many of these platforms that they are simply open \u2018marketplaces\u2019 or \u2018malls\u2019 for digital labor,\u201d said Mary L. Gray, a researcher at Microsoft Research and professor in the Media School at Indiana University who studies gig economy workers.The efforts extend well beyond drivers for Uber and its prime competitor, Lyft. A group of couriers who find work on the platform Postmates is waging a campaign to create an \u201cI\u2019m done after this delivery\u201d button because they worry that turning down jobs will affect how many future assignments they receive. (A Postmates official said turning down jobs had no effect on future work, but that the company was still sympathetic to the idea.)The National Domestic Workers Alliance, which organizes nannies and housekeepers, recently produced what it calls the Good Work Code, which it has urged gig economy companies to adopt.\u201cThey would be dispatched to a home that didn\u2019t feel safe, but would be hesitant to exit themselves from that situation because it might affect their ratings,\u201d said Palak Shah, the alliance official leading the effort, citing one of several issues that the Good Work Code is intended to address. A handful of firms, like Managed by Q, LeadGenius and CareLinx, have embraced the guidelines.Though the so-called Turkers tend to value the flexibility and independence of freelancing and often reject the idea of a traditional union, many have also developed a kind of working-stiff identity. \u201cI\u2019ve heard them say Jeff Bezos is their boss \u2014 we\u2019re workers here,\u201d said Niloufar Salehi, a Stanford Ph.D. student who spent a year immersed in Turker forums to help the workers organize.By contrast, sellers of goods on digital marketplaces like eBay and Etsy rarely think of themselves as employees. In their minds, they say, they are independent artisans and shopkeepers.\u201cEtsy is the place where the shop exists, where I pay rent,\u201d said Sandie Russo, a longtime seller of hand-knit accessories and knitting patterns who once ran an online forum in which sellers helped one another address common problems. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely that you\u2019re an entrepreneur, not a worker.\u201dLike the Etsy shopkeepers, many Uber drivers began their relationship with the company thinking of themselves as self-employed.Unlike sellers on eBay or Etsy, Uber drivers cannot set the prices they charge. They are also constrained by the all-important rating system \u2014 maintain an average of around 4.6 out of 5 stars from customers in many cities or risk being deactivated \u2014 to behave a certain way, like not marketing other businesses to passengers.The experience of the Dallas UberBlack drivers is telling. When Uber entered Dallas in 2012, many of the drivers were either independent hired-car operators or contractors for limousine companies who bought or leased their own cars.\u201cSome had their own business, they were fine with the business,\u201d Mr. Alemayoh said. \u201cThey just used Uber as a complement.\u201dThe drivers formed a tactical alliance with the company to help it gain the city\u2019s approval, which local cab operators resisted. Mr. Alemayoh even sang Uber\u2019s praises in testimony before the Houston City Council, after the company asked him to speak there as part of its expansion efforts. \u201cI said it\u2019s fair to drivers to have Uber,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI spoke on their behalf, they didn\u2019t pay me.\u201dBut the relationship began to sour in 2014, when the company decreed that drivers with cars made before 2008 would no longer be able to participate in UberBlack.\u201cWe said, \u2018You guys are affecting so many families,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Kebede, a leader of a group called the Association of Limousine Owners and Operators of Dallas Fort Worth, formed the previous year. Uber extended the grace period by several months in some cases but did not reverse the policy.By the time Uber handed down its UberX directive in September, the drivers had long since recognized that they were at the company\u2019s beck and call. Because of Uber\u2019s popularity, almost all their other sources of business had dried up. And Uber had earned the imprimatur of the City Council, which made the drivers politically expendable, too.So it was something of a surprise that the drivers\u2019 association, which represents about 500 of the 2,000 to 3,000 black-car drivers it believes are active in the Dallas area, was able to push Uber not only to scale back the UberX change, but also to reinstate several of the drivers it had deactivated for pressuring fellow drivers as the showdown escalated.Some continue to be deactivated for what they feel are arbitrary reasons, which Uber maintains are unrelated to the protest (\u201cDrivers have the right to free expression and we respect that,\u201d said a company representative). But to the extent that the Dallas drivers have been successful, one crucial advantage is that they were able to organize in person rather than depend exclusively on the Internet and social media.That also helps explain the success of the campaign in Seattle, where Uber had previously reversed a rate cut after facing pressure from drivers. (Uber maintains that the reversal was unrelated.) \u201cThe drivers have gone out and talked to each other,\u201d said Dawn Gearhart, a spokeswoman in the area for the Teamsters union, which provides support services to local drivers. \u201cEvery time they would call a meeting, a couple hundred people would show up.\u201dIn the Tampa area, drivers have protested cuts that brought rates down to 65 cents a mile from 95 cents as of early January, and from $1.20 as recently as last spring. Net earnings for drivers there can come perilously close to subminimum wage rates on a 15- to 20-minute trip in town once they factor in pickup and wait times and the cost of gas, depreciation and maintenance.\u201cWe sometimes lower prices in a city to get more people using Uber,\u201d said an Uber representative. \u201cAs we have always said, price cuts need to work for drivers. If they do not, we will roll them back.\u201d In response, the Tampa area drivers started a weekly logout of an hour or two during peak periods for weekend revelers. During that time, they write messages on their windows about what they consider unlivable wages. The group has grown rapidly to a network of 700 drivers who communicate via an app-based walkie-talkie service called Zello.The Tampa drivers\u2019 goal is to enlist Uber\u2019s most politically valuable asset \u2014 legions of customers who have grown dependent on the service \u2014 to help send a message to Uber. Over time, they hope to extend the logouts to several hours, perhaps even a full day on the weekend.\u201cIt\u2019s a little blip on Uber\u2019s radar,\u201d said Josh Streeter, one of the leaders. \u201cBut then people might believe they have the power. That if they band together, they could pull off a bigger action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The West Must Stop Giving Turkey a Free Pass", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Erdogan\u2019s actions shouldn\u2019t have been surprising. The president has a history of jailing journalists and cracking down on media companies critical of his policies. And yet this time the response from his supporters was exceptionally chilling: A pro-Erdogan organized crime boss proclaimed, \u201cWe will take a shower in your blood,\u201d while the office doors of some of the academics were ominously marked with red crosses.Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who as a former academic might have been expected to come to his colleagues\u2019 defense, announced that he \u201cdid not regard the petition as falling under the rubric of free speech.\u201d He then set out on a trip to several European countries in order to encourage foreign investment in Turkey\u2019s foundering economy. In Britain and Germany, Mr. Davutoglu received a warm welcome from Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor Angela Merkel. The European Union\u2019s response to the latest crackdown on dissent in Turkey amounted to little more than a statement calling the persecution of the academics \u201cextremely worrying.\u201dMany prominent Western academics and non-governmental organizations have been vocal in censuring the persecution suffered by their Turkish counterparts. The European Union\u2019s lack of action on Turkey\u2019s crackdown on academic freedom and human rights would therefore be inexplicable but for one crucial detail: As the European Union faces its largest refugee crisis since World War II, the 2.5 million Syrians currently in Turkey are a huge bargaining chip for Ankara. Europe\u2019s leaders are well aware of this.Just weeks before Turkey\u2019s early elections on Nov. 1 , Ms. Merkel came to Istanbul to meet with Mr. Erdogan and strike a deal: If Turkey helped stem the flow of refugees into Europe, Germany would help push forward talks on Turkey\u2019s membership in the European Union. Many people fear that Ms. Merkel offered another compensation in exchange for help on the refugee issues: The European Union would tolerate Turkey\u2019s human rights violations and its reckless handling of the Kurdish conflict.The United States, which has crucial air bases in Turkey, cannot afford to alienate the Erdogan government, either. When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Turkey recently, he made a point of meeting with journalists who had been fired under government pressure. But afterward, Mr. Biden declared that the Turkish government was the United States\u2019 \u201cstrategic partner\u201d \u2014 an apparent gesture of reconciliation by Washington. Like many Western governments, the Obama administration has distanced itself from Mr. Erdogan since his suppression of the Gezi Park protests of 2013.The diplomatic balancing act cannot go on indefinitely. The Syrian Kurdish group known as the Democratic Union Party, or P.Y.D., a branch of the P.K.K., is an American ally on the ground against the Islamic State and has received American military aid. Meanwhile, Turkey continues its attempt to overthrow the regime of Bashar al-Assad by supporting Jaish al-Fatah, a Syrian rebel group that includes the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch.Turkey and the United States also do not see eye to eye when it comes to the Islamic State. Washington views the group as a high-priority threat and is pressuring Turkey to build a wall along its 60-mile border with the territory the jihadist group controls. Ankara, by contrast, sees the Islamic State as a symptom of a larger problem \u2014 Bashar al-Assad\u2019s continued presence in Damascus \u2014 and is entreating Washington to back an Islamist-dominated rebel group. The United States is ill at ease about this state of affairs, yet believes it has no choice but to stand behind Mr. Erdogan.Turkey and the European Union are in a more complex entanglement. At present, the European Union wields considerable leverage over Turkey, both as the market for more than 40 percent of its exports and as the arbiter of its long-stalled membership bid. Europe\u2019s current strategy of placating Mr. Erdogan for the sake of its own short-term interests is misguided. As the Paris and Istanbul attacks have shown, Europe and the Middle East are part of one open system: Chaos and conflict in one region is sure to have repercussions in another. The millions of Syrians seeking refuge in the West, as well as the thousands of jihadists going to Syria from Europe, are now Europe\u2019s problem \u2014 a problem that cannot be solved by building walls.With the Middle East ravaged by religious radicalism and sectarianism, the European Union and the United States can\u2019t afford the Turkish government\u2019s brutal military efforts against the Kurds or its undemocratic war on academics and journalists. Only a secular, democratic Turkey that can provide a regional bulwark against radical groups will bring stability to both the Middle East and Europe. As Mr. Erdogan seeks to eliminate all opposition and create a single-party regime, the European Union and the United States must cease their policy of appeasement and ineffectual disapproval and frankly inform him that this is a dead end.Advertisement"}

Their use of arbitration has raised concerns with state regulators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia urged the federal government to deny Medicaid and Medicare money to nursing homes that use the clauses. The argument is catching on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 appeals courts across the country have been throwing out arbitration agreements signed by family members of nursing home residents.Investors who scooped up broken-down houses at bargain prices after the financial crisis have made deals with low-income home buyers unable to get traditional mortgages.

{"Headline": "Gearing Up for the Cloud, AT&T Tells Its Workers: Adapt, or Else", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 Thirty-four years ago, Kevin Stephenson got his younger brother, Randall, a job with the telephone company.Kevin, then 23, and Randall, 22, had tried selling cattle feed with their father near their home in Moore, Okla., but that didn\u2019t pan out. Kevin was hired to do accounting at a local Southwestern Bell office. Randall, who was in college, needed a bit more help. \u201cHe had trouble getting hired,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI talked to someone I knew in personnel.\u201dThe brothers had different tastes. Kevin liked to be outside, and now, at 57 years old, he works in Norman, Okla., fixing the decades-old copper lines that still connect to landline telephones in most homes as well as to modern Internet conduits like high-speed fiber optics. Randall liked numbers and stayed indoors, rising through the management ranks.Southwestern Bell became SBC Communications and took on the old AT&T name through an acquisition in 2005. By 2007, Randall was running the place.Today, Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is trying to reinvent the company so it can compete more deftly. Not that long ago it had to fight for business with other phone companies and cellular carriers. Then the Internet and cloud computing came along, and AT&T found itself in a tussle with a whole bunch of companies.AT&T\u2019s competitors are not just Verizon and Sprint, but also tech giants like Amazon and Google. For the company to survive in this environment, Mr. Stephenson needs to retrain its 280,000 employees so they can improve their coding skills, or learn them, and make quick business decisions based on a fire hose of data coming into the company.In an ambitious corporate education program that started about two years ago, he is offering to pay for classes (at least some of them) to help employees modernize their skills. But there\u2019s a catch: They have to take these classes on their own time and sometimes pay for them with their own money.To Mr. Stephenson, it should be an easy choice for most workers: Learn new skills or find your career choices are very limited.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.\u201cThere is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop,\u201d he said in a recent interview at AT&T\u2019s Dallas headquarters. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning, he added, \u201cwill obsolete themselves with the technology.\u201dKevin? He admires his younger brother, but he is among the many AT&T lifers who are not that keen to participate in this reinvention of old Ma Bell. \u201cI\u2019m riding the copper train all the way down,\u201d he said.He talks about the changes with obvious affection for both his brother and his longtime employer. In interviews, many veteran AT&T employees around the country showed a surprising amount of emotion toward a company that has been broken up, rebuilt and reinvented several times.But that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is particularly eager to rebuild and reinvent themselves for a new AT&T. Even if it means, as Randall put it, obsolescence.Companies\u2019 reinventing themselves to compete with more nimble competitors is hardly a new story. Many have tried, and a handful have even succeeded. Mr. Stephenson wants AT&T to be among those few.By 2020, Mr. Stephenson hopes AT&T will be well into its transformation into a computing company that manages all sorts of digital things: phones, satellite television and huge volumes of data, all sorted through software managed in the cloud.That can\u2019t happen unless at least some of his work force is retrained to deal with the technology. It\u2019s not a young group: The average tenure at AT&T is 12 years, or 22 years if you don\u2019t count the people working in call centers. And many employees don\u2019t have experience writing open-source software or casually analyzing terabytes of customer data.If you don\u2019t develop the new skills, you won\u2019t be fired \u2014 at least AT&T won\u2019t say as much \u2014 but you won\u2019t have much of a future. The company isn\u2019t too worried about people leaving, since executives estimate that eventually AT&T could get by with one-third fewer workers.Mr. Stephenson declined to project how many workers he might have by 2020, when the cloud-based system is supposed to be fully in place. One thing about cutting people in an aging work force, he noted, is that \u201cdemography is on our side.\u201d Other senior executives say shrinking the work force by 30 percent is not out of the question.Maybe so, but count Kevin among the skeptics of how fast AT&T\u2019s transformation will happen.\u201cI\u2019m proud of my brother,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not going to get rid of this stuff as fast as he thinks.\u201dLong ago, a phone system created wire lines between callers, and operators moved plugs in their switchboards to connect people. Over time, that was automated to become something closer to a computer, with digital fibers and wireless towers. Much of the setup, however, still needed lots of people to tend hardware that had been built for particular tasks, like feeding one neighborhood\u2019s calls into a nationwide backbone of wires, fiber and switches.Mr. Stephenson has concentrated on things related to cloud computing, a technology setup that is more like the computer guts of Google or Amazon than the circuits and switches of a phone company. This cloud system will eventually touch ventures in landline phones, wireless, high-speed online services, cable TV and now satellite, thanks to the DirecTV purchase.Analysts give him good marks but say he has a long way to go. \u201cThey want to be 75 percent done by 2020, and last year they did the first 5 percent,\u201d said Akshay Sharma, an analyst with the research firm Gartner.AT&T wants to build products and services as fast as this competition. Data from satellite TV could be analyzed for viewing habits and someday used, for example, to sell football fans a replay app for their AT&T mobile phones.In 2012, Mr. Stephenson realized, much to his dismay, that his staff was woefully unschooled for the new technology. Vision 2020, as the company calls it, is a program that combines online and classroom-based course work in subjects like digital networking and data science, as well as a look at old skills that can be transferred to new careers.Everything at AT&T is changing, from the services customers are offered to the way they are charged for them. One service called Network on Demand, for example, allows customers to increase the size of their Internet pipes without calling a technician, something that used to take weeks. And Mr. Stephenson\u2019s employees have to be able to deal with all that.\u201cIf we can\u2019t do it, mark my words, in three years we\u2019ll be managing decline,\u201d he said.Inside a glass-walled office where Mr. Stephenson meets presidential candidates and corporate titans, Mr. Thrun gave him a pitch on funding an online master\u2019s degree in engineering that Udacity proposed to teach in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Within five minutes, the two men were cross-legged on the floor, Mr. Stephenson eager to try a physics course.His first online learning began with an unexpected challenge: getting online. AT&T\u2019s own Wi-Fi was too clunky, Mr. Thrun recalled. Eventually they used Mr. Thrun\u2019s smartphone, which ran on the network of T-Mobile, a rival carrier.The building\u2019s Wi-Fi is now said to be better, and elsewhere in AT&T the first employees are getting their online Georgia Tech degrees.Eboni Bell, 24, a product manager for smartphone software in AT&T\u2019s Atlanta office, sees the Vision 2020 retraining as the chance of a lifetime. The company provided tuition assistance for much of her two-year Udacity/Georgia Tech master\u2019s degree in computer science, which it says cost $6,600. Single and childless, she doesn\u2019t mind the hours it takes.\u201cI leave the office at 7 p.m., work at home until midnight, and Saturdays and Sundays are committed to school,\u201d she said.Ms. Bell, who wants to work in software architecture and design, plans to keep taking courses. \u201cI need to know what my competitors are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself staying with one product too long \u2014 it makes me feel like I\u2019m not growing.\u201dSo far most of the people who have taken the new courses are managers, and seem interested in learning very technical skills. Among the most popular courses are web development, data analysis, introduction to programming and writing apps for the iPhone.\u201cIt\u2019s great for those who want to make the transition,\u201d said Mr. Sharma of Gartner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to change, it\u2019s a good time to retire and enjoy life.\u201dAT&T\u2019s workers receive weekly emails and video broadcasts about learning online. Vision 2020 includes an internal website where employees can enter their job titles, see what types of careers might be available in a software-driven company, and what courses they need to take to get them. Over time, their grades are logged, and depending on how they do on the schoolwork, different new courses are suggested. Eventually, performance reviews will include data on what people studied, how well they did and whether, like Ms. Bell, they are willing to keep learning.Eventually, the plan is that desire for learning will be taken into account when promotions are considered.Across the country in Orange, Calif., Patti Cunningham, a 61-year-old technician, is struggling. Ms. Cunningham, who has worked at AT&T for 43 years, has not signed up for any courses, and can barely recall receiving emails about the new plans. (An AT&T spokesman produced dozens of such messages, going back to early 2014.) Essentially, she does not see a place for herself.\u201cThis new concept of training on your own time, everything changing all the time, if you want to keep working, do more things on your own time \u2014 I guess they have to do it,\u201d she said, sitting in a run-down room at her union local. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see a need to be involved.\u201dChristopher Shelton, national head of the Communications Workers of America, said the changes were inevitable, and he believed his people would go along with them.\u201cWe realized a long time ago that you can\u2019t fight technology change and win,\u201d he said. \u201cOur contracts spell out training programs and policies to make sure that members get training to update their skills as technology changes.\u201d Still, he thinks the expectations about home study after a hard day\u2019s work are too much.AT&T will reimburse up to $8,000 a year in tuition; the amount was raised just last month. The company claims that a year into the program, over half of the work force, mostly managers, has started training, sometimes with dozens of short online courses.\u201cPeople are going to have to work hard, but it\u2019s not insane,\u201d said William Blase, who oversees personnel for all of AT&T. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an expectation that your compensation will be tied to continuing to learn. We\u2019re at a crossroads as a business \u2014 and a country \u2014 where education has to keep up with technology.\u201dIf there is one thing on which Ms. Bell and Ms. Cunningham agree, albeit with different sentiments, it is that the change is necessary. Eventually phone calls, texts, sensor data and TV shows, along with much else, will all run on fiber-optic networks and be managed largely with software.Ms. Bell works with a lot of older colleagues. \u201cOne of my co-workers has been looking at the same database for 20 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds harsh, but if she doesn\u2019t adapt, there won\u2019t be room for her.\u201dThat message has not been lost on Jacobie Davis, an 18-year employee in Richardson, Tex., who works in tech support for older-style gear. At 39, he is the youngest person in his office, and is scrambling to study both new networks and data science. \u201cI try to put in 15 hours a week,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2020, my technology will be gone.\u201dIn some ways, cloud computing is not as radical a technology shift as all the puffy language suggests. Big banks of computers still run software, as they have been doing in many industries since the 1960s. They have more power, because their chips have more transistors that enable them to do more, and they connect to more things thanks to fiber-optic cable and wireless.The big difference is something called virtualization, which amounts to software that allows many machines to operate like one piece of computer hardware. This made it possible to run software that in effect interacted with other software instead of hardware. This, in turn, means the possibility of changing functions around rapidly by typing a few lines of code.The new systems also collect more data, quickly analyze information about what people and things are doing, and react. That is how online ads are personalized for you, and increasingly how maps reflect current traffic conditions, or streetlights adjust to suit parking congestion.Now what once took a year of analysis and deployment can instead happen in days, even minutes.These concepts can be tough in some reaches of AT&T, where lives and work have not changed all that much.In Dayton, Ohio, Kirk Warrenburg came out of a job in a bowling alley and started wiring cards for telegraph systems 40 years ago. Now he works on AT&T\u2019s signaling network, which makes sure billions of calls get through.He has taken 16 courses \u2014 Udacity courses and in-house \u201cnano courses,\u201d each about two weeks long \u2014 in the last year. He doesn\u2019t see himself changing jobs, however, because the old machines still need someone to care for them. Younger workers, he thinks, won\u2019t want to be in his dead end.\u201cWriting a telegraph circuit was like writing a recipe for a field technician,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of legacy systems are still around here. I\u2019ll be long gone before they will.\u201dSome other older employees besides Kevin Stephenson think the 2020 target will come and go, but basics won\u2019t change.The 2020 effort \u201cis just a start,\u201d said Kenny Williams, 64, a testing technician and the head of Ms. Cunningham\u2019s union local in Southern California. \u201cI\u2019ve inoculated my people against worrying. They need a fiber network for this that doesn\u2019t exist out here yet. Seventy percent of my folks are safe; the other 30 have to be found jobs, or they\u2019ll take the golden handshake\u201d and retire.As he sees it, much of the urgency comes from the threat of Google. In 2015 Google Fiber, Google\u2019s high-speed Internet service, caused AT&T to do something uncommon in its history: lower its prices because of competition. \u201cIn 40 years here I hadn\u2019t seen that,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cTheir people aren\u2019t in unions \u2014 we\u2019re a lot more on AT&T\u2019s side than theirs.\u201dWhat happens next at AT&T \u2014 and how fast that will happen \u2014 is a matter of disagreement in the Stephenson family.\u201cI go out to houses away from the cities, and there\u2019s not a lot of fiber there,\u201d Kevin said. Fiber would open the way for all that new technology. He takes comfort in looking at patches linemen did on fiber systems decades ago \u2014 from both the jury-rigged craftsmanship and the way they have endured.But Randall said his brother was not necessarily like the rest of the work force because there will always be hard, outdoor tasks for people like him. \u201cThere will be people turning screws and digging trenches. I\u2019ll be long gone before that is over. But other guys I know in Oklahoma will do a skills pivot\u201d with additional training, he said.Besides, it\u2019s not just about his brother. It\u2019s about most of the economy.\u201cEverybody is going to go face to face with a Google, an Amazon, a Netflix,\u201d he said. \u201cYou compete based on data, and based on customer insights you get with their permission. If we\u2019re wrong, it won\u2019t play well for anyone here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Troubled Dickstein Shapiro Law Firm to Merge With Blank Rome", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAfter several years of turbulence, including the indictment of J. Dennis Hastert, a former House speaker who led its public policy practice, the once-prominent Washington law firm Dickstein Shapiro is folding and becoming part of a larger Philadelphia firm, Blank Rome.Dickstein Shapiro has been buffeted in recent years as the legal economy has changed. Known particularly for its regulatory, litigation and intellectual property practices, the 53-year-old firm in its heyday had 400 lawyers with five offices, including one in New York. Its profit per partner \u2013 a public measure of the firm rankings by the publication The American Lawyer \u2013 was around $1 million as recently as 2014.But a year earlier, the firm\u2019s fortunes began to change when it lost 17 percent of its partners, including its insurance coverage practice group, to other firms. More recently, a major firm rainmaker, Barbara Van Gelder, left for another firm. She is one of Washington\u2019s more prominent female lawyers, representing a number of Bush-era officials.That occurred in the wake of the indictment of Mr. Hastert, 74, who joined the firm in 2013 to help rebuild its lobbying practice. In May 2015, Mr. Hastert, a former Illinois lawmaker, resigned from the firm after he was indicted on charges of violating federal mandatory banking reporting requirements by withdrawing cash in small amounts. The money was used for payments to conceal past questionable conduct.As Mr. Hastert\u2019s troubles unfurled publicly, the buildup of the firm\u2019s lobbying practice \u2013 part of a major revamping plan \u2014 slowed. That, together with firm defections, set the stage for Dickstein Shapiro\u2019s merger talks with Bryan Cave, a St. Louis firm, but those talks ended without a deal.Of those left at Dickstein, about 100 lawyers and staff will join Blank Rome, which has about 470 lawyers, the Philadelphia firm announced. The 70-year-old Blank Rome had $825,000 in profit per partner as of 2014, according to published figures.The combination, part of the consolidation trend in the legal world, will leave the newly formed firm \u2014 to keep the name Blank Rome \u2014 with more than 620 lawyers in 14 offices, including 150 lawyers in New York City, according to its announcement of the arrangement on Thursday.This is Blank Rome\u2019s biggest acquisition to date. Last year, it merged with a 24-lawyer Houston firm that specialized in maritime and litigation. The latest combination, which will have about 150 lawyers in its Washington office, tucks in Dickstein Shapiro\u2019s well-known government contracts group, which represents federal, state and local government contractors across a wide range of industries.Advertisement"}

It is unusual for Egyptian security services to target foreigners, and Egyptian authorities deny their security forces had anything to do with Mr. Regeni\u2019s torture and death. On Monday, Egypt\u2019s interior minister, Maj. Gen. Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, made an incredible claim: \u201cSuch crimes have never been attributed to the Egyptian security apparatus.\u201dIn addition to paranoia, Mr. Sisi\u2019s government is in a panic over the sorry state of Egypt\u2019s economy \u2014 hit hard by a drop in tourism \u2014 and fearful of the restlessness this could spark. Though Mr. Regeni\u2019s dissertation research focused on trade unions, a delicate topic in Egypt, friends and colleagues said he was careful in how he carried it out.The day he disappeared was the fifth anniversary of the 2011 uprising that brought down the government of President Hosni Mubarak. To make sure there would be no trouble, the police were out in force that day when Mr. Regeni left his home to attend a birthday party. It was the last anyone heard from him.Italy is counting on Egypt to help contain the Islamist threat in Libya, and Italy has strong commercial ties with Egypt as well. But Mr. Regeni\u2019s murder has profoundly shocked the Italian people and government. The foreign affairs minister, Paolo Gentiloni, vowed, \u201cWe want the truth to come out, every last bit of it.\u201dThe truth is, it is high time for all of Egypt\u2019s allies, including the United States, to make it clear to Mr. Sisi that the abuses he has encouraged to flourish can no longer be tolerated. Italy has sent a team of investigators to Egypt to assist in the investigation of Mr. Regeni\u2019s death. The Egyptian government must ensure that security forces cooperate fully and transparently.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Georgia Bill Shields Discrimination Against Gays", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe bill, which is on the verge of becoming law, would shield those who would refuse service not only to same-sex couples but to anyone they disapprove of, including interracial, interfaith or remarried couples.For instance, the bill would offer a blanket defense to a domestic-violence shelter that might reject a single mother and her child because of her marital status. Georgia has no state laws protecting gays and lesbians against discrimination in housing or employment, but even in Atlanta, which does have such protections, the bill would allow a hospital to prohibit a gay man from visiting his sick husband based on its religious views.The bill\u2019s backers say they are trying to protect religious freedom. But they know full well that the measure is nothing more than a legal shield for discrimination. Georgians are free to believe as they choose, and to say whatever they want to whomever they want about their views on marriage. But when they enter the public sphere, and particularly when they benefit from taxpayer dollars, they are not free to ignore any law that doesn\u2019t align with their personal religious views on marriage.If Georgia\u2019s House approves this bill, which would do immeasurable harm to the state\u2019s citizens and businesses, Gov.

{"Headline": "Can Health Care Providers Afford to Be Ready for Disaster?", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisDespite repeated calls for change, however, and billions of dollars in disaster-related costs for health care providers, federal rules do not require that critical medical institutions make even minimal preparations for major emergencies, from hurricanes, earthquakes and tornadoes to bioterrorist attacks and infectious epidemics such as Ebola and Zika.The federal health official overseeing preparedness and response, Dr. Nicole Lurie, an assistant secretary at Health and Human Services, said the proposed rule could help build overall health system resilience and save lives. \u201cBeing ready and able to withstand disaster can benefit individual health care facilities and the local economy and helps the community as a whole recover faster.\u201dThe proposed rule, however, appears stalled. Since Nov. 3, it has been parked at the Office of Management and Budget, undergoing a legally required review. A spokeswoman for the office said the 90-day review period had been extended.Part of the reason for the yearslong wait may lie in the critical reaction to the proposal from health care groups, which argued that certain provisions, including testing backup power generators more frequently for longer periods (they have failed often in emergencies), were too costly and unnecessary.In December, reviewers from the Office of Management and Budget discussed the rule with representatives of the American Health Care Association, which represents facilities that care for the elderly and disabled, and has challenged the cost estimates associated with the requirements.Medicare\u2019s calculations suggested a relatively modest impact: $8,000 on average for hospitals the year the rule takes effect and about $1,262 each year for skilled nursing facilities. But the association said that those figures were unrealistic because of factors like emergency overtime.Others who commented on the proposal said they feared that the rules would be particularly burdensome for smaller facilities that have traditionally not been involved in emergency preparedness. \u201cEach organization can only do so much based on their resources,\u201d Mark Covall, president and chief executive of the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, said in an interview.Mr. Schmitt said those resisting regulation were shortsighted. \u201cIt\u2019s saying, \u2018Look, if you want to care for the more vulnerable populations in America and you want to bill for these services, we\u2019re just saying meet some minimum standards.\u2019 \u201dBut girding for emergencies often seems to fall off the map as a disaster recedes. More than 45 years after the Sylmar earthquake killed dozens at California hospitals, for example, more than 250 hospital buildings rated most at risk of collapsing and endangering the public have yet to be retrofitted, replaced or removed from service. \u201cIf I never have a disaster and you make me invest, say, $100,000 or $500,000 in preparedness, I\u2019ve lost revenue,\u201d said Dr. David Marcozzi, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \u201cHowever, for the facility that is impacted and is able to continue treating patients, the return on investment is different. Tell me, how do you do a budget analysis on that?\u201dDr. Marcozzi, a former director of the National Healthcare Preparedness Programs at Health and Human Services, recently left a position at Medicare, where he contributed expert advice to the group working on the rule. They were considering scaling back or revising it \u201cto accommodate a lot of the stakeholders,\u201d he said.The rule has a statutory deadline of three years from proposal to publication, and if it is approved, much of its strength will depend on how it is interpreted and enforced. \u201cIf this has political will, which unfortunately it hasn\u2019t historically, it will get across the goal line,\u201d Dr. Marcozzi said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, and other things encumber it, this will not get to final.\u201dSheri Fink is a New York Times correspondent and the author of \u201cFive Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conflicting Economic Indicators Challenge Fed\u2019s Policy Makers", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 The contrast between the improving health of the labor market and the weakness of other economic indicators poses a challenging quandary for the Federal Reserve.But the Fed would be betting on a theory. Inflation remains low, growth has slowed and the impact of global economic problems and financial market volatility is unclear. If the Fed presses ahead, it could undermine the economy just as things are getting good for the vast majority of Americans.She will speak publicly for the first time since then on Wednesday when she testifies before the House Financial Services Committee. In the intervening two months, the economic outlook has deteriorated. Financial conditions have tightened and the dollar has gained strength, weighing on American exporters and delaying any rebound in inflation.The January jobs report, however, reflects considerable strength in other parts of the economy. Stronger wage growth is particularly likely to grab the Fed\u2019s attention, suggesting that employers are finally being forced to compete for workers by raising pay. In a high-profile example, Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, has said that it plans to increase hourly pay rates for most of its employees later this month.The Fed is less likely to worry about the slower pace of job creation in January, as officials have predicted that slower population growth would weigh on job creation. In keeping with those expectations, the unemployment rate still fell to 4.9 percent.One reason the Fed is focused on job growth is that it may be a more accurate reflection of the strength of the underlying economy. In the fourth quarter of 2015, for example, the government estimated the economy added 279,000 jobs a month, but that output increased at a rate of just 0.7 percent.One wing of the Fed sees an undiminished case for raising rates.She also played down concerns about the economic impact of recent market volatility. \u201cWhile taking a signal from such volatility is warranted,\u201d she said, \u201cmonetary policy cannot respond to every blip in financial markets.\u201dLoretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and another voter, said on Thursday in New York that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to change her economic outlook.Other Fed officials, however, say the volatility has given them pause.William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a close adviser to Ms. Yellen, said in an interview with Market News International this week that he was worried about the economic impact of jittery markets.\u201cIf those financial conditions were to remain in place by the time we get to the March meeting, we would have to take that into consideration in terms of that monetary policy decision,\u201d Mr. Dudley said.And Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been particularly outspoken in warning that global pressures will weigh on domestic growth, told The Wall Street Journal this week that \u201crecent developments reinforce the case for watchful waiting.\u201dInvestors, oddly, have walked away from this debate feeling confident that the Fed will not raise rates in March. Indeed, asset prices tied to expectations about the future level of short-term interest imply only about a 50 percent chance of any rate increase this year.That contrasts sharply with the Fed\u2019s own prediction in December that it planned to raise rates by about one percentage point in 2016, most likely in four discrete steps.Many analysts have taken a more measured position, predicting that the Fed is less likely to move in March, but that it will still raise rates two or three times this year.Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said on Friday he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, instead of three times, and to start in June, instead of March.Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the continuation of low inflation probably meant Fed policy makers would hesitate at their next session.\u201cWere the meeting held tomorrow, we still think the Fed would stay on hold \u2014 primarily because of concerns about inflation and inflation expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it would be an uncomfortable hold.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anxious for Re-Election, Senator Richard Shelby Refuses to Act on Banking Nominations", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Senate banking committee convened earlier this month to listen to testimony from Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, all but dusted off the chairs and shook moths from the curtains.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see everyone back in this hearing room,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThis is our first gathering since October. Welcome back.\u201dTo avoid the sort of controversy that can animate primary voters on March 1, Mr. Shelby has stalled the work of the committee in the name of an increasingly familiar Republican tactic \u2014 failing to approve President Obama\u2019s nominees. He now has the distinction of running the only committee in the Senate that has not acted on a single nominee in this Congress.As a result, Mr. Shelby has interfered with economic sanctions and hampered the work of the Export-Import Bank and the Federal Reserve. The committee\u2019s work spans a number of policy areas, and so do the officials it approves. Or in this case, fails to approve.\u201cMy primary is Tuesday!\u201d Mr. Shelby said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cWe can talk about this later!\u201dBut as of now, the members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is short two members \u2014 meaning interest rate decisions are being made without a full team \u2014 as is the board of the Export-Import Bank, which means the bank, lacking a quorum, cannot authorize loans over $10 million.Since 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.More urgently, Democrats say, is the lack of approval of Adam J. Szubin, the acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury Department, even as Mr. Szubin oversees Treasury sanctions that target some 6,000 people and institutions.Therese McMillan, the acting administrator of the Federal Transit Administration, has been waiting for approval by the committee since 2014, even though there is an array of safety measures that need action.All told, 16 men and women are waiting for the committee to act. Other nominees have withdrawn.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cClearly this has had impact on people\u2019s lives.\u201dAlthough Treasury officials and congressional Democrats say that Mr. Szubin is not hampered in his job, they say the lack of approval from Congress sends an awkward message to the countries and partners he works with.Companies that rely on the Export-Import Bank \u2014 which was in the cross hairs of Republicans last year \u2014 say the inability to access big loans is a problem. \u201cIt is no secret having a quorum is critical to staying competitive in the global economy,\u201d said Kate Bernard, a spokeswoman for Boeing.The Democrats on the committee sent a starchy letter to Mr. Shelby this week noting, \u201cFor more than a year, the committee has failed to carry out one of its basic duties.\u201d\u201cIt has been five years,\u201d Mr. Shelby said in the interview on Tuesday.Republican primary voters are not fans of the Export-Import Bank, the Fed and Mr. Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran.

Few Republicans tried to challenge him with primaries, largely because of his connections and daunting resources, culled mostly from financial services companies and Wall Street. Mr. Shelby began the year with $17 million in the bank, 90 percent of it raised outside Alabama.This time around, Mr. Shelby has a handful of primary opponents, most notably Jonathan McConnell, an Iraq war veteran and entrepreneur whose central campaign theme is that Mr. Shelby is \u201ctoo old he and he needs to come home.\u201dBut Mr. McConnell, who was a Marine and now runs a ship security company, says his message about Mr. Shelby\u2019s need to come home has resonated around Alabama, even as he concedes he is dwarfed by Mr. Shelby\u2019s war chest.Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserves Dwindling Rapidly", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 As markets around the world have churned, China has long taken comfort in having what in the financial world amounts to a life preserver: its vast holdings of other countries\u2019 money.A year and a half ago, China held as much as $4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. The reserves represented a symbolic trophy for China\u2019s leaders, who have described them as the \u201cblood and sweat\u201d of the workers and upheld them as a sign of national strength.Now, as China\u2019s economic growth slows, that sign of national strength is ebbing.China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are shrinking steadily as money flows out of the country, and Beijing moves to shore up its currency.The country\u2019s reserves have shrunk by nearly a fifth since the summer of 2014 \u2014 and more than a third of the shrinkage has been in the last three months.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.By the end of January, reserves stood at $3.23 trillion, a level that has prompted speculation about how much lower Beijing will let them go.With a smaller pot of reserves, Chinese leaders have less room to maneuver, should the economy undergo a sudden shock. The reserves situation also weakens China\u2019s control over the value of its currency, the renminbi.The drop in reserves could also hurt China\u2019s efforts to raise its global profile, as it doesn\u2019t have as much money to pump into major projects in developing countries.\u201cIf you use up $700 billion of reserves, how much more is going to follow? That is the basic problem,\u201d said Guntram Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a nonprofit economic research institute in Brussels.The dwindling reserves are one of the many factors shaking global investor confidence because of the impact the slide could have on China\u2019s financial system. A number of investors are now betting that China may have to let its currency depreciate, rather than dip further into its reserves.China\u2019s reserve hoard is a byproduct of the way it manages its currency.During China\u2019s biggest boom years, its currency could have risen in value as huge sums in dollars, euros and yen flowed into the country. Instead, Beijing tightly controlled the value of the renminbi, buying up much of the inflows and putting them into its reserves instead. That brought angry accusations from the United States and Europe that it was manipulating its currency to help keep Chinese exports inexpensive and competitive in foreign countries.Now that the renminbi faces pressure to fall, China is spending its reserves in an effort to prop up the currency. But many American lawmakers and presidential candidates still accuse China of keeping its currency artificially weak.The reserves are still considerable, more than double Japan\u2019s, which has the world\u2019s second-largest amount. The central bank chief, Mr. Zhou, and others have questioned whether the reserves are too big and the money could be better invested if left in the private sector. Mr. Zhou led a move over the last two years to make it easier for Chinese companies and families to invest their own money overseas, only to find in recent months that the outflows have been disconcertingly fast at times.China has taken steps to stem further flows out of the country. This winter the Chinese authorities arrested the leaders of underground banks that were converting billions of renminbi into dollars and euros. They also made it harder for Chinese citizens to use their renminbi to buy insurance policies in dollars.More quietly, Beijing bank regulators have halted sales within China of investment funds known as wealth management products that are denominated in dollars.Beijing has also instructed bank branches in Hong Kong to limit their lending of renminbi to make it harder for traders and investors to place bets against the Chinese currency in financial markets.\u201cWe did receive notice from Beijing in the earlier part of January to be more stringent in approving renminbi-denominated loans,\u201d said a Hong Kong-based China bank executive, who insisted on anonymity for fear of employer retaliation. \u201cIt is no fun being caught in the middle, with marketing officers wanting to do more business and the higher-ups telling you to be tougher when reviewing credit proposals.\u201dThe erosion of reserves is also politically awkward, given public perception, and Beijing has taken steps aimed directly at shoring them up.One move would keep more of its reserves free of long-term commitments. China\u2019s central bank now demands that at least some foreign money managers who want to invest part of the reserves pledge to achieve an annual return of as much as 26 percent or else their management fees will be reduced, said a person with knowledge of China\u2019s foreign reserves who insisted on anonymity to avoid retaliation.Chinese markets rose this week, as some investors bet that China could slow the erosion. Expectations have faded that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates this year, making China look more attractive. And China is running huge trade surpluses, bringing in a steady inflow of foreign money.Economists inside and outside China are increasingly trying to guess how far reserves must fall before China might consider a sharp devaluation of the currency. An International Monetary Fund model suggests that an economy of China\u2019s size needs $1.5 trillion with strict capital controls and $2.7 trillion without them.Brad Setser, a former United States Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China could manage with smaller reserves because the model exaggerates the need for reserves in a country like China with very large domestic banking deposits.Longer term, China looks less likely to commit its reserves to big projects that build up its image abroad, said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese finance at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cWhen you\u2019re losing $100 billion a month, you can\u2019t afford to invest in a highway in the middle of nowhere or a railway in Pakistan that could be blown up,\u201d he said.Last month, Mr. Xi announced yet another fund for additional infrastructure projects in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Its total: just $50 million, barely enough to build a few roads in a single impoverished country.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Congressional Republicans Balk at Obama\u2019s Budget, Sight Unseen", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama sends Congress his eighth and last annual budget proposal on Tuesday, a lame-duck executive\u2019s accounting of national priorities that Republican leaders have branded sight unseen: dead before arrival.But some new ideas that the administration previewed in recent weeks, including on cancer research, opioid abuse and military projects, could have more life than Republicans care to admit. A $10-a-barrel oil tax for infrastructure and clean transportation projects\u00a0is certain to be too much for conservatives, but administration officials said some initiatives would prevail in some form. Congressional Republicans went to new lengths to extinguish any such expectations. Breaking with a 41-year-old tradition, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees announced that they would not even give the president\u2019s budget director, Shaun Donovan, the usual hearings in their panels this week.G. William Hoagland, who was the Republican staff director at the Senate Budget Committee for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and is senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said he could not recall a year since the modern budget process took effect in the 1970s when a president\u2019s budget director was not invited to testify before the budget committees.\u201cWhile the last budget of an outgoing president is usually aspirational, and sets a theme for what he or she hopes will be followed up by his or her successor, it nonetheless should be reviewed by the Congress,\u201d Mr. Hoagland said.On Monday, 14 Democrats on the House Budget Committee signed a letter calling the snub \u201cdisrespectful to the committee members, the public and the president.\u201d And like Mr. Hoagland, other Republicans criticized the decision, which injects partisan toxicity early in a year of election pressures. \u201cI believe that permitting the administration the courtesy of explaining its intent and what it thinks of the policy should have been maintained,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and an economic adviser to Republicans. Besides, he added, \u201cit gives you an opportunity to express why you disagree.\u201dThe rebuff of Mr. Donovan was at odds with the civility that Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin has sought, going back to his time as House Budget Committee chairman. A senior adviser to Mr. Ryan, Brendan Buck, said the speaker was informed before his committee successor, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, issued the statement with his Senate counterpart, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, indicating Mr. Donovan was unwelcome.\u201cThis was a decision made by the budget committee, but we support the chairman,\u201d Mr. Buck said.Mr. Price and Mr. Enzi said in their statement, \u201cRather than spend time on a proposal that, if anything like this administration\u2019s previous budgets, will double down on the same failed policies that have led to the worst economic recovery in modern times, Congress should continue our work on building a budget that balances and that will foster a healthy economy.\u201dBut some of the president\u2019s spending priorities are shared by key Republicans, including senators seeking re-election in swing states. Those include $1 billion to research cures for cancer and another $1 billion over two years to expand treatment for people addicted to prescription opioids or heroin. When Mr. Obama took office in 2009, the country was in a recession and running the first annual deficit exceeding $1 trillion, and unemployment reached 10 percent.Mr. Obama\u2019s budget once again will emphasize domestic programs, recycling initiatives that he would offset with increased taxes from the wealthy and some corporations.New ideas he has previewed include:\u25a0 A state-based system of wage insurance to replace up to half of workers\u2019 wages if they lose a job or are forced to take lower-paying employment.\u25a0 A $2 billion pilot program testing state and local innovations for aiding families in distress, for example because of job loss, serious illness or substance abuse.\u25a0 Expanded options for tax-favored retirement savings for workers at small businesses.\u25a0 $12 billion over 10 years to expand food benefits for poor children in the summer, when they do not receive free or subsidized school meals.\u25a0 A reduced version of the so-called Cadillac tax on employer-provided insurance plans, which was designed to control health spending but proved highly unpopular with unions and both parties.Advertisement"}

But there was someone else on stage helping her here on Sunday night, in spirit, at least.Bill.Mrs. Clinton referenced her husband, Bill Clinton, by his first name only, in his home state, repeatedly. Rather than the usual biographical video that plays at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s events, the former president from \u201ca place called Hope\u201d in Arkansas starred in a video that introduced Mrs. Clinton as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cchange maker\u00e2\u0080\u009d who put the water crisis in Flint, Mich., on the map and helped children from the early years of her career.When Mrs. Clinton took the stage in the crowded atrium of an auditorium at the University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, she repeatedly started sentences with \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d a name that still goes a long way in this state where he served as governor before becoming the first Arkansan in the White House.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBack in the early 1990s when Bill got into the White House\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said as she reminded the largely black audience that the precursor to President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Affordable Car Act was \u201cHillarycare,\u201d her failed effort to overhaul the health care system.\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou heard Bill talk about a program I brought to Arkansas\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, explaining an early childhood education program she put into effect as the first lady of this state.And, at a time in the campaign when parts of Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy, including the 1994 crime bill and an overhaul of the welfare system, have come under criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters, Mrs. Clinton recited the economic successes of the Clinton Administration, including the 23 million new jobs created and the millions of Americans lifted out of poverty. The Republican candidates, she said are \u201cselling the same snake oil: trickle down economics\u201d that reversed Mr. Clinton\u2019s economic achievements.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important to me that you all know, Arkansas runs deep in me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had 18 wonderful years in the state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am so grateful and so proud to have Arkansas connections and I will do whatever I can as president to be a good partner to this state.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMrs. Clinton holds a home state advantage against Mr. Sanders in the Democratic contest in Arkansas on Tuesday, but the state, where Democrats got trounced in the 2014 midterm elections despite Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best efforts, will almost surely be a Republican stronghold in the general election.Nevertheless, Mrs. Clinton used the opportunity in the final days before Super Tuesday to argue a Republican president would wreck the economy, dismantle Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature achievements, and make the country less safe \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fighting words in a state where conservative radio dominates and Donald J. Trump has drawn enthusiastic crowds.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the leading Republican candidate, in his long line of insulting all kinds of people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Clinton said, without explicitly mentioning Mr. Trump, \u201cthat makes the job harder.\u201d\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only offensive, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dangerous because we have to build bridges in order to get people to work with us to defeat ISIS and the other terrorist networks.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEarlier on Sunday, at a stop at a coffee shop in Nashville, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Trump\u2019s initial refusal to disavow the white supremacist David Duke \u201cpathetic.\u201dThe Clintons maintain an apartment overlooking the Arkansas River on the top of the William J.

{"Headline": "Romer and Romer on Friedman", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "The main points are things I was aware of \u2014 especially the second point \u2014 but are now laid out in full:Unfortunately, careful examination of Friedman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work confirms the old adage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif something seems too good to be true, it probably is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We identify three fundamental problems in Friedman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analysis.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 First, all the effects of Senator Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies that he identifies are assumed to come through their impact on demand. However, his estimates of those demand effects are far too large to be credible\u00e2\u0080\u0094even given Friedman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own assumptions.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Second, in assuming that demand stimulus can raise output 37% over the next 10 years relative to the Congressional Budget Office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s baseline forecast, Friedman is implicitly assuming that the U.S. economy is (and will continue to be for a long time) dramatically below its productive capacity. However, while some output gap likely still exists, the plausible range for the output gap is much too small to accommodate demand effects nearly as large as Friedman finds. As a result, capacity constraints would likely lead to inflation and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates long before such high growth rates were realized.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Third, a realistic examination of the impact of the Sanders policies on the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s productive capacity suggests those effects are likely to be small at best, and possibly even negative.But it gets worse. For example,Thus, Friedman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figures for the effect of additional government spending exceed conventional ones by at least a factor of four. He offers no evidence for such effects. Indeed, his estimates appear inconsistent with his own assumptions: he assumes that rise in government spending of $1 would typically raise real output by slightly less than a dollar (Friedman, p. 47).Oh, dear. I have no beef with Mr. Friedman; the campaign staff who evidently had no idea that the numbers were wildly implausible, and responded to criticism by attacking the critics\u2019 motives, are another matter. But I hope we can now stop talking about this.Two parting observations, however:First, aren\u2019t you glad not to see a candidate leading with his chin this way in the general election?Second, this is an object lesson in the dangers of believing something because it\u2019s what you want to hear. And that\u2019s a lesson that applies to a lot more than economic growth projections.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Deals Blow to Obama\u2019s Efforts to Regulate Coal Emissions", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byBut the Supreme Court\u2019s willingness to issue a stay while the case proceeds was an early hint that the program could face a skeptical reception from the justices.The 5-to-4 vote, with the court\u2019s four liberal members dissenting, was unprecedented \u2014 the Supreme Court had never before granted a request to halt a regulation before review by a federal appeals court.\u201cIt\u2019s a stunning development,\u201d Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor and former environmental legal counsel to the Obama administration, said in an email. She added that \u201cthe order certainly indicates a high degree of initial judicial skepticism from five justices on the court,\u201d and that the ruling would raise serious questions from nations that signed on to the landmark Paris climate change pact in December.The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.In negotiating that deal, which requires every country to enact policies to lower emissions, Mr. Obama pointed to the power plant rule as evidence that the United States would take ambitious action, and that other countries should follow.The White House said in a statement that it disagreed with the court\u2019s decision and remained confident that it would ultimately prevail. \u201cThe administration will continue to take aggressive steps to make forward progress to reduce carbon emissions,\u201d it said.Opponents of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate policy called the court\u2019s action historic.\u201cWe are thrilled that the Supreme Court realized the rule\u2019s immediate impact and froze its implementation, protecting workers and saving countless dollars as our fight against its legality continues,\u201d said Patrick Morrisey, the attorney general of West Virginia, which has led the 29-state legal challenge.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who are celebrating,\u201d said Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer with Bracewell & Giuliani, a firm representing energy companies, which are party to the lawsuit. \u201cIt sends a pretty strong signal that ultimately it\u2019s pretty likely to be invalidated.\u201d\u201cClimate change is the most significant environmental challenge of our day, and it is already affecting national public health, welfare and the environment,\u201d Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. wrote in a brief urging the Supreme Court to reject a request for a stay while the case moves forward.The regulation calls for states to submit compliance plans by September, though they may seek a two-year extension. The first deadline for power plants to reduce their emissions is in 2022, with full compliance not required until 2030.The states challenging the regulation, led mostly by Republicans and many with economies that rely on coal mining or coal-fired power, sued to stop what they called \u201cthe most far-reaching and burdensome rule the E.P.A. has ever forced onto the states.\u201dA three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January unanimously refused to grant a stay. The court did expedite the case and will hear arguments on June 2, which is fast by the standards of complex litigation.The states urged the Supreme Court to take immediate action to block what they called a \u201cpower grab\u201d under which \u201cthe federal environmental regulator seeks to reorganize the energy grids in nearly every state in the nation.\u201d Though the first emission reduction obligations do not take effect until 2022, the states said they had already started to spend money and shift resources.In a second filing seeking a stay, coal companies and trade associations represented by Laurence H. Tribe, a law professor at Harvard, said the court should act to stop a \u201ctargeted attack on the coal industry\u201d that will \u201cartificially eliminate buyers of coal, forcing the coal industry to curtail production, idle operations, lay off workers and close mines.\u201dThe E.P.A., represented by Mr. Verrilli, called the requests for a stay \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented.\u201d The states challenging the administration\u2019s plan, he said, could point to no case in which the Supreme Court had \u201cgranted a stay of a generally applicable regulation pending initial judicial review in the court of appeals.\u201d In a later brief, the states conceded that point.Mr. Verrilli said judicial review of the plan, including by the Supreme Court, will be complete before the first deadline for emissions reductions in 2022.\u201cThere is no reason to suppose that states\u2019 duties under the rule will be especially onerous,\u201d Mr. Verrilli wrote. \u201cA state can elect not to prepare a plan at all, but instead may allow E.P.A. to develop and implement a federal plan for sources in that state.\u201dThe two sides differed about whether current declines in coal mining and coal-fired power generation are attributable to the administration\u2019s plan. \u201cSome of the nation\u2019s largest coal companies have declared bankruptcy, due in no small part to the rule,\u201d a group of utilities told the justices.A coalition of environmental groups and companies that produce and rely on wind and solar power said other factors were to blame for coal\u2019s decline.\u201cThese changes include the abundant supply of relatively inexpensive natural gas, the increasing cost-competitiveness of electricity from renewable generation sources such as solar and wind power, the deployment of low-cost energy efficiency and other demand-side measures, and increasing consumer demand for advanced energy,\u201d they wrote.Advertisement"}

The company is among the many big producers of commodities that has been hit by lower demand from the slowing global economy. But ArcelorMittal is taking pains to lay blame on China.ArcelorMittal said its loss \u2014 including a $6.7 billion retreat in the fourth quarter last year \u2014 was mainly down to falling steel prices that were depressed by a surge of Chinese exports, and to write-offs in the company\u2019s large mining business. In the fourth quarter of 2014, ArcelorMittal lost $955 million.China\u2019s economic slowdown is upsetting the calculus of just about all commodity producers, including steel makers, but with a twist.Rather than importing steel, China has ramped up its own capacity, which now accounts for about half of all global production of raw steel. With the Chinese economy slowing and domestic producers reluctant to cut production, the remedy so far has been to unleash exports that undercut rivals around the world.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Lakshmi N. Mittal, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive, called the results \u201crather sobering\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201dIn an indication of continuing difficult conditions, Mr. Mittal also forecast that his company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a widely cited financial metric, would be \u201cin excess\u201d of $4.5 billion in 2016, compared with $5.2 billion in 2015.With a steady decline in the company\u2019s share price lately, ArcelorMittal\u2019s stock market value is now about 6.3 billion, or $6.8 billion \u2014 less than one-quarter of the nearly \u20ac27 billion that Mittal Steel agreed to pay for Arcelor after a bruising takeover battle in 2006.During a call with reporters on Friday, Aditya Mittal, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said that the Chinese makers had been \u201cexporting at aggressive levels in 2015; this has caused prices to drop in all of our key markets.\u201dPrices of one important type of steel exported by the Chinese, hot-rolled coil, which is used in automobiles and other manufacturing, fell by about 40 percent in 2015.Aditya Mittal, who is Lakshmi Mittal\u2019s son, said the industry was pursuing trade actions against Chinese exports in both the United States and in Europe, although he said that Europe was less effective in protecting its producers from dumping.\u201cClearly the trade defense instruments that have been developed in the U.S. are better,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cThey insure a fairer, level playing field.\u201dIn addition, Aditya Mittal painted a picture of relatively weak demand for steel this year, with only the market in the United States showing growth. He said that growth in European demand would be weaker this year than last, and that Brazil, a major market for ArcelorMittal, and China would continue to show declines. He added, however, that there were still pockets of strength for the company\u2019s products, including in the automobile industry.The combination of reduced prices and a weakening world economy played havoc with ArcelorMittal\u2019s annual and quarterly results on Friday. The company said it lost $7.9 billion in 2015, compared with a $1.1 billion loss in 2014. Revenue fell about 20 percent last year to about $64 billion.ArcelorMittal, which is based in Luxembourg, has a global reach, but that did not help much toward the end of last year. The company said it had suffered fourth-quarter operating losses in its steel-making units in each of its major markets, including Europe, North America and Brazil.The company is also being hurt by previous investments it has made in mining. Those ventures are turning sour because of declining prices for iron ore and coal, both tied to falling demand in China. ArcelorMittal\u2019s mining unit reported a $3.5 billion operating loss for 2015, compared with a $565 million profit a year earlier. The company also wrote off $3.4 billion on mines, primarily in Liberia and the United States, as lower prices resulted in a revision of its commercial forecasts.Aditya Mittal did predict that late 2015 would prove to have been the most difficult period for the industry in terms of the pressure from Chinese exports, noting that steel prices in China had risen recently.He added, however, that ArcelorMittal thought it prudent to raise new capital to offset debt.ArcelorMittal also said it would sell its 35 percent stake in Gestamp Automoci\u00f3n, a Spanish maker of car components, for 875 million euros, or about $975 million.The sale and the rights issue were expected to reduce ArcelorMittal\u2019s debt to less than $12 billion.ArcelorMittal published its earnings a week ahead of schedule to coincide with the announcement of the plan to raise additional capital.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Francis\u2019s Visit to Mexico Comes as Country Struggles With Many Ills", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 For more than a century, the Mexican government has treated the Catholic Church with a deep suspicion, if not outright hostility. Battles have literally been fought between church and state, while anticlerical laws stayed on the books until just a couple of decades ago.To welcome the pope when he arrives on Friday night, the first lady produced a song in his honor. For the first time, the president will welcome a pope in the National Palace. Francis will receive a key to Mexico City, which placed a giant billboard along the airport highway that perhaps most accurately sums up the sentiment: \u201cPope Francis, Mexico City is your home.\u201d\u201cThe Mexico of drug trafficking, the Mexico of the cartels, is not the Mexico that our mother loves,\u201d Francis said last week, alluding to the Virgin Mary. \u201cI would urge you to fight, day by day, against corruption, against trafficking, against war, against disunity, against organized crime, against human trafficking.\u201dFew doubt that Francis will receive anything less than an ecstatic reception across Mexico, but his six-day visit here is hardly free of risk for him, either. Mexico is a veritable canvas on which Francis can play to his strengths, providing the full menu of themes central to his papacy.But as the first Latin American pope, he faces public expectations that somehow his visit might stir change, and he will have to navigate the dangers of appearing too close to a government marked by public mistrust.\u201cHe begins the year with great prestige but certainly 2016 and 2017 will be a watershed in his papacy,\u201d said Marco Politi, a Vatican analyst in Rome and the author of \u201cPope Francis Among the Wolves.\u201d \u201cThere is a great, great part of the hierarchy, and the bishops, who are not sharing his views about family.\u201dSome of this tension, including the pope\u2019s indelible focus on the poor, exists right here in Mexico.\u201cWhen Pope Francis urges the Church to be more courageous, to have much more of an evangelical attitude, one of sensitivity and solidarity with the poorest sectors of society, the Mexican hierarchy feels very uncomfortable,\u201d said Bernardo Barranco, a sociologist in Mexico who specializes in religion. \u201cIt breaks the comfort zone they have grown so accustomed to.\u201dThe pope\u2019s itinerary spans many of the social and geographic divides that define Mexico. He will visit the nation\u2019s poorest region, Chiapas, to underscore the plight of indigenous communities and their place in the Roman Catholic Church. In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso, Tex., he will express his solidarity with migrants and implicitly criticize American immigration policy. He will visit slums and the violence-wracked state of Michoac\u00e1n, where he will most likely expand his critique of poverty, corruption and drug cartels.Today, roughly 84 percent of Mexicans identify themselves as Catholic. The Mexican state was fiercely secular for much of the last century, with a litany of anticlerical statutes, including prohibitions against land ownership by the church. Most of those statutes have since been repealed, and Pope John Paul II played a critical role in building closer ties to the government. His statue now rises beside the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City.But historians say that only recently has the Mexican church sought to more overtly engage with the problems of society \u2014 and to do so with the blessing of the government.\u201cThe expectation of persecution has inhibited lots of outward efforts by the church over the years,\u201d said Jorge Eugenio Traslosheros Hern\u00e1ndez, a history professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who has studied Mexican Catholicism. \u201cThat is changing, and now the pope comes and hopefully he can help catalyze change. Without the participation of every citizen in Mexico, we will never fix this crisis.\u201dMany ordinary Mexicans are deeply frustrated with the government, with crime and violence features of daily life and the economy cleaved by inequality. Corruption from the top levels of government down to the police on the streets has engendered deep public cynicism. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto is suffering from the worst poll ratings in the last quarter century, and many people hope Francis will publicly rebuke the government.The editorial added: \u201cWe Mexicans, we want peace, and we need the truth, not the numerical bureaucracy. Mission has not been accomplished.\u201d That last line was an explicit reference to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s remark after Mexican security forces captured Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the infamous drug cartel leader known as El Chapo.\u201cThe pope is not going to go and rebuke anyone,\u201d said the Rev. Armando Flores Navarro, rector of the Mexican College in Rome, which houses visiting Mexican priests.Francis has expressed great interest in visiting the most famous symbol of Mexican Catholicism, the shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe. In his remarks to the Mexican news agency, Francis said he was coming to Mexico \u201cas a pilgrim\u201d and would \u201clook at the Mexican people to give something to me.\u201d Then, wryly, he added: \u201cStay calm. I will not pass around the little basket but rather I will seek the wealth of faith you have.\u201dYet beyond faith, the consensus is that Mexico\u2019s ills represent a problem that Pope Francis is uniquely qualified to address.\u201cThis trip suits him like a ring to a finger,\u201d said Luis Barrera, a Catholic priest and member of the Mexican Episcopal Conference, the leadership organization of the country\u2019s Catholic Church. \u201cHere he will see poverty, inequality, immigration, ethnic minorities, violence \u2014 things he has seen separately in his many trips around the world.\u201cHere, he will find everything.\u201dAzam Ahmed and Paulina Villegas reported from Mexico City, and Jim Yardley from Rome.

{"Headline": "Uncovering the Bad Math (or Logic) of an Economic Analysis Embraced by Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceUntil now.Their excavation uncovered one crucial but buried tidbit, and it\u2019s basically the whole shebang.But first, some background. Most economists believe that temporary increases in government spending will yield temporary increases in output. To see why the effect of stimulus is temporary, realize that if raising government spending raises output, then because the end of a stimulus program means cutting government spending, the same forces are later set in motion, but in reverse. And so in the standard story, a temporary stimulus improves the economy, but only temporarily.Here\u2019s the problem: Mr. Friedman\u2019s calculations assume that removing a stimulus has no effect. The result is that temporary stimulus has a permanent effect.The same levels-versus-changes confusion leads Mr. Friedman\u2019s calculations to show that a permanent increase in the level of government spending \u2014 like that proposed by Senator Sanders \u2014 will yield a permanent rise in the rate of change of output. This is the reason he finds that the Sanders plan has such enormous effects on economic growth.The problem is that conventional analyses link changes in government spending to the changes in output, not to its long-term level as in Mr. Friedman\u2019s analysis. Effectively Mr. Friedman is arguing that boosting government spending boosts the economy, but cutting government spending as the stimulus program ends has no effect. For all of the detail spelled out over 53 pages and 97 footnotes, this one critical assumption is never mentioned.Here\u2019s why this matters. Mr. Friedman claims to \u201cmake a conservative estimate of the stimulative effect of the Sanders program by using a relatively low spending multiplier.\u201dThe multiplier is a number that quantifies how strongly government spending influences output. He relies on the Congressional Budget Office for estimates of the multiplier, and shades them a little, which makes them appear conservative. The multiplier he uses is on average 0.89. In the Congressional Budget Office models that he\u2019s drawing from, this means that if the government spends $100 more today, output will rise by $89 this year, but when that stimulus is withdrawn next year, output will then fall back to its earlier level.From start to finish, that $100 extra government spending yields $89 worth of more stuff. By contrast, in Mr. Friedman\u2019s figures, output stays $89 higher each year, forever. Over a 10-year period, this means that $100 of government spending yields a total of $890 worth of more stuff, implying a 10-year multiplier of 8.9.This is not a conservative estimate; it\u2019s so high that I know of no study that suggests such large effects, nor of any economist who would defend this view. This is why Ms. and Mr. Romer say that Mr. Friedman\u2019s \u201cestimates of the likely demand effects are dramatically higher than standard approaches imply,\u201d and that his estimates are \u201cnot just implausibly large, but literally incredible.\u201dWhen I pointed Mr. Friedman to this critique of his analysis, he simultaneously accepted and rejected it.He accepted it, telling me that \u201cI may have made a mistake.\u201dWhen I pressed Mr. Friedman on whether he was right to conclude that standard assumptions suggest that Mr. Sanders\u2019s economic program will have such large effects, he said, \u201cI have to stop saying \u2018standard.\u2019 \u201d It became apparent in our conversation that he simply hadn\u2019t realized that he had mischaracterized mainstream economics, leading him to describe his disagreement with Ms. and Mr. Romer as \u201ca measure of my ignorance of modern macro, and my disagreements with modern macro.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Am Not a Kook", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorMultiple choice: Which 2016 presidential candidate should this voter support?Easy \u2014 this red-state rube can take her pick. But it gets trickier.She is also pro-choice and endorses same-sex marriage. She opposes school prayer. She is outraged about abuse of police powers, particularly in black communities. She disapproves of farm subsidies and other congressional backhanders to big business. She abhors widespread state surveillance of Americans\u2019 emails and phone calls. She would decriminalize assisted suicide, prostitution and not only marijuana but all drugs. She believes anyone should be free to publish visual depictions of Mohammed. While a feminist, she wouldn\u2019t restrict pornography, however grossly misogynistic. She is skeptical of foreign military interventions, most of which, during her lifetime, don\u2019t seem to have resulted in any real net gain for the United States.If you guessed Rand Paul, that Kentucky senator may minimally approximate this voter\u2019s positions, save for the fact that, as of last week, Rand Paul has left the building. No loss, if for our prototype, as for many American women, Mr. Paul\u2019s anti-abortion stance crosses a red line. Which it does. For no surprise \u2014 \u201cshe\u201d is I.The mainstream of neither the Democratic nor the Republican Party (insofar as it has a mainstream anymore) represents my views, which qualify as left-wing or right-wing only on the basis of \u201ceeny meeny miny moe.\u201d During the nine months a year I live in London, I\u2019m regarded as an archconservative nut. When I fly home to the United States, I transform, mid-Atlantic, to a leftist radical \u2014 with the same opinions. That\u2019s because most of my progressive social positions are taken as the norm in Britain by just about everybody.We can at least thank Rand Paul for nominally refurbishing libertarianism so that it is halfway respectable. But the real mystery is why American libertarianism was ever marginalized (and why they marginalized themselves). David Boaz encapsulates the essential idea in last year\u2019s \u201cThe Libertarian Mind\u201d: \u201cYou learn the essence of libertarianism in kindergarten: Don\u2019t hit other people, don\u2019t take their stuff, and keep your promises.\u201dYet Chris Christie has declared that libertarianism is \u201cdangerous.\u201d Its advocates\u2019 going on about property rights strikes communitarians as grabby, selfish and sordid. Libertarians are caricatured as regarding every man as an island. When I announced to my mother in the 1980s that I considered myself libertarian, she recoiled. How did people like me come to seem like kooks?This discussion always rounds on hard cases. Do parents have a right to not vaccinate their children against measles? (No, and Rand Paul got this issue wrong in his own terms. Vaccine refuseniks infringe on the rights of their neighbors\u2019 children.) Individual rights can conflict with collective rights. Coercive legislation to secure clean waterways, breathable air and sustainable fishing practices seems good and necessary, yet un-libertarian. Climate change is unlikely to be sorted out by the free market. Both governments on brief electoral cycles and companies with shareholders hungry for short-term gains struggle to meet long-term goals.The hardest case is immigration. Libertarians ought to believe that anyone should be free to live anywhere. In a crowded, mobile world of grossly disparate opportunities, open borders for wealthier countries are impractical. Little wonder that Rand Paul has championed American border security, not international freedom of movement.I have my own inconsistencies. I have no problem with seatbelt and helmet laws. I support a minimum wage \u2014 a higher minimum wage \u2014 and laws forbidding racial discrimination in employment. There are simply too many crazy people, and I\u2019m keen on gun control out of sheer self-preservation. Having enjoyed a largely positive experience with Britain\u2019s National Health Service, I prefer single-payer health care \u2014 though in the United States, I\u2019m not holding my breath.But then, without allowing for qualifications, any standpoint degenerates from pragmatic guideline to inflexible dogma. Like any other broad political perspective, libertarianism can be a useful starting point, but if you apply it in a strict, quasi-religious manner, you\u2019ll indeed get consigned to the crackpot\u2019s corner. All viable political positions make room for exceptions \u2014 leeriness of foreign interventions need not preclude entering World War II \u2014 and contend with What Is. So there\u2019s little purpose to libertarians holding out for the elimination of the Federal Reserve or a return to the gold standard, especially since neither of those tired tropes flows inexorably from that core rubric that we should be free to do what doesn\u2019t hurt others.I cannot be the only American repeatedly forced to vote Democratic because the Republican social agenda is retrograde, if not lunatic \u2014 at the cost of unwillingly endorsing cumbersome high-tax solutions to this country\u2019s problems. My comrades and I don\u2019t all sit around reading Ayn Rand novels, either. In fact, the abundance of my natural political bedfellows don\u2019t call themselves libertarian \u2014 though \u201csocially progressive economic conservative\u201d is a mouthful. We aren\u2019t bigots, and we\u2019re not evangelical. We\u2019re live-and-let-live about sexuality, accept man-made climate change and believe in evolution. But we\u2019re also concerned about the national debt, oppressed by an arcane, punitive tax code, and unenthusiastic about widespread dependency on the state.Dismayingly, the more acceptable libertarianism has grown, the less often its principles are applied. Many Americans once defended the right of Nazis to march down Main Street; now defending the rights of people whose views we abhor has ceded to defending our right to take offense. Municipalities are ban-happy \u2014 forbidding anything from lighting up on your own balcony to putting a cookie in your kid\u2019s bag lunch to finding a saltshaker in your local restaurant. The total Code of Federal Regulations is now over 175,000 pages in 238 volumes, with compliance costs of $1.75 trillion. Annually, businesses and individuals spend six billion worker hours on tax paperwork. No one has any idea how many federal crimes are on the statute books \u2014 anywhere from 4,500 to 300,000.Confirming Milton Friedman\u2019s \u201ctyranny of the status quo,\u201d government all too readily expands and all too rarely contracts. Not impersonal abstractions but groups of self-interested individuals, federal, state and local governments will never willingly release their $6 trillion grip on the American economy. It will be a miracle if we merely stop the usurpation from getting worse.In the last few decades, this country has grown ever more oriented toward control freakery. Rand Paul was an imperfect counterbalance to this trend, if only because neither he nor his father, Ron, before him had the commanding personal presence to win, and lead from, the White House. Yet I hold out hope for a more formidable successor in the years to come. Voters like me \u2014 who believe that environmental quality, health and safety, and security needn\u2019t be purchased at the cost of our liberty, and who defend the right to make our own mistakes as a crucial aspect of being human \u2014 deserve political representation. We\u2019re ornery, and we don\u2019t like being told what to do, but we\u2019re not kooks.Advertisement"}

But in less prosperous areas, there was much less enthusiasm, and turnout seemed lower.\u201cAt least if I vote for a reformist, I will reduce the number of hard-liners,\u201d said Shahin Hemati, a 28-year-old dentist, expressing a widespread attitude in the more affluent areas. \u201cIf the hard-liners are voted in, this will be a nightmare for me.\u201dIn a great number of cases, however, the outcome of the voting was predetermined, as the candidates were vetted by the Guardian Council, a panel dominated by hard-liners. Thousands of candidates, most of them reformists, were disqualified, assuring they would remain in the minority and limiting President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s ability to make promised changes to end the country\u2019s isolation and to expand personal liberties.Ayatollah Khamenei voted early in the day and called upon all \u201cwho love Iran, the Islamic republic and people\u201d to follow suit. A high turnout, he said, will \u201cdisappoint the enemies.\u201dHe appeared to be getting his wish in places, particularly in North Tehran, the most affluent section of town, where voters turned out in droves. People there tend to look at the parliamentary elections as a once-in-four-years opportunity to register their dislike for the hard-line guardians of the revolution who largely control the government.On social media, people in North Tehran shared pictures of themselves after voting, flashing victory signs and calling upon others to come out and vote. Families waiting in lines at school buildings and mosques could be overheard expressing their astonishment at the level of the turnout.State television focused on one popular polling station, Hosseiniye Ershad, a blue-tiled spectacle of Islamic architecture in North Tehran. Several well-known officials and actors could be seen waiting their turn in the lengthy lines, holding their identity cards.Many people came out to support Mr. Rouhani in his effort to break the stranglehold of the hard-liners and to begin to modernize the country. \u201cI\u2019m here to say yes to better relations with the world and the continuation of President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s policies,\u201d said one of them, Amir, 33, who like many others refused to give his surname, saying he did not want it to appear in a Western newspaper.\u201cMy vote is against those who have been in power now for over a decade; I want to give them a sign,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a miracle will happen.

As a senior Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, he helped those banks grow larger than ever.On Tuesday, he said it was time to think about breaking them up.He described the threat of another crisis that might force the government to bail out large banks, as it did in 2008, as a rare instance of a clear and preventable problem.\u201cThe question is whether we as a country have the courage to actually take action now,\u201d he said.Mr. Kashkari\u2019s remarks caused a stir in Washington. Such views have become relatively common at both ends of the political spectrum \u2014 providing fuel for the presidential campaigns of Senator Bernie Sanders, Democrat of Vermont, and Donald Trump, a Republican \u2014 but Mr. Kashkari is a moderate Republican and a former employee of Goldman Sachs.\u201cThere are lines in your speech I can imagine a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren saying,\u201d David Wessel, a former economics editor at The Wall Street Journal who moderated the Brookings event, told Mr. Kashkari during a panel discussion after the speech. \u201cIt\u2019s not what one expects from a Goldman Sachs Republican.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m not willing to stand up and share my concerns, then I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job,\u201d he said.Donald L. Kohn, who worked with Mr. Kashkari during the crisis as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said after the speech that he had greater confidence than Mr. Kashkari in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which grants regulators new powers to constrain and, if necessary, dismantle large banks.\u201cI think the new regime, once it\u2019s fully in place, probably will work,\u201d he said.Mr. Kashkari said the cost of large crises underscored the importance of minimizing risk. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply the cost of the bailout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the economic damage that\u2019s inflicted across society.\u201dMr. Kashkari outlined a number of potential options for restraining large banks, although he emphasized that the list was not intended to be comprehensive.The first and most familiar is forcing large banks to break into smaller pieces, the approach favored by Mr. Sanders, who released a statement on Tuesday saying he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the speech.Big banks argue they play a unique role in the global economy, and that foreign rivals would take up the slack. They also say big banks are stronger in some ways, and that regulations are adequate.\u201cBreaking up the U.S.-based global financial institutions would ensure that one of the United States\u2019 most competitive global industries serving companies small and large is turned over to banks based outside the United States,\u201d said John Dearie, acting chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the interests of large financial firms.A third, broader approach would impose a tax on borrowing throughout the financial system, reducing risk-taking not just by banks but a wide range of other financial intermediaries. The role of banks in the financial system has declined over time, and many experts regard the rest of the financial system, relatively less regulated, as a more likely source of future crises.Critics of both the second and third approaches argue that economic growth requires risk-taking, and preventing risk-taking by banks will shift activity to less regulated sectors.Mr. Kashkari said that limiting the risks posed by large banks could allow the government to ease regulation of smaller banks. He also took a pre-emptive shot at the banking industry, noting the \u201cendless objections\u201d its lobbyists have raised to proposals for stronger regulation.\u201cWe need to move before we as a society have forgotten the lessons of \u201908,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

At the same time, the average man is 30 pounds heavier today than he was in 1960 (196 pounds compared with 166 pounds) and the average woman is 26 pounds heavier (166 pounds, up from 140 pounds), Mr. Cohen said, citing statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smaller seats and larger passengers mean planes may not be capable of rapid evacuation in the event of an emergency, he said. \u201cThis affects safety and health.\u201dDuring the debate, Representative Rick Nolan of Minnesota, among those who voted yes for the amendment, recalled seeing a man trying to squeeze into his seat and inadvertently pull the hair of the woman sitting in front of him. \u201cAnd she\u2019s screaming at him \u2019cause he pulled her hair, and he\u2019s screaming at her for screaming at him and, I mean, it\u2019s getting out of line.\u201dAlas, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee voted down Mr. Cohen\u2019s Seat Egress in Air Travel Act of 2016, 33 to 26, on Feb. 11. But I\u2019m still holding out hope. Mr. Cohen introduced the act as a stand-alone bill on Feb. 8 and plans to introduce it again as an amendment if or when the F.A.A. Reauthorization comes to the House floor for consideration, according to a spokesman for Mr. Cohen. On Feb. 28, Senator Schumer of New York announced that he would offer an amendment to the F.A.A. Reauthorization bill that would require seat-size standards. \u201cThe average passenger feels like they\u2019re being treated as a sardine,\u201d he said during a news conference. \u201cSqueezed and squeezed and squeezed.\u201dWhatever happens, Mr. Cohen\u2019s bill raises important questions. Smaller seats are doubtless uncomfortable and unfair to travelers who are especially tall or heavy. But are they also unsafe?There are two main concerns addressed by the Seat Egress in Air Travel Act: \u201ceconomy class syndrome\u201d (the condition experienced by travelers who develop deep vein thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot or clots, after long-distance flights) and the ability for passengers to safely evacuate a plane when they can barely get into their seats in the best of circumstances.The other major safety concern Mr. Cohen raised is the ability of passengers to exit a plane in the event of an emergency.\u201cThe F.A.A. requires that planes be capable of rapid evacuation in case of emergency,\u201d he said in a statement when the bill was voted down, \u201cyet they haven\u2019t conducted emergency evacuation tests on all of today\u2019s smaller seats. That\u2019s unacceptable.\u201dSince the introduction of Mr. Cohen\u2019s bill, it has garnered a few more supporters, including Representative Charles B.

{"Headline": "Infighting Dilutes Push in Britain to Leave E.U.", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Old-fashioned, upper class and with a habit of spouting Latin quotations, the British lawmaker and European Union critic Jacob Rees-Mogg is affectionately known in Parliament as the \u201chonorable member for the early 20th century.\u201dBut with a referendum looming on Britain\u2019s place in the union, Mr. Rees-Mogg and other Tory euroskeptics think that they are on the right side of history in pressing Britons to quit.\u201cThe British people feel closer to the Americans than they do to the French,\u201d said Mr. Rees-Mogg, 46, sitting in an ornate tearoom in Parliament, overlooking the Thames River.With the referendum likely to be held in June, the euroskeptics\u2019 inability to coalesce around a single, clear message or leader is complicating their cause, even as their long-sought goal of ending Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union is within reach.The internal spats extend beyond the Conservative Party to competing private groups representing rival ideological camps \u2014 free-market conservatives, like Mr. Rees-Mogg, and a more populist, anti-immigrant component embodied most visibly by Nigel Farage, leader of the nativist U.K. Independence Party.Advocates of a British withdrawal from the union constitute a lively and outspoken \u2014 if ill-disciplined \u2014 force. Naturally, they are not impressed with Mr. Cameron\u2019s renegotiation: Liam Fox, a former defense secretary, has accused him of handing out the \u201cpolitical begging bowl.\u201d Philip Davies, another Conservative lawmaker who favors leaving the bloc, calls the effort an \u201cabsolute shambles.\u201dMr. Farage\u2019s U.K. Independence Party has come to prominence in the last decade, successfully capitalizing on concerns over immigration in European elections but not in those for the British Parliament.But the Conservatives have been split on Europe since before 1990 when Margaret Thatcher was pushed out as prime minister. She supported membership of the European Economic Community, as it then was, in Britain\u2019s previous referendum in 1975, but became steadily more hostile to European integration.Her ouster in a 1990 putsch was partly caused by European policy, and her successor, John Major, was tormented by her supporters.Even now, several years after her death, there is debate about how Mrs. Thatcher would have voted on exiting the bloc, a \u201cspectacularly silly\u201d discussion, according to Mr. Rees-Mogg, who ridiculed it by suggesting \u201ca quick s\u00e9ance.\u201d\u201cKnock once for \u2018yes,\u2019 knock twice for \u2018no,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, before rapping twice on the table and announcing, with a grin, that Mrs. Thatcher had spoken from beyond the grave. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018no!\u2019 \u201dMr. Rees-Mogg makes an economic case for Britain to go it alone, saying that Europe is narrowing Britain\u2019s trading focus, \u201cwhen we need to broaden it.\u201d But he also highlights historical factors that, he says, set Britain apart, including that \u201cit\u2019s also a long time since we have, off our own bat, wanted to fight anyone in Europe.\u201dAs for his personal style Mr. Rees-Mogg, who does not own a pair of jeans, believes that arguments, not \u201cpersonal quirks\u201d will decide the referendum. Anyway, he says, \u201cI can\u2019t suddenly pretend to be Mr. Trendy.\u201dNot all euroskeptics are as entertaining as Mr. Rees-Mogg, perhaps because some have spent decades studying the subclauses of European Union treaties, regulations and other, mind-numbing texts. The best known and most knowledgeable of these is Bill Cash, a veteran lawmaker once derided by Mr. Major as \u201cobsessive, driven and, on Europe, frankly a bore.\u201dMr. Cash has long worried about the erosion of national sovereignty. Younger euroskeptics also contend that European institutions lack democratic legitimacy, and that Britain\u2019s history and common law legal system sets it apart.\u201cWe have different histories,\u201d said Mr. Davies, the Conservative lawmaker. \u201cThe motivation for the European Union was, in a sense, to stop France and Germany from going to war with each other.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf France and Germany want to do that, good luck to them. But that wasn\u2019t our history.\u201dWhile Mr. Rees-Mogg, was educated at Eton College and Oxford University and is the son of the onetime editor of The London Times, William Rees-Mogg, Mr. Davies grew up in Doncaster, northern England, and was a supermarket manager before being elected to Parliament.Mr. Davies\u2019s main argument reflects a switch of emphasis made by euroskeptics in the last decade, when they began to argue that membership in the bloc was shackling Britain to an economic corpse.\u201cEurope is an economic disaster zone, and unless we can start looking outwards, we are going to get nowhere,\u201d Mr. Davies said. That argument has resonance because it relates to the central reason that Britain joined the bloc in the first place.Back then Britain\u2019s economy was stagnant and arguably needed the impetus of membership in a club that had helped France and Germany to thrive.Now the roles are reversed, with Britain\u2019s economy outperforming most of the Continent.Euroskeptics are trying to reverse the common assumption that an exit is a leap into the unknown. Mr. Davies says the bloc is fated ultimately to \u201cfall apart,\u201d and Mr. Rees-Mogg suggests that it would be safer to stay \u201cgoverned by our own democratic forms, rather than to be in a country called Europe, governed by a bureaucracy in Brussels.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Farage and others have campaigned against immigration into Britain from Eastern Europe, which surged after the expansion of the European Union.That happened after Britain decided to open its labor market immediately to new European Union citizens in 2004, unlike countries such as Germany and France, which exercised a right to delay their employment rights.While Britain is outside the union\u2019s passport-free travel zone, known as Schengen, euroskeptics argue that since Europeans have a right to live and work in one another\u2019s countries, only by quitting the bloc can Britain control its borders.Other politicians know that while Mr. Farage might galvanize some voters, he is a divisive figure. That has led to feuding over which organization should be the approved \u201cno\u201d campaign.Whether these divisions matter to voters is unclear, and having several different messages might actually help the departure movement by allowing its campaign to reach different groups.One seasoned European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity following protocol, believes that in the end the divisions in the exit camp may not matter. Those who want Britain to remain in the bloc have a big battle on their hands, he said, because euroskeptics have tapped into a rich vein of British life.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that Britons see themselves as different from the Continent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more that they really want to be.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Fear That Central Banks Are Hindering Global Growth", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byWhat if the bazooka is shooting blanks?Since the financial crisis, it has been gospel for many investors that some combination of actions by central banks \u2014 bond buying, bold promises or flirtations with negative interest rates \u2014 would be enough to keep the global economy out of recession.But investors\u2019 distress over the latest volley by a major central bank, the surprise decision on Thursday by the Swedish central bank to lower its short-term rate to minus 0.50 percent from minus 0.35 percent, has heightened fears that brazen actions by central bankers are now making things worse, not better.Global stock markets sank, the price of oil plunged to a 13-year low and investors fled to safe haven instruments like gold and United States Treasury bills.Markets generally embrace conviction and run away from indecision \u2014 which is what many see in the policy making of some of the large central banks these days.The Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, for example, has been criticized in the past for prematurely raising rates, and Thursday\u2019s rate cut was opposed by two bank deputies.At the European Central Bank, Jens Weidmann, the head of the powerful German Bundesbank, remains at odds with the president, Mario Draghi, in terms of how loose the central bank\u2019s policies should be.And in the United States, the Federal Reserve is seen by some market participants to be wavering in its commitment to higher rates in light of the market turmoil.Speaking to Congress, Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Fed, sought to dispel the notion that interest rates might be headed anywhere but up.\u201cWe will meet in March, and our committee will carefully deliberate about what impact these developments have had,\u201d she said, referring to turmoil in the markets.On Thursday, the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed down 1.2 percent, after falling as much as 2.3 percent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.6 percent to 15,660.18. Earlier, European stocks declined sharply. Stocks in Frankfurt closed down 2.9 percent and stocks in London fell 2.4 percent.Japanese markets continued the sell-off on Friday, with the Nikkei 225 index down as much as 5.3 percent midday.The price of crude oil slipped to $26.21. Gold rose to $1,247.90 an ounce, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.66 percent, from 1.67 on Wednesday.The move by the Swedish central bank was intended to counter the dual threat of deflation and an appreciating currency, which poses a threat to the country\u2019s export-driven economy.But many investors saw the rate cut as smacking of desperation and the latest sign that global central bankers are moving toward a round of competitive devaluations \u2014 also known as currency wars \u2014 as a way to stimulate their economies.\u201cWhat central bankers are doing now feels like a Jedi trick,\u201d said Albert Edwards, global strategist for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London. \u201cEveryone is in a currency war and inflation expectations are collapsing.\u201dIn other words, drastic steps by central bankers in Europe, Japan and China to keep their currencies weak and exports strong may not only be counterproductive in terms of stimulating global growth \u2014 someone has to buy all those Chinese and Japanese goods \u2014 but has other consequences as well.Negative interest rates, for example, are not only bad for bank profits and lending prospects, they can also make savers more fearful, hampering the central aim, which is to get people to spend, not hoard.All of which can lead to a global recession.A perma-bear like Mr. Edwards is always in possession of a multitude of negative economic indicators to prove his thesis, which, in his case, is a fall of 75 percent in the S.&P. 500 from its peak last summer.Some are obvious and have been highlighted by most economists, like the increasing interest rates on corporate bonds in the United States \u2014 both investment grade and junk.But he also pointed to a recent release from the Fed that showed that loan officers at United States banks said that they had been tightening their loan standards for two consecutive quarters.\u201cYou tend to see that in a recession,\u201d Mr. Edwards said.His prediction of a so-called deflationary ice age is still considered a fringe view of sorts, although he did say that a record 950 people (up from 700 the year before) attended his annual conference in London last month.Still, the notion that the global economy has not responded as it should to years of shock policies from central banks is more or less mainstream economic thinking right now.Within the International Monetary Fund, which has been regularly downgrading global forecasts over the last year, economists have begun to express concern that the growth problems of large emerging markets like China, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa are going to persist for the long term.Increasing levels of debt and the inability of governments in these countries to put in place long-lasting reforms, especially at the private sector level, will keep growth rates much lower than they should be.That could mean that this convergence with developed economies that emerging market bulls have long predicted could face quite a long delay and perhaps, in some cases, not even materialize.The well-known bond investor William H. Gross of Janus Capital took up this theme in his latest investment essay, arguing that there was no evidence to show that the financial wealth (and increased levels of debt) created by a long period of extra-low interest rates would spur growth in the real economy.As proof, he cited Japan\u2019s persistent struggles to grow despite near-zero interest rates; subpar growth in the United States; and emerging market problems in China, Brazil and Venezuela.\u201cThere is a lot of risk in the global financial marketplace,\u201d Mr. Gross said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cIt is incumbent on me to focus on safe assets now.\u201dFor the time being at least, investors seem to agree. Over the last few days they have been pouring money into exchange-traded funds that track gold stocks and United States Treasury bills.Riskier securities like emerging market stocks; European banks, where fears over bad loans are growing; and high-yield corporate bonds have suffered.Low oil prices, cheap Chinese exports and negative interest rates may smell like recession to some, but economists with a more optimistic bent see these trends as a tremendous gift to the consumer.Charles Dumas, the chief economist for Lombard Street, an independent research house based in London says that consumers in Europe and the United States will not hoard their gains but instead spend them on houses, cars and other items.\u201cThis idea that consumers are not spending is just wide of the mark,\u201d Mr. Dumas said. Perhaps the full effect won\u2019t be felt immediately, he added, but over time it will.The world\u2019s central bankers certainly hope he is right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better Way to Control the Banks ", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byEditorialWhat gets lost in the discussion is that Dodd-Frank, properly executed, would help to create the conditions for breaking up large and complex banks. That\u2019s because the banks would face rising regulatory costs, which means they might well be worth more to investors if taken apart. Essentially, effective regulation and market forces would work together to make banks smaller and safer.For example, Dodd-Frank and related regulations require big banks to hold considerably more capital now than they were required to hold before the crisis. The aim is to ensure that banks can absorb any losses they may generate, instead of relying on taxpayers to pick up the bill.Even so, the capital requirements are not strong enough, in part because they do not require banks to fully account for potential losses from the trading of derivatives, a multitrillion-dollar activity.Mrs. Clinton has vowed to fight for higher capital requirements, which can be accomplished without new legislation if regulators willing to impose them are appointed. Of course, that would not be as blunt a way to shrink the banks as simply requiring them to stop their riskiest trading. Still, it would not preclude breaking up the banks at some later date. And it would make the journey from here to there a safer one.As campaign slogans go, \u201cmore capital\u201d does not have the same ring to it as \u201cbreak up the banks.\u201d But both are paths to the same destination.

{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Attitude Toward Wall Street Is Subjective", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byStandard DeductionWhat is Hillary Clinton\u2019s attitude toward Wall Street? The question evokes similarly heated and overly confident responses online, even among Democrats. Mrs. Clinton is deep in the pocket of Wall Street, as evidenced by her lucrative speeches to Goldman Sachs. Or she is a progressive fighter with a smart and sophisticated plan to rein in Wall Street\u2019s excesses.There is no right answer. She is either of these things, depending on how your brain processes information. On tax policy, Mrs. Clinton has a strong team in place and has put forth some sensible proposals, focusing the weight of her tax increases on those who earn more than $5 million annually. Some observers subtract the evidence of being too friendly to Wall Street, focusing on her detailed policy proposals.But I remain skeptical. I tend to subtract Mrs. Clinton\u2019s more recent left-leaning policy proposals. Consider her first major tax proposal of the campaign, on capital gains. Rather than suggest that we abolish the capital gains preference, she proposed a gradual step-down in rates depending on the length of time an investor holds assets, with the lowest rate of 20 percent available after five years.I find this approach troubling because it would do little to address top-end income inequality, which is exacerbated by the lower rate of tax on long-term capital gains, much of which is generated by the sale of assets with long holding periods.For me, the question is one of authenticity. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s capital gains proposal seems to have originated on Wall Street. Laurence D. Fink, the chairman of the asset management firm BlackRock, is frequently suggested as a possible Treasury secretary should Mrs. Clinton become president.In April 2015, he spoke out against Wall Street\u2019s \u201cgambling culture,\u201d proposing that gains on assets held for less than three years be treated as short-term gains and taxed at ordinary rates, followed by a step down that would reduce the rate to zero after 10 years. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, announced in July, has a similar structural design.One notable difference between the financial overhaul approaches of Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders relates to size. Mr. Sanders would break up the big banks. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s approach, while arguably more effective at reducing systemic risk, is more nuanced and technocratic, and more tolerant of large institutions.When it comes to Wall Street, Mr. Sanders seems to prefer what a colleague has called \u201cbig dumb rules\u201d \u2014 rules that lack precision but are easier to enforce. Mrs. Clinton seems to prefer more precise, tailored solutions that make incremental improvements but might leave the Securities and Exchange Commission, Treasury and other relevant agencies vulnerable to industry influence and regulatory capture.Despite Mrs. Clinton\u2019s populist speeches, there is some evidence to indicate her approach would be similar to that of her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Clinton, guided by advisers like Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, presided over a strong economy and a strong period on Wall Street. But he also presided over the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated investment and commercial banking, and other Wall Street-friendly moves that helped set the table for the financial crisis of 2008.James Carville, Mr. Clinton\u2019s longtime adviser, once grumbled, \u201cI used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now, I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Political Backlash Grows in Washington to Chinese Takeovers", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 As Chinese companies try to snap up American tech businesses, they are setting off ripples of unease in the Obama administration and in Congress, inciting a backlash that has stopped the latest acquisition attempt.One of the companies that first brought silicon to Silicon Valley \u2014 Fairchild Semiconductor International \u2014 said it would remain in American hands after rejecting a takeover offer worth about $2.5 billion led by Chinese state-backed buyers. Instead, Fairchild embraced a smaller bid from an American rival on Tuesday, citing concerns that federal regulators might reject the Chinese deal.The unsuccessful Chinese bid for Fairchild was just one of at least 10 such offers in the last year for international semiconductor businesses, mostly in the United States. China\u2019s Five-Year Plan, the government\u2019s economic and strategic road map, has emphasized semiconductors as a core industry. And a long list of Chinese companies with varying ties to the government have been trying to acquire foreign technology in the sector.Recent Chinese moves in areas like heavy equipment, aerospace and financial services are also drawing attention from both ends of the American political spectrum.A group of 44 Republican members of Congress and one Democrat sent a letter on Tuesday afternoon to the Treasury Department, demanding that the Obama administration\u2019s interagency committee on foreign acquisitions \u201cconduct a full and rigorous investigation\u201d of a bid by a company in Chongqing, China, to acquire the small but historic Chicago Stock Exchange.Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina, said in a telephone interview that it had been easy to gather signatures on the letter in the House, with members worried that the deal would give China direct access to America\u2019s financial infrastructure. \u201cIt took two days \u2014 generally, you\u2019ll spend two weeks trying to get signatures,\u201d he said.\u201cChina\u2019s engaged in a buying spree of international semiconductor firms,\u201d said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor bilateral relations. \u201cWhat they can\u2019t develop on their own, they intend to buy, if they can, or steal, if they must.\u201dThe Chinese government has vehemently denied that it is responsible for hacking attacks, while pointing to detailed disclosures by Edward Snowden of how the United States engages in extensive electronic intelligence gathering on China. Economists in China \u2014 and some in the United States, particularly at Wall Street banks that advise on Chinese acquisitions \u2014 argue that the United States needs to remain open to foreign investment, particularly given low American savings rates.When Washington politicians start objecting to Chinese acquisitions, \u201cthey\u2019re caught up by old-school, Cold War thinking,\u201d said Fred Hu, a prominent Chinese economist and fund manager.In that case, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, voiced worries about the deal\u2019s effect on national security in a public letter to Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. But Republicans are now starting to take up the issue, which means that it could take on a partisan dimension in an election year.Despite the difficult climate, Chinese bids for American companies seem likely to increase, affected by a slowing Chinese economy and a desire by many Chinese companies to move money out of the country before China\u2019s currency can weaken further against the dollar. In the sensitive microchip industry, deals are also being driven by more than $100 billion set aside by the Chinese government to help the country improve the sophistication and scale of the critical industry.The number of deals involving a Chinese company that is trying to buy an overseas chip maker rose to 21 last year, including the offer for Fairchild, from eight in 2010, according to the data company Dealogic. There have already been five this year, worth $857 million.That has drawn more attention to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, also known as Cfius. An interagency body that includes representatives from the Treasury, Justice and Defense Departments, Cfius can recommend against foreign deals made for American companies, or companies connected to the United States, on grounds of national security. The agency can also broker compromises in which companies enact special security checks for sensitive aspects of an acquisition or sell off those assets.The Fairchild board said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it found the higher offer attractive but that there was \u201cnonnegligible risk of a failure to obtain Cfius approval.\u201dShares of ON Semiconductor closed up more than 6 percent on Tuesday, when Fairchild announced that it still favored the American company\u2019s bid. Fairchild\u2019s stock dropped almost 3 percent.Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Liquor License Workaround: Fermented, Not Distilled", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byBut when markets get convoluted, entrepreneurs get creative. Around the country, restaurateurs and others in the industry are finding unusual ways to work around restrictive local laws or take advantage of their loopholes.In many places, beer and wine licenses are much less expensive and easier to obtain than those that allow hard liquor to be served. Florida law limits the supply of full-service liquor licenses, and in Broward County, where Chillbar is, they have a market value of about $150,000. Licenses to serve only beer and wine, however, are unrestricted in number and cost $392 a year. Elizabeth Becker, Chillbar\u2019s co-owner, said that disparity made the decision easy for her restaurant. But some customers cannot face the prospect of brunch without a Bloody Mary \u2014 and for that, she has Premium Blend\u2019s Klir Red, which promises to replicate \u201cthe clean taste of triple-distilled vodka\u201d with a wine-based formula.\u201cMost people don\u2019t notice,\u201d said Mrs. Becker, who incorporates Premium Blend\u2019s formulas into elaborate cocktails. \u201cIf they ask, I tell them, \u2018There\u2019s enough alcohol in there that you\u2019ll be fine.\u2019\u00a0\u201dPremium Blend, founded 26 years ago by two brothers, has a full catalog of imitation liquors sold through distributors in 39 states. The drinks are fermented, not distilled, which allows them to be legally classified as wine. They have a lower alcohol content than hard spirits, but for customers seeking a full-strength buzz, there\u2019s an easy solution: double up. Two ounces of Premium Blend\u2019s 48-proof Candian Wicket packs about the same punch as one ounce of a traditional 80-proof bourbon.The company brings in about $5 million a year in sales and caters mostly to small businesses, said Henry O. Santos, one of the founders.\u201cWe lose business for two reasons: They go out of business, or they grow so much that they get a full license,\u201d he said.The imitation-liquor market is tiny, but other vendors are trickling in. Phillip Capriccio, the second-generation owner of a wholesale liquor business near Los Angeles, concocted a tequila-like agave wine a decade ago and began stocking it on his shelves. In 2011, his son Nick helped him develop a brand around it and expand the distribution.\u201cOur usual customers are small, mom-and-pop restaurants,\u201d Nick Capriccio said. \u201cA lot of them are just trying to keep their lights on. It\u2019s a product that lets them compete with the full-liquor restaurant across the street.\u201dFor example, the law allows bitters. So Mr. Zohn dumped an entire ounce of them into his \u201cNogroni,\u201d which also included juniper-infused sherry and vermouth to riff on a drink usually made with gin and Campari. (TBD closed because of a fire, but Mr. Semmelhack plans to reopen the space in the next few months as a new restaurant, F\u00e9nix, using the same license.)\u201cLoopholes are fun,\u201d Mr. Semmelhack said happily.Brewery licenses are a popular workaround in other states as well, including New Mexico, which has given them a protectionist twist.State-licensed small brewers are allowed to open up to three off-site tap rooms. Those tasting rooms can also sell wine and beer from other craft makers, provided that the beverages are all produced in New Mexico.\u201cWe have several clients who are desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to impact people\u2019s ability to open their restaurants.\u201d\u201cEvery one of these states has a particular nuance driving the engine,\u201d he said. \u201cNew Jersey is out of control. Massachusetts has its moments. Pennsylvania is bad. Some of the East Coast is terrible beyond belief. I don\u2019t know how you get a return on investment in many of these instances.\u201dIn San Francisco, Mr. Semmelhack sometimes fantasizes about profiting from the ultimate loophole \u2014 one that involves an actual hole.\u201cIf we cut a hole in the walls, the coffee shop could serve booze if they want to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my pipe dream: Three liquor licenses for the price of one.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rubio\u2019s Call for No Capital Gains Tax Is a Break With the G.O.P.", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceWhen Steve Forbes ran for president in 1996 on a plan that called for no taxes on dividends and capital gains, Mitt Romney, then a private citizen, took out a full-page ad in The Boston Globe attacking his proposal as plutocratic.The mainstream Republican position on capital gains has long been that they should be taxed at a low rate, but not zero. In 1996, Mr. Romney was supporting Bob Dole, the eventual nominee, whose campaign platform called for a 14 percent tax rate on capital gains. In 2003, President George W. Bush signed a law setting the rate at 15 percent, a policy that John McCain proposed to continue if elected in 2008. (The current maximum rate on capital gains is 23.8 percent, after tax increases that took effect in 2013.)When Mr. Romney was the Republican nominee in 2012, he proposed to abolish the capital gains tax for moderate earners \u2014 who typically have few capital gains anyway \u2014 but not for the Kennedys, Rockefellers and Forbeses, who would have continued paying 15 percent.But the once-fringe idea of abolishing a capital-gains tax is going mainstream this year courtesy of Senator Marco Rubio. His tax plan breaks with past establishment Republican candidates for president in its extreme generosity to taxpayers who derive their income from investments rather than work.His plan would impose no tax at all on interest, dividends or capital gain income from stocks. It would also set a maximum tax rate of 25 percent on business income, both for large corporations and small ones. In many cases, that would mean business owners would pay a lower tax rate on profits than their employees would pay on their wages \u2014 even after counting both taxes paid by the business and those paid by the business owner directly.Mr. Rubio\u2019s tax plan has drawn attention for so-called family-friendly features, including a significantly expanded child tax credit. It has also drawn criticism from Senator Ted Cruz for imposing too high a tax rate on wage income \u2014 rates of up to 35 percent. Mr. Rubio seeks a lower top rate than is imposed today, but one higher than any other current Republican presidential candidate has proposed. Mr. Cruz\u2019s plan, which combines a flat income tax with a value-added tax, would impose an effective combined tax rate of 24.4 percent on wages.The fight over taxes mirrors the divide that has emerged between the Republican Party\u2019s elite supporters and its voter base. Mr. Cruz\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s tax plans offer significantly lower tax rates than Mr. Rubio\u2019s to the sorts of highly paid workers that form a key Republican voting constituency. But they are not as generous to people who live off investment income \u2014 a group that, not incidentally, includes many of the people who fund Republican super PACs.To be clear, the idea that capital gains should get a preferential tax rate did not arise as a pure sop to the rich. For nearly the entire history of the American income tax, capital gains have been taxed at a lower rate than regular income. Canada, France, Britain, Germany and even Sweden all impose top tax rates on capital gains that are more than 10 points lower than their top rates on regular income.Reduced tax rates on capital income serve three plausible policy purposes beyond being nice for the Rockefellers and the Kennedys. First, a large fraction of capital income is taxed twice, at the corporate and individual levels. Dividends are distributions of already-taxed corporate profits, while a rise in a stock price represents a rise in expected future taxable corporate profits. Second, economists generally believe the revenue-maximizing tax rate on capital gains is much lower than the revenue-maximizing tax rate on salaries. This is in large part because capital gains are voluntary; you pay only if you sell an appreciated asset, so investors are likely to respond to higher tax rates by not selling.Third, and more controversially, some economists say capital is significantly more sensitive to tax policy than labor. That is, high taxes on capital income will do more to discourage investment than high taxes on wages do to discourage work. Capital taxes are therefore more damaging to the economy than wage taxes.The problem with proposing a zero tax rate on capital gains and dividends, rather than just a low one, is that it can rely only on the third, least-certain justification. A zero rate will more than offset the double taxation of corporate income, and is certainly well below the revenue-maximizing rate.But it\u2019s a big tax cut for people who are already doing well, and can be a good idea only if you really believe it will do a lot for economic growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Implicit Foreign Policy", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byMy fellow Americans:I have based my foreign policy on some tough realities that are hard to talk about because no American likes to hear about the limits of our power. But those limits have grown. American power in the 21st century cannot be what it was in 1945 \u2014 or even in 1990.To say this is to be accused of defeatism, of managing American decline and of giving up on American exceptionalism. That is why I have pursued an implicit foreign policy rather than an explicit one. That is why I waited so long to give this speech on my doctrine of restraint. No president wants to make a speech called \u201cThe Consequences of the End of the American Century.\u201d It\u2019s political suicide.Implicit has meant letting actions speak. Some say I have failed to understand the theater of American leadership. I\u2019ll leave the strutting on the world stage to others.Our world is more interdependent than ever. China, India and other nations have grown rapidly, ending an era of Western domination. The Chinese economy has quintupled in size since 1990. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq consumed trillions of dollars but did not bring victory. The enemies we face, often groups of violent extremists, cannot be vanquished through conventional warfare.The consequence is that American power still counts but no longer clinches the deal. Multilateral solutions to international problems must be pursued. The Iran nuclear agreement \u2014 reached with help from Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany \u2014 is one example. Another is the Paris Climate Agreement. Military power can only be used as a last resort, for clear and achievable political ends, and when there is a workable plan for post-military development. That was not the case in Iraq. Look at the price.I know that many people think my policies have failed in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, and that President Putin has filled the vacuum. My priority was to avoid overreach in the use of American power, adjust our ambitions to the realities of the world and devote resources to neglected domestic priorities including infrastructure, inequality and health care.In 2016, we have no business building other nations. It is for them to decide their fates. As a result, I have asked a lot of questions, so many that I hear that Bob Blackwill, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, calls me \u201cthe king of the slippery-slope school of foreign policy.\u201dI\u2019ll take that moniker, if the alternative is to embrace feel-good posturing and drift into another intractable war in which young Americans die for murky causes in the indifferent sands of the Middle East.Should I have backed the pro-democracy uprising of young Iranians in 2009 against the regime, and might American support have tipped the balance? Should I have done more to ensure the fragile Egyptian experiment in democracy did not fail by pressing former President Mohamed Morsi to restrain his divisive Muslim Brotherhood agenda? Should I have called the coup that ousted him a \u201ccoup\u201d?Should I have armed the rebels in Syria, or established a no-fly zone once President Bashar al-Assad began murdering his citizens en masse, or set up a safe area to protect desperate refugees as a gage of our determination? Should I have upheld through one-off punitive military strikes against Assad the \u201cred line\u201d I set against the use of chemical weapons and so demonstrated to the Saudis and other Sunni gulf states that I was not, as they believe, in the pocket of the Shia world? In short, should I have kept my word and taken more risks to save Syria, oust Assad and stop Putin dictating the outcome?Perhaps. I know members of my foreign policy team have agonized over Syria and its quarter-million dead. One or two may have been close to resigning. The refugee flow into Europe destabilizes allies. But I do not lose sleep. This job is about tough choices. Restraint was the wiser option for a chastened America unready to pass the mantle but condemned now to share it.I have built new bridges \u2014 to Iran, to Cuba. We are working with China to advance Afghan-Pakistani dialogue and bring peace in Afghanistan. Tough love for Israel, more conditional friendships with Saudi Arabia and other Arab autocracies and a gradual reduction in the isolation of Iran are, in my view, the only path over time to a new, stable order in a Middle East where our strategic priorities have changed with energy independence.That\u2019s about it. You see now why I chose the implicit approach. I hope you will understand the wisdom of my restraint. Perhaps you will even become nostalgic for it. The pendulum swings \u2014 and American adventurism may well make a comeback with my successor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Big Questions on the Job Market, and How January\u2019s Numbers Answer Them", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byJobs ReportGet used to jobs numbers like those newly reported for the United States Friday morning \u2014 if we\u2019re lucky.It\u2019s not that the new data blew the lid off expectations or pointed to some radical acceleration in job growth in the opening weeks of 2016. Quite the contrary. The nation added 151,000 jobs in January, which was below analysts\u2019 expectations and well below the revised 262,000 jobs added in December. That looks an awful lot like \u201creversion to the mean,\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if final revisions show a slower pace of job growth across the two months.But while economists and financial markets have traditionally placed the greatest weight on that payroll number as the key indicator of whether economic growth is speeding up or slowing down, we\u2019re entering a phase where some other components of the jobs report are more important.Think of it this way: Millions of people lost their jobs during the 2008-2009 recession, and during the last seven years the biggest question has been how quickly they got back to work. But now that job is largely accomplished, and the United States has 4.9 million more jobs than it did at the onset of the recession in December 2007.Mathematically, the rate of job growth will have to slow as we get closer to full employment, simply because the number of people available to be hired can over the long term only grow in line with population growth, which would be something below 100,000 jobs a month.The questions now are more subtle. Here are the questions \u2014 and the answers offered by the January data.How close are we to full employment?The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent in January, the first sub-5 percent reading since February 2008. That\u2019s good news, particularly because the details of the survey from which the unemployment rate is derived show that the rate fell for good reasons (more people working) instead of bad ones (people dropping out of the labor force).What exactly constitutes full employment is open for debate, but it\u2019s important to note that we are now within sight of a jobless rate that matches the low point of the 2002-2007 expansion (4.4 percent, achieved in several months in 2006 and 2007).Are more people joining (or rejoining) the labor force?During the crisis, millions of Americans dropped out of the labor force, and a key question for understanding the United States\u2019 economic potential is how many can be coaxed back in as the job market improves.The January numbers report good news on that front. After adjusting for the updates to the Labor Department\u2019s population estimates, the size of the labor force rose by 284,000 in January, and the ratio of the population that is employed ticked up by a tenth of a percent, as did the labor force participation rate.It\u2019s hardly enough to solve the problem of America\u2019s missing work force, but for one month at least the numbers were pointing in the right direction.Are wages finally rising?With full employment within sight, the big question is less how many jobs are being added and more about how much workers are being paid. Here too there was good news in January, with an 0.5 percent rise in average hourly earnings and a small increase in the length of the average workweek.That still leaves wage growth over the last year at 2.5 percent, below its pre-recession levels. The silver lining is that inflation has been so low over the last year, thanks in large part to a drop in energy prices, that the 2.5 percent increase in an average worker\u2019s pay translates into a meaningful gain in buying power.As we get closer to full employment, it is inevitable that job creation will slow. But so long as these other indicators in these monthly reports keep showing improvement in 2016, it will be a good year for American workers anyway.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Cleared Way for Today\u2019s Outsider Candidates", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonSince outsider, anti-establishment White House candidates are all the rage, consider this one: scant executive experience, brief time in federal office, a bold if not arrogant willingness to challenge much more seasoned politicians, an aspirational platform with little track record to back it up, and a minority to boot.As a junior senator back in 2006, Mr. Obama was urged by allies to run for president precisely because he had spent such a short time in Washington that he had not built up the legislative record or earned the insider image that could weigh him down like, say, Hillary Clinton.\u201cIt was almost a liability to have any experience or ties to Washington,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader from South Dakota, who was among those encouraging Mr. Obama to run before it was too late.It is hard to imagine Mr. Cruz and his fellow Republican senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul running as credible contenders had it not been for Mr. Obama\u2019s success. All are in their first term, and Mr. Cruz, like Mr. Obama, announced his candidacy for the White House after less than three years in the Senate. None of the three Republicans has led a committee, and all have spent most of their time in the Senate in the minority party.As for his own party, Mr. Obama also no doubt cleared the way for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a democratic socialist mounting a progressive bid to shake up the status quo in the nation\u2019s capital and relying strongly on his appeal to young voters with little interest in embracing what they see as the moth-eaten Washington ways.Before Mr. Obama\u2019s victory, the ticket to a major party presidential nomination since John F. Kennedy had been a well-seasoned national pedigree or a stint in a governor\u2019s mansion. Consider Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, both George Bushes and Bill Clinton. Mr. Obama, then, is the clear outlier in that list in terms of legislative or executive experience.The losers in some of those contests were even more notable for their Washington r\u00e9sum\u00e9s: Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, a former senator; Senator George McGovern; Walter Mondale, a former vice president and senator; Bob Dole, a former Senate majority leader: Vice President Al Gore, a former senator; Senators John Kerry and John McCain. Both parties clearly have seen Washington gravitas as essential.Mr. Obama\u2019s candidacy also heightened another element in presidential politics that is glaringly obvious in today\u2019s campaign \u2014 celebrity. While he was a freshman member of the Senate with limited influence inside the institution, he was the most sought-after candidate on the campaign trail, drawing huge crowds eager for a fresh face.It goes without saying that the current celebrity candidate is Donald J. Trump, a reality television star who has never cast a vote in a legislative body, providing him with the ultimate protection against anyone trying to pin him down on his positions. Mr. Trump is building on the Obama model in some ways but coming at it from an entirely different direction, one fueled more by anger than hope.Mr. Obama was a fund-raising machine, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars outside the party apparatus, keeping him free of conventional party allegiances and obligations. Once in office, he held on to his outsider status to a large degree, keeping his distance from Congress and not engaging in the sort of Washington backslapping that in the past was seen as important in getting initiatives through the House and Senate.With less than a year left in the president\u2019s tenure, some in the White House now wonder if it would have been better to embrace his outsider demeanor entirely, to let Obama be Obama from the start and drop any pretense of buttering up those on Capitol Hill or playing the Washington game.Some of those who were with him at the time say it would have been a risky approach. The times were too unsettling with the economic crisis and two wars to wind down, and Mr. Obama was already seen as such a different political creature that going full outsider could have shaken the public.\u201cIt is easy to say now that we should have owned this from the beginning,\u201d said David Axelrod, the president\u2019s former chief political adviser. \u201cBut at the time, given the fragility of the economy and the country, you already felt you were walking on eggshells. People were looking for stability.\u201d\u201cI think what you have seen in the last two years is him being freed of the burden of running for his own election or anyone else\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said.With voting actually beginning in the presidential primaries to replace him, the results will ultimately show whether this outsider president paved the way for another or whether wary voters still value experience.Advertisement"}

And I shudder to think how he would actually govern.PAUL HEERCambridge, Mass.To the Editor:I am a longtime Democrat who has been very undecided between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for a number of reasons that I will not outline here.But I can offer Mrs. Clinton a piece of advice if she wishes to win me over: Instead of just figuring out new ways to attack Senator Sanders, she would be a better candidate for me if she could show that her vision includes some newer concepts of where this country might be further down the pike, say, in 20 to 40 years and beyond.One of this country\u2019s problems is that we tend to be pretty shortsighted, just thinking of presidential terms and an economy that is crumbling from within.PAMELA MICHAELSHagerstown, Md.To the Editor:Those of us who favor moderate candidates and do not think it healthy to have two families dominate the White House for half a century are horrified at this election.The Republicans are a horror show, except possibly John Kasich. Where is the moderate candidate who will aim for compromise, but is not compromised himself or herself?DAVID MACHLOWITZWestfield, N.J.To the Editor:Gender is not Hillary Clinton\u2019s only qualification but is clearly an asset.Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright\u2019s comments, calling on young women who support Bernie Sanders essentially to get with the program, should be cheered rather than disparaged. We have them to thank for the increase of women at the table of public discourse and in high levels of management and finance.It is impossible to deny the role that they and other brave colleagues have played in opening up doors of opportunity and spaces of safety for women of all ages and all social, ethnic, religious and racial backgrounds.In 2008, America\u2019s voting public had a particularly challenging decision to make, and chose to elect an exciting new leader, Barack Obama, and simultaneously turn around centuries of racial discrimination.The challenge in 2016 is to carefully review Mrs. Clinton\u2019s qualifications and professional experiences \u2014 not her style, not her age \u2014 but most definitely her gender and all that means in terms of further advancing the rights of all women.

{"Headline": "A Failed Auction? Might Be Nice.", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsDeutsche Bank is making investors an offer they should refuse. The German bank on Friday offered to buy back 5 billion euros of its senior unsecured bonds, after a week in which its shares went on a roller-coaster ride. A big takeup would generate more capital for Deutsche, but it could also imply a lack of confidence in the bank\u2019s solvency. Given the potential for bond prices to snap back, it may be better for investors to sit on the sidelines.Banks have many reasons to buy back debt. For Deutsche, it\u2019s a blend of bullish messaging and opportunism. Its bond prices have sunk sharply after concerns over the global economy and whether the bank would cut off coupons on some of its equity-like capital instruments. The Deutsche Bank chief executive, John Cryan, insists the bank is solid as a rock.By buying back the debt, Deutsche can lock in a small profit, as some of the debt is trading at high yields \u2014 below par value, in other words. Investors might see this as a good deal, too: Deutsche is offering a small bump on the current market price. It is offering, for example, to buy a bond maturing in 2021 at 94.4 percent of par, versus a current trading price on Feb. 11 of about 92.Still, selling could end up looking pretty shortsighted. A week ago the same bond was trading around 97 percent of par. An investor might have other reasons to sell: It\u2019s hard to shift large quantities of bonds in current markets, and some asset managers may be grappling with outflows. But if they have any confidence in Deutsche \u2014 and there is no reason to doubt its solvency more now compared to two weeks ago \u2014 then they should expect the price to be above the bank\u2019s offer pretty soon.For both lender and bondholder, the best result would be a low takeup. That would show that bondholders have more faith in Deutsche than market prices right now suggest. Although the buyback is a logical move, this is one case where a failed auction might be a good outcome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Hard-Liners Cling to the Past", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byEditorialIt happens nearly every February: Iranian hard-line organizations make a symbolic gesture to breathe new life into the fatwa against the author Salman Rushdie. The fatwa, declared on Feb. 14, 1989, by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called for Mr. Rushdie to be killed for his novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which was deemed blasphemous.True to form, on Monday, 40 Iranian news agencies announced they had raised $600,000 to add to the bounty on Mr. Rushdie. In theory, that bounty now stands at nearly $4 million, although it\u2019s far from clear that the money would ever be paid. But that is not the point. Monday\u2019s announcement has far more to do with power struggles in Iran ahead of Friday\u2019s elections for seats in Iran\u2019s Parliament and its Assembly of Experts (a group of 88 senior clerics) than it does with Mr. Rushdie.Though Iran\u2019s hard-line political leaders have stacked the electoral deck in their favor by culling reformists from the roster of approved candidates, they are taking no chances that moderates might be elected. Since a large voter turnout is thought to favor moderate candidates, dragging up the old fatwa against Mr. Rushdie is, as the reformist journalist Mojgan Faraji observed, intended to overshadow the elections and cause a stir to make \u201cother issues more important than voting.\u201dThe hard-liners are right be nervous. The BBC\u2019s Persian social media team reports that the hashtag #ImVoting is gaining momentum, a sign that Iranians will be turning out in big numbers.As long as the fatwa remains in place, the threat to Mr. Rushdie will never entirely disappear. Though Mr. Rushdie has been able to move on with his writing and his life, 27 years after the fatwa was pronounced, it\u2019s long past time for Iran to end it and focus on the work of rebuilding the country\u2019s economy and improving Iranian lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Ukrainian Ex-Premier\u2019s Visit to Washington Highlights Obstacles Facing Peace Pact ", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byMs. Tymoshenko\u2019s comments, though not new, were particularly notable given that she made them in Washington. The United States has been one of the new Ukrainian government\u2019s strongest allies and one of its main supporters in securing help to prevent an economic collapse, including billions in credit from the International Monetary Fund.Wrapping up a weeklong visit in which she met with top administration officials and members of Congress, Ms. Tymoshenko, 55, also said that she would push for early parliamentary elections \u2014 \u201cthe sooner, the better\u201d \u2014 which are opposed by the United States because the parties of President Petro O. Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk are virtually certain to lose seats.The two men are considered allies of the West. But both have been dogged by criticism that they have failed to sufficiently root out endemic corruption. This week, Ukraine\u2019s economy minister, Aivaras Abromavicius, abruptly quit his post, saying, \u201cIt has become clear that any kind of systemic reform is decisively blocked.\u201dThe continuing corruption and the failure to carry out the Minsk accord have prompted some frustration among American and European officials. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with Mr. Poroshenko for four hours on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month and was said to have pressed the Ukrainian leader on both fronts.In an interview in her hotel suite at the Willard InterContinental, near the White House, Ms. Tymoshenko said that the Minsk agreement was flawed because it combined political and military issues, and that Ukraine could not move forward with regional elections until it had greater assurances regarding its security, including control of the border with Russia.She said that early parliamentary elections were needed to build public legitimacy and to \u201creboot\u201d the government before the constitutional changes \u2014 which would grant greater autonomy to the disputed eastern regions \u2014 could win approval. But only Mr. Poroshenko can call early elections, and both he and Ukraine\u2019s Western allies oppose the idea.Modern Russia has inflamed conflict in former Soviet republics to create \u201cfrozen zones,\u201d allowing it to influence events and confound its opponents.In a bid to push the peace deal forward, Victoria J. Nuland, an assistant secretary of state, met last month with Vladislav Surkov, a senior adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin, in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The accord will also be a main topic of discussion next week at the annual Munich Security Conference, where Mr. Poroshenko is expected to come under heavy pressure from American and European officials to move ahead with the constitutional changes, as a precursor to elections in eastern Ukraine.But Ms. Tymoshenko said that Ukraine\u2019s Western allies appeared to be putting their own political interests first.Ms. Tymoshenko spent 28 months in prison as the nemesis of former President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted in the Maidan revolution two years ago. She was released in February 2014, a day after Mr. Yanukovych fled Kiev, the capital.She is hardly uncontroversial. Although her jailing was viewed as political, voters were clearly wary of her after she emerged from prison, and she and her party have struggled because of their association with past Ukrainian administrations notorious for entrenched corruption and pervasive mismanagement.Ms. Tymoshenko is widely known to harbor continuing national political ambitions. Her opposition to the constitutional changes and her push for early elections undoubtedly reflect a move to capitalize on the falling popularity and perceived political weakness of Mr. Poroshenko and Mr. Yatsenyuk.The minority faction that her party, Fatherland, controls in Parliament does not by itself have enough votes to block the constitutional changes. But the changes, which can be approved only by a supermajority of 300 out of 450 votes, are also opposed by another influential minority party, Self-Reliance, and by numerous other lawmakers.Ms. Tymoshenko said that pushing too quickly to carry out the accord could allow Russia to retain the ability to destabilize Ukraine politically at Mr. Putin\u2019s whim.\u201cIt seems to me a fundamental mistake to try to end the Ukrainian conflict at any price,\u201d she said.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Immigration Message May Resound in New Hampshire", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported by\u201cAmericans go through security before they get on a plane, enter a government building or attend a ballgame,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cBut folks who come here illegally? They just walk across the border. That\u2019s wrong.\u201dEven so, it had a powerful impact, helping Mr. Brown survive a crowded primary and make the race with the incumbent senator, Jeanne Shaheen, competitive. It also prodded Ms. Shaheen to distance herself from President Obama\u2019s planned executive orders on immigration.\u201cScott did something that the national party was actually arguing against,\u201d said Eric Fehrnstrom, a consultant for Mr. Brown in that race. \u201cIt worked for him.\u201dMr. Brown narrowly lost that contest, 51 percent to 49, but his campaign recognized something that the national party seemed for months to miss: The party\u2019s base was deeply angry, and white working-class voters, like those in New Hampshire, felt neglected by and alienated from the political system.Mr. Trump has emerged as the champion of those voters who feel neglected, in large part by viscerally amplifying Mr. Brown\u2019s message that the borders are not secure, America is not safe from terrorism, the economy is lagging and immigrants are poised to do harm to the United States. Mr. Brown, as it happens, endorsed Mr. Trump this week.These themes, which have helped propel Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension in the polls, might also help him regain his trajectory after a loss in Iowa. Immigration is one of the few issues where Mr. Trump is to the right of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and one where he can puncture Senator Marco Rubio of Florida as too moderate.\u201cNow, they\u2019re all trying to be tougher than me \u2014 nobody can be tougher than me,\u201d Mr. Trump said Tuesday night at the rally in New Hampshire where Mr. Brown endorsed him.The Brown campaign was not alone in deploying a focus on national security and immigration in the midterm races two years ago.Other Republicans sensed the growing anxieties of voters: Representative David Brat of Virginia beat Eric Cantor, the incumbent congressman and a member of the Republican leadership, in their 2014 primary race by combining worries about immigration and terrorism. And Senator Thom Tillis used a similar message in North Carolina.Soon after Mr. Brat\u2019s victory, attempts at a comprehensive immigration overhaul crumbled in Congress, and Mr. Obama announced plans for executive actions to halt some deportations. National Republicans became less fearful of their candidates\u2019 talking about illegal immigration at that point, and it was a topic in several races.Still, after the 2014 midterms in November, Republicans and business leaders believed they had found a way to placate voters\u2019 fears and contain the insurgencies, a conclusion that turned out to be far from correct.\u201cTrump is hitting a message that has been building in the country for some time,\u201d said Greg Mueller, a Republican strategist who advised the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan when he challenged President George Bush in the Republican primary in New Hampshire in 1992. Candidates positioning themselves otherwise in the primary, such as by supporting immigration reform, he added, \u201cmay as well be committing political suicide.\u201d\u201cMust we absorb all the people of the world into our society, and submerge our historic character as a predominantly Caucasian Western society?\u201d said Mr. Buchanan to the columnist George Will at the time.\u201cI\u2019m surprised nobody picked up on it prior to him,\u201d Michael Dunbar, a local conservative activist, said of Mr. Trump. Mr. Dunbar led the \u201cDraft Trump\u201d movement in 1987, when the real estate developer was promoting his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\u201cThe border has been an issue for a decade,\u201d Mr. Dunbar said, comparing concerns about illegal border crossings to worries about a terrorist threat.\u201cI live in a small town in Hampton, New Hampshire. I don\u2019t worry a whole lot about terrorists. But if I got to a city, I\u2019ve got to be aware here. I shouldn\u2019t have to do that in my country.\u201dMr. Brown was among the first to use the immigration issue in ads in Senate contests in the 2014 midterm races. He ultimately aired three spots, all of them insinuating a threat in more muted tones than Mr. Trump has used.\u201cScott was careful to stress the need for compassion when addressing the immigration crisis and avoided using caustic immigration rhetoric so that he didn\u2019t alienate independent voters who can tip the balance of New Hampshire elections,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked on the Brown campaign.But by the end of the race, Mr. Brown said he was voicing \u201crational fears\u201d of voters, and yoked immigration concerns to the Ebola outbreak in the fall of 2014.For voters concerned about illegal immigration, the issue cuts against a rigid view in New Hampshire that laws are meant to be enforced.In interviews, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s ardent supporters have frequently mentioned immigration as a reason for supporting him, even echoing those ads from Mr. Brown.\u201cI\u2019m a Polish immigrant; my parents came over from Poland in the 1930s, and my grandparents,\u201d said Carol Le Lacheur, the former daughter-in-law of a local official in Lowell, Mass., just over the border from New Hampshire, who attended a rally of 7,500 people for Mr. Trump.\u201cThey taught us to work hard, to be loyal to this country.\u201dHer family, she said, came to the country legally.\u201cThey told their candidates to support a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants as a way to increase outreach to Hispanics,\u201d said Mr. Fehrnstrom, who also advised Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race.\u201cAnd candidates who followed that advice are struggling. Donald Trump went in the opposite direction and he has total command of the 2016 field.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the result of the 1992 Republican primary in New Hampshire. The winner was President George Bush, not Patrick J. Buchanan, who challenged him in the primary.Advertisement"}

But all good \u2013 or less bad \u2013 things must come to an end, and many are encouraging investors to prepare for a shift in leadership and a prolonged period of relative strength overseas.\u201cIn the rest of 2016 you\u2019re going to have lots of opportunities in foreign markets, more than in the U.S.,\u201d said Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consultancy. \u201cForeign markets have had better valuations, and they\u2019re correcting much more sharply.\u201dFundamental factors like the interest-rate policies of central banks also could make prospects more favorable for foreign stocks. The Federal Reserve just raised rates for the first time since before the financial crisis and signaled that it would do so four more times this year, although Wall Street is skeptical that domestic economic growth will warrant such aggressive credit-tightening. Other central banks, meanwhile, are headed the opposite way.\u201cMonetary policy and business-cycle differences play in favor of international markets,\u201d said Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank. \u201cCentral banks in the eurozone and Japan are easing. More than easing in the eurozone; they\u2019re catching up to where the U.S. was four years ago.\u201dThe European Central Bank has been especially loose with credit as it tries to undo the damage caused by its earlier reluctance to match the Fed\u2019s efforts to flood the financial system with money. The Fed\u2019s quantitative easing program \u2013 purchases of Treasury bonds and other instruments \u2013 ended last year.Mr. Wieting encourages investing in Europe and oil importers like Japan that benefit from depressed prices. He would avoid countries with economies that depend on resource production, notably Brazil, South Africa and Canada.David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Asset Management, says that \u201cEurope is looking a lot more promising,\u201d but he finds it \u201cvery hard to see Japan make any sustained progress\u201d because of its low population growth and the likelihood of a change in government policy away from weakening the yen. A stronger currency would create difficulties for Japanese exporters.There are enough difficulties in enough places for Hank Herrmann, chief executive of the asset manager Waddell & Reed, to recommend caution before venturing anywhere too far afield. American stocks represent safety to him in an unsafe world.\u201cI still think there\u2019s enough uncertainty that staying home makes a lot of sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difference between foreign and domestic may not be sufficient to overcome the uncertainties.\u201dMr. Sri-Kumar acknowledges that much can still go wrong in foreign markets, especially in the developing world. In fact, he\u2019s looking forward to it.\u201cI was negative on emerging markets for quite a while, but with things falling apart, I\u2019m getting superoptimistic,\u201d he said. He sees those markets, and markets dominated by commodity producers, reaching the capitulation stage, where downturns have gone on for so long and prospects look so bleak that investors just give up. That\u2019s often when a lasting low occurs.His advice is to invest gradually in diversified baskets of emerging markets and commodities, either directly or through shares of companies that produce them, over the next six months, feeding in the same dollar amount at regular intervals.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a terrific pick beginning in March,\u201d Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted. \u201cThe timing could not be better, especially in emerging markets.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Venues Put Milan on the Contemporary Art Map", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byA player piano sounded an evocative refrain. Light boxes resembling old-time movie marquees were suspended from the soaring ceiling. Shadows floated by on the walls, giving viewers a sense of movement through time and space. In the next room, Anselm Kiefer\u2019s \u201cSeven Celestial Palaces\u201d rose high into the air.A few years ago, it would have been rare to find a major work by a leading cross-disciplinary artist like Mr. Parreno on view in Italy. But HangarBicocca and other venues across Milan have put the city back on the contemporary art map. The new luster seems to come from the alchemy of wealthy private enterprise, a public administration open to experimentation and a young, cosmopolitan professional class hungry for culture.Although elegant, Milan has never been considered gorgeous. Traveling south from France, the 19th-century author Henry James once called it \u201crather perhaps the last of the prose capitals than the first of the poetic.\u201d Both HangarBicocca and the Prada Foundation are in the formerly industrial outskirts of the city, a textbook case of culture\u2019s role in a postmanufacturing economy.In the heart of the city, near the central train station, rises a monument from a different era: Gi\u00f2 Ponti and Pier Luigi Nervi\u2019s Pirelli skyscraper, the symbol of Italy\u2019s postwar economic boom. It now houses government offices for the Lombardy region. That afternoon some of its windows were lit to spell out \u201cFamily Day,\u201d in support of a demonstration against a bill before Parliament that would legalize civil unions.If Italy has always been pulled between conservatism and innovation, then Milan \u2014 the country\u2019s capital of finance, fashion and publishing \u2014 has generally pointed toward the future. (In addition to the early 20th-century Futurism movement, the city also produced the media powerhouse-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi, whose model for creating a viewership and transforming it into an electorate may have been ahead of its time.)Since its opening, the Prada Foundation has become one of the most dynamic cultural spaces in Europe. \u201cPeople love coming in and out,\u201d Ms. Welter said. \u201cThe exhibition spaces are large but not overwhelming. We don\u2019t call it a museum.\u201dShe was sitting over tea at a mint-green retro Formica table in the Prada Foundation\u2019s Bar Luce. It was designed by the director Wes Anderson , inspired by classic Milan bars from the \u201950s and \u201960s but also echoes elements from his films \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d and \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\u201d Outside, people headed to the cinema for a sold-out film series co-curated by the director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.The foundation\u2019s complex has the feel of a Hollywood back lot. The permanent collection favors works with color and texture \u2014 they were, after all, collected by Miuccia Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli.A separate building covered in gold leaf glows in the evening light. It is filled with works by Robert Gober and Louise Bourgeois, like an avant-garde haunted house. A large tower with more exhibition space is under construction.The Prada Foundation has been organizing shows in temporary venues since the 1990s. In this, it is more akin to Moscow\u2019s Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, which presented cutting-edge exhibitions before opening a permanent space last year, also designed by Mr. Koolhaas, than it is to the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, which opened in a Frank Gehry building in 2014 but is still finding its way in a culture-saturated city.\u201cThe big scale is perfect for art and utopian projects,\u201d Ms. Welter said of the complex\u2019s more than 118,000 square feet of exhibition space.That afternoon, the Polish artist Goshka Macuga was putting the finishing touches on \u201cTo the Son of Man Who Ate the Scroll,\u201d an exhibition that runs through June 19 and features a humanoid android who delivers speeches culled from world history. Ms. Macuga filled another space with 73 bronze heads of historical and contemporary figures, including Albert Einstein, Karl Marx and Aaron Swartz, the Internet activist who committed suicide in 2013.Ms. Macuga, who works in London, said her exhibit asked a central question: \u201cAre we still human?\u201d\u201cAre we still in human time or in a posthuman era?\u201d she continued. She was standing in a room with seven metal assembly lines on which mechanical tools drew images from art history.Hers isn\u2019t the only thought-provoking art project in Milan at the moment. Across town, HangarBicocca is showing \u201cSpace Shuttle in the Garden,\u201d on view through March 13, in which the Kosovar artist Petrit Halilaj uses everything from dirt to video installations for a multimedia exploration of a lost homeland and a search for utopia.In many ways, the Prada Foundation and HangarBicocca complement each other.\u201cPeople that come to Milan and see both institutions will really have access to a wide variety of positions, and that I think is what makes a city richer,\u201d said Vicente Todol\u00ed, the artistic director of HangarBicocca since 2013, after the Pirelli Foundation took over the programming and refurbished the space, which had opened as a contemporary art venue in 2004.Last year, when Milan hosted the Expo world\u2019s fair, HangarBicocca had 200,000 visitors; the Prada Foundation would say only that its attendance since opening had exceeded expectations.He divided the unforgivingly huge space into three sections. Mr. Kiefer\u2019s \u201cSeven Celestial Palaces,\u201d a site-specific work from 2004 in which seven cement towers rise 46 to 60 feet into the air, has been cordoned off from the other areas. Several large-scale paintings by Mr. Kiefer were hung on the walls last year. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a symphonic orchestra to play when another one is playing,\u201d Mr. Todol\u00ed said.In the other room, the sounds of Mr. Parreno\u2019s \u201cHypothesis\u201d filled the air.Advertisement"}

She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking the talk, but not walking the walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Harpootlian, who supported Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaigns and then backed President Obama in 2008 and 2012, comes with a limited political network given that many prominent South Carolina Democrats have endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Harpootlian does have a knack for attracting news media coverage for his chosen candidates, and Mr. Sanders is far less known in South Carolina than Mrs. Clinton. But he also has a history of offensive statements.In 2012, as state party chairman, Mr. Harpootlian compared Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, with Hitler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistress, Eva Braun. He also used the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cretard\u00e2\u0080\u009d to refer to other Republican leaders, and years earlier insinuated that Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was gay by calling him \u00e2\u0080\u009clight in his loafers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Harpootlian may be best remembered for showing up at a South Carolina campaign event in 2008 that Mr. Clinton was holding for his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign. There, Mr. Harpootlian told reporters that the Clinton campaign was using \u00e2\u0080\u009creprehensible\u00e2\u0080\u009d tactics against the Obama campaign and accused the former president of lying about Mr. Obama in order to continue \u00e2\u0080\u009csome kind of Clinton dynasty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton dismissed the remark but then let loose with a torrent of criticism against the Obama campaign, Mr. Harpootlian and the news media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a public outburst that was unusual for Mr. Clinton and that cast a pall over the primary race, which Mrs. Clinton went on to lose.Mr. Harpootlian said he warned Mr. Sanders recently that his endorsement came \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith some baggage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He described the senator as unconcerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Sanders said he understood that I was supposed to be a pitbull and attack dog when I was party chairman, and sometimes you get carried away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Harpootlian said. He added that he did not plan to apologize for his past remarks.Mr. Sanders has been insistent that he will not run a negative campaign against Mrs. Clinton or harshly attack her. When asked about Mr. Harpootlian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of negative remarks, Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be responsible for views of people who support Senator Sanders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment on the endorsement.The endorsement is something of a reversal for Mr. Harpootlian, who said last year that he did not see himself supporting Mr. Sanders because the senator was a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocialist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since then, Mr. Harpootlian said, he has become comfortable with Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s philosophy of democratic socialism \u00e2\u0080\u009csince it does not involve government control of the economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said he supported the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan for broad-based tax increases to finance a single-payer health care system because, according to Mr. Sanders, the tax increases would be offset by savings in health care costs.Mr. Harpootlian is a crucial South Carolina ally of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and he had been involved with the ultimately unsuccessful efforts to encourage Mr. Biden to run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Harpootlian said he asked Mr. Biden last month if he might change his mind and enter the race; the vice president said no, according to Mr. Harpootlian, prompting him to give Mr. Sanders a closer look. Mr. Harpootlian said he did not discuss the Sanders endorsement with Mr. Biden.Mrs. Clinton has a double-digit lead over Mr. Sanders in recent South Carolina polls, and she has the support of many elected and former officials, including two former governors, Jim Hodges and Richard Riley, and many mayors and others, including former Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston. She also has strong support from black Democrats in the state, a key part of the electorate that Mr. Sanders is trying to court. Mrs. Clinton, who won a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, and Mr. Sanders are now campaigning in New Hampshire before the primary there on Tuesday.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Cranks on Top", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byThe thing is, one of the two men who may still have a good chance of becoming the Republican nominee is a scary character. His notions on foreign policy seem to boil down to the belief that America can bully everyone into doing its bidding, and that engaging in diplomacy is a sign of weakness. His ideas on domestic policy are deeply ignorant and irresponsible, and would be disastrous if put into effect.The other man, of course, has very peculiar hair.But what I do know is that one shouldn\u2019t treat establishment support as an indication that Mr. Rubio is moderate and sensible. On the contrary, not long ago someone holding his policy views would have been considered a fringe crank.Let me leave aside Mr. Rubio\u2019s terrifying statements on foreign policy and his evident willingness to make a bonfire of civil liberties, and focus on what I know best, economics.In short, Mr. Rubio is peddling crank economics. What\u2019s interesting, however, is why. You see, he\u2019s not pandering to ignorant voters; he\u2019s pandering to an ignorant elite.So when Mr. Rubio genuflects at the altars of supply-side economics and hard money, he isn\u2019t telling ordinary Republicans what they want to hear \u2014 by and large the party\u2019s base couldn\u2019t care less. He is, instead, pandering to the party\u2019s elite, consisting mainly of big donors and the network of apparatchiks at think tanks, media organizations, and so on.In the G.O.P., crank doctrines in economics and elsewhere aren\u2019t bubbling up from below, they\u2019re being imposed from the top down.What this means, in turn, is that Mr. Rubio\u2019s consolidation of establishment support isn\u2019t a testament to his good sense. In fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite, a reward for his willingness to echo party orthodoxy even, or perhaps especially, when it\u2019s nonsense.So don\u2019t let anyone tell you that the Republican primary is a fight between a crazy guy and someone reasonable. It\u2019s idiosyncratic, self-invented crankery versus establishment-approved crankery, and it\u2019s not at all clear which is worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Milwaukee", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate in Milwaukee, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.WOODRUFF: Good evening, and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.WOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you\u2019re going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook. We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.IFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight. This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you\u2019re watching \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Democrat, a Republican, or neither \u2014 because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too. With that, let\u2019s welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) Very good to be here with you.CLINTON: Thank you.IFILL: Welcome to you both.WOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.IFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America\u2019s heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now let\u2019s turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first.SANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you. Nine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months. And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.SANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that\u2019s an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We\u2019re spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you.IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I\u2019m running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. There aren\u2019t enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women\u2019s work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.WOODRUFF: Thank you both. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you both. And we\u2019ll be right back after a short break to begin questions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Let\u2019s get right to the questions. Senator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they\u2019re asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It\u2019s already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going \u2014 getting poorer. What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating. Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.WOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...SANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I\u2019ve seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans \u2014 let\u2019s take healthcare for example. Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don\u2019t add up, and that\u2019s a promise that cannot be kept, and it\u2019s really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people\u2019s lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.SANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they\u2019re going to lose their CHIP program. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We\u2019re not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can\u2019t even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don\u2019t know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle \u2014 the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. (APPLAUSE) And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama\u2019s principal accomplishment \u2014 namely the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I\u2019ve set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it\u2019s Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. So if you\u2019re having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don\u2019t add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.IFILL: Final thought, Senator.SANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country \u2014 the United States \u2014 which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people. Please do not tell me that in this country, if \u2014 and here\u2019s the if \u2014 we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.CLINTON: Well, let me just \u2014 let me just say, once again... (APPLAUSE) ... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: I\u2019d like to move along. I\u2019d like to move along. Secretary Clinton, you might \u2014 you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d You may remember that. When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?CLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case, whether it\u2019s health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward. I\u2019ve tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I\u2019m aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.CLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can\u2019t keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people\u2019s lives.IFILL: But I haven\u2019t heard either of you put a price tag on your \u2014 you say... (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing. And I think once I\u2019m in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.IFILL: Senator?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. We need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. Yes, I\u2019m going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession \u2014 Great Depression. Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. We differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don\u2019t have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it\u2019s hard to get to where we need to go. And Senator Sanders\u2019s plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Next, we\u2019re going to...SANDERS: A brief response.WOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you.SANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign \u2014 you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president. But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you?CLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it\u2019s most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I\u2019m going to keep making that case. I\u2019m going to keep making sure that everything I\u2019ve done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m working towards. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there\u2019s a special place in Hell for women who don\u2019t support other women. Do you agree with what she said?CLINTON: Well, look, I think that she\u2019s been saying that for as long as I\u2019ve known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn\u2019t change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always stood for. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we\u2019re going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that\u2019s at the core of my campaign. I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we\u2019ve had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we\u2019ll take our progress wherever we can find it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, you\u2019re in the minority, but we still want to hear from you. (LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian- Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. I am very proud, if my memory is not correct \u2014 I think I am \u2014 that I have a lifetime \u2014 and I\u2019ve been in Congress a few years \u2014 a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. I\u2019m very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other \u2014 the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?SANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have said \u2014 I have said many times, you know, I\u2019m not asking people to support me because I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019m asking people to support me because I think I\u2019m the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief. (APPLAUSE) And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders\u2019 voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I\u2019ve been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women\u2019s health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.CLINTON: I\u2019m very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women\u2019s issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women\u2019s rights. So I\u2019m asking women, I\u2019m asking men, to support me because I\u2019m ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Final comment.SANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question women\u2019s rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We\u2019re going to cut Social Security to help you. We\u2019re going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. If that\u2019s not hypocrisy, I don\u2019t know what hypocrisy is. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you both.IFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we\u2019ve been following of undecided voters. The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: \u201cWisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin\u2019s incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country\u2019s rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?\u201d Senator Sanders.SANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama\u2019s policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.CLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that\u2019s one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn\u2019t happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. But, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. (APPLAUSE) We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up \u2014 we\u2019re shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do. But, here is a pledge I\u2019ve made throughout this campaign, and it\u2019s really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here\u2019s my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation\u2019s first African American has not been able to?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President\u2019s office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama\u2019s work with young women. But, we can\u2019t rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it\u2019s going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we\u2019re going to enforce the law, we\u2019re going to change policing practices, we\u2019re going to change incarceration practices, but we\u2019re also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.(APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders? (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African- American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration \u2014 which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother \u2014 clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.WOODRUFF: So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they\u2019ve been?SANDERS: Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they\u2019re not hanging out on street corners. We\u2019re going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. And I think when you give low-income kids \u2014 African-American, white, Latino kids \u2014 the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. They\u2019re going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color. I want to talk about white people, OK?SANDERS: White people?IFILL: I know. (LAUGHTER) So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working- class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don\u2019t they have a reason to be resentful, Senator \u2014 Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Look, I am deeply concerned about what\u2019s happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And I\u2019m going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has \u2014 the 10-20-30 proposal \u2014 to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans \u2014 particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have \u2014 you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that\u2019s why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator \u2014 Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to \u2014 am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?SANDERS: Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue.SANDERS: And here\u2019s what the economic issue is. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. You once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. They\u2019re off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. What have you got now? You are working at McDonald\u2019s? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They\u2019re making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. And that\u2019s why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that\u2019s why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you. Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits. Would you go further than that? And if so, how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: The answer is yes. We\u2019ve got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act. And in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. And let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn\u2019t do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I strongly support the president\u2019s executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. I am against the raids. I\u2019m against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. I\u2019m a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary\u2019s position. In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they\u2019d be thrown out of this country. So it wasn\u2019t just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. But we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.CLINTON: Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. I\u2019ve also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy\u2019s bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: I\u2019d like...SANDERS: Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don\u2019t apologize for that vote. But in terms of the children, I don\u2019t know to whom you\u2019re sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don\u2019t think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, that just wasn\u2019t \u2014 that just wasn\u2019t the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. So we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I\u2019ve called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: If you would allow me now to move on, we\u2019ve been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, \u201cMy father\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes, \u201cMy father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid\u2019s family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?\u201d Start with you, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, we\u2019re not doing particularly well.SANDERS: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors \u2014 and I\u2019ve talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country \u2014 who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can\u2019t get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. And here\u2019s an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. (APPLAUSE) And when we \u2014 and when we do that, we don\u2019t do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don\u2019t have decent nutrition, where they can\u2019t heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I think \u2014 I think it\u2019s fair to say we don\u2019t have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don\u2019t believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.SANDERS: In all due respect... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal? Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We\u2019re asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this.CLINTON: Well, Senator, look, I think we\u2019re in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you\u2019re describing that the \u2014 raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been...SANDERS: That\u2019s my bill. Check it out.CLINTON: Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I\u2019m going to come up with the best way forward. We\u2019re going to end up in the same place. We\u2019re going to get more revenue. I\u2019m going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: We\u2019re going to move on. Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.WOODRUFF: You have said that there\u2019s no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?CLINTON: I can\u2019t speak for the Koch Brothers, you\u2019re referring to a Super PAC that we don\u2019t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. Let\u2019s talk about our campaigns. I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, I\u2019m proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think it\u2019s great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. That\u2019s the way it should be, and I\u2019m going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what\u2019s happening right now on the Republican side. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. We\u2019re going to fight it as hard as we can, and we\u2019re going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: I\u2019m asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.SANDERS: What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We don\u2019t represent Wall Street, we don\u2019t represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I\u2019m the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until \u2014 and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now, Secretary Clinton\u2019s Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I\u2019m very proud of that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator Sanders, are you saying...CLINTON: We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I\u2019m very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. It\u2019s not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can\u2019t be independent. I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930\u2019s. So, let\u2019s not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it\u2019s Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what\u2019s best for the American people.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The people aren\u2019t dumb. Why in God\u2019s name does Wall Street... (APPLAUSE) But let\u2019s not \u2014 but let\u2019s not \u2014 let\u2019s not insult \u2014 let\u2019s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren\u2019t dumb. Why in God\u2019s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. (LAUGHTER) Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay \u2014 spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? (APPLAUSE) And when we talk about Wall Street, let\u2019s talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd- Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, let\u2019s just \u2014 let\u2019s just follow up on this, because, you know, I\u2019ve made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that\u2019s a major accomplishment. I agree, however, it doesn\u2019t go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that I\u2019ve proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if that\u2019s appropriate. But let\u2019s not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these... (CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: We have to go to a break. We...SANDERS: Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. That\u2019s my view. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back, we\u2019re going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.IFILL: There\u2019s a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.(BREAK)WOODRUFF: Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders. Senator, it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio. And he asks: \u201cAre there any areas of government you would like to reduce?\u201dSANDERS: Hey, I\u2019m in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn\u2019t think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken. I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.IFILL: How about you, Senator Clinton \u2014 Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities. I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we\u2019re taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don\u2019t need anymore. And that\u2019s what I intend to do.SANDERS: If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you\u2019re going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America\u2019s role in the world. Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here. According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can\u2019t win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we?CLINTON: Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it\u2019s a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven\u2019t done enough. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS \u2014 that\u2019s not the only one, but let\u2019s focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. And we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. Here at home, we\u2019ve got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it\u2019s needed. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what\u2019s happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others... (APPLAUSE) ... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. It\u2019s not only offensive; it\u2019s dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. (APPLAUSE) And you don\u2019t go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.IFILL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: Let me just say this. What a president of the United States has got to do \u2014 and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility \u2014 is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect... ... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn\u2019t believe them. And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it\u2019s to understand what happens the day after. And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. But this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It\u2019s very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. And it\u2019s important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You\u2019ve got a bit of experience, I would imagine. But judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it. But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.SANDERS: That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.CLINTON: You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think it\u2019s important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. I looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the president\u2019s decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I\u2019m proud that I gave him that advice. And I\u2019m very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, one area very briefly...WOODRUFF: Just a final word.SANDERS: Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate \u2014 and I believe in her book \u2014 very good book, by the way \u2014 in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. (APPLAUSE) I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger\u2019s actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.SANDERS: Well, it ain\u2019t Henry Kissinger. That\u2019s for sure.CLINTON: That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fine. (LAUGHTER) You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) So if we want to pick and choose \u2014 and I certainly do \u2014 people I listen to, people I don\u2019t listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it\u2019s a big, complicated world out there.SANDERS: It is.CLINTON: And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I find \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. That\u2019s what he talked about, the great threat of China. And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you\u2019re right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he\u2019s urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator, let me \u2014 let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that\u2019s Russia. On the one hand, we\u2019re aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.WOODRUFF: Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead \u2014 that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all \u2014 have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS. So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared \u2014 how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.SANDERS: Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As you\u2019ve indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed \u2014 men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country \u2014 their own country - - it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let\u2019s be clear: Russia\u2019s aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO \u2014 correctly, I believe \u2014 are saying, you know what, we\u2019re going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he\u2019s trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.SANDERS: Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what\u2019s left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease- fire up as quickly as possible. But I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. This is incredibly complicated, because we\u2019ve got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. This is one of the areas I\u2019ve disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. So let\u2019s support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let\u2019s hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what\u2019s left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So we\u2019ve got some real work to do, and let\u2019s try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me just \u2014 just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree \u2014 and I think the president does not agree with her \u2014 in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let\u2019s hope that it holds.SANDERS: But furthermore, what we have got to do, I\u2019m sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba. And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That\u2019s how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos. Yes, they\u2019ve got to get out of Syria. They\u2019ve got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: No, I think the idea was that president \u2014 then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It\u2019s easier to talk to your friends. It\u2019s harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day. Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing. If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they\u2019re going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. And it\u2019s especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular.CLINTON: This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.SANDERS: A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we\u2019ve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about. So I believe that working with Europe \u2014 and, by the way, you know, we\u2019ve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well. But I think this is a worldwide \u2014 that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we\u2019re seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. He\u2019s a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts. He says, \u201cThe world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders \u2014 one American and one foreign \u2014 who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as \u2014 why are they influential?\u201dSANDERS: You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That\u2019s not the role of the government. And when FDR said, \u201cYeah, it is,\u201d that we\u2019re going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. And kind of \u2014 that\u2019s what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don\u2019t give up on the political process. don\u2019t listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill\u2019s politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.CLINTON: But I want to \u2014 I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers\u2019 remorse when it comes to President Obama\u2019s leadership and legacy. And I just couldn\u2019t agree \u2014 disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president... (APPLAUSE)The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.CLINTON: ... who got us out of that... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a \u2014 the kind of criticism that we\u2019ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.SANDERS: That is... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world\u2019s financial system is on the verge of collapse. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. You\u2019re right. Maybe you haven\u2019t. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. That\u2019s what I said. That is what I believe. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re- election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don\u2019t agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re- election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. As a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.IFILL: Senator, if you would like respond to \u2014 you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.SANDERS: Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this. There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. This campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don\u2019t think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it\u2019s like going to the moon. It ain\u2019t going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.SANDERS: What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. Thank you all very much. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: You know, we \u2014 we agree that we\u2019ve got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. But here\u2019s the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it\u2019s poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it\u2019s the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that\u2019s what I want to take on. And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We\u2019ve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before... (APPLAUSE) ... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You\u2019re right. But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I\u2019m going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don\u2019t think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you. Thank you Senator Clinton. Thank you, Senator Sanders. We also want to thank our partners at Facebook and our hosts here at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: And we want to thank our audience, our quiet audience here in Helen Bader Concert Hall, and to all of you watching at home. Thank you all. Stay tuned for analysis of the debate and the overall race for the Democratic nomination. That\u2019s coming up next here on PBS stations and online atPBS.org/NewsHour.IFILL: I\u2019m going to remain here in Milwaukee tomorrow evening for a special edition of Washington Week here on PBS.WOODRUFF: And I\u2019m going to be returning to Washington. I hope you\u2019ll join us for the PBS NewsHour tomorrow and every night. That\u2019s it from all of us here in Milwaukee. We thank you.IFILL: Good night. (APPLAUSE)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Is Again Put on the Defensive Over Perceived Ties to Wall Street", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Hillary Clinton appeared frustrated.Dozens of prominent economists and academic experts have endorsed her plans to regulate the financial sector. Her policies would \u201ctry to prevent the problems of the future,\u201d she explained in Thursday\u2019s debate, in addition to reining in \u201cthe excesses of Wall Street.\u201dSo why do so many voters not believe it?Throughout the debate, Mrs. Clinton found herself cornered by Senator Bernie Sanders and the moderators about her ties to Wall Street, the political contributions that have bolstered her campaign account, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars in paid speaking fees she received from Goldman Sachs and other financial firms in the months after she left the State Department.Mrs. Clinton tried again and again to explain that her plans for Wall Street would be tougher and go further than Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposals by also regulating the shadow banking industry, the insurance companies and other wrongdoers.\u201cI have a broader view,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, contrasting her plan to that of Mr. Sanders, whose anti-Wall Street message has turned him from a long-shot candidate to a serious contender for the Democratic nomination.\u201cIf all we are going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one street in our economy, we\u2019re missing the big oil companies, we\u2019re missing the other big energy companies,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cWe\u2019re missing the big picture.\u201dThe response provided a perfect opening for her populist opponent. \u201cMadam Secretary, it is not one street,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.\u201dIn an election year fueled by the anger over the growing gap between rich and poor, Mrs. Clinton, who is widely viewed as too close to the financial sector, seems an imperfect messenger for change. She has developed sophisticated policy proposals that many economists agree would aggressively regulate the financial sector, but they have collided with the image that Sanders supporters and other political rivals have painted of her: Wall Street\u2019s friend and defender.\u201cLook at my record,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said throughout the night. \u201cI have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist and I will continue to do that.\u201d\u201cI went to Wall Street before the crash,\u201d she said, recalling the warning she said she delivered to the executives in the room. \u201cI was the one saying, \u2018You\u2019re going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.\u2019\u201dThe New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Despite her husband\u2019s record of deregulation and trade deals, Mrs. Clinton has been ahead of much of the Democratic Party in identifying economic headwinds and proposing restrictions to try to deal with them.In her 2008 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton ran to the left of Barack Obama, angering some of her Wall Street donors with a 2007 speech in which she called for eliminating the so-called carried interest loophole, rolling back the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthy, placing limits on chief executives\u2019 compensation and imposing tighter regulations on derivatives. \u201cLet\u2019s finally do something about the growing inequality that is tearing our country apart,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in June 2007 at a \u201cTake Back America\u201d gathering of liberal groups.Years before Mr. Sanders\u2019s message of alleviating economic inequality thrust him onto the national stage, Mrs. Clinton said in the 2007 speech, \u201cthe top 1 percent of our households\u201d held \u201c22 percent of our nation\u2019s wealth.\u201dBut that was before the financial crises and the anger that Americans harbor because the players involved were never punished.By the time Mrs. Clinton emerged from the State Department in 2013 and, like many former cabinet officials, cashed in on the paid speaking circuit, something was stirring in the American electorate. A disaffection and disgust had sprung Occupy Wall Street on one side of the political spectrum and the Tea Party on the other. And in the middle of it was Mrs. Clinton delivering upbeat bromides about her time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat to Goldman Sachs executives for $675,000 for three speeches. \u201cYou can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t show up,\u201d she said in her standard script for paid speeches. \u201cLeadership is a team sport.\u201dAsked by CNN on Wednesday night why she accepted such a high fee, Mrs. Clinton seemed unable to fully respond. \u201cThat\u2019s what they offered,\u201d she said uncomfortably.On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton expanded on her paid speechmaking, saying she also spoke to other groups, like heart surgeons and camp counselors. But again, she seemed to struggle, this time when pressed by the moderators if she would release the transcripts of all of her paid speeches.\u201cI will look into it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the status, but I will certainly look into it.\u201dFor Mrs. Clinton, the key question should not be whether she received generous checks from Wall Street, but whether she did their bidding in return. At one point, she challenged her opponent to identify even one example of how her Wall Street contributions or paid speaking fees resulted in a favor from her, calling the implication an \u201cartful smear\u201d by Mr. Sanders. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got something to say, say it directly, but you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Sanders, eager to avoid suggestions that he is making personal or gendered attacks on Mrs. Clinton, did not bother to directly answer the question. As is his custom, returned to his old refrain: Wall Street is too big, too powerful, and no one in their right mind believes they contribute to politicians out of the goodness of their hearts. \u201cThat is what power is about,\u201d he said.But almost instantaneously, his campaign blasted out a \u201cfact check\u201d to the news media that included an excerpt from Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s 2003 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d in which she accused Mrs. Clinton of shifting her position on bankruptcy legislation when she became a New York senator to appease her Wall Street donors, a charge Mrs. Clinton has denied. \u201cShe could not afford such a principled position,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote. \u201cCampaigns cost money and that money wasn\u2019t coming from families in financial trouble.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Deal Clears Path for British Referendum on Membership", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union leaders agreed on Friday to a deal to overhaul their ties with Britain, opening the way for a high-stakes referendum on whether the bloc\u2019s most ambivalent member country will stay within the union or quit.After hours of tense talks, all 28 European Union leaders signed off on an agreement covering a variety of issues related to sovereignty, economics and migration, and intended to help keep skeptical Britons within the European Union when they vote on the matter, almost certainly in June.\u201cI believe this is enough for me to recommend that the United Kingdom remain in the European Union,\u201d said Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain after reaching the agreement at a summit meeting in Brussels, adding that the deal ensured both \u201cspecial status\u201d for his country and that \u201cBritain will never be part of a European superstate.\u201dThe referendum would be a \u201conce-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country,\u201d Mr. Cameron added.Other leaders welcomed the agreement, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who said the union had given a package to Mr. Cameron \u201cthat will enable him to elicit support in Britain for Britain remaining a member of the European Union.\u201d Mr. Cameron plans to hold a cabinet meeting on Saturday morning and is expected to hold the referendum on June 23. But the divisions within his Conservative Party were underlined by reports that a friend and cabinet colleague, Michael Gove, will campaign to leave the union, a decision that Mr. Cameron said left him \u201cdisappointed but not surprised.\u201dAnd even after the agreement, the referendum represents a huge gamble because a no vote would have huge ramifications for Europe, as well as for Britain.Already contending with a record influx of migrants and a weak economic outlook, European leaders are desperate to avoid a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d which would plunge the bloc into a new crisis, adding to uncertainty about its future.The referendum has been billed by Mr. Cameron as the moment to settle whether Britain should remain a member of the club it joined more than four decades ago. That relationship has become increasingly neuralgic amid concerns about bureaucratic meddling by European policy makers. In 2013, under pressure from right-wing euroskeptics in his own party, Mr. Cameron promised to call a referendum by the end of 2017, but said he first wanted to renegotiate British ties so he could recommend a vote to stay.His demands tested the good will of other European partners in the negotiations, which started Thursday and stretched late into Friday night.Ultimately, he appeared to win most of the battles he had fought over a draft agreement, though this is unlikely to impress euroskeptics.Mr. Cameron also secured guarantees that Britain\u2019s financial sector will not face discrimination because the British have kept the pound and have no intention of adopting the single European currency, the euro.He also achieved his demand to exempt Britain from the largely symbolic pledge to pursue \u201cever closer union,\u201d which for some euroskeptics encapsulates the pursuit of a federal Europe that would supersede the nation-state. When the bloc\u2019s treaty is next revised, it will be made clear that Britain is no longer bound by this obligation.Ms. Merkel described this as \u201can emotional issue,\u201d adding that she had agreed to the concession \u201cin the spirit of compromise.\u201dAs if those issues were not complicated enough, talks proved more difficult than expected, partly because efforts to negotiate a compromise were delayed as European leaders took time to debate migration, their other pressing concern. The overlapping threats facing the bloc were underlined on Friday by suggestions that the Greeks might block the meeting\u2019s concluding document if they did not receive reassurances that European states would not shut borders to stop migrants from moving northward. Mr. Cameron\u2019s deal initially was to be approved at an \u201cEnglish breakfast,\u201d but it was delayed first to brunch, then to the afternoon and then to an \u201cEnglish dinner.\u201d By early Saturday, the remaining differences were hammered out.Always an awkward European partner, Britain joined the forerunner of the European Union in 1973 after more than a decade of trying. Even then membership was controversial, and after he came to power in 1974, the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, held a referendum in 1975 on whether Britain should stay in what was then called the European Economic Community.Had Britain voted to leave at that point, its departure would have had relatively few implications because its membership was so new. But now, Britain is much more deeply integrated into myriad Europewide agreements in areas like international trade, climate protection and subsidies for farmers hashed out in Brussels, not London.Among Europeans, Britons are among the least enthusiastic about membership of the bloc, according to opinion surveys. Britain is a net contributor to the European Union\u2019s budget. In the 1970s, the British economy was stagnant, while continental Europe made gains, but that situation is now reversed.The bloc\u2019s long battle to save the eurozone from imploding in recent years, and its failure to craft a unified response to the migration crisis, has made the European Union look even less attractive to many Britons.Although few of the migrants arriving in Europe during the past year have made their way to Britain, immigration still is a contentious issue because Britain saw a large influx of workers from Central and Eastern Europe after countries like Poland joined the bloc in 2004.At the time, the government could have kept its labor market closed for several years \u2014 as countries such as France and Germany did \u2014 but elected not to.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Industry Shift, Sharp Looks Outside Japan for a Buyer", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byNAGOYA, Japan \u2014 One by one, Japan\u2019s famed consumer electronics companies have in the last five years given up on the business of manufacturing video displays, thwarted by lower-cost competition from South Korea and China.Each time, the Japanese government has been there to scoop up the unprofitable operations they could no longer afford to maintain. Toshiba, Hitachi, Sony \u2014 all of their display businesses were swept up into a state-financed investment fund.Foreign buyers that have tried to acquire Japanese companies have often failed \u2014 blocked by reluctant managers, a protectionist government or both \u2014 but this bid is looking like a deeper test for corporate Japan. It pits the sort of government-led industrial policy long favored by Japanese elites against the forces of a more open global market.Sharp\u2019s chief executive, Kozo Takahashi, said Sharp would take the month to make its decision. On the table are the offer from Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, and a competing one from the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, or INCJ, the government-backed fund that has been trying to consolidate the display industry.Foxconn is offering twice as much money \u2014 at least 600 billion yen, or about $5 billion \u2014 though the bids are difficult to compare directly. INCJ is promising to secure additional support from Japanese banks, whose emergency loans have kept Sharp from going under as its business has deteriorated.Mr. Takahashi suggested that Sharp\u2019s board favored the Foxconn offer, though he denied news reports that Sharp had granted Foxconn exclusive negotiating rights. Those reports, initially by the Japanese national broadcaster NHK, drove Sharp\u2019s share price higher before Mr. Takahashi\u2019s news conference, after the market closed.\u201cWe are putting more resources on studying the Hon Hai offer,\u201d Mr. Takahashi said. \u201cWe are considering the offers from the point of view of all of Sharp\u2019s stakeholders, its employees and shareholders.\u201dSharp has lost about $10 billion over the last half-decade as LCD prices have fallen and foreign rivals have grabbed its market share. It reported on Thursday a net loss of 24 billion yen for the latest quarter.INCJ has been courting Sharp for months, and was widely seen as the company\u2019s most likely savior. Japan Display, the company created from the operations of Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony in 2012, has struggled, and its backers hoped that adding Sharp\u2019s production volume would make it more competitive.But Foxconn\u2019s richer bid altered the script.\u201cEven Nikkei started asking whether it\u2019s O.K. to use taxpayer money to save a company that\u2019s basically a zombie,\u201d said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex, a Japanese stock brokerage, referring to Japan\u2019s dominant financial newspaper. \u201cPublic opinion started to question the old collusive way of doing things, which is good.\u201dSharp has turned to Foxconn for help before. In 2012, Foxconn\u2019s billionaire founder, Terry Gou, privately bought a minority share in an underused Sharp LCD factory in western Japan. Foxconn simultaneously offered to buy a stake in Sharp itself, though that part of the deal fell apart over a price disagreement.Foxconn\u2019s current move to buy Sharp caps a long effort to expand beyond its core electronics assembly business.Over the last two decades, Mr. Gou built Foxconn by instilling militarylike efficiency on plants the size of cities where Chinese migrant laborers assemble electronics for the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Apple. Yet, as those efforts turned Foxconn into the maker of many of the world\u2019s most popular devices, it also left the company dominant in a market space where margins are low.Despite Foxconn\u2019s impressive roster of customers and mastery of the electronics supply chain, analysts have wondered whether it would be able to turn Sharp around. Fixing the company\u2019s difficulties would be a challenge for any company, but for one coming from outside Japan with less understanding about Sharp\u2019s core business, it could prove impossible, analysts argue. They point to Foxconn\u2019s failure in 2012 to close the deal as evidence of a lack of understanding of the business.Still, moves by Apple to use other Taiwanese manufacturers, like Pegatron, to put together some of its phones, and a broader weakness in electronics demand mean the deal may look like a way to find growth through efficiency as the global economy struggles.Jonathan Soble reported from Nagoya, Japan, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Reprimands for 3 Lawmakers Rekindle Debate About Israel\u2019s Arab Minority", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byThe lawmakers, members of the Balad faction of the Knesset, or Parliament, were censured this week by the legislature. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had overstepped the boundaries of appropriate behavior, declaring from the podium of Parliament, \u201cThere is such a thing as national pride.\u201dA leading Arab lawmaker suggested that such questions of pride were not so single-minded for him and his colleagues.\u201cWe are Arab Palestinians, and we are also Israeli citizens,\u201d Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List of predominantly Arab parties, said. \u201cThere is always tension between the two identities.\u201dThe controversy over the lawmakers\u2019 meetings exposed again the inherent frictions and complex emotions dividing Israel\u2019s Jewish majority and its Arab citizens, who make up about a fifth of the country\u2019s population of more than eight million. The Arab lawmakers and many of their constituents identify themselves as Palestinians in terms of nationality, while they are afforded the rights of citizenship in the Jewish state. The country\u2019s conservative government, which holds a slim majority in Parliament, has said it recognizes the importance of integrating Arab citizens, but bristles when Arab Israelis identify closely with the Palestinian cause.The absence of any substantive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the recent surge in Palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks against Israelis have only compounded the political pressure and raised the public\u2019s anxiety.Israeli Jews were particularly incensed at reports that the Arab lawmakers had stood for a moment of silence, suggesting sympathy and support for the Palestinian assailants. The lawmakers said that they had been reciting the Fatiha, a prayer that Muslims offer on the occasion of any death, and that their meetings had been humanitarian missions to discuss terms under which the Israeli authorities might release the assailants\u2019 bodies for burial.The Parliament\u2019s ethics committee voted late Monday to suspend two of the lawmakers, Hanin Zoabi and Basel Ghattas, from plenary sessions and committee hearings for four months for meeting with the families of attackers whom the Israeli government brands as terrorists. A third Arab lawmaker, Jamal Zahalka, was punished for two months. The lawmakers \u2014 all from the Balad faction, one of the parties occupying the Joint List\u2019s 13 seats in the 120-member Parliament \u2014 will still be allowed to participate in votes.One of their colleagues, Ahmad Tibi, leader of the Arab Movement for Change and a member of Parliament since 1999, denounced the disciplinary action and said the lawmakers had met with the families because the families had no other legal recourse. \u201cIt is just humane, just natural, to listen to them and to transfer their request to the Israel internal security minister,\u201d Mr. Tibi said in an interview Tuesday.Mr. Netanyahu, speaking in Parliament on Monday, said, \u201cWe are in favor of the integration of Israel\u2019s Arab citizens into society, the economy and the state.\u201dIn fact, the Israeli government recently announced a roughly $2.5 billion five-year investment plan for Israel\u2019s Arab sector, an effort to narrow the gaps between Jewish and Arab citizens. But Mr. Netanyahu added Monday: \u201cWe are not willing to accept a situation in which members of the Knesset support the families of people who murder Israeli citizens. There is a limit.\u201dTo enforce the limits, Mr. Netanyahu is promoting a contentious bill that would allow members to be banned from Parliament for \u201cunbecoming conduct\u201d with a supermajority vote of 90 members.Mr. Odeh of the Joint List said it was for the Israeli people, not fellow lawmakers, to elect their leaders and decide which ones to remove.This month, Ms. Zoabi was fined and given a six-month suspended prison sentence for insulting Arab Israeli police officers, whom she accused of being traitors.Ms. Zoabi lashed out on Tuesday against the latest actions in Parliament. \u201cThere is a racist atmosphere; there is even a fascist atmosphere that empties democracy of its content,\u201d she told Israel Radio. \u201cAlready, I have to ask right-wing Knesset members if they will let me deal with things that are in the public interest, and now I have to ask them if I can deal with humanitarian issues?\u201dShe added that the meetings with the families of the Palestinian assailants had been \u201can issue of sensitivity for the dead.\u201dEyal Ben-Reuven \u2014 a member of the ethics committee from the center-left Zionist Union, which leads the parliamentary opposition \u2014 supported the suspension of the Balad legislators, describing the visits to the Palestinian families as a \u201cvery grave\u201d act.But on Israel Radio, he criticized the bill that Mr. Netanyahu is promoting to allow the expulsion of members of Parliament, saying, \u201cInstead of fighting terrorism, Mr. Netanyahu is fighting democracy.\u201dReferring to the Arab minority, Mr. Ben-Reuven added, \u201cThey are citizens of Israel, whether you want them or not.\u201dRick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fury Shakes the Iowa Caucuses, Boosting Ted Cruz While Slowing Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisDES MOINES \u2014 Fury carried Ted Cruz to victory. And it stopped Hillary Clinton from truly claiming one.The vote here in Iowa was a portrait of red-hot America, so disaffected that it turned to a pugilistic evangelical Republican who calls for demolition of a system saturated with corruption. And it sent a forceful message to Democratic leaders that it was unwilling to put aside its resentment of Wall Street and corporate America to crown a lifelong party insider who has amassed millions in speaking fees from the big banks.Monday night\u2019s results confirmed that despite the widening cultural and political fissures that have divided right and left, voters are united in an impatience, even a revulsion, at what they see as a rigged system that no longer works for them.For Republicans, the enemy is an overreaching government, strangling their freedoms and pocketbooks. For Democrats, it is an unfair economy, shrinking their paychecks and aspirations.\u201cThis is the most anxious electorate we\u2019ve seen in a very long time,\u201d said David Gergen, an adviser to four presidents of both parties.Mr. Cruz\u2019s triumph on Monday, combined with Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s effective tie with Mrs. Clinton, demonstrated how bipartisan the bitterness has become. \u201cIt\u2019s striking,\u201d Mr. Gergen said, \u201cthat the winner of the Republican side represents the far right and the moral winner for the Democrats comes from the far left. It\u2019s a clear vote of no confidence in the economic order.\u201dIn many ways, the focus of the 2016 campaign has turned to easing the palpable frustrations of a large portion of white working-class Americans who believe that the country no longer works for them.Now, both parties are reacting, sometimes clumsily, to the indignation and insecurities of those voters, buffeted by financial stagnation, globalization, and technological and demographic change.From the start, an uncomfortable question has hovered over this race: In a country where, increasingly, everybody is a statistical minority, who exactly speaks for the white working class?Mrs. Clinton has stumbled as she has sought to champion such voters, as if putting on populist clothes that do not quite fit. Despite the advantages of financial muscle and establishment organization, she failed to convince enough of the insecure electorate that she was truly on their side.On Monday night, a disappointed-looking Ms. Clinton raised her voice to a near yell as she tried to demonstrate her own conviction. But she offered oddly little direct assuagement to the unsettled working class that still craves her assurance.That task fell instead, as it has throughout the campaign, to Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ultraliberal rival, whose denunciations of greedy plutocrats and an unfair economy are at the center of his message. \u201cGiven the enormous crisis facing our country,\u201d he said here after voting had concluded, \u201cit is just too late for establishment politicians and establishment economics.\u201dYet on Monday, Mr. Cruz was just persuasive enough, overtaking his colorful red-cap-wearing rival, Donald J. Trump, whose entire candidacy was built around class rage and a promise to bring wealth and success back to the downtrodden. Surveys of voters who turned out for the Iowa caucuses showed that 40 percent of Republicans described themselves as angry. And they split their vote between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump.In his victory speech, Mr. Cruz characterized this win as a victory for the overlooked and undervalued \u2014 those \u201cwho shouldered the burden of seven years of Washington deals run amok.\u201dFittingly, the two are worlds apart on almost every issue.She is for abortion rights; he is firmly opposed to them. She wants to expand health care; he wants to blow up the Affordable Care Act. She wants to raise taxes on the rich; he wants to impose a flat tax that would lower them. She is an eager supporter of gay marriage; he views its legalization as an infringement on religious liberty.But both confront the same furious national mood and the challenge of turning alienation and rage into organized support and Election Day votes over the coming months \u2014 without going too far.

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Still on the Rise, White House Report Finds", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States economy continued a strong rebound last year, with unemployment falling by half since the depths of the 2008 recession, wages growing and consumer confidence at its highest point in a dozen years, the White House said on Monday. But a slowdown overseas and persistent income inequality at home threaten to sap some of those gains in the years to come.Unemployment is at 4.9 percent, down from 10 percent during the recession, the Council of Economic Advisers reported, while average nominal hourly wages grew 2.7 percent, a high since the recession began.\u201cIn 2015, we continued to take steps forward, with strong job growth and wages rising at their fastest rate in the recovery,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the opening message to the 430-page report, an annual submission to Congress required by law. \u201cSo claims that America\u2019s economy is in decline or that we haven\u2019t made progress are simply not true.\u201dStill, the report acknowledges that economic forces, including the rapid pace of technological change, are weighing on American workers, sharpening income disparities and fueling disaffection. Mr. Obama has tried to tackle the problem through the Affordable Care Act and middle-class tax cuts among other measures, his advisers said, but Congress has balked at others, including a minimum-wage increase and a new infrastructure plan.\u201cWe would have liked to have passed even more support for jobs than we did,\u201d said Jason Furman, the chairman of the economic council. \u201cWe\u2019re still not all the way there. We, in particular, would like to see stronger wage growth.\u201dThe lowest-wage workers are profoundly affected by technology, the report found, with professions paying less than $20 an hour more likely to be automated.While the economy has performed better than most projections, the sharp decline in oil prices, which had been expected to contribute to stronger growth, had a much smaller effect on the gross domestic product than anticipated, only 0.2 percent, the report found. It may have contributed to a sharp boost in consumer sentiment at the beginning of last year, the White House said.Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers said their findings illustrated the need for Congress to enact his top policy priorities, including the ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the sweeping 12-nation trade agreement, to help bolster exports. An overhaul of criminal justice reform and job-training and educational programs he has requested could help improve productivity and narrow wage disparities, they said.A one-year delay in final approval of the trade agreement would cost $94 billion, Mr. Furman said, amounting to $700 per family.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that we need to do to be in the place that we should be,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xiao Gang, China\u2019s Top Securities Regulator, Ousted Over Market Tumult", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s top securities regulator, Xiao Gang, has been forced out, the official Xinhua News Agency announced on Saturday, after facing stinging criticism for amplifying the country\u2019s stock market turbulence.The move reflects the increasing pressure on the Chinese leadership to bolster confidence at home, as questions mount about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage the economy, the currency and the markets.Just days ago, Prime Minister Li Keqiang castigated the country\u2019s financial regulators for their handling of a steep plunge in stocks since last June and an erosion in the value of China\u2019s currency.The China Securities Regulatory Commission, led by Mr. Xiao, 57, has taken a big dose of blame for the problems.He attracted significant criticism for allowing a speculative bubble to form, in which share prices more than doubled in a year. When it burst last summer, those shares gave up all of their gains, hurting millions of families who had borrowed heavily to buy stocks.As stocks sank, the regulator also intensified the market mayhem. Two measures, intended to stabilize stocks, have been widely blamed for producing a weeklong rout in China\u2019s stock markets during the first week of January that unsettled investors around the world.Mr. Xiao defended himself in a long statement on his agency\u2019s website in mid-January, analyzing the causes of his country\u2019s recent financial sector difficulties. He said the turbulence in China\u2019s markets, including another nose dive in share prices last summer, was partly caused by the inexperience of investors and the immaturity of the local market.But he also conceded that recent troubles reflected an \u201cimperfect trading system, flawed market mechanisms and inappropriate supervision systems,\u201d together with an exodus of seasoned personnel from his agency.Mr. Xiao, who also lost his post as the regulator\u2019s Communist Party leader, will be succeeded as chairman and party leader by Liu Shiyu, 54, chairman of the Agricultural Bank of China and a former deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, according to the news agency.Mr. Liu was trained in engineering at Tsinghua University, but started a career in the state banking sector in the 1980s, according to the news agency.His task will not be an easy one.Anticorruption investigators have been scrutinizing the agency, trying to ascertain whether staff members tipped off friends about their decisions, particularly during the market\u2019s fall last summer. New rules also make it hard for the spouses and children of regulators to live overseas, even though the regulatory agency has also been widely accused of lacking workers with international experience and connections.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But the biggest challenge for Mr. Xiao\u2019s successor may be a lack of autonomy. The senior leadership in Beijing gave little latitude to Mr. Xiao, and it is likely to vet and second-guess his successor as well.\u201cEven changing him is not going to change the system,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, the overseas arm of one of China\u2019s largest banks. \u201cI don\u2019t see how someone else will want to take his job; he has a very unenviable position.\u201dMr. Xiao, who earned an undergraduate degree from Hunan University and a master\u2019s degree in law from Renmin University, spent much of his career in finance.He started at the People\u2019s Bank of China in 1981. At the central bank, he held several posts, including director general of the fund planning department and the monetary policy department, working his way up to deputy governor.Mr. Xiao took over at the securities regulator in March 2013, putting him at the helm during the rise and the fall of the Chinese stock markets.When the markets started tumbling, Mr. Xiao\u2019s agency rolled out a raft of measures to help stabilize the situation. He halted initial public offerings of stock and banned share sales by large stakeholders.The regulator\u2019s efforts worked for a while, but they started to backfire in January.Mr. Xiao\u2019s agency introduced so-called circuit breakers for its stock market on the first trading day of this year. The circuit breakers mandated that markets would close for 15 minutes if share prices fell 5 percent and would close for the day if they fell 7 percent.It was intended to provide a cooling-off period. But in practice, it added to the anxiety in the markets.As markets began sustained slides, investors rushed to sell as many shares as possible before the circuit breakers could shut down trading. The thresholds were hit in quick succession, twice during the first week of trading in January.Further policy measures only added to investors\u2019 confusion. The ban of share sales was supposed to expire, and the country\u2019s central bank was pushing down the value of the currency.As China\u2019s stock markets and the value of the renminbi tumbled faster, the country\u2019s leaders ended up scrapping all three policies in less than 24 hours. The circuit breakers were repealed, the ban on sales of shares by large stakeholders was extended, and the central bank intervened decisively in currency markets to halt any further drop in the renminbi.\u201cIt was a correct strategy to take market-stabilizing measures against unusual movements in stocks and the currency last year,\u201d Prime Minister Li said last Monday of the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, according to the government-controlled Beijing News. \u201cLooking back, the major responsible departments took inadequate actions and had internal management issues.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

A mature jungle is quite easy to walk through, but new undergrowth is very, very dense. Daley had to cut a path with a machete in places where there had been roads. There were also Jack Spaniard wasps, which are very aggressive and nasty, living under the leaves. Daley had to look out for them and spray them; he was stung, and my assistant was as well. We went to a village in the hills above Plymouth that had also been completely abandoned; it took us about an hour to go one mile. I shot some pictures from a helicopter, which offered extraordinary views, because you can see Plymouth and the volcano in the background. But on foot, you could actually see houseplants that had grown 20 feet tall and shot up through a roof. The director of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory, Roderick Stewart, is a volcanologist and a keen photographer himself. He was impressed that I was shooting with a four-by-five, a large-format camera.

Some are wealthy, some are struggling; some are undocumented, and others are American citizens.\u201cThe community needed information,\u201d Ms. Sepulveda said. \u201cWorldly information.\u201dUnlike East End publications that mostly report local stories, Voz Latina also features news from other countries.\u201cIt\u2019s about connecting the Latino community with their culture, their world,\u201d Ms. Sepulveda said. \u201cWe live here, but we have our tentacles back at home. Voz Latina doesn\u2019t have one place, one community.\u201dRoger Acosta, a lawyer with a practice in Huntington Station and Riverhead, found Ms. Sepulveda\u2019s passion so inspiring that he wrote the check for Voz Latina\u2019s first ad.\u201cNewspapers are what create our freedom,\u201d said Mr. Acosta, who lived in Cuba until he was 9. He said he remembers his parents lamenting the lack of freedom of the press.Ms. Sepulveda said she believed being informed was critical to being empowered. As a co-founder of Organizaci\u00f3n Latino-Americana, she has striven to strengthen the Latino community on the East End through workshops, celebrations and advocacy. In Voz Latina, she informs readers about local leaders who are sympathetic to the Latino experience, which means that the publication admittedly has political leanings.\u201cI put things in there so people know who represents them,\u201d she said.Columns in Voz Latina offer advice on immigration issues, as well as problems out of the public eye such as domestic violence and alcoholism.\u201cAfter September the economy really slows,\u201d Ms. Sepulveda said, \u201cand people get stressed there\u2019s not enough money to pay the bills. There\u2019s insecurity, and machismo, which can lead to these issues.\u201dMs. Sepulveda said she felt that her mission was to connect the Anglo and Latino worlds on the East End, and she is consciously looking for places where they overlap, like the dance floor.\u201cThere are people who won\u2019t even walk down Main Street because they\u2019re afraid the police will stop them. But when Mambo Loco plays,\u201d she said, referring to a popular local band that specializes in Afro-Cuban and Puerto Rican music, \u201cyou see everyone on the dance floor. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a citizen or if you\u2019re undocumented.\u201dMs. Sepulveda said she hoped that Voz Latina, like music, could create a space for communication. She said she often received phone calls and messages on Facebook from readers who needed help and wanted to connect.\u201cSomeone called me up and told me immigration took her son,\u201d she said. Ms. Sepulveda included the story in the paper, along with an article in Spanish that explained what to do if immigration agents came to the door.\u201cPeople need to know their rights,\u201d she said.Angela Quintero, who taught business administration in her native Colombia before moving to East Hampton, writes a column that addresses topics like effective communication and leadership. These are important and often-overlooked skills for people coming to the United States, she said.\u201cMost immigrants come here looking to achieve their dreams,\u201d Ms. Quintero said. \u201cBut they arrive at this totally different culture, and often they have to change their focus.\u201dMs. Quintero hopes that instead of surrendering their dreams, her readers will learn how to take an idea that she writes about, combine it with their own aspirations, and create a business plan.Voz Latina is bilingual: Ms. Sepulveda said she wanted Anglo readers to pick it up to connect to the Latino community, as well as the other way around. Some columnists, like Javier P\u00e9rez Mandujano, a life coach from Mexico by way of France, write in both languages.He said that he wrote in both languages because a column could not simply be translated into another language, because of cultural nuances and sensibilities.\u201cSometimes we try so hard to define our culture, we end up confronting,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez Mandujano. He said that, while it is important to maintain cultural identity, it is also important to connect. \u201cVoz Latina,\u201d he said, \u201cis a bridge.\u201dWhether the Latino community has been integrated into East End culture remains a controversial subject. You need only look at the cafeteria tables in the local public schools, Ms. Sepulveda said, to see how the communities are stratified.Ms. Quintero expressed more optimism. \u201cI believe that there are two communities,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 4, East Hampton started a Latin Advisory Committee, a group of 10 people, eight of whom are Latino. Ms. Quintero is a member of the committee, charged with community outreach. Larry Cantwell, East Hampton town supervisor, said he hoped the Town Board would introduce and facilitate new bilingual workshops with the police and housing departments.\u201cThis population is a significant part of the community, and we want to break down the communication barrier,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said.Ms. Quintero attributed the strides being made in communication between Latinos and the broader East End community, in large part, to the efforts of Voz Latina.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about language, it\u2019s about culture, it\u2019s about communication,\u201d she said. \u201cVoz Latina connects the community by opening doors into different cultures.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He said ineffective policies and parochialism among provincial officials had exacerbated the problem.China has for decades grappled with overcapacity, which occurs when demand for a product falls below what an industry is capable of producing. But the problem has worsened significantly in recent years, as the government has pumped capital into heavy industries like shipbuilding and glassmaking, even as global demand has fallen.The issue of overcapacity has exacerbated trade tensions, as Chinese producers have sought to export surpluses. Several foreign governments, including the United States, have imposed tariffs on some Chinese steel products, and European steelworkers have protested the import of cheap Chinese steel.\u201cTrade frictions hamper supply chains,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis poses a major threat to the positive effects of globalization.\u201dAs China\u2019s economy slows after more than two decades of breakneck growth, government leaders are facing increasing pressure to find ways to expand the service sector, increase consumer spending and shift resources away from traditional industries.Their efforts to overhaul the economy have been hampered by protectionism among local officials, who worry that closing factories will result in the loss of important sources of tax revenue.In its report, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China offered several suggestions to Chinese leaders, including cutting capital expenditures in some industries and imposing a value-added tax to offer local governments alternative sources of revenue.Advertisement"}

We lingered at a display devoted to \u2018\u2018As Seen on TV\u2019\u2019 products, by far the most Pee-wee-ish part of the store. There were trompe l\u2019oeil stretch pants made to resemble denim. There were fitted slip-on garments called Sleevey Wonders, designed for those who wished to wear sleeveless dresses while covering their arms. Reubens read aloud from another box with glee: \u2018\u2018Suzanne Somers\u2019s 3-Way Poncho!\u2019\u2019 The three ways were \u2018\u2018professional,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018casual\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018dressy.\u2019\u2019 At the Walgreens, it turned out, magic was everywhere.Reubens drifted away from Wound Care and arrived at a rack of tourist junk: Walk of Fame shot glasses; vinyl Clippers purses. He considered these, then nodded upward, toward the fluorescent lights. \u2018\u2018There are apartments upstairs \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to live here?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019d never have to leave.\u2019\u2019Rewatching old episodes of \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 affirms Pee-wee\u2019s comic resilience. Reubens was ahead of his time in his breezily progressive handling of identity politics, which dominate the comedy we consider most relevant today, though his strategies were vastly different. On contemporary hits like, say, \u2018\u2018Broad City\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Transparent,\u2019\u2019 gender norms are explicitly and unapologetically assailed, whereas on \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 the sabotage was largely implicit. Because the show\u2019s more radical elements were refracted through \u2014 and secreted within \u2014 an upbeat, candy-colored atmosphere, \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 could be consumed and adored not only by those who \u2018\u2018got it\u2019\u2019 but also by \u2018\u2018squares\u2019\u2019 (not to mention their children, whom Pee-wee indoctrinated into a cult of extreme acceptance). Judd Apatow, who helped to shepherd \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 into production, identifies this spirit, along with the ingenuity of Reubens\u2019s performance, as central to what he sees as Pee-wee\u2019s evergreen appeal, and to a new movie\u2019s viability. \u2018\u2018When I was younger, I didn\u2019t put my finger on why I liked Pee-wee so much \u2014 it just made me laugh,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018But looking back, it\u2019s a group of strange people who are having a great time and being really nice to each other, and as a slightly weird kid I must have understood that. I liked watching someone so different whom the audience loved. The idea that unique people were getting applause, that the crowd was going crazy for Pee-wee, made me feel you didn\u2019t have to be the football-team quarterback.\u2019\u2019Reubens has been plotting Pee-wee\u2019s big comeback for years. He wrote several scripts, appeared as Pee-wee in stray television cameos and amassed nearly two million Twitter fol\u00adlowers, for whom he posts pictures of gold-plated Slinkys and sleeping bags that resemble pizza. The most important step in this plan was the hit \u2018\u2018Pee-wee Herman Show,\u2019\u2019 a stage production that Reubens mounted in Los Angeles in 2010, which led to a 10-week Broadway incarnation later that year. Reubens intended for these shows to drum up movie interest, and they did: Apatow saw a Los Angeles performance, and soon afterward he and Reubens formed a partnership.Nonetheless, Reubens\u2019s desire to return remains in some tension with his bunker mentality \u2014 from the start, Pee-wee offered Reubens a way to transform into, and armor himself within, his own ventriloquist dummy; when Pee-wee grew popular enough to attract interviewers, Reubens often insisted on receiving them in character, and in the credits for Pee-wee projects the character was listed as played by \u2018\u2018Himself.\u2019\u2019 The reason for this self-erasure, he explains, was that Pee-wee worked better if audiences believed he might be real, but the feint also let Reubens hide in plain sight. Between seasons of \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 \u2014 by which point Pee-wee had hosted \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019\u2019 appeared on the covers of Rolling Stone and Life and released ubiquitous merchandise (T-shirts, action figures, magnets, windsocks) plastered with his face \u2014 Reubens took to growing his hair and wearing a goatee to go incognito: Peter Pan turned bus-stop drifter. \u2018\u2018I once went up to Steve Martin, whom I knew fairly well by that point, and said, \u2018Hey, Steve!\u2019 and he had no idea who I was,\u2019\u2019 Reubens recalls. \u2018\u2018Finally he said, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re really lucky \u2014 you can go around unrecognized.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Which made what came next feel all the more catastrophic. In July 1991, police arrested Reubens at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, where he was visiting his parents, and charged him with indecent exposure. The media, titillated as ever by the gap between public image and private behavior, seized on Reubens\u2019s distinctly un-Pee-wee-ish mug shot: the stringy hair, scruffy chin and white gym shirt of his off-set disguise. The arrest\u2019s afterlife, in tabloids and late-night monologues, was toxic, and even though Reubens had already ceased production on \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 (he says he intended a break from show business), CBS killed the final weeks of reruns, adding to the sense that the scandal torpedoed his career. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have any feeling about it at all that I want to share,\u2019\u2019 he told me when I brought up the arrest. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t really think about it \u2014 or I try not to.\u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018The only thing I\u2019ll say is that it was stupid not to do anything. I never spoke out. I just went and hid, and in hindsight \u2014 I mean, that was my true response, but I don\u2019t think it was smart \u2014 if I had to do it over again, I would figure out a way to get out there, talk about it, take control of it.\u2019\u2019 When he disappeared, he took Pee-wee with him, camping out for a time at the New Jersey estate of the billionaire tobacco heiress Doris Duke, whom he\u2019d befriended, and in the Hollywood Hills, among his funny things. (He has always denied the charges and entered a plea of no contest at the time to avoid trial.)\u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 represents, on some level, Reubens\u2019s attempt to refigure the events of 1991 once and for all as a mere footnote in Pee-wee\u2019s story, rather than its deflating coda. \u2018\u2018Part of the reason why I wanted to come back,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018is that I didn\u2019t have a real good ending to my career.\u2019\u2019 In the years since, he has delivered acclaimed supporting performances \u2014 in the \u2018\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019\u2019 movie, \u2018\u2018Murphy Brown,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u201830 Rock\u2019\u2019 and Ted Demme\u2019s \u2018\u2018Blow,\u2019\u2019 among other projects \u2014 but such work has felt minor compared with what he accomplished with Pee-wee, and a whiff of exile, self-imposed or otherwise, has long clung to Reubens. \u2018\u2018To be honest, there have been times when I\u2019ve had a foot out of the business altogether, with no plans of continuing,\u2019\u2019 he says.Paul Reubens as a high-school student in 1967.That somebody turned out to be Netflix. The production arm of the content-streaming service has become a reliable home for well-pedigreed comedy reboots \u2014 like \u2018\u2018Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp,\u2019\u2019 the fourth season of \u2018\u2018Arrested Development\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018W/ Bob & David\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that might seem too offbeat for more traditional avenues of backing and distribution. The company remains relatively unproven in the feature-film category, however; John Lee, the director of \u2018\u2018Big Holiday,\u2019\u2019 surmises that it was partly for this reason that Netflix approved a budget of just under $30 million, on par with comedy budgets at big studios. \u2018\u2018They wanted to be sure that they weren\u2019t cheap,\u2019\u2019 Lee jokes. (A burly, 30ish guy, Lee grew up a Pee-wee fan and was a creator of the mid-aughts MTV comedy \u2018\u2018Wonder Showzen,\u2019\u2019 a demented mock children\u2019s show \u2014 far darker in its humor than \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 but with some Pee-wee in its DNA all the same.)The movie they made is of a piece with other Pee-wee projects, each of which takes place in a world distinct from the others. In \u2018\u2018Big Adventure,\u2019\u2019 Pee-wee lives in a suburban town and loves his bicycle; in \u2018\u2018Big-Top Pee-wee,\u2019\u2019 he\u2019s a farmer in rural nowhere; in \u2018\u2018Playhouse,\u2019\u2019 he inhabits a fantastical realm called Puppetland. The premise of \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 is that Pee-wee, having suffered some unspecified trauma earlier in life, refuses to leave his hometown, where everyone knows and likes him. And yet he also feels inarticulably different from his fellow townspeople and yearns to escape. Pee-wee\u2019s stifled urge to bust out is drama\u00adtized in a wonderfully bizarre opening dream sequence featuring a naked alien with six moist nostrils, and is ignited in his waking life when a motorcycle-riding hunk \u2014 the actor Joe Manganiello, from \u2018\u2018True Blood\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Magic Mike\u2019\u2019\u2014 rolls through town and inspires Pee-wee to embark on a cross-country pilgrimage. (If you wish to trace parallels here with the traumas, retrenchments and re-emergences in Reubens\u2019s career, they are available, but not belabored.)Production on \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 lasted 36 days. Last July, Reubens joined Lee and his editor, Jeff Buchanan, to fine-tune the scene in which Joe and Pee-wee first meet, at a diner. The two men bond over their shared fixation with the same uncommon candy (root-beer barrels), and Pee-wee makes Manganiello a milkshake. Decades in, Reubens retains his masterful, almost perverse, sense of comic timing. He distends certain beats you expect to whiz by, accelerates others you expect to linger and exerts precise control over his outsize character; his motions are clipped but surge with weird, spastic joy, and in the diner scene he makes a process as mundane as pouring milk over ice cream riveting. \u2018\u2018We trimmed down the shake-making,\u2019\u2019 Lee told Reubens after the scene played through. \u2018\u2018You thought it was a little long. And we leaned on the two-shot more when you and Joe are in sync.\u2019\u2019 Reubens told me that the root-beer-barrel motif is set up early in the movie: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s Pee-wee\u2019s favorite candy, and he has a little red-and-white straw that goes into the barrel. Then there\u2019s a red-and-white straw I put in the milkshake in this scene. Then later there\u2019s a dream sequence where Joe and I are jousting and our poles look like the straws.\u2019\u2019The context for such winks and nudges has always been an air of childlike innocence and a storybooklike narrative economy. Like \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 and its road-trip premise, \u2018\u2018Big Adventure\u2019\u2019 needed no plot machinery more elaborate than a nation-spanning hunt for a stolen bike; entire episodes of \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 rested on premises as wispy as \u2018\u2018It\u2019s raining.\u2019\u2019 For Reubens, plots are excuses to pile up gags and set pieces. In his most famous moment, from \u2018\u2018Big Adventure,\u2019\u2019 Pee-wee, in platform shoes, dances with manic verve to \u2018\u2018Tequila\u2019\u2019 in a motorcycle bar. The scene\u2019s subtextual purpose, to the extent it has one, is to ratchet up and then dissolve the tension between dainty Pee-wee and the macho bikers: It barely registers that the sequence serves zero narrative function.As Lee and Buchanan examined \u2018\u2018Holiday\u2019\u2019 footage, a skin-colored strip of fabric was visible on the back of Reubens\u2019s neck; it was something like a tiny girdle, tugging excess flesh back from his sexagenarian jawline. This would eventually vanish in postproduction, thanks to digital retouchers whom Reubens had hired to pore over the film frame by frame. \u2018\u2018I feel I\u2019m too old to be in a Pee-wee Herman movie without that,\u2019\u2019 he explained. \u2018\u2018Pee-wee doesn\u2019t work, to me, with age mixed into it. So I knew I wanted digital retouching, and that was my biggest concern from the get-go, with Judd, when it came to budgeting, because it costs a fortune. I could have had a face-lift and we would have saved two million dollars.\u2019\u2019If Reubens often seems like a man out of time \u2014 his close association with the \u201980s; the way that, despite owning an iPhone, he still records personal reminders on Post-it Notes stuffed into his wallet \u2014 his age is a surprisingly poignant element of the new movie, and he was without vanity in discussing it. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re looking at so many images of myself on a giant screen and fixing them, and it\u2019s a buzzkill,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not as limber as I was, I\u2019m not as skinny, I don\u2019t have that energy, I don\u2019t have that body.\u2019\u2019 He said that, when pitching the movie, he \u2018\u2018was constantly saying, Get Michael Cera in here to be Pee-wee. Do what they did with \u201821 Jump Street\u2019 and cast Jonah Hill instead of Johnny Depp.\u2019\u2019In the end, software intervened. Reubens called digital retouching \u2018\u2018a huge secret in Hollywood. People aren\u2019t really aware that stars have secret riders in their contracts\u2019\u2019 stipulating that money will be devoted to preserving their youthful appearances with computers. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going to be forced to talk about it\u2019\u2019 in television appearances promoting the film, Reubens said, because \u2018\u2018Pee-wee\u2019s not older in the movie, but I am.\u2019\u2019 Lee agreed: \u2018\u2018I think it would be weird to ignore it. It\u2019s the elephant in the room.\u2019\u2019Reubens considered this and grimaced. \u2018\u2018One of the elephants.\u2019\u2019Reubens\u2019s focus, from youth, has been on performance. His high-school history teacher, Lou Ann Palmer, recalled for me his \u2018\u2018phenomenal\u2019\u2019 turn as Nathan Detroit in a school production of \u2018\u2018Guys and Dolls\u2019\u2019 \u2014 evidence of a theatrical streak that carried into the classroom. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t call him a class clown; he was a comic,\u2019\u2019 Palmer says. \u2018\u2018He would plan tricks and make the other kids laugh \u2014 not at him but with him. I loved it. Who laughs in history class?\u2019\u2019 In addition to school musicals, Reubens performed in local theater, studied trapeze at circus camp, volunteered at the art museum and was a television fiend: Pee-wee descends from Captain Kangaroo, Pinky Lee, Howdy Doody and Rocky & Bullwinkle.Pee-wee also owes debts to experimental theater, cabaret and the conceptual prankishness of the artist Allan Kaprow, whose Happenings Reubens discovered in the early 1970s when he enrolled in the theater program at California Institute of the Arts, where Kaprow taught. One of Reubens\u2019s friends there was Michael Richards, who went on to play Kramer on \u2018\u2018Seinfeld.\u2019\u2019 Richards described the prevailing spirit at CalArts \u2014 where the faculty included artists like John Baldessari and Alison Knowles \u2014 as one of fecund transgression. \u2018\u2018On my very first day,\u2019\u2019 Richards says, \u2018\u2018as an introduction to the faculty, there was a pool party, and everyone was naked. What school do you go to and see that kind of liberation?\u2019\u2019 He recalls Reubens\u2019s seriousness when it came to doing character work. \u2018\u2018There was a student film where Paul wanted me to play his husband, and he played the wife and wore a dress. His performance wasn\u2019t pushed, it wasn\u2019t broad \u2014 he committed to it. He and I would talk about how a character\u2019s doing you, you\u2019re not doing the character.\u2019\u2019After graduation, Reubens changed his surname and rented an apartment in Echo Park, on the east side of Los Angeles. He conceived of Pee-wee as a jittery, joke-botching idiot savant, and his other creations at the Groundlings were similarly so-bad-they\u2019re-good entertainers. Among these were the \u2018\u2018syndicated Jewish cartoonist\u2019\u2019 Moses Feldman, the Native American lounge act Jay Longtoe (the racial insensitivity of which Reubens came to regret) and a hokey sound-effects team named the Fabulous Betty and Eddy, whom Reubens developed with his fellow improviser Charlotte McGinnis: They mimicked leaky faucets and delivered dialogue in the style of old commercials.\u2018\u2018We all grew up with so much cheesy variety on television, and when we got into our 20s we said, Oh, my God, there\u2019s nothing organic happening here,\u2019\u2019 says Phyllis Katz, of the Groundlings. \u2018\u2018We started making fun of it.\u2019\u2019 She recalls Reubens coming up with Pee-wee Herman in one of her classes, before developing the character further with the troupe\u2019s founder, Gary Austin, who crucially lent Reubens his glen-plaid suit. \u2018\u2018Pee-wee sort of seemed like a gimmick, and that\u2019s what I was looking for,\u2019\u2019 Reubens says. \u2018\u2018A simple thing to hang a bunch of stuff on.\u2019\u2019 Pee-wee was an instant hit with audiences, and Reubens ditched his other characters; this, he says, angered his friend and fellow Groundling Phil Hartman, who was a writer on \u2018\u2018Big Adventure\u2019\u2019 and an actor on \u2018\u2018Playhouse,\u2019\u2019 and whose career, through \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\u2019 in the \u201990s, featured an army of personas. Hartman, Reubens recalls, thought he was bowing to crass careerism and squandering his gifts. \u2018\u2018He hated that I was drilling into one character,\u2019\u2019 Reubens says. Katz says that Reubens, \u2018\u2018unlike many of us, understood business. Getting your ducks in a row. He had head shots made for Pee-wee before anyone knew who he was!\u2019\u2019In the early days of Pee-wee, Reubens built a stage show at the Roxy that eventually attracted the attention of HBO, which broadcast a Pee-wee special in 1981. (The 2010 stage productions in New York and Los Angeles leaned on the same script.) Pee-wee appeared in interstitial segments on the fledgling MTV and as a favorite guest of David Letterman\u2019s. Amid the frequently cynical atmosphere of stand-up, Reubens saw how sweetness could be counterintuitively provocative: Working comedy clubs, he gave out pirate hats and deputized audience members to distribute candy. \u2018\u2018It was one of the greatest performances I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\u2019 says Apatow, who caught a Manhattan show.Reubens\u2019s club buzz led to a contract for his first film, \u2018\u2018Big Adventure,\u2019\u2019 which earned more than $40 million on a budget of $6 million and, in turn, led to \u2018\u2018Playhouse.\u2019\u2019 There, Reubens revitalized Saturday-morning programming, a wasteland of cheap animated series that served mostly as glorified toy commercials, by discovering an aesthetic wormhole connecting late-night comedy and early-morning children\u2019s programming. The sensibility of stoned 20-somethings at midnight, he realized \u2014 marked by an unreasonable love of repetition, absurdity, narrative disjuncture and jokes that either last way too long or flit by in a short-attention-span-accommodating blink \u2014 had significant overlap with that of little kids in pajamas, laughing themselves silly over breakfast cereal. \u2018\u2018Those are the times of the day when there aren\u2019t rules,\u2019\u2019 Reubens said of morning and night, standing as they do in idiosyncratic opposition to the more conventional prerogatives of the prime-time dial. \u2018\u2018Rules are for the other times.\u2019\u2019One day in Burbank, I met Reubens at a recording studio where he was scheduled to do some voice-over work. As \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 was winding its way toward completion, he was keeping busy with other jobs. Steven Soderbergh had cast Reubens in a coming HBO project, and he had also booked multi-episode arcs as a guest actor on \u2018\u2018The Blacklist\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Gotham.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018When it rains, it pours,\u2019\u2019 he said happily.Reubens was particularly excited about one bit of rainfall: NBC had ordered a pilot for what he hoped would become a brand new Pee-wee prime-time variety series. The pilot was supposed to be taped in October, and he was feeling good about its chances \u2014 \u2018\u2018It\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve written\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but in late September he called me to say that NBC had pulled the plug. He cited scheduling and budgetary issues, blaming the network and theorizing that the poor ratings of \u2018\u2018Best Time Ever With Neil Patrick Harris,\u2019\u2019 a recently begun and rapidly canceled variety show, had weakened NBC\u2019s resolve. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m better off in a situation where people are going to let me do what I want,\u2019\u2019 he said, discussing the pilot\u2019s demise. \u2018\u2018I had such a lucky, fluky experience with the kids\u2019 show, where they never said anything, and I got spoiled.\u2019\u2019Reubens has influential champions \u2014 not just Apatow and Soderbergh, but also Todd Solondz, David O. Russell and Tina Fey, who have all cast him in projects. His C.V. also includes a list of credits for voice acting in dozens of cartoons and video games \u2014 roles with names like Screwy Squirrel, Bat-Mite and Gnome Ruler. It was a gig of this kind that took him to the Burbank studio: dialogue for a forthcoming Minecraft video game. Inside, an engineer worked a computer while a director, Khris Brown, patched in remotely and led Reubens through his 26 lines. He was to portray a villain named Ivor, who had an argument, and forged a tentative alliance, with the games\u2019 heroes.The session lasted less than an hour. With each take, Reubens shifted emphasis and emotional inflection, offering up different flavors of ham here, unexpected subtlety there. In the darkened booth, hunched over his script with his reading glasses on and his arms crossed, Reubens appeared very small. For Ivor he mustered a voice not so different from that of his best-loved creation: antic, petulant, silly. \u2018\u2018Hey \u2014 these attacks are starting to feel a little personal!\u2019\u2019 he cried. \u2018\u2018Hey! These attacks are starting to feel a little personal!\u2019\u2019 he growled. If you closed your eyes, it was easy to imagine that Pee-wee himself had burst into the room, engaged in some nonsensical game of repetition and that it was him, not Reubens, mouthing every line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton, Sanders and the Fight Over Obama\u2019s Legacy", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorPicture a largely unknown, black first-term senator with a surname that rhymes with \u201cOsama,\u201d who spent part of his childhood living in a Muslim country, crisscrossing the country calling for \u201crevolution,\u201d perhaps with a guy called Killer Mike in tow. Now imagine that person becoming president of the United States.Anyone with even a passing familiarity with American history cannot imagine such a thing happening in a country still troubled by the tug of war between privilege and race.It couldn\u2019t have happened. And it\u2019s not what happened. Still, some supporters of Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential candidacy seem to think that Barack Obama promised them a revolution and failed, or refused, to deliver.In fundamental ways, the 2016 Democratic primary has been a litigation of the Obama years, and of whether the president\u2019s 2008 campaign vow of \u201cchange we can believe in\u201d succeeded or failed. The Hillary Clinton campaign has been built around the notion that, indeed, President Obama achieved substantial, progressive change, in the face of unprecedented and partly race-based obstruction, change that can be made durable only by electing a Democratic president willing to hold the line.Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, is an implicit critique of that proposition. It is premised on the idea that Mr. Obama promised sweeping, revolutionary change and failed, and that Mr. Sanders can succeed where Mr. Obama didn\u2019t, by unleashing a huge outpouring of popular pressure on Washington.The Sanders effort has attracted a fierce following among young people, political independents, McGovernite liberals once forced into political exile by Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic Leadership Council, and working-class white voters, whose broad sense of anger, economic displacement and distrust of institutions are also fueling the rise of Donald J. Trump on the right.Mr. Sanders\u2019s message has resonated least with the groups most likely to be defensive of President Obama: African-Americans and Latinos, as well as women over 60, who have expressed a greater sense of investment in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s quest to become the first woman president.When he ran for president in 2008, Mr. Obama was the candidate of the young and the demographically ascendant. He eventually attracted strong majorities among African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and voters under 30.Mr. Obama\u2019s message was inspirational and nationally cathartic, to be sure. But it was far from revolutionary, though his candidacy, given his race, certainly was. He called on the country to put aside differences of region, color and class and to join together toward a common and prosperous future. Hardly the stuff of Eugene V. Debs.He promised to put an end to the Bush economic disaster and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and to pass universal health care, completing a Democratic dream dating back at least to F.D.R. The most populist idea Mr. Obama offered was his vow to repeal the Bush-era tax cuts for the rich, while keeping them in place for the middle class.After Mrs. Clinton won the New Hampshire primary in 2008, Mr. Obama responded with an intonation crafted in defeat, which was designed to stir not revolutionary fervor, but patriotic hope; proclaiming that it was \u201cwritten into the founding documents\u201d of a flawed but earnest nation yearning to perfect its union: \u201cYes, we can.\u201dMr. Obama was arguing for his own electability as a black man in a country that had never elected anything but a white man as president.Candidate Obama didn\u2019t favor overturning the country\u2019s private health care system or even instituting the individual mandate to purchase health insurance that Senator Clinton insisted was necessary to extend coverage, though he later adopted it as president. And Mr. Obama vehemently fought the notion that he was a socialist, or even out of the ideological mainstream. He ran as a centrist and a national healer, clearly not knowing that he would face an opposition once in office that was equal parts trenchant and ideologically radical.Once elected, Mr. Obama faced immediate and continual fire from vocal contingents on the right, but also from influential left-wing bloggers and liberal and libertarian radio hosts whom the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs derided in 2010 as \u201cthe professional left.\u201dBut many African-Americans chafed at the fact that these mostly white liberals had hardly given the new, and first black, president \u2014 with all the unique historic challenges the latter fact entailed \u2014 time to tackle the sinking economy and get health care through before demanding that he issue executive orders defying the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d law and somehow unilaterally close the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison without the consent of Congress. Mr. Obama and his attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., were excoriated for failing to jail Wall Street bankers whose rapaciousness triggered the Great Recession.Of all the liberal resentments during the Obama years, one of the sharpest has been the failure to secure a public insurance option as part of the Affordable Care Act. And while Mr. Sanders frequently points out that he was a member of a committee that helped draft Obamacare, he still wants to scrap it in favor of a European-style single-payer model, which would certainly face an even harder time getting through Congress than Obamacare did.Some prominent liberals called for voters to punish Mr. Obama during the 2010 midterms. They got their way, as Democratic voters stayed home in droves, something that often happens in midterm elections but was especially devastating in a census year. African-Americans have paid the heaviest price, as the 2010 election stripped them, particularly in the South, of significant political power as a result of redistricting.Today, Mr. Sanders is struggling to add Obama Democrats, particularly voters of color, to his coalition.The campaign offers many reasons: a continuing unfamiliarity with the candidate in black communities; or the Clinton family\u2019s long ties to black voters, despite the continuing critique of the aspects of the Bill Clinton era that were the worst for African-Americans, such as the infamous 1994 crime bill (which Mr. Sanders voted for as a congressman) and welfare reform.Black voters also cite Mrs. Clinton\u2019s greater experience, pragmatism and knowledge on a variety of issues. But it seems clear that among Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strongest advantages with black voters \u2014 and it\u2019s an advantage that could prove decisive for her in the primary campaign \u2014 is her embrace of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy.It\u2019s an embrace that has been made all the more powerful when the notion that President Obama has achieved little that he promised, and therefore must be followed by a \u201crevolution,\u201d remains a constant undercurrent of her opponent\u2019s campaign.Joy-Ann Reid is an MSNBC national correspondent and the author of the book \u201cFracture: Obama, the Clintons, and the Democratic Divide.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zika Virus a Global Health Emergency, W.H.O. Says", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byAn outbreak of the Zika virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes, was detected in Brazil in May and has since moved into more than 20 countries in Latin America, including two new ones announced Monday: Costa Rica and Jamaica.At a news conference in Geneva, Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the W.H.O, acknowledged that the understanding of the connection between the Zika virus and microcephaly was hazy and said that the uncertainty placed \u201ca heavy burden\u201d on pregnant women and their families throughout the Americas. She said the emergency designation would allow the health agency to coordinate the many efforts to get desperately needed answers. Officials said research on the effects of Zika in pregnant women was underway in at least three countries: Brazil, Colombia and El Salvador.Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.\u201cThe evidence is growing and it\u2019s getting strong,\u201d Dr. Chan said. \u201cSo I accepted, even on microcephaly alone, that it is sufficient to call an emergency. We need a coordinated international response.\u201d\u201cI think there was a political overtone,\u201d said Lawrence O. Gostin, director of the O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. \u201cIf it were my daughter and she was pregnant or thinking of getting pregnant, I would absolutely warn her off of going to a Zika-affected country, and the W.H.O. should have said that.\u201dThe current outbreak of Zika has taken the world by surprise. The virus was first identified in 1947 in Uganda, and for years lived mostly in monkeys. But last May in Brazil, cases began increasing drastically. The W.H.O. has estimated that four million people could be infected by the end of the year. The rapid spread is because people in the Americas have not developed immunity, public health experts say.Health officials in the United States, however, say the risk of a major homegrown outbreak is low because mosquito control programs are systematic and effective. They cite a related virus, dengue, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes but has not spread very much since first appearing locally a few years ago.An emergency designation from the W.H.O. can prompt action and funding from governments and nonprofits around the world. It elevates the agency to the position of global coordinator and gives its decisions the force of international law. It could also help standardize surveillance of new cases across countries \u2014 something that Dr. David L. Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who chaired the emergency committee, said was critical to getting control over the virus.The global health agency is trying to strike a balance between alerting the public and scaring it. Zika symptoms are mild or even nonexistent in most people. Overreaction could have the effect of punishing countries that are experiencing epidemics, experts say, for example, through restrictions on travel, trade or tourism that could hurt economies.The thrust of Monday\u2019s meeting \u2014 which was held by teleconference and included presentations from officials of the affected countries \u2014 was a renewed emphasis on research to determine whether Zika can cause microcephaly. Dr. Heymann said afterward that he could not discuss the evidence that was presented in a confidential meeting. But he underscored that committee members were mostly concerned that the research efforts, unfolding in multiple countries, were not coordinated.\u201cThe research needs to be pulled together instead of different groups doing different things in their own corners,\u201d Dr. Heymann said in a telephone interview. He added that the committee members were \u201cpretty unanimous\u201d in their decision to recommend emergency status.But many health experts said Monday\u2019s announcement lacked details, and they expressed concern that it would not jolt the agency into action. Among the most urgent needs, experts said, were aggressive efforts to control the populations of mosquitoes that spread Zika and know no boundaries.\u201cThey should have presented a specific list of interventions and the most obvious one is mosquito control,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cThis is their window of opportunity.\u201dIf no action is taken, he said, a country like Haiti, which has very little public health infrastructure and nearly nonexistent mosquito control, could be facing \u201ctens of thousands of cases of microcephalic babies seven to nine months from now.\u201d\u201cThis makes it formal,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. \u201cIf there is a ministry of health anywhere that hasn\u2019t awakened to this problem, this will do that.\u201dThe last time the W.H.O. declared a public health emergency was when Ebola was tearing through West Africa. But the agency was strongly criticized for its tardiness in declaring Ebola an international emergency, and many global health experts said it was unlikely that the agency\u2019s director, Dr. Chan, would let that happen again.\u201cThe W.H.O. took a very serious hit to their reputation,\u201d said Dr. Ron Waldman, a professor of global health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. \u201cThey do have to be mindful of the politics, but they have to get the science right, too. They don\u2019t have much room for slip-ups.\u201dStill, there are major differences between Zika and Ebola, the most significant being that thousands of people died of Ebola, while Zika is not known to be fatal.But some experts said there were enough indications of a link between Zika and microcephaly that global health agencies should act more aggressively.\u201cThis is not a curveball out of nowhere,\u201d said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, adding that there were cases of microcephaly in French Polynesia, where Zika struck in 2014. \u201cClearly something is going on.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the Zika virus and the declaration of an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization omitted part of the name of the institution at George Washington University where Dr. Ron Waldman is a professor. It is the Milken Institute School of Public Health, not the Milken School of Public Health.Advertisement"}

Accordingly, there are movies in development with titles that pretty much give away their plots: \u201cSmoke and Mirrors,\u201d \u201cAll We Had\u201d and \u201cStraight to Hell.\u201d\u201cThese projects are not operating in a vacuum,\u201d said Len Amato, president of HBO Films. HBO has a movie about Bernard L. Madoff coming out in 2017. ABC\u2019s two-part mini-series \u201cMadoff\u201d aired last week.\u201cYou can see what\u2019s happening in the political process \u2014 both parties are dealing with grass-roots movements standing up against the shrinking of the middle class and the rise of income inequality,\u201d Mr. Amato said. \u201cAudiences are not only ready to take that on in television and movies, they very much want to understand how we came to this point.\u201dIn \u201cMoney Monster,\u201d a thriller set for release in May, George Clooney plays a hyperbolic, Jim Cramer-esque host of a cable show. Held at gunpoint by a viewer who lost all his savings in a market plunge, Mr. Clooney\u2019s character is forced to investigate a financial conspiracy. \u201cI\u2019m telling you it\u2019s rigged,\u201d the gunman says in the trailer. \u201cThey\u2019re stealing everything from us, and they\u2019re getting away with it, too.\u201dThe movie\u2019s anti-Wall Street theme echoes across the spectrum of popular culture.The market crash threatens to destroy a publishing house run by the hero of Jay McInerney\u2019s latest novel, \u201cBright, Precious Things,\u201d to be published later this year. In March, the Public Theater in New York will host the debut of \u201cDry Powder,\u201d a sardonic take on private equity shenanigans that stars John Krasinski (\u201cThe Office\u201d) and Claire Danes (\u201cHomeland\u201d).A few years ago, there was less appetite for art that delved into the inner workings of the financial industry. Writers and directors delivered nonfiction books about the disaster and documentaries like the 2010 film \u201cInside Job,\u201d but by and large entertainment executives seemed to doubt that audiences would spend money to relive how they lost so much of it.\u201cMargin Call,\u201d a 2011 drama about the disintegration of an investment bank at the start of the crisis, was a critical success but not a popular one. It took in less than $20 million worldwide, and more than 70 percent of its audience was overseas, according to Box Office Mojo. (By contrast, \u201cThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part I\u201d grossed $712 million worldwide that year.)Film historians liken this lag to the ones that followed the Vietnam War and the 1929 stock market crash. Movies were made about those events in real time, but the most powerful ones came years later. \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d and \u201cComing Home\u201d were released in 1978; \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d came out in 1979. Classic films about the Great Depression, like Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cMeet John Doe\u201d and John Ford\u2019s \u201cGrapes of Wrath,\u201d didn\u2019t make it to the screen until World War II was underway.\u201cAfter a cataclysmic event, it takes a while for the collective unconscious to bubble to the surface,\u201d said Brian Koppelman, one of the creators of \u201cBillions,\u201d a new Showtime series about a hedge fund titan under investigation by a crusading United States attorney. (Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times is another of the show\u2019s creators.)\u201cBillions\u201d is set in the present, but like many other contemporary financial dramas, it is darkened by the shadow of 2008. For one thing, Mr. Koppelman noted, viewers today are more prepared to digest the details of what went wrong. \u201cWe have all learned the language. In 2008, who knew what a \u2018tranche\u2019 was?\u201d he said.\u201cThe Big Short\u201d ends with a written warning that Wall Street could be repeating its mistakes: \u201cIn 2015, several large banks began selling billions in something called a \u2018bespoke tranche opportunity,\u2019 \u201d referring to the apparent rebranding of the complex securities at the heart of the 2008 mess.The movie, which stars Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Steve Carell, looks like a sure thing now, but Mr. McKay said it took a few years to persuade the studio to greenlight it. \u201cThey worried that the material was too esoteric and wonky, but they were more open once we found a way to make it entertaining,\u201d he said.\u201cIt also helped that \u2018Wolf of Wall Street\u2019 was a success,\u201d he added, referring to Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2013 film about a crooked 1980s stockbroker played by Leonardo DiCaprio.Hollywood executives did not exactly rush to embrace that project, either, which cost about $100 million and runs three hours in length. Red Granite Pictures, whose principal film backer is the Abu Dhabi-based businessman Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny, financed the film.But it grossed $392 million worldwide. Those returns helped embolden other studios.Washington and Wall Street are to blame in most of these works \u2014 comedies as well as dramas. But some take a particular angle that reflects the personal interests of their creators.Actresses increasingly seek roles that allow them to play strong, complex women, and several have optioned works that focus on female executives in the banking world. Sony Classics bought \u201cEquity,\u201d a film that stars Anna Gunn of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d as an investment banker brokering an initial public offering and dealing with corruption in the financial world.Last October, the Irish author Paul Murray published a satirical novel, \u201cThe Mark and the Void,\u201d about the Irish banking crisis.Michael M. Thomas, a writer and former partner at Lehman Brothers who left the firm long before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008, took a more patrician, and rococo, path in his novel \u201cFixers,\u201d which was published last month. Mr. Thomas\u2019s fictionalized account of what went wrong is an indictment of Wall Street greed and parvenus, but it also holds President Obama responsible for letting them get away with it. In the novel, a cabal of power brokers rigs the election in favor of an Obama-like candidate and steers him away from reforming Wall Street and sending bankers to jail.\u201cThe culture has become much more attuned to the financial world,\u201d said Sandy Climan, president of Entertainment Media Ventures, a movie and digital media investment company in Los Angeles. \u201cCreators are now dramatizing what people were already thinking about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Toxic Loans Around the World Weigh on Global Growth", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported by8 PhotosBeneath the surface of the global financial system lurks a multitrillion-dollar problem that could sap the strength of large economies for years to come.The problem is the giant, stagnant pool of loans that companies and people around the world are struggling to pay back. Bad debts have been a drag on economic activity ever since the financial crisis of 2008, but in recent months, the threat posed by an overhang of bad loans appears to be rising. China is the biggest source of worry. Some analysts estimate that China\u2019s troubled credit could exceed $5 trillion, a staggering number that is equivalent to half the size of the country\u2019s annual economic output.Official figures show that Chinese banks pulled back on their lending in December. If such trends persist, China\u2019s economy, the second-largest in the world behind the United States\u2019, may then slow even more than it has, further harming the many countries that have for years relied on China for their growth.But it\u2019s not just China. Wherever governments and central banks unleashed aggressive stimulus policies in recent years, a toxic debt hangover has followed. In the United States, it took many months for mortgage defaults to fall after the most recent housing bust \u2014 and energy companies are struggling to pay off the cheap money that they borrowed to pile into the shale boom.In Europe, analysts say bad loans total more than $1 trillion. Many large European banks are still burdened with defaulted loans, complicating policy makers\u2019 efforts to revive the Continent\u2019s economy. Italy, for instance, announced a plan last week to clean out bad loans from its plodding banking industry.Elsewhere, bad loans are on the rise at Brazil\u2019s biggest banks, as the country grapples with the effects of an enormous credit binge.\u201cIf you have a boom and then a bust, you create economic losses,\u201d said Alberto Gallo, head of global macro credit research at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London. \u201cYou can hope the losses one day turn into profits, but if they don\u2019t, they are a drag on the economy.\u201dIn good times, companies and people take on new loans, often at low interest rates, to buy goods and services. When economies slow, these debts become difficult to pay for many borrowers. And the bigger the boom, the more soured debt that is left behind for bankers and policy makers to deal with.In theory, it makes sense for banks to swiftly recognize the losses embedded in bad loans \u2014 and then make up for those losses by raising fresh capital. The cleaned-up banks are more likely to start lending again \u2014 and thus play their part in fueling the recovery.Even so, the drawback of delaying the cleanup is that the banks remain wounded and reluctant to lend, damping any recovery that takes place. Japan, economists say, waited far too long after its credit boom of the 1980s to force its banks to recognize huge losses \u2014 and the economy suffered for years after as a result.Now many banking experts are beginning to worry about China\u2019s bad loans.Fears that the country\u2019s economy is slowing have weighed heavily on global markets in recent months because a weak China can drag down growth globally.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Many of these concerns focus on China\u2019s banking industry. In recent years, banks and other financial companies in China issued a tidal wave of new loans and other credit products, many of which will not be paid back in full.China\u2019s financial sector will have loans and other financial assets of $30 trillion at the end of this year, up from $9 trillion seven years ago, said Charlene Chu, an analyst in Hong Kong for Autonomous Research.\u201cThe world has never seen credit growth of this magnitude over a such short time,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWe believe it has directly or indirectly impacted nearly every asset price in the world, which is why the market is so jittery about the idea that credit problems in China could unravel.\u201dHeadline figures for bad loans in China most likely do not capture the size of the problem, analysts say. In her analysis, Ms. Chu estimates that at the end of 2016, as much as 22 percent of the Chinese financial system\u2019s loans and assets will be \u201cnonperforming,\u201d a banking industry term used to describe when a borrower has fallen behind on payments or is stressed in ways that make full repayment unlikely. In dollar terms, that works out to $6.6 trillion of troubled loans and assets.\u201cThis estimate really isn\u2019t that unreasonable,\u201d Ms. Chu said in the email. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen similar ratios in other countries. What\u2019s different is the scale, which reflects the massive size of China\u2019s credit boom.\u201d She estimates that the bad loans could lead to $4.4 trillion of actual losses.Although there is not enough official data to come up with a precise figure for bad loans, other analysts have come up with estimates of around $5 trillion.Given the murkiness of the Chinese financial industry, other analysts arrive at estimates for a \u201cbaseline\u201d figure for bad loans. Christopher Balding, an associate professor at the HSBC School of Business at Peking University, said that an analysis of corporations\u2019 interest payments to Chinese banks suggested that 8 percent of loans to companies might be troubled. But Mr. Balding said it was possible that the bad loan number for China\u2019s overall financial system could be higher.The looming question for the global economy, however, is how China might deal with a vast pool of bad debts.After a previous credit boom in the 1990s, the Chinese government provided financial support to help clean up the country\u2019s banks. But the cost of similar interventions today could be dauntingly high given the size of the latest credit boom. And more immediately, rising bad debts could crimp lending to strong companies, undermining economic growth in the process.\u201cMy sense is that the Chinese policy makers seem like a deer in the headlights,\u201d Mr. Balding said. \u201cThey really don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dIn Europe, for instance, some countries have taken years to come to grips with their banks\u2019 bad loans.In some cases, the delay arose from a reluctance, at least in part, to force people out of their homes. Even though Ireland\u2019s biggest banks suffered huge losses after the financial crisis, they held back from forcing many borrowers who had defaulted out of their homes. In recent years, the Irish government has pursued a widespread plan that aims to reduce the debt load of financially stressed homeowners. Such forbearance appears not to have weakened the Irish economy, which has recovered at a faster rate than those of other European countries.Still, the perils of waiting too long are evident in Italy, which in January announced a proposal to help banks sell their bad loans. Some critics of the plan say it resembles a government bailout of the banks, while other skeptics say the banks might not use it because it appears to be too expensive.\u201cThe big problem in the Italian system is that they acted very late,\u201d said Silvia Merler, an affiliate fellow at Bruegel, a European research firm that focuses on economic issues. \u201cThey could have done something smarter \u2014 and they could have done it earlier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Asked, You Answered: Is It Important to Elect a Female President?", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "AdvertisementThe Times asked readers whether electing a woman as president was important, and nearly 10,000 readers shared their views. Here is a sampling of responses, which have been condensed and edited.Another white man will not have the personal experience of societal prejudice against him that can drive a woman to fight for what is right, not just because she knows right and wrong, but because she\u2019s lived with it. It is of the utmost importance. With more than 50 percent of women in the work force, the continuing efforts to restrict women\u2019s control over their own bodies and the attempts to roll back the rights of all folks perceived as marginal, these are the times to elect a woman. All the other issues, including national defense and the economy, are handled by women all over the world. Every other major country in the world has had female leadership. It is our time. Although a woman elected as president would represent a benchmark in the movement for gender equality, electing a woman for president simply because of gender is sexist. There would be no progress achieved if the movement for gender equality utilizes the same methods that have kept women out of positions of power for so long. This would be sexist and backwards. If any progress is to be gained at all, then as voters we need to look past gender and, with a critical lens, focus on the policies that the candidates are presenting.While I understand and support Secretary Clinton\u2019s campaign for the presidency, I do not believe that I should be choosing a nominee based on gender. Having feminists rallying for her and essentially insulting women who are not voting for Clinton is most definitely not a way to gain momentum or support. Promoting a vote for Clinton based off of her being a woman is promoting sexism. While I support Secretary Clinton in her campaign to become the first woman president, I will not cast my vote based off of gender. I will be casting my vote based on who I believe will be the most successful and progressive in office. It is extremely important for me to see a woman president. I believe firmly that women have been left out of the political process for so long that we don\u2019t realize how strange it is to be 50 percent of the population and have zero percent representation at the presidential level. This country has been controlled by men from the beginning. It is time for a woman to have a chance to represent the people and to begin to develop the role of president as woman. What\u2019s crazy is that we even have to ask that question. It should be important to every man who has ever had a mother or sister or daughter. We should be asking more men this question. It\u2019s important that we elect the very best possible candidate to do the job and move America forward. If that person happens to be a woman, she should get our absolute support and respect. As a children\u2019s librarian, I studied the books in my public library. Very few were about confident women and girls. I wrote the first book that examined racism and sexism in children\u2019s literature. I don\u2019t want to see just any woman in the White House. I truly believe that Hillary is the most qualified candidate in both parties to carry on a tradition of social consciousness begun by such historic figures as William Lloyd Garrison, Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Jobless Rate Is 42 Percent? Donald Trump Has a Point, Sort Of", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceDonald Trump seems quite certain that the real unemployment rate is higher than the 4.9 percent that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported it to be. A lot higher.\u201cDon\u2019t believe these phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his victory speech after the New Hampshire primary Tuesday night. \u201cThe number\u2019s probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent.\u201dMr. Trump might be bombastic, but he\u2019s not entirely wrong. And the ways in which he is wrong are actually useful for anyone who wants to understand how to make sense of economic data.The truth is, there is no \u201ctrue\u201d unemployment rate. There are a nearly infinite multitude of ways to think about, and calculate, joblessness. The unemployment rate that is widely reported in the press on the first Friday of every month isn\u2019t some manna from heaven, but rather a convention that has developed over the years that gives a partial \u2014 but still useful \u2014 view of the state of the labor market.The B.L.S. itself reports six different unemployment rates, of which the one the press most commonly cites is called U-3, the third of the six options. But anyone with Microsoft Excel and access to B.L.S. and census data could dream up their own version.So what\u2019s in that 4.9 percent \u201cofficial\u201d unemployment rate? The numerator is Americans who are unemployed, the people who told a survey taker that they do not have a job but want one and have actively sought a job in the last four weeks. There were 7.8 million people in that category in January. The denominator is the total labor force, meaning people who either have a job or are looking for one; there were 158 million of those people.It\u2019s easy to see how you can get to a much larger unemployment rate if you change your definition for either of those numbers. Take the B.L.S.\u2019s broadest definition of unemployment for example, known as U-6.U-6 includes not just those 7.8 million people who have actively sought work in the last four weeks, but also millions more who told a survey taker that they wanted a job and had looked for one in the last year, including those who say they\u2019re discouraged by economic conditions, along with people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job. That measure of unemployment was 9.9 percent in January (or 10.5 percent if you want to cast aside the \u201cseasonal adjustment\u201d process that smooths out normal seasonal variation).But we don\u2019t have to restrict ourselves to the calculations that B.L.S. has done for us. With a little creativity we can come up with other definitions of unemployment that yield an even higher number.There are, after all, many millions of Americans who are of prime working age who are not working, not looking for a job, haven\u2019t looked for a job in the last year and yet in a healthier economy may well prefer to work.At the high point, in 1999, 84.6 percent of Americans 25 to 54 were working; now that is down to 81.1 percent. If we returned to the 1999 level, that would mean an additional 4.4 million working Americans. If we count those people \u2014 the missing workers \u2014 as unemployed, and tack them on to the definitions of unemployment included in U-6, we suddenly get to 20.1 million unemployed people and a 12.3 percent unemployment rate.But back to Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the true unemployment rate is more like 28 or 35 or 42 percent. Is there any plausible way to come up with a jobless rate at those kinds of levels?As it happens, there is, and it\u2019s right there near the top of the monthly jobless report. Only 59.6 percent of the United States population was employed in January. On the other side of that, a whopping 40.4 percent of the population is not employed.If that is your definition of unemployed, well, yeah, the United States does have 40 percent unemployment. But keep in mind that this counts as unemployed every retiree, every college student, everyone who is unable to work because of a disability and every parent who voluntarily stays at home to raise a child.But surely we can find a way to make the unemployment rate seem higher still, right?I did some back-of-the-envelope math and came up with a way to get a jobless rate of about 53 percent! Instead of just including people 16 and above, the way the B.L.S. does, we could throw in those good-for-nothing children who are neither working, looking for work nor counted as part of the labor force.Like my 2-year-old niece, Lilia, who if you ask me has had it too easy for too long. I just hope the job she finds in the Trump administration involves finger-painting.An earlier version of this article misstated the population used to calculate a 40.4 percent jobless rate via the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It includes people 16 and older; it does not include children.Advertisement"}

Indeed, there are many states like South Carolina, which will hold its Democratic primary Saturday, that look even worse for Sanders than Nevada.That is because of the narrowness of Sanders\u2019s winning demographics, as demonstrated in Nevada.Let\u2019s explore some of the positives for Sanders, the groups among which he won. He won liberals, of which there were many, and independents, of which there were few. He won people under 40, particularly those under 24, and whites with no college degree. He also won people who said their most important issue was income inequality and believed that the most important quality was having a candidate who cares about people like them or who was honest and trustworthy.According to the entrance poll, Sanders also won the Hispanic vote, but this is where some prominent poll watchers took exception to the poll\u2019s accuracy.\u201cBased on the results in Clark, the precincts in ELV, and the overall entrance poll error, I do not believe Sanders won the Hispanic vote.\u201dIt is true that Sanders\u2019s message may have more resonance with Hispanic voters than with other nonwhite groups, because Hispanic voters skew younger.\u201cHispanic millennials will account for nearly half (44 percent) of the record 27.3 million Hispanic eligible voters projected for 2016 \u2014 a share greater than any other racial or ethnic group of voters, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.\u201dBut the poll points out an even bigger problem for Sanders among black voters than millennials, and that\u2019s his lack of support among black women who \u201ccomprise a disproportionate segment of the black electorate.\u201dAs the Post pointed out in no uncertain terms:\u201cA Democratic victory in the general election requires enthusiastic support from black women, and black women are significantly more enthusiastic about Clinton than Sanders.\u201dIt is very hard to see how Sanders wins the nomination without winning the black and Hispanic vote in the Southern and Western states, not to mention New York and Michigan.That doesn\u2019t sound like a political revolution to me.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Banks, Lies and Emojis", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byIf you were a young iPhone-carrying client of RocketBank, a Russian start-up that offers app-based banking, you would have gotten some mixed messages on Thursday, Jan. 28. At 1:10 p.m., you would have received a letter written in RocketBank\u2019s trademark pally style, only worrisome, and accompanied by a \u201cshruggie\u201d emoji:\u201cHi [client\u2019s first name], our longtime partner Commercial Bank Intercommerz is having cash-flow issues. Technically, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you would have problems with RocketBank cards serviced by Intercommerz, but times being anxious as they are, we would like to warn you as soon as we can and help you take precautions.\u201d The letter went on to instruct clients to withdraw or transfer any funds they had on Intercommerz-serviced RocketBank-issued debit-card accounts.You would have been well-advised to follow the instructions posthaste. Within an hour and a half, Intercommerz stopped servicing RocketBank cards. Money could not be withdrawn or transferred, and no purchases could be made.At 3:50 p.m., RocketBank sent out a second letter to its customers:\u201cHi [client\u2019s first name], earlier today we did something hasty, without really checking all the facts, by sending out a letter recommending that clients withdraw funds from RocketBank cards issued by Intercommerz Bank. This was an unjustified action on the part of our marketing department, and we apologize, first of all, to our esteemed partner Intercommerz Bank, as well as to you, our dear clients. We ask you not to give in to panic that could harm the bank.\u201dBut Intercommerz-issued RocketBank cards did not start working again after this letter.The next day, RocketBank posted a long explanation on its website. It recounted the chronology of the contradictory letters and said that Intercommerz Bank had demanded that RocketBank retract the information in its first letter if it wanted Intercommerz to renew services to its clients. After the retraction \u2014 the second letter \u2014 went out, Intercommerz upped the price of renewing services, demanding that RocketBank arrange for the retraction to be published in the media. Then, said the RocketBank post, even after RocketBank complied with this condition to the best of its ability, Intercommerz did not unblock its cards.By the time this explanation was published, the Russian Central Bank had appointed a temporary administration at Intercommerz, essentially beginning a bankruptcy process.Banks have been going belly-up in Russia with alarming regularity and, generally speaking, little publicity. The RocketBank incident provides a rare glimpse not only into the routine business of bankruptcy but also into the peculiarity of communication in contemporary Russia. Most of the time, information is perceived and treated solely as an instrument of manipulation. Truth is what the stronger party says it is. Nothing shapes a message better than blackmail.That Russia is a land of lies and propaganda is hardly news, and so the RocketBank incident is telling in another way. The Russian economic crisis, although undeniably severe \u2014 the ruble is worth against the U.S. dollar today less than half of what it was worth two years ago \u2014 has proceeded in a calm, almost plodding way. Contrary to what some hopeful critics of the Putin regime once predicted, Russians have not taken to the streets in response to plummeting living standards. Never mind protests: There has been nary a bank run.That\u2019s because even panic requires open lines of communication. Free media can help spread panic. But Russian television, which is where the vast majority of people get their information, alternates between uplifting stories about growing domestic production and Russia\u2019s boundless resources, and fear-mongering reports about United States aggression toward Russia.President Vladimir Putin has on several occasions told the nation that dropping oil prices and economic sanctions have only strengthened the Russian economy. Sure, Russians are watching the exchange rate fall while the prices of goods in grocery stores rise, but they do not see their subjective experience affirmed anywhere outside the narrow confines of their kitchens and social-network groups.When your president, your bank and your boss keep lying to you, claiming that things are just fine even as you witness your real purchasing power evaporate, they may not be able to convince you that everything is fine, but they are able to sow doubt. And by routinely denying your lived experience, they also succeed in demonstrating their power over you, if not over the actual economy.Most important, they effectively prevent the emergence of any social consensus that could, in turn, lead to panic or even protest. So the Russian economy will likely continue its downward slide in eerie silence, leaving every Russian alone with the misery of growing poorer every day.Masha Gessen is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Brothers: The Road to an American Tragedy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colonial Architecture Fades From Ho Chi Minh City, and Residents Mourn", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byHo Chi Minh City JournalHO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam \u2014 When Nguyen Viet moved back to Vietnam from Britain in 2014, he was hired to write design guidelines for a redevelopment project in downtown Ho Chi Minh City. He had just earned his master\u2019s degree in urban design and planning, and was eager to make an impact.But before he could finish writing the guidelines, a building on the project site \u2014 a 1929 Art Deco apartment beside the former Rue Catinat, once a central artery of French-colonial Indochina \u2014 was demolished.\u201cWhat I realized is that they have very little power,\u201d Mr. Viet, 28, said of his fellow urban planners. \u201cThe fates of the buildings were being decided by someone else.\u201dBut when Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s property market perked up after a slump that followed the 2008 financial crisis, dozens of prewar buildings \u2014 spanning the colonial to modernist eras \u2014 were razed to make room for new ones. As the city\u2019s modest skyline grows, residents are watching with a mixture of awe and trepidation.\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of destruction, especially in the last five to seven years, I would say, and mainly by these huge, huge, huge developments,\u201d said Hoanh Tran, design principal at HTA+Pizzini Architects here and a former historic preservation consultant in New York City.Today, many of the city\u2019s remaining colonial-era apartment blocks are mixed-use and charmingly dilapidated, with an entrepreneurial buzz that lures stylish retailers and mom-and-pop vendors alike.A prime example is 151 Dong Khoi Street, a colonial-era building with yellow concrete walls and tiled wall mosaics. Its ground level has an arcade \u2014 once the entrance to the Catinat-Cin\u00e9 movie house \u2014 where vendors hawk greeting cards and inexpensive artwork. But its upper levels house L\u2019Usine, a cafe and lifestyle boutique, and Galerie Quynh, a commercial art gallery that would not look out of place in Paris or New York. Tearing these old buildings down, Mr. Tran said, rips holes in the city\u2019s social fabric.\u201cIf it happens a lot, then in a decade you won\u2019t recognize this place,\u201d he said.The historic downtown already presents a striking contrast to its former self. Its colonial-era cathedral, post office and opera house now sit near glittering malls, apartments and office towers. A handful of 35-plus-story skyscrapers have appeared since 2010, and an 81-story building is being constructed by the private conglomerate Vingroup.Statistics on demolitions are scarce, but the Ho Chi Minh City Urban Development Management Support Center, a French-Vietnamese research agency, found that at least 207 colonial-era villas in two of the city\u2019s 24 districts were demolished or significantly altered from 1994 to 2014.In the past few years, several thousand residents have started to network on new Facebook groups dedicated to celebrating and protecting the city\u2019s historic buildings, several participants said.The groundswell appears to reflect a wider trend: Although Vietnam\u2019s governing Communist Party bans private media and aggressively punishes internal dissidents, the rise of social media has enabled millions of Vietnamese to discuss hot-button social issues online without much fear of reprisal.Thousands of Vietnamese flocked to Facebook last year, for example, to criticize a government plan to cut down and replace 6,700 trees in Hanoi, the capital. City officials eventually backed down.\u201cA lot of young people would like to be part of a movement,\u201d said Nguyen Duc Hiep, an environmental scientist in Australia and a visiting researcher at Ton Duc Thang University here.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to watch and let the authorities decide what should be done; they want to have a voice,\u201d said Mr. Hiep, who is also an administrator of a Facebook group dedicated to vintage shophouses.The public outcry here has largely focused on a plan to overhaul the Saigon Tax Trade Center, a 1924 department store that was drastically transformed over the decades, but whose interior still has wrought-iron balustrades, an intricately tiled floor and grand staircase, and other original design features.The grass-roots advocacy has focused on those features, but aesthetics are not the only motivating factor: Some residents feel protective toward the building because they remember visiting it as children.\u201cIt is the history that the Saigoneers want to keep,\u201d said Tuan A. Phung, the honorary consul general of Finland in Ho Chi Minh City and the leader of a 2014 online petition to save the building. \u201cThe feeling, the atmosphere, memories.\u201dLater in 2014, the Culture Ministry asked the city\u2019s governing People\u2019s Committee to step in. And last year the tax center\u2019s owner, the state-owned Saigon Trading Group, sent local officials a conservation plan for its scheduled redevelopment work.But Mr. Phung said he worried about the plan, which proposes to remove the vintage design features and later reinstall them, because the details were not publicly released.\u201cThey don\u2019t have the habit of being responsive\u201d to public feedback, he said of the company\u2019s executives, who did not respond to interview requests. \u201cInstead they\u2019re responsive to the boss, which is the People\u2019s Committee.\u201dEqually contentious is a plan by Vingroup to build a mixed-use development in Ba Son, a military-controlled naval complex at the edge of downtown.In a brief statement, Vingroup said the project would include commercial, residential and \u201cheritage preservation\u201d elements, including a section with the original Ba Son Shipyard.But the makeover risks treading on a key symbol of Vietnamese nationalism.The naval complex was developed during the Nguyen dynasty and hosted a 1925 labor strike against French industrialists led by future President Ton Duc Thang. In 1993, the Culture Ministry declared the shipyard a national historic site.Architects and other experts say privately that the project\u2019s historical resonance, powerful developer and military association make it politically delicate. And they wonder aloud if most of the site\u2019s historic buildings will be sensitively renovated, or even retained.Nguyen Hong Tien, a Construction Ministry official in Hanoi, said Vingroup\u2019s previous projects in downtown Ho Chi Minh City have benefited the city\u2019s economy and aesthetic.However, he added, \u201cif we just see the immediate benefits of new development, then in the future we cannot restore what we have lost.\u201d\u201cThe key to tourism is creating stories around urban landscapes, and people come here wanting to do Graham Greene tours,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the stuff associated with Graham Greene is gone.\u201dOn that list, he said, is the 1929 apartment that was demolished in 2014, and another historic building along the old Rue Catinat that was replaced by a Vingroup mall.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nudges Aren\u2019t Enough for Problems Like Retirement Savings", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneWhy don\u2019t Americans save more for old age? Even when their employers promise to match their savings, workers often fail to salt away their earnings for the future, inexplicably leaving money on the table.Yet, though lauded by policy makers as a powerful new tool in the policy kit, the approach poses a risk, too. It fosters a belief that tweaks based on an understanding of people\u2019s psychology could lead to a vastly improved society at little or no cost to taxpayers.\u201cThe insights from behavioral economics are beautiful from a research perspective,\u201d said Eldar Shafir, a professor of psychology at Princeton who is an expert on decision-making and a leading proponent of the behavioral approach to economics. \u201cBut its popularity no doubt comes from a combination of lack of funds and political helplessness.\u201dSending text messages to low-income high school graduates about prematriculation requirements for college increased enrollment rates. Well-written emails increased the participation of military service members in the federal employees savings plan. They also bolstered enrollment in health insurance plans under Obamacare.Automatic enrollment in retirement accounts counts as the most successful nudge yet tested on a large scale. It also underscores the limitations of the strategy.It\u2019s great to know that there are promising ways to improve society by developing a smarter email or changing the default choice on an application form. But if the question is whether policy makers can cheaply nudge Americans out of destitution onto a path to prosperity, the answer must be no.The limits of nudging come into focus in an evaluation by the research firm MDRC of a set of behavioral nudges intended to increase poor fathers\u2019 payment of child support for their children.If the government\u2019s objective was to change the landscape of child support \u2014 a critical policy question considering there are 25 million children living with a single parent \u2014 this will not be enough.Policy experimentation is always welcome. But the approach taken in this instance seems to spring from a shaky assumption: Poor noncustodial fathers can afford child support but choose not to pay it. As the MDRC researchers put it, \u201cthe modest findings suggest that the targeted noncustodial parents may have a limited ability to pay.\u201d Dealing with that, however, might cost taxpayers real money.They tried several behavioral techniques to persuade poor Americans to take advantage of individual development accounts, savings accounts topped off by the federal government at a rate of $2 for every $1 saved. That\u2019s quite a deal.But nothing worked. \u201cPeople are not saving because they have such low incomes,\u201d Professor Loewenstein concluded.This is not to bash behavioral economics. It offers invaluable insights into how real humans depart from the robotic assumptions of most economists, who posit that any rational individual will jump through every hoop to gain a benefit if it exceeds its cost.Emily Schmitt is a senior social science research analyst at the Administration for Children and Families in the Health and Human Services Department. She ran the child support experiments in Ohio along with a dozen others testing how to improve people\u2019s access to government programs.She noted that behavioral insights are critical to ensure that the poor gain access to the benefits available to them. \u201cUnintentional barriers can screen out the people that need programs the most,\u201d she said.And there is more. If we want to diminish poverty, it is crucial to understand the actions of the poor better.\u201cThe poor lack two things: money and cognitive freedom,\u201d Professor Shafir told me.That understanding might act as a corrective for the belief that poor people are mostly to blame for their poverty. And it poses a challenge for those who argue that the government\u2019s role should mostly be to curb dependence on public support while exhorting the poor to get their act together, marry, get a job.It could shift the onus onto those with power over poor Americans \u2014 employers, government \u2014 not just to design their application forms, their business hours, their policies in a way that takes into account the restrictions poverty imposes, but also to shift real resources to where they would make the biggest difference.This is hardly a cheap lunch, however.Take retirement savings. The government has encouraged employers to nudge their employees into opening savings accounts. But what if the problem is bigger? What if workers simply cannot assess how much they need to save today to navigate turbulent financial markets and still have a decent nest egg 20, 30 years down the road?In such a case the better response \u2014 drawing from the insights unveiled by behavioral economics \u2014 might be to replace all the tax subsidies and other incentives for so-called defined-contribution pensions with something that works more effectively for more Americans.\u201cThe single biggest contribution of behavioral economics to public policy is taking this flawed approach to retirement savings and making it a little bit more viable,\u201d Mr. Loewenstein told me. \u201cThe downside is that if we make it just sufficiently viable, people won\u2019t recognize how bankrupt the concept is.\u201dSociety could be nudged in the wrong way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Thwarted Reformers Set Careful Goals for Coming Vote", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byTEHRAN \u2014 They clapped and cheered, and many shouted for the release of their political leaders under house arrest for the past five years. Some held up pictures of a popular former president, Mohammad Khatami. Pictures of his hands, to be exact, because displaying his portrait is illegal.The election of President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 raised the hopes of the reform movement, and Iran negotiated a nuclear deal with the West and rejoined the world economy. But internally, virtually nothing changed. The political space remained constrained, and the hope that reformers would re-emerge as a guiding force has not come to fruition.As the reformers again try to stage a comeback, their agenda, once a sweeping manifesto for change in the Islamic republic, has been narrowed to simply calling for a high turnout in the coming vote.During the campaign rally, the new leader of the reformists, Mohammad Reza Aref, seemed most concerned with reassuring hard-liners who accuse his movement of opposing the legacy of the 1979 revolution. \u201cWe act within the system,\u201d Mr. Aref said in front of thousands of supporters. \u201cNobody loves the revolution more than us. Like a mother, we feel concern for it and want to preserve it.\u201dFor the elections, thousands of reformist candidates were barred from participating by the Guardian Council, a 12-member vetting body that is dominated by hard-liners. As a result, the remaining reformists have joined forces with supporters of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s self-styled moderate government.Despite the obstacles, the reformists still want Iranians to vote. \u201cOur main goal is to have a minimum of hard-liners, both in the assembly and in the Parliament,\u201d said Hamidreza Jaleipour, an advocate for the movement. \u201cNothing more. We are just being realistic.\u201dIn the early 2000s, the reformists openly sought to alter the Islamic republic\u2019s rigid ideology, and rewrite laws in order to decrease gender inequality and promote personal freedoms. The leader, Mr. Khatami, served two terms as president, and for four years the reformists dominated Parliament. Backed by record numbers of voters, they seemed set to herald a new, more modern era for Iran. Instead, the period was dominated by political infighting, student protests, sit-ins in Parliament and the closure of dozens of reformist newspapers.However, Iran\u2019s young society has changed at a lightning pace over the past decade, propelled by the rise of the Internet, satellite television, the influx of oil money and cheap foreign travel.In Tehran and other Iranian cities, long-forbidden Western music can be heard in restaurants, some women drive cars without the obligatory head scarf, and blocked social media sites can be reached with illegal software that is sold openly. But such freedoms are only tolerated, not encapsulated in legislation, as a way of allowing people to blow off steam without officially altering revolutionary Islamic ideology. Political reforms have been aggressively blocked on all levels by hard-liners who have gained unprecedented power. Much has been done to undermine the reformists.In recent years, Mr. Khatami has been rendered invisible. Newspapers are not allowed to publish his picture, and politicians, even his supporters, often avoid mentioning his name. Two former presidential candidates, Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, have spent more than five years under house arrest since becoming the figureheads of postelection protests in 2009. For those who remained free, the experience hardened their conviction that compromise and adaptation were crucial to the reformists\u2019 political survival. Especially for the coming elections.\u201cWe need to remain on the political stage,\u201d said Ibrahim Asgarzadeh, a reformist leader who was disqualified from participating in the elections. Old slogans and demands have been shelved. \u201cYes, we now do not loudly advocate freeing those under house arrest, human rights and freedom of speech,\u201d Mr. Asgarzadeh said. \u201cOur goal is to be a part of the establishment, in order to change it from within in the future.\u201dOthers, who are critical of the movement, say its leaders are watering down their ideals to the point where there is nothing left. \u201cTheir agenda is minimal, their ambitions have shrunk to the same level,\u201d said Behzad Nourfard, a former activist. \u201cThey are aligning themselves with people whom they hope will support them in the future. But who opposed them in the past.\u201dIranians often say they get to choose between the bad and the worse in elections. While the reformists might have difficulty promoting their agenda, they are political kingmakers. They can attract millions of potential voters because they are the only viable political option for many urban dwellers. However, these people will vote only if they feel something is at stake. Used to self-censorship, and shy of the dangers of political activism, they tend to turn out in large numbers if they feel it is in their interest.Fear of hard-line dominance is a major driving force. In 2013, in the final week before the elections, the reformists started supporting Mr. Rouhani, whom they saw as a technocrat, rather than a reformer. Many urbanites feared a hard-liner, Saeed Jalili, might win. Instead of opting for a boycott, the reformists offered support that was a decisive factor in Mr. Rouhani\u2019s victory.The nuclear deal engineered during his presidency has been a major success for the reformists as well. \u201cBut domestically we have not seen much change,\u201d Mr. Asgarzadeh said. When thousands of reformist candidates were disqualified in January, Mr. Rouhani did not intervene on their behalf. \u201cThat was disappointing as well,\u201d Mr. Asgarzadeh said.Nevertheless, for this election, the reformists are again supporting the government, saying that anything is better than the continuation of hard-line dominance in Parliament.The reformists are even supporting a conservative member of Parliament, Ali Motahari, who stresses that he is independent and not a reformist. On religious issues such as the mandatory Islamic scarf, Mr. Motahari has emphasized that he is a hard-liner and promoted enforcement. The reform leaders are also supporting Ali Larijani, the current head of the Parliament, for a second term. Mr. Larijani has been repositioning himself toward the political middle, but is a scion of a conservative, powerful family.Mr. Jaleipour, the reformist advocate, said the compromises were part of reaching political adulthood in a hostile environment. \u201cWe have learned from our errors and mistakes,\u201d he said, adding that in the beginning, \u201cwe thought Iran could be democratized overnight. That was wishful thinking. We shouldn\u2019t have high expectations. That only brings frustration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Pounding rice into a doughy holiday treat with a giant wooden mallet. Warmly shaking hands with an elderly woman as an enthusiastic crowd gathers.But those images conflict with contemporary reality here. Within days, this struggling community of 250 souls will be nearly empty.Like an increasing number of villages across China, most of its people have left to find work or attend school elsewhere, returning to their ancestral home only for the New Year holidays. The rest of the year, only 50 or so people live here, most of them elderly, usually fending for themselves.\u201cOur village is an empty nest village,\u201d said Xiong Jifu, 63, a retired village bookkeeper, who said he lives alone while his son works 250 miles away. \u201cThis is a very, very hard problem. If you don\u2019t go out to work, there\u2019s no income for the family. If you all leave, there\u2019s nobody left in the village.\u201dThe contrast between the lyrical village life as seen on TV and the realities of rural social fragmentation is stark, even in this hamlet that was handpicked to greet China\u2019s top leader. It is a pattern repeated across much of China, where many rural parents, children and grandparents often live scattered at great distances.\u201cBasically, rural society is in a state of collapse. Villagers come together only for the New Year,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a historian at Renmin University in Beijing who has written widely about rural issues and politics. \u201cVillages have become empty shells.\u201dWhile Communist Party leaders\u2019 rural pilgrimages every Lunar New Year holiday are a staple of party propaganda, China\u2019s recent economic slowdown has made rural life even more difficult, magnifying the mismatch between image and reality.Mr. Xi\u2019s hourlong visit was partly to promote his promises to lift more people out of poverty through local relief programs.But villages like this one, whose terraced rice fields are crumbling from neglect, depend on the economy far beyond its borders. Remittances from the men and women who work in factories and menial jobs far away pay for new homes, televisions, refrigerators and other improvements here.Villagers said that China\u2019s slowed growth, especially in manufacturing and building, had hurt their confidence in the future. Factory shutdowns are a concern, many said.\u201cWe\u2019re worried about the factories,\u201d said Peng Qinglian, a 43-year-old resident. He said he was jobless for six months last year when the auto parts factory where he worked in southern China closed. \u201cThe pressure was intense. I had to find work, and it was hard for month after month.\u201dThe sunny portrayal of a village in crisis was just one of the ways Mr. Xi\u2019s visit to this part of China was cast and choreographed to fit his zealous ideological agenda.Until Mr. Xi\u2019s visit this month, Shenshan (the name means \u201cspirit mountain\u201d) Village nestled in obscurity in the hills above the monuments venerating Mao and the revolution. The village, reached by a one-lane concrete road winding two miles through bamboo and trees, was unknown even to many residents of the region.Still, officials took care to ensure that Mr. Xi\u2019s visit was free of any discord.About a week before he arrived, security officers encamped here to check homes, weed out troublemakers, and, according to several villagers, tell people not to say anything \u201cirresponsible\u201d to an unnamed senior leader who would soon visit.\u201cWe were told not to talk about bad things,\u201d said Wu Guilan, a sprightly 67-year-old woman. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t dare say anything like that anyway. I was afraid it would look bad to say something about our own problems in front of so many people.\u201dOne problem that she did not mention, for instance, was how the courts had failed to deliver promised compensation to her son after his wife was killed by a reckless driver in 2013.\u201cBut we wouldn\u2019t dare raise our personal problems,\u201d said the son, Luo Linhui. \u201cWe can\u2019t spoil a leader\u2019s visit.\u201dOfficials also blocked residents of the back part of the village, where dozens of members of the Hakka ethnic minority live, from glimpsing Mr. Xi, residents said. The Hakka have long had tensions with other people in this region, and there have been feuds over land and forests.There was to be no risk of Mr. Xi seeing any such flare-ups.\u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to go to see him,\u201d said Lai Yuanlong, a 40-year-old Hakka farmer, leaning over a smoky wood fire in his drafty home. \u201cNobody here was on the list. But he\u2019s also our leader.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the emperor of 1.3 billion people,\u201d said Mr. Xiong, the retired bookkeeper. \u201cWithout him, the problem of corruption would have kept getting worse and worse.\u201dAfter Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, officials promised to expand the road into the village to lure more visitors.Some tourists, led by guides excitedly recounting \u201cPapa Xi\u2019s\u201d visit, have already appeared.But Luo Lin\u2019geng, a worker in a ceramics factory who had the privilege of briefly chatting with Mr. Xi about his life, said that Shenshan might become a ghost village before it benefits from its new fame and the attention of local officials.\u201cNow everyone knows about Shenshan Village,\u201d he said. \u201cBut soon almost nobody will be here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And while Mr. Brown often invokes California\u2019s natural resources, he has at times expressed irritation at what he sees as excessive regulation that has slowed development.The commission was voted into existence under California\u2019s ballot proposition system in 1972, and it was made permanent when Mr. Brown signed the California Coastal Act of 1976 during his first of two consecutive terms as governor.But he grew critical of the commission in the late 1970s after it denied an application by the singer Linda Ronstadt, Mr. Brown\u2019s girlfriend at the time, for work on her home in Malibu. Mr. Brown was elected governor again in 2010 and 2014.Mr. Brown\u2019s press secretary, Evan Westrup, said the governor had not discussed the possible dismissal of Mr. Lester with his appointees. \u201cThis is a personnel matter, initiated without any involvement from our office, for the Coastal Commission to decide,\u201d Mr. Westrup said.Environmentalists, former commission members and state lawmakers \u2014 including the speaker of the State Assembly, Toni Atkins \u2014 have mobilized behind Mr. Lester, describing the effort to fire him as a move by pro-development forces to develop valued coastline.\u201cWe are not just talking about whether or not the current executive director retains his position as executive director,\u201d said Mel Nutter, who was chairman of the commission from 1982 to 1985. \u201cWe are looking at a dynamic where the whole focus and the mission of the commission itself may be at risk.\u201dThe commission applies the strict development and wildlife protection provisions of the state\u2019s Coastal Act to protected coastal land, acting on the recommendations of the commission staff led by Mr. Lester. He declined to be interviewed for this article.\u201cThe California Coastal Commission staff is one of the most difficult bureaucracies to work with, I believe, in the entire United States,\u201d said Fred Gaines, a lawyer and lobbyist who has represented owners of oceanfront homes such as the actor Dustin Hoffman and the director Steven Spielberg. \u201cThey put severe limitation on property owners\u2019 right to use their property.\u201dJana Zimmer, who served on the commission from 2011 to 2015, said environmentalists were unfairly characterizing the intentions of the board, which she said regularly ratified staff recommendations.\u201cMy hope was that I could help to depoliticize the position of the executive director and focus on an array of programmatic concerns that I saw as needing to be addressed to keep the coastal program moving forward,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe that my vision has been clear and incisive, and that my performance and accomplishments in the administration of the coastal program have been exceptionally strong.\u201dIn one high-profile case, the commission, after nearly a decade of resistance from environmentalists, last year approved the construction of a five-house compound by Dave Evans, the lead guitarist of U2, who is known as the Edge, on a pristine bluff of oceanfront land in Malibu.The commission is scheduled to vote next month on one of the largest coastal development proposals that has ever come before it: 1,100 acres at Banning Ranch on Newport Beach. The project is said to be worth over $1 billion and has stirred huge community opposition.\u201cThe pressure to develop California\u2019s coast is an everlasting tug of war,\u201d said Stefanie Sekich-Quinn, the coastal preservation manager with the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental group. \u201cUnfortunately, we are starting to see special interests gaining some ground. It\u2019s taken us 40 years to protect what we have now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wanted in China: More Male Teachers, to Make Boys Men", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byFUZHOU, China \u2014 The history class began with a lesson on being manly.Lin Wei, 27, one of a handful of male sixth-grade teachers at a primary school here, has made a habit of telling stories about warlords who threw witches into rivers and soldiers who outsmarted Japanese troops. \u201cMen have special duties,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to be brave, protect women and take responsibility for wrongdoing.\u201dWorried that a shortage of male teachers has produced a generation of timid, self-centered and effeminate boys, Chinese educators are working to reinforce traditional gender roles and values in the classroom.In Zhengzhou, a city on the Yellow River, schools have asked boys to sign pledges to act like \u201creal men.\u201d In Shanghai, principals are trying boys-only classes with courses like martial arts, computer repair and physics. In Hangzhou, in eastern China, educators have started a summer camp called West Point Boys, complete with taekwondo classes and the motto, \u201cWe bring out the men in boys.\u201dEducation officials across China are aggressively recruiting male teachers, as the Chinese news media warns of a need to \u201csalvage masculinity in schools.\u201d The call for more male-oriented education has prompted a broader debate about gender equality and social identity at a time when the country\u2019s leaders are seeking to make the labor market more meritocratic.The view that there is an overabundance of female teachers that has had a negative effect on boys has, perhaps predictably, led to a backlash. Parents have accused schools of propagating rigid concepts of masculinity and gender norms, and female educators have denounced efforts to attract more male teachers with lavish perks as sexist.In Fuzhou, a city of two million, colleges and universities have come under fire for relaxing admissions requirements and offering full scholarships and teaching jobs to young men.Xue Rongfang, a student at Fujian Normal University, wondered why women should not get similar benefits to enter traditionally male fields. \u201cIf women go into architecture, shouldn\u2019t the government give them a free education too?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should men get this benefit?\u201dIn some schools, teachers said the large number of female educators, especially in lower grades, had a positive influence on students.\u201cWe have a more intuitive sense of children\u2019s needs,\u201d said Li Yue, 36, a kindergarten teacher in Fuzhou. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the responsibility of schools to teach boys to be boys. It\u2019s the responsibility of parents.\u201dChinese education officials, for the most part, appear to disagree. While men are scarce among the ranks of public schoolteachers worldwide, including in the United States, the gender imbalance is especially pronounced in China, where women occupy four out of five teaching positions in urban areas, according to a 2012 study by Beijing Normal University. China has 15 million schoolteachers and about 270 million students in kindergarten through 12th grade.In some districts, school officials have pressured local officials to intervene, saying students are underperforming because they lack male role models. Boys consistently trail girls on college entrance exams, and disparities in academic achievement emerge as early as third grade, according to a 2012 study by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.In recent years, education officials in Fujian, Guangxi and Jiangsu have created incentives for male teachers, arguing that men bring an energetic style that appeals to boys.Still, it is not clear that children derive academic benefits from studying with teachers of the same sex. A 2008 study of 9,000 11-year-olds in Britain found no tie between male teachers and higher academic performance among boys.Shanghai No. 8 Senior High School began an all-boys program for 60 students in 2012 with the goal of \u201creviving the masculinity\u201d of its male students.Zhou Jiahao, 18, a senior at the school, said he did not think China faced a masculinity crisis in its classrooms. But he said boys felt more confident when they took classes together. The school offers courses in etiquette, coding and wilderness survival, among others.\u201cIn classes with female students, we might not dare speak out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s just boys, we feel much freer.\u201dSun Yunxiao, a researcher at the China Youth and Children Research Center and the author of a book on education titled \u201cSave the Boys,\u201d said Chinese students were increasingly distant from male role models, including their fathers.\u201cChildren need both female teachers and male teachers for their development,\u201d Mr. Sun said.A major obstacle to luring more men into teaching are the modest wages paid to educators in China (as elsewhere in the world).In 2013, the average salary of a teacher at a public school was about $17,000, according to government statistics. While Chinese law dictates that teacher pay should not fall below the salaries of other public servants, enforcement has been inconsistent, and some seek out higher-paying positions in other fields.In Fujian Province, education officials hope to recruit thousands of male teachers a year, particularly for preschools, where the shortage is most severe.Of the million or so kindergarten teachers and instructional aides across China, about 60,000, or 6 percent, are male, government statistics show. Retention of male teachers is a serious challenge in China, and many male educators complain that they are lonely and disrespected.Fujian Normal University admitted its first class of male student teachers under the tuition-free program last fall. Each day, they study for up to 12 hours under the guidance of female professors, who coach them in reading body language and showing empathy. Because they are expected to be in high demand, they are required to gain certification in a number of subjects, including English, math and science.Wang Ningde, 19, said he hoped to teach Chinese in an elementary school. But he said he was concerned about a perception in some schools that male teachers were untrustworthy.\u201cIf we have only women as teachers,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will still have many problems.\u201dJiang Weiwen, 19, a first-year student at the university, said many of his friends and relatives were confused when he said he wanted a career in teaching.\u201cThey asked, \u2018Why would a man want to be a teacher?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThey think men should be ambitious, and that it\u2019s so stable and bland to be a teacher.\u201dEven on campus, the students are mocked for their career choice, Mr. Jiang said, and some are stereotyped as gay or effeminate.Mr. Lin, in his classroom in Fuzhou, said he felt a responsibility to teach his students \u201cto be brave.\u201d In his history lessons, he speaks about the physical effort by the men who built the Great Wall. And in a nod to chivalry, he prods boys to apologize to girls when they get into fights.Each year, he recounts the story of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain, a tale meant to underscore the importance of sacrifice. In the story, a group of soldiers lures the Japanese Army up a mountain during World War II, giving the Chinese Army time to regroup. The soldiers on the mountain, rather than be killed by the Japanese when they reach the top, jump from the side, shouting, \u201cLong live the Communist Party\u201d as they fall.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an education researcher.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Budget Seeks to Ease Economic Fears for U.S. Workers", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisIn laying out proposals from improving access to 401(k) plans to supplementing the incomes of workers who accept lower wages after losing jobs, the president laid out a clear, if limited, view of government\u2019s role in the labor market. Inside the budget is a detailed agenda to ease the anxieties of workers weighed down by job insecurity and income volatility.Those anxieties are among the factors that propelled two populist candidates to victory in the New Hampshire presidential primaries on Tuesday.Mr. Obama\u2019s approach has clear advantages at a moment when Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and when the business community has made clear its opposition to a greater government role in the economy.\u201cThese are policies that broadly accept the extent to which risks have shifted onto working people and they try to mitigate the impact of those risks,\u201d Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said about the president\u2019s proposals. \u201cThey have not viewed it as their job to try to change the underlying shifts in risks.\u201dWith the left invigorated by the campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, such assurances may fall flat with wide swaths of Democrats.\u201cThe president has some good messaging proposals that would have a positive impact,\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots organizing group. \u201cBut a new Democratic president winning on something like a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal would reset the debate.\u201dPerhaps no set of budgetary ideas better illustrates the president\u2019s limited approach than those relating to worker pensions, which would cost about $18 billion over the next decade. The president is proposing a variety of changes, including making it easier for small-business employees to buy into pooled 401(k) plans, which typically have lower costs than plans offered only to employees of a single small business.Mr. Obama also wants to encourage more employers to automatically enroll workers in 401(k) programs and allow them to opt out, which yields greater participation and retirement savings than simply offering plans to those who sign up.But the proposals are a far cry from resurrecting the so-called defined benefit model that reigned during the decades after World War II, said Teresa Ghilarducci, who studies pension systems at the New School for Social Research. She has proposed a system of portable individual accounts in which contributions are pooled, workers are guaranteed a minimum 2 percent rate of return, and the benefits are doled out annually after retirement so that workers do not prematurely run down their savings.Likewise, the wage insurance proposal would provide many former manufacturing workers who settle for lower-paying service jobs with a wage supplement equivalent to half the difference between their current and previous annual pay. That supplement would total up to $10,000 per worker over two years.Still, for manufacturing workers, those efforts will seem vastly inferior to rebuilding the domestic manufacturing base, something the budget only feints at through small investments in manufacturing research and development and subsidies to help small manufacturers scale up operations. (The budget does propose a major investment in clean-transportation research.)\u201cTo me it\u2019s kind of a salve, an ointment for the consequences of trade policy and globalization,\u201d said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group jointly financed by industry and labor.But, he said, bringing back high-paying manufacturing would require large investments and tax benefits to encourage businesses to bring overseas jobs back, something the budget finances only modestly, and the kind of aggressive trade enforcement for which the administration has shown little appetite. (It says it would create disincentives for offshoring by changing how it taxes foreign profits.)The moderation of many of the president\u2019s budget proposals for workers and the economy reflect the White House belief that, even at this late date in the administration, it may be able to strike a handful of deals with Republican leaders in Congress.Wage support, in principle, could win Republican support, said Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the former domestic policy director for Mitt Romney.\u201cThe idea of targeting financial support to people who, especially later in their careers, are choosing between going back to a lower-wage job, or potentially ending up on disability or something else \u2014 it\u2019s a win-win to have them in the work force,\u201d he said.That does not entirely explain the moderation. In the same budget, the president embraced a $10-per-barrel tax on oil. That effort makes sense only as a way of shifting the debate on climate policy and infrastructure, given its dead-on-arrival prospects.But Mr. Obama may have accommodated his policies to the tectonic shifts in the economy in recent decades because he genuinely believes it can be futile to resist.As Seth D. Harris, a former deputy secretary of labor under Mr. Obama, put it: \u201cThese proposals make sense considering the trajectory of the president\u2019s agenda from 2008 until today. For him to all of a sudden become Bernie Sanders would be inconsistent with the larger narrative of his presidency.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the involvement of Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots organizing group, in the presidential campaign. They have not endorsed a candidate; it is not that case that they support Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Advertisement"}

In the meantime, the less gasoline we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re burning the better off we are.People shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ignore the fact, though, that the demand is still somewhat driven by the tax credits and portfolio standards. So we still have quite a ways to go, particularly when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to get from 20 percent of the energy sources up to the eventual 100 percent we need, where then you run into the big challenge of intermittency [dips and peaks in power as wind and solar sources vary] and the cost of adding storage that would deal with that. This makes the economics dramatically tougher because batteries haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t improved that much. Now I and many other people are investing in companies that are going to try and see what we can do with batteries. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not guaranteed that their price will come down a lot. So solar and wind are great, but as they exist today, for countries like India, either in terms of cost or reliability, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to get used substantially without innovations in cost and storage or alternative approaches.Being aware of those different costs, we know which things really bring dramatic greenhouse gas reductions, particularly given the goals, reflected in the Paris climate agreement, of getting close to zero emissions. Things that only cut you down even 50 percent, like switching to natural gas, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t achieve the 2050 goal. And so the Coalition will be scrutinizing biofuels to ask if they can be a big part of the solution. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m impressed that people are now looking at the issue comprehensively.

I saw this in a packed, stuffy auditorium at Elm Street Middle School on a warm Wednesday night, at a town hall with Senator Ted Cruz.In the row in front of me, in a pile of cardboard Ted Cruz posters, sat a young father and mother with a baby and two little boys. The baby was wriggling, the mother was trying to hear Mr. Cruz, the boys were trying to make each other laugh by putting M&M\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in their noses. One M&M went too deep, and the woman, baby in one arm, spent several tense moments squeezing her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose like a toothpaste tube until it reappeared.I thought: Cruz voters already have their hands full, on top of America going to hell. The talk-radio personality who did the warmup spoke of God, country and socialist sabotage as if it were\u00c2\u00a0 the end of days. His gags and applause lines brought responses like refrains in church, obscure to non-members.

They ask questions in search of answers.The first question: Senator, please address charges that you stole the vote in Iowa, by lying about Ben Carson quitting the race.Mr. Cruz said it was an honest mistake by aides who circulated a news article that said Mr. Carson was going home.Another: Explain your loan from the big bankers at Goldman Sachs.He said he and his wife had borrowed against their life savings for a longshot political race in Texas, framing his campaign financing difficulties as an example of selflessness and courage.A young boy asked: How are you going to defeat ISIS?Mr. Cruz, in pullover and dad jeans, suddenly was grave and deadly: the commander-in-chief as war criminal. By utterly and completely destroying them with overwhelming air power, he said. Carpet bomb them into oblivion. Do what we did in the first Gulf War, with 1,100 air attacks in 37 days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after an assault like that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Arm the Kurds, and then send in American troops.

He is a demagogue.An elderly man asked about the deficit. He was worried about his grandchildren living in a third-world country.Mr. Cruz spun a happy tale of growth, amazing growth, 7 percent growth. And cutting spending, eliminating entire federal departments: education, energy, commerce, housing, the IRS, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. How this was going to spur growth while Mr. Cruz was also ejecting millions of immigrants from the American economy, building a 2,000-mile Great Wall of Mexico and starting a third full-blown Middle Eastern war, he did not explain.Another question: Please talk about the changing climate, and the water crisis forcing Syrians into ISIS-controlled territory.Here Mr. Cruz exposed his most fraudulent self. He spun a long answer about a decades-long conspiracy by liberal elites and scientists to frighten the world with false theories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first global cooling, then global warming, and now \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a unassailable lie. He said the only thing the lies had in common was the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire to control our lives.He was riffing on that idea of victimhood \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you are all being bamboozled \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when a small cluster of protesters suddenly stood up and started yelling about climate-change \u00e2\u0080\u009clies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA man behind me jumped up and yelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cU.S.A., U.S.A.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with that war-drum cadence that to me always sounds like \u00e2\u0080\u009cIN YOUR FACE, IN YOUR FACE,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the crowd did not join in. A man on the stage who had been holding an American flag on a pole with one hand rushed at the protesters, holding the pole in front of him like a spear. I thought he might stab somebody with Old Glory, like that man in the famous photo from the Boston busing riots of the 1970s, but he settled for merely shoving the protesters as others gave them the bum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rush.Mr. Cruz made some jokes about children in the room, Donald Trump and political correctness in college. His ad-libbing had that distinctly Cruz flavor of freeform hate; he views the world through a lens of anger, thuggishness and self-satisfaction. I found myself remembering people I knew in high school, who knew they were right and would not yield to shame or facts.The people thrilled to it, even when Mr. Cruz went deep on methanol subsidies and Medicaid expansion. When it was time to go, a host urged the crowd to tidy up the room because the middle school would be back tomorrow. Mr. Cruz said: We will, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re conservatives, not Occupy Wall Street protesters who defecate in public.\u00c2\u00a0 Mr. Cruz started to work the edge of the stage, and many in the audience went up and surrounded him, moths to a flame, while others streamed slowly out the doors and into the darkness.Advertisement"}

He was electrocuted and died when he touched a live cable.Since then, his death has inspired a new round of protests by Tunisia\u2019s youth, nearly a third of whom are unemployed and increasingly embittered that many of the promises of Tunisia\u2019s revolution five years ago remain unfulfilled. Demonstrations and violent clashes with the police have broken out in dozens of towns and have shaken Tunisia\u2019s government into ordering a nightly curfew across the country for three weeks.Most of the demonstrations petered out. But in Kasserine, an impoverished provincial capital of about 400,000, the protesters have refused to let up.Several hundred jobless youths have now occupied part of the governor\u2019s office for more than three weeks under the eyes of soldiers and black-clad police officers. For more than a week, some of the protesters have declared a hunger strike.\u201cWe have one demand: employment,\u201d said Shamseddine Tlilli, 30, who has a master\u2019s degree in computer science and was one of the organizers of the sit-in at the governor\u2019s office. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have money. We are sick with worry about food and electricity.\u201dIf the protests in Kasserine seem like an isolated dispute in a dun and dusty provincial capital, smaller things have led to bigger conflagrations here.Today, young people in Kasserine find themselves squeezed between the wilting promises of that revolt and a budding Islamist insurgency that has set up camps in the mountains just outside town.Military operations and sporadic clashes have since helped scare off investors and further depressed the local economy.Most of the protesters, like Mr. Tlilli, are well educated but have found that even advanced degrees, do not help them.They complain that the government has done little to address the problem of unemployment in Tunisia\u2019s underdeveloped regions, like this one in the west. They cannot find jobs here, they say, and they cannot afford the rent in larger cities.What they want is for the government to hire at least one member from disadvantaged families, in effect introducing a hiring quota from underdeveloped regions.They also want the government to relax conditions for young entrepreneurs seeking loans and start-up financing. Corruption has become so pervasive, they say, that the few programs designed to generate jobs have been hijacked.\u201cPeople are sick of the government\u2019s words,\u201d said Ahmed Rahali, 25, who has a master\u2019s degree in business management but remains jobless. \u201cThey are just promises.\u201dHe stood with a cluster of young men shifting their feet in the cold outside the governor\u2019s office here on a recent morning.Some of them had taken government training courses for entrepreneurs, but they complained that the banks refused to lend them start-up money and insisted on down payments that they cannot afford.\u201cThey ask you for 30 percent, but I don\u2019t have that,\u201d said Ashraf Aloui, an agriculture graduate.A textile engineer, Ibrahim Omri, said he had been turned down three times for business loans. \u201cThe government asks us to submit projects, but then there are a whole lot of obstacles,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to know someone or have money to bribe. If I had money, I would not be here.\u201dHe and the others insisted that they are not troublemakers. \u201cWe protested peacefully,\u201d Mr. Omri said. \u201cWe asked the government to negotiate with us because we have ideas and solutions.\u201dThe government, however, has expressed little sympathy. Instead, President B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi has warned that the far left, with which the students\u2019 demands are associated, is as dangerous as Islamist extremists who have committed terrorist attacks.Prime Minister Habib Essid promised in an address to Parliament that the government would provide more jobs, relax conditions for bank loans to entrepreneurs and push private-sector development toward the regions.But more promises have so far done little to calm the situation. The mayor of Kasserine, Ridha Abbassi, an academic who supported the 2011 revolution, described his job now as constant crisis management.\u201cI feel all the time I am walking on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe town is boiling and bubbling.\u201dMr. Yahyaoui was a well-known protester here who often climbed buildings to attract attention. Mr. Abbassi said he had often talked Mr. Yahyaoui down from his stunts, once from the roof of the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cThis time, I was not there,\u201d he said.Since the protests, Mr. Abbassi said, the local government has been issuing 4,000 birth certificates a day as people rush to prepare their documents in anticipation of a round of hiring for government jobs. They ignore official assurances that they do not need the certificates, he added.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem of trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to be near to the people and be clear with them, but it does not work.\u201d He blames the legacy of dictatorship and decades of injustice.The protesters accuse officials, including Mr. Abbassi, of making money on government contracts and caring only about that. He denies any involvement in corruption.\u201cThe fault is that of the government,\u201d Mr. Abbassi said, referring to that in Tunis, the capital.\u201cIn five years, there has been no clear vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe manner of requesting is no different. We go to the capital and say we want a hospital or an airport. No one comes here to trace a vision for the region.\u201dFarah Samti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

With each new delivery to his doorstep \u2014 sometimes several in a day \u2014 he faces the source of his guilt and frustration: another cardboard box.A handful of scientists and policy makers are circling the same question, grappling with the long-term environmental effect of an economy that runs increasingly on gotta-have-it-now gratification. This cycle leads consumers to expect that even their modest wants can be satisfied like urgent needs, and not always feel so great about it.The environmental cost can include the additional cardboard \u2014 35.4 million tons of containerboard were produced in 2014 in the United States, with e-commerce companies among the fastest-growing users \u2014 and the emissions from increasingly personalized freight services.Dr. Sperling said that consumers shared as much responsibility for the environmental cost of the deliveries as the companies that provided the speedy services.\u201cFrom a sustainability perspective, we\u2019re heading in the wrong direction,\u201d he said.But measuring the effect of the cardboard economy is more difficult.There are possible trade-offs, for example. As people shop more online, they might use their cars less. And delivery services have immense incentive to find the most efficient routes, keeping their fuel costs and emissions down. For its part, Amazon said that delivering to consumers straight from huge warehouses cuts down the need to distribute to thousands of stores.Ardeshi Faghri, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Delaware, said the increase of various emissions \u2014 which he estimated at 20 percent from 2001 to 2011 \u2014 \u201ccould be due to a multitude of reasons, but we think that online shopping and more delivery trucks are really one of the primary reasons.\u201d\u201cOnline shopping has not helped the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made it worse.\u201dOther scholars say that, at least for now, online shopping appears to be complementing brick-and-mortar shopping, not replacing it.Dr. Wang and other researchers say the demand for instant delivery, in particular, creates challenges for trucking companies trying to be efficient. Instead of taking big truckloads to single retailers they now make more scattershot deliveries.Many drivers deliver just one item. This is often the case for Postmates, which has a fleet of 15,000 freelance drivers signed up to make deliveries of whatever the customer orders \u2014 an Uber-like service, but for deliveries. The cost typically starts at $5, and a 9 percent service fee applied to the cost of the item. (The company says it also has about 5,000 deliverers who go on bike or foot in dense urban areas).And the push for speed from marketers gives shoppers little incentive to wait.Such is the case for Monica Rohleder, who admits to using Amazon Prime so much that \u201cmy husband jokes we keep Amazon in business.\u201dMs. Rohleder, who lives in Los Angeles and works at a public relations firm, said she liked overnight delivery, but \u201cwithin a couple of hours is best\u201d because she is busy with work and her two young children. So she often does not order something until it\u2019s urgent. \u201cThere\u2019s the immediate gratification of getting something and checking it off your list,\u201d she said.One afternoon she received six boxes, from Amazon and Nordstrom, for a Hawaii trip, including bathing suits, workout clothes and coloring books. Some of the clothes did not fit, so she returned them.She thinks more about the cardboard that comes into her house than the truck emissions, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d she added of her mass of weekly recycling.Amazon is aware of the cardboard issue. Since 2009, it has received 33 million comments, ratings and photographs about its packaging as part of its \u201cpackaging feedback program.\u201d Amazon said it used that feedback to make sure that cardboard box size was consistent with the size of the product. It also works with manufacturers to send some products without additional cardboard packaging, said Craig Berman, a company spokesman.\u201cAnd maybe not put a box inside a box inside a box,\u201d he saidAdvertisement"}

The report portrays the December release as a cynical attempt to garner good press, and says that listings of multiple homes by hosts on the site have already begun to proliferate again, just months after the purge.In an email, Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said that those kinds of abusers were not representative of most of its hosts, and said that as of Feb. 8, 94 percent of hosts in the city had only one active listing on the site.In response to the Inside Airbnb report, Nick Papas, a spokesman for the company, emphasized that picture of users in the city.\u201cThe vast majority of our hosts are everyday people who have just one listing and share their space a few nights a month to help make ends meet,\u201d he wrote in an email Wednesday.He continued, \u201cAirbnb is an open people-to-people platform where listings come on and go off throughout the year.\u201dMatt Mittenthal, a spokesman for New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said, \u201cIf this analysis is accurate, it appears that Airbnb is again trying to downplay the number of illegal apartment listings on the site.\u201d\u201cAirbnb continues to show a blatant disregard for New York laws designed to protect the rights of tenants and prevent the proliferation of illegal hotels,\u201d he added.State law bans apartment rentals of fewer than 30 days unless a permanent occupant is present, meaning that short-term, full apartment rentals are illegal. A host with multiple listings cannot be present in multiple locations at once.Airbnb has a history of removing listings in bulk in New York. In 2014, it got rid of more than 2,000 listings in response to an affidavit filed by Mr. Schneiderman that said two-thirds of all apartments listed in the city were illegal.In an email on Thursday, the same spokesman, Wiley Norvell, said that the city had put \u201csignificant new resources into enforcement.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned by reports the data shared with the public by Airbnb excluded many questionable listings,\u201d he said. \u201cAccurate sharing of information is nonnegotiable in our work to protect the public.\u201dDavid Ordal, the chief executive of Everbooked, a firm that helps users of sites like Airbnb optimize their pricing schemes, said that the site frequently removes listings in batches, citing similar instances in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore.\u201cAirbnb is walking a fine line \u2014 they\u2019re trying to be in compliance with local laws, but they\u2019re also trying to spread their \u2018sharing economy\u2019 platform,\u201d Mr. Ordal said. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy thing to do in principle, but there are a lot of gray areas, and this is one of them.\u201dMr. Slee, the technology writer, said that the removal of so many listings right before the release of the data damaged the trust that the company hoped to build in New York and elsewhere.\u201cAirbnb is making its business model depend on regulations changing in cities around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cCities need to be able to trust Airbnb if they\u2019re going to do that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And here in New Hampshire, some of the most heated rhetoric yet over who is best suited to step in on day one, who has the experience, who has the temperament to be commander-in-chief.Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz has said about you right here in New Hampshire this week, quote, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who would be comfortable with someone who behaves this way, having his finger on the button. We\u2019re liable to wake up one morning, and if he were president, he would nuke Denmark.\u201d Saying, quote, \u201cThat\u2019s temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.\u201dI wanted to give you the opportunity to respond to this and to tell the American people tonight why you do have the temperament to be commander-in-chief.TRUMP: I actually think I have the best temperament. I built a massive corporation. I employ thousands and thousands of people. I\u2019ve gotten along with people for years and years, have tremendous relationships with many people, including politicians on both sides. And no matter how you cut it, when I \u2014 when I came out, I hit immigration, I hit it very hard. Everybody said, \u201cOh, the temperament,\u201d because I talked about illegal immigration.TRUMP: Now, everybody\u2019s coming to me, they\u2019re all trying to say, well, he\u2019s right, we have to come to him. I hit other things. I talked about Muslims. We have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up. I took a lot of heat. We have to have a temporary something, because there\u2019s something going on that\u2019s not good. And remember this, I\u2019m the only one up here, when the war of Iraq \u2014 in Iraq, I was the one that said, \u201cDon\u2019t go, don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East.\u201d So, I\u2019m not one with a trigger.

I want to bring this to Senator Cruz, then.Because Senator, you did said of Trump\u2019s behavior this week, that\u2019s not the temperament of a leader to keep this country safe.Why not?CRUZ: Well, you know, David, the assessment the voters are making here in New Hampshire and across the country is they are evaluating each and every one of us. They are looking to our experience. They are looking to our knowledge. They are looking to our temperament and judgment. They are looking to our clarity of vision and our strength of resolve.The world is getting much more dangerous. We\u2019ve had seven years with Barack Obama in the oval office, a commander-in-chief that is unwilling even to acknowledge the enemy we\u2019re facing. This is a president who, in the wake of Paris, in the wake of San Bernardino, will not even use the words radical Islamic terrorism, much less focus on defeating the enemy.I am convinced every individual standing on this stage, would make a much better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)And the primary voters are making the assessment for each of us, who is best prepared to keep this country safe, to rebuild the military, to rebuild our Navy, our Air Force, our Army, our Marines, and to ensure that we keep America safe.MUIR: Senator Cruz, I did ask about Mr. Trump. You said he doesn\u2019t have the temperament to be commander-in-chief. Do you stand by those words?CRUZ: I think that is an assessment the voters are going to make. And they are going to make it of each and everyone of us. They are going to assess who is level-headed, who has clear vision, who has judgment, who can confront our enemies, who can confront the threats we face in this country, and who can have the judgment when to engage and when not to engage \u2014 both are incredibly important for a commander-in-chief, knowing how to go after our enemies.In the case of Iran, for example, who has the clarity of vision to understand that the Ayatollah Khamenei, when he chants, \u201cDeath to America,\u201d he means it. We need a president with the judgment and resolve to keep this country safe from radical Islamic terrorists.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. We\u2019re going to continue on this notion of readiness and experience. I\u2019m going to come back.TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond? I have to respond.MUIR: If you would like to respond, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: First of all, I respect what Ted just said, but if you noticed, he didn\u2019t answer your question. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 OK.(APPLAUSE)That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen with our enemies and the people we compete against. We\u2019re going to win with Trump. We\u2019re going to win. We don\u2019t win anymore. Our country doesn\u2019t win anymore. We\u2019re going to win with Trump. And people back down with Trump. And that\u2019s what I like and that\u2019s what the country is going to like.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. And we\u2019re going to continue on this notion of readiness and on experience, but I want to ask about a headline that was back in the papers again this morning.Dr. Carson, on the day of the Iowa caucuses, the Cruz campaign sent out messages and voicemails saying, quote, \u201cBreaking news. Dr. Ben Carson will be planning to suspend his campaign following tonight\u2019s caucuses. Please inform any Carson caucus-goers of this news.\u201dBut as we can all see, you are still standing here tonight. Late this week, your campaign sent this e-mail, quote, \u201cThis kind of deceitful behavior is why the American people don\u2019t trust politicians. If Senator Cruz does not act, then he clearly represents D.C. values.\u201dWhat kind of action do you think Senator Cruz should take?CARSON: Well, you know, when I wasn\u2019t introduced No. 2, as was the plan, I thought maybe he thought I already had dropped out. But...(APPLAUSE)But you know, today is the 105th anniversary, or \u2014 105th birthday of Ronald Reagan. His 11 Commandment was not to speak ill of another Republican. So, I\u2019m not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)But I will say \u2014 I will say \u2014 I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause \u2014 one even died \u2014 to think that I would just walk away ten minutes before the caucus and say, \u201cForget about you guys.\u201dCARSON: I mean, who would do something like that? Now, I don\u2019t think anyone on this stage would do something like that. And to assume that someone would, what does that tell you? So, unfortunately, it did happen.It gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics. Washington ethics. Washington ethics basically says, if it\u2019s legal, you do what you need to do in order to win. That\u2019s not my ethics. My ethics is, you do what\u2019s right.MUIR: Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Dr. Carson, thank you.Senator Cruz, you have said that Dr. Carson and his wife have become friends of yours. I\u2019m curious as why you didn\u2019t call ahead of time to either the doctor or his wife or have your campaign check in with the other campaign before sending out those messages.CRUZ: Ben is a good and honorable man and Ben and Candy have become friends. He has an amazing life story that has inspired millions, including me. When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now. Ben, I\u2019m sorry.Let me tell you the facts of what occurred for those who are interested in knowing. On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m., CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather, he was, quote, \u201cTaking a break from campaigning.\u201dThey reported that on television, CNN\u2019s political anchors, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer, said it was highly unusual and highly significant. My political team saw CNN\u2019s report breaking news and they forwarded that news to our volunteers, it was being covered on live television.Now, at the time, I was at the caucuses, I was getting ready to speak at the caucuses just like Ben was, just like everyone else was. I knew nothing about this. A couple hours later, I found out about it. I was told that Ben was unhappy. I called him that evening because I respect him very, very highly. I didn\u2019t reach him that evening.(BELL RINGS)I reached him the next day and apologized. He asked me then, he said, Ted, would you make this apologize in public? I said, yes, I will. And I did so. I regret that subsequently, CNN reported on that \u2014 they didn\u2019t correct that story until 9:15 that night. So from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15, that\u2019s what CNN was reporting.Subsequent to that initial report, Ben\u2019s campaign put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign. I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had, that\u2019s why I apologized.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you.We\u2019re going to move on here. Back to the issues...CARSON: Since I was mentioned...MUIR: Dr. Carson, please.CARSON: This is great you guys. I want you all to mention me when you say something.(LAUGHTER)In fact, the time line indicates that initial tweet from CNN was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that I was not dropping out. So, what happened to that one, it is unclear. But the bottom line is, we can see what happened, everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment.MUIR: Dr. Carson, thank you. Thank you, doctor.Senator Rubio. I want to stay on the issue of readiness to be president and experience and questions about you being a first-term senator.Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first-term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you are, quote, \u201c not ready to be president of the United States.\u201dAnd Senator Santorum, who we all know, dropped out of the race and endorsed you, had a hard time when asked on national television, listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight, what are your accomplishments in the Senate that demonstrate you are ready to be president of the United States?RUBIO: Well, let me say, from protecting the people of Florida from imminent domain abuse, to bringing accountability to the V.A., to the Girls Count Act, to sanctioning groups, I\u2019m proud of my service in the United States Senate and before that, in the Florida legislature.I will say, if politics becomes and the presidency becomes about electing people who have been Congress or in the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden. He\u2019s been around 1,000 years. He\u2019s passed hundreds of bills and I don\u2019t think any of us believe Joe Biden should be president of the United States.And let\u2019s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.That\u2019s why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world and we are going to leave our children with what they deserve: the single greatest nation in the history of the world.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: I do want to ask Governor Christie, Governor Christie, you said fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me when it comes to electing a first-term senator. You heard Senator Rubio make the case that he does have the experience. Your response?CHRISTIE: Sure. First, let\u2019s remember something. Every morning when a United States senator wakes up, they think about what kind of speech can I give or what kind of bill can I drop? Every morning, when I wake up, I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me?It\u2019s a different experience, it\u2019s a much different experience. And the fact is, Marco, you shouldn\u2019t compare yourself to Joe Biden and you shouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Here is exactly what we\u2019re doing.You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven\u2019t.(APPLAUSE)And the fact is \u2014 the fact when you talk about the Hezbollah Sanctions Act that you list as one of your accomplishments you just did, you weren\u2019t even there to vote for it. That\u2019s not leadership, that\u2019s truancy.(APPLAUSE)And the fact is that what we need to do \u2014 what we need to have in this country is not to make the same mistake we made eight years ago. The fact is it does matter when you have to make decisions and be held accountable for them. It does matter when the challenges don\u2019t come on a list of a piece of paper of what to vote yes or no every day, but when the problems come in from the people that you serve.I like Marco Rubio, and he\u2019s a smart person and a good guy, but he simply does not have the experience to be president of the United States and make these decisions. We\u2019ve watched it happen, everybody. For the last seven years, the people of New Hampshire are smart. Do not make the same mistake again.RUBIO: If I may respond to that.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, I think the experience is not just what you did, but how it worked out. Under Chris Christie\u2019s governorship of New Jersey, they\u2019ve been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This country already has a debt problem, we don\u2019t need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and destroying the credit rating of his state.But I would add this. Let\u2019s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don\u2019t want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America. And when I\u2019m elected president, this will become once again, the single greatest nation in the history of the world, not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon us.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to bring in governor bush on this, because you...CHRISTIE: Hold on one second.MUIR: ... have made this...CHRISTIE: Excuse me...MUIR: If you\u2019d like to respond to economic...CHRISTIE: I think he mentioned me and my record in there, so I think I get a chance to respond. You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this. That\u2019s what Washington, D.C. Does. The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him.(APPLAUSE)See Marco \u2014 Marco, the thing is this. When you\u2019re president of the United States, when you\u2019re a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn\u2019t solve one problem for one person. They expect you to plow the snow. They expect you to get the schools open. And when the worst natural disaster in your state\u2019s history hits you, they expect you to rebuild their state, which is what I\u2019ve done.None of that stuff happens on the floor of the United States Senate. It\u2019s a fine job, I\u2019m glad you ran for it, but it does not prepare you for president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Chris \u2014 Chris, your state got hit by a massive snowstorm two weeks ago. You didn\u2019t even want to go back. They had to shame you into going back. And then you stayed there for 36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign. Those are the facts.Here\u2019s the bottom line. This notion that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.CHRISTIE: There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody.RUBIO: Well, that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the reason why this campaign is so important. Because I think this notion \u2014 I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we\u2019re going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he is doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s done the things he\u2019s done.That\u2019s why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he\u2019s done to America is deliberate. This is a president that\u2019s trying to redefine this country. That\u2019s why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation, as a people. Our future is at stake.This election is not about the past. It is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century, and if we elect someone like Barack Obama, a Hillary Clinton, a Bernie Sanders or anyone like that, our children are going to be the first Americans to inherit a diminishes country. That will not happen if I\u2019m elected.MUIR: Governor Christie, we will \u2014 we will...BUSH: Chris, why don\u2019t you mention my name so I can get into this.CHRISTIE: You know what the shame is \u2014 you know what the shame is, Marco? The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work, plowing the streets, getting the trains running back on time when you\u2019ve never been responsible for that in your entire life.RUBIO: Chris, you didn\u2019t want to go back. You didn\u2019t want to go back.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: And the fact is, I went back, it got done and here\u2019s...RUBIO: You didn\u2019t want to go back, Chris.CHRISTIE: Oh, so \u2014 wait a second. Is that one of the skills you get as a United States senator ESP also? Because I don\u2019t think it is.RUBIO: Chris, everybody \u2014 you said you weren\u2019t going to go back. He told everyone he wasn\u2019t going to go back. They had to shame him into going back. And when he decided to go back, he criticized the young lady, saying, what am I supposed to do, go back with a mop and clean up the flooding?CHRISTIE: It gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points. MUIR: Governor Christie \u2014 thank you, Governor. I will mention \u2014 listen...RUBIO: ... It\u2019s your record, it\u2019s not a talking point...MUIR: ... Listen, people...(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Bush, I\u2019ll mention your name so that you can come in on this...BUSH: ... I appreciate that, I really do, thank you.MUIR: I want to bring you in on this because you\u2019ve made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days. Four Years ago you said of Senator Rubio, he was ready to be Vice President. You spoke of his experience as well. You said he has the fortitude to be a good President, but just this week you said Senator Rubio accomplished, quote, \u201cnothing\u201d in the Senate. How do you square the two?BUSH: Well, first of all he said the exact same thing about me, that I would make a great Vice Presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering. I said the same thing about Marco. I think we were both right at the time, and Mitt picked somebody else. So, let\u2019s move on to the 2016 race. Who has the leadership skills...(APPLAUSE)BUSH: ... Who has the leadership skills to lead? And, I\u2019m proud of the fact that I have 12 Medal of Honor recipients, over 30 admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as Commander in Chief. That I serve as Governor of the state of Florida where we cut taxes and reduced government. I took on very powerful interests, forged consensus, fought for my beliefs, implemented them and the state was better off.We had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. The whole state was turned upside down. It required a steady hand. Leadership. You learn this, you learn it by doing it. It\u2019s not something that you just go up, and on the job do it.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: It\u2019s not the same. Look, let\u2019s be clear. Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted politician, and he may have the skills to be a President of the United States, but we\u2019ve tried it the old way with Barack Obama, with soaring eloquence and we got \u2014 we didn\u2019t get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up. The next President...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... going to have to forge consensus to bring about a set of common purposes so that we can move forward again in this country...MUIR: ... We\u2019re going to continue with leadership now. Martha?RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you are a first term Senator as well. Your opponents say you, like Senator Rubio, are not prepared to be Commander in Chief. You have talked tough about threats we face in the Mid-East. It was reported just moments ago that the North Koreans test launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has nuclear weapons, and conducted another nuclear test just last month.The missile that was launched is the kind the North Koreans hope could someday carry a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States. How would you respond if Commander in Chief to that launch?CRUZ: Well, I would note, initially the fact that we\u2019re seeing the launch, and we\u2019re seeing the launch from a nuclear North Korea is the direct result of the failures of the first Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. Billions of dollars flowed into North Korea in exchange for promises not to build nuclear weapons. They took those billions and built nuclear weapons.And, I would note also the lead negotiator in that failed North Korea sanctions deal was a woman named Wendy Sherman who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton promptly recruited to come back to be the lead negotiator with Iran. So, what we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we will be with Iran.With respect to North Korea and what we should do now, one of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense capacity. We ought to put missile defense interceptors in South Korea. South Korea wants them. One of the real risks of this launch, North Korea wants to launch a satellite, and one of the greatest risks of the satellite is they would place a nuclear device in the satellite. As it would orbit around the Earth, and as it got over the United States they would detonate that nuclear weapon and set of what\u2019s called an EMP, and electromagnetic pulse which could take down the entire electrical grid on the Eastern seaboard, potentially killing millions.We need to harden the grid to defend ourselves, and we need missile defense to protect ourselves against North Korea.RADDATZ: Well, let me ask you this, if you were Commander in Chief tonight would you have order the U.S. military to destroy that missile preemptively on the launchpad to prevent North Korea from becoming an even graver threat?CRUZ: You know, at this point I\u2019m not going to speculate on that without the intelligence briefing that any Commander in Chief would have, knowing what exactly is there.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: One of the real problems...RADDATZ: ... Senator Cruz, let me tell you this, you have talked tough about the Mid-East, you haven\u2019t gotten those intelligence briefings about that. Why not tell us whether you would preemptively strike a missile on a launchpad that threatens the U.S...CRUZ: ... Actually, with respect, I have gotten the intelligence briefings on the Mid-East. Those have been going on for many years. I haven\u2019t gotten the intelligence briefing tonight on what North Korea\u2019s doing because I\u2019m here in new Hampshire. When you\u2019re responding to an immediate incident, you need to know the intelligence of what\u2019s occurring.CRUZ: But what I was saying \u2014 look, it is qualitatively different dealing with a country once they have nuclear weapons. It\u2019s why you prevent them from getting nuclear weapons in the first place \u2014 because your hands are somewhat tied once they have nukes.It\u2019s why this Iranian nuclear deal is so catastrophic, and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve pledged, on the very first day in office, to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal so we\u2019re not sitting here in five years, wondering what to do about an Iranian missile launch when they have nuclear weapons. The stakes are too high for that.RADDATZ: Okay. Senator Cruz, I will say that missile has been sitting there for quite some time, and they have had eyes on it.RUBIO: But Martha, just \u2014 Martha, just to clarify on that point, because he\u2019s right, and one more thing to point \u2014 it is standard procedure of the United States to shoot down those missiles once launched if they pose a threat to civilians, land and ships (ph).RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, I\u2019m talking about a preemptive strike on the launch pad.RUBIO: Well \u2014 no, I understand. And not \u2014 but \u2014 but I think it\u2019s important to note that it is \u2014 and Senator Cruz, I think, was alluding to this, as well \u2014 it is the standard procedure of the United States, if those missiles pose a threat to land, civilians, our allies or any of our assets, to shoot down that missile in mid-flight.I understand your question was about a preemptive strike, but my point is that there is in place now contingencies to avoid any sort of that strike (ph) from going errant and destroying any \u2014 any assets of the United States, or implicating or hurting any of our allies or any of our assets in the region.RADDATZ: OK. Thank you, Senator Rubio.Governor Kasich, how would you respond to tonight\u2019s launch?KASICH: Well, we\u2019ve got to to step up the pressure. And by the way, I\u2019ve gotta say, after being here, every one of my 100 town hall meetings in New Hampshire were a lot more fun than what I saw here today, were so much more positive.Look, in terms of North Korea, Martha, we have to make sure that we intercept both the ships and their aircraft, because what they\u2019re trying to do is to proliferate this very dangerous material, along with the \u2014 with the technology, the instruments that can be used for mass destruction.That\u2019s what I worry about the most, frankly, is non-state actors, people who don\u2019t have a uniform, people don\u2019t have a country, who can spread this, who are not subject to the \u2014 to the mutual assured defense. In other words, you strike us, we strike you.Some of these radicals, they don\u2019t care about that. That\u2019s what I worry about, for my children, and for their children, going forward. So, we have to be very tough.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.And we should tell the Chinese, look, if you\u2019re not going to do this ballistic missile defense to the Koreans, ballistic missile defense to Japan \u2014 and by the way, we should impose the same kind of sanctions on North Korea that we imposed on Iran, because they\u2019re able to shift money. They\u2019re able to send money and receive money.(BELL RINGS)KASICH: We\u2019ve gotta to be very tough on this. And frankly, I think we could have \u2014 I think we could have let the Japanese know that if you want to take action on that \u2014 on that missile that\u2019s rising, you want to take action \u2014 you will have our support, if that\u2019s what you think is the best thing to do. We cannot continue to be weak in the face of the North Koreans, or, frankly, in the entire rest of the world.Martha, this is \u2014 this is the \u2014 relates...RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Kasich. Thank you \u2014 thank you...BUSH: ... this relates to strategic patience.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: ... Governor Bush, I\u2019ll get to you in a moment.BUSH: This relates to the strategic patience of the Obama administration. They come up with these great marketing terms, and what they do is they pull back, and voids are filled, and they\u2019re now filled by asymmetric threats of terror, as well as nation-states on the run.The next president of the United States is gonna have to get the United States back in the game, and if a preemptive strike is necessary to keep us safe, then we should do it.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Bush.Mr. Trump, do you have a red line with North Korea? Would you consider military action? And how far would you let them go?TRUMP: Well, let me say a couple of things. First of all, Marco said earlier on that President Obama knows exactly what he\u2019s doing, like we have this president that really knows. I disagree, respectfully, with Marco.I think we have a president who, as a president, is totally incompetent, and he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.(APPLAUSE)I think he has no idea what he\u2019s doing. And our country is going to hell. So, I just want to say, we disagree on that. Is that okay?RUBIO: Yeah. I have a \u2014 I got mentioned, can I respond?TRUMP: Good.RADDATZ: And I\u2019d like him to finish the question, please.TRUMP: As to North Korea?RADDATZ: Specific \u2014 as to North Korea.TRUMP: We have \u2014 tremendous \u2014 has been just sucked out of our country by China. China says they don\u2019t have that good of control over North Korea. They have tremendous control. I deal with the Chinese all of the time. I do tremendous \u2014 the largest bank in the world is in one of my buildings in Manhattan.I deal with them. They tell me. They have total, absolute control, practically, of North Korea. They are sucking trillions of dollars out of our country \u2014 they\u2019re rebuilding China with the money they take out of our country. I would get on with China, let China solve that problem.(BELL RINGS)They can do it quickly and surgically. That\u2019s what we should do with North Korea.RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, you were mentioned.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Here\u2019s the broader point, as well, and then I think it touches on what Donald just mentioned. Barack Obama views America as this arrogant global power that needed to be cut down to size. OK? RUBIO: This is a president that views this country as a country that\u2019s been too powerful in the world and we create problems around the world.For example, it\u2019s one of the reasons why he had betrayed Israel, because he believes that if we create separation from Israel, it will help our relations in the Islamic world. The same is happening in the Asia-Pacific region with accommodations to North Korea. North Korean should be back on that list of terrorist nations, as an example.And Donald\u2019s absolutely right. China does have a lot of influence over North Korea and he should be leveraging our relationship with the Chinese to ensure that North Korea no longer has access to the resources that have allowed them \u2014 a country that has no economy to develop long range missiles already capable of reaching the west coast of the United States potentially.RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Senator Rubio.Governor Bush, another problem facing the commander-in-chief right now is that North Korea is currently detaining an American college student. What would you do to get that college student back home?BUSH: Well, first of all, it\u2019s interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in Iran. A day or two days afterwards, North Korea took a \u2014 held an American student hostage. I think it\u2019s when we send a signal of weakness, when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that didn\u2019t commit crimes that are held hostage in Iran.We saw the shameful treatment of our sailors, that this creates weakness \u2014 sends a signal of weakness around the world. The next president of the United States is going to have to get back in the game. Where the United States\u2019 word matters. Where we back up our allies, where we don\u2019t send signals of weakness. We need to use every \u2014 every influence possible to get this student back.And I think John is right about this, there are crippling sanctions that are available, as it relates to the two or three banks that North Korea uses to \u2014 to \u2014 use it \u2014 illicit trade. We ought to re-establish sanctions, not just because of the student, but because of their actions that they\u2019re taking right now, as it relates to building this missile capability.RADDATZ: Governor Christie, I want to go to you on the same question.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: Let\u2019s get something...RADDATZ: Would you negotiate with North Korea to...CHRISTIE: No. Let\u2019s make something very clear. I learned seven years as a federal prosecutor in dealing with types of situations like we\u2019re talking about in North Korea, where criminals take people hostage. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Ever. You never pay ransom to the criminals. Everyone out at home watching tonight understands that principle.And so, what you need to do is to engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand anything but toughness and strength, and we need to engage the Chinese to deal with the North Koreans, but we also need to make sure that they understand there\u2019s a commander-in-chief who will not pay ransom for any hostage.This president and his former secretary of State are for paying ransom for hostages. When do that, you endanger even more Americans around the world to be the subject of this type of hostage taking and illegal detention. You need a strong commander-in-chief who will look these folks in the eye and say, we will not put up with this and we will take whatever actions we need to take, not only to get our people home safely, but to swiftly and surely punish those who believe they can violate the law and violate American\u2019s sovereign rights to travel the world freely and safely.This is unacceptable. And this is why this president is so weak and why the secretary of State, who is embracing a third Barack Obama term, would be even weaker.RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Christie.(APPLAUSE)David?MUIR: Martha, we\u2019re going to turn to immigration now. And I want to bring in Governor Kasich because you told us in an ABC interview, Governor, quote, \u201cIt is completely ridiculous to think we are going to go into neighborhoods, grab people out of their homes and ship people back to Mexico.\u201d Adding, quote, \u201cThat\u2019s not where the party is. The party is not for departing 11.5 million people.\u201dBut Mr. Trump and Senator Cruz, who have made deportation central to their campaigns, top the national polls. So, my question for you, are you not where the voters are?KASICH: Well, you know, David, I \u2014 I\u2019ve just spent a lot of time here in this state, as I mentioned earlier, and we have to have practical solutions, just like we were just talking about a few minutes ago on North Korea. Look, the situation is, we need to finish the border. It has to be completed. Just like we lock our doors at night, the country has to be able to lock its doors. And we can have a guest worker program, where people can come in and out in an orderly way.And then for the 11.5 million that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, I believe they ought to pay some back taxes, pay a fine, never get on the path to citizenship, but get legalization. It is not \u2014 I couldn\u2019t even imagine how we would even begin to think about taking a mom or a dad out of a house when they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, leaving their children in the house. I mean, that is not, in my opinion, the kind of values that we believe in. KASICH: And secondly, I think at the end of the day, that Americans would support a plan like this. I think Congress would pass a plan to finish the border, guest worker, pay a fine, a path to legalization, and not citizenship. And we\u2019ve got to get this done. And I will tell you this, within the first 100 days that I am president, I will put that proposal to the Congress. And I will tell you, as a former Congressman, and an executive, in Ohio, I can promise you that I believe you\u2019ll get the votes to pass that, and we can move on with that issue and protect our border. That\u2019s what I think.MUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.(APPLAUSE)I want to bring this next to Senator Cruz. You heard what the governor said. He said, \u201cWe need practical solutions.\u201d And you\u2019ve said, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to send jack boots to knock on doors. That\u2019s not how we enforce the law for any crime.\u201dSo, what is your plan? How will you deport 11.5 million undocumented people? And be specific. How would you do it?In short, we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to build a wall. We\u2019re going to triple the border patrol. We\u2019re going to increase \u2014 and actually, since Donald enjoyed that, I will simply say, I\u2019ve got somebody in mind to build it.We\u2019re going to increase four-fold, the fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, so that you have technology monitoring an attempted incursion to direct the boots on the ground where they\u2019re occurring. We\u2019re going to put in place a strong e-verify system in the workplace, so you can\u2019t get a job without proving you are here legally.We\u2019ll put in place a biometric exit-entry system on visas, because 40 percent of illegal immigration comes not over the border illegally, but people coming on visas and overstaying.We will end sanctuary cities by cutting off taxpayer dollars to any jurisdiction that defies federal immigration law.(APPLAUSE)And we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Let me just ask you this, though, because Governor Kasich was talking about the families and what you do with the families that you would have to send home.Can you tell the American people tonight how you would do that?CRUZ: What you do is, you enforce the law. You know, under the Constitution, the president has an obligation to, quote, \u201cTake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Federal immigration law provides, if someone is here illegally and is apprehended, they are to be deported.We saw just this past week the head of the border patrol union testify before Congress that President Obama had given the order to the border patrol to stand down, not to enforce the law. That is wrong. I will enforce the law, and for everyone who says, you can\u2019t possibly do that, I would note that in eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people.In eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people. Enforcing the law \u2014 we can do it. What is missing is the political will. And when they were deporting the people, the border wasn\u2019t secure, so they\u2019d come right back. Once you secure the border, enforcing the law will solve this problem and that will benefit American workers.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. I want to bring in Senator Rubio.This question is about immigration, it is also about leadership. You\u2019re aware of the criticism from many candidates on this stage tonight that you co-authored the so-called Gang of Eight bill that would have created a path to citizenship for people here illegally.Governor Christie has said of you, as soon as you felt the heat, you turned tail and run. Governor Bush has said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we need people cutting and running anymore.\u201dDid you fight for your own legislation, Senator, or did you run from it?RUBIO: Here\u2019s the bottom line. We can\u2019t get that legislation passed. The American people will not support doing anything about people that are in this country illegally until the law is enforced first, and you prove it to them.This has been abundantly clear. Every effort over the last ten years to do those comprehensively has failed. And it has failed because the American people have zero trust that the federal government will enforce our laws.And that\u2019s why since then, I have said repeatedly, if you are serious about immigration reform, then the key that unlocks the door to being able to do that is not just to pass a law that says it is going to enforce the law, but to actually do it. To hire the 20,000 new border agents, to finish the fencing and walls, to put in place mandatory e-verify, to put in place an entry-exit tracking system to prevent visa overstays.And once that is in place and that\u2019s working, I believe the American people will support a very reasonable, but responsible approach to people that have been here a long time, who are not dangerous criminals, who pay taxes and pay fines for what they did.But until then, none of that is going to be possible.MUIR: But I\u2019m asking, did you fight for the legislation at the time or did you run from it as you\u2019re...RUBIO: Well, the legislation passed, but it has no support. In essence, it couldn\u2019t pass in the House, it will never pass in the United States until we secure the border, and it is not the way we\u2019re going to do when I\u2019m president.When I\u2019m president, we are going to enforce the law first, prove to people that illegal immigration is under control. And then we\u2019ll see what the American people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals, who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay.MUIR: Governor Christie?CHRISTIE: Yeah, David, I would just like you to listen, again, everybody.This is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question. The question was, \u201cDid he fight for his legislation?\u201d(APPLAUSE)It\u2019s abundantly clear that he didn\u2019t. It\u2019s abundantly clear that he didn\u2019t fight for the legislation.CHRISTIE: When the teachers unions attacked me with $20 million of ads because I wanted to reform teacher tenure, I fought them and fought them and fought them and I won.When they didn\u2019t want \u2014 when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at Democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government, I told them, fine. Close down the government. I\u2019ll get in my cars, head to the governor\u2019s mansion, order a pizza, open a beer and watch the Mets. You can call me when the government reopens.And guess what they didn\u2019t do? They didn\u2019t pass a tax increase, because I vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew I would fight for what I believed in. The fact of the matter is, a leader must fight for what they believe in. Not handicap it and say, well maybe since I can\u2019t win this one, I\u2019ll run. That\u2019s not what leadership is.(BELL RINGS)That\u2019s what Congress is.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor thank you.Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Leadership is ultimately about solving the problem. And the approach that was tried and has been tried now repeatedly over ten years to do this comprehensively, all at once in a massive piece of legislation has no chance of passage.It is not leadership to continue to try something that has no chance of happening. I want to make progress on this issue. It has been discussed now for 30 years and nothing ever happens.And I am telling you that the only way forward on this issue that has any chance of happening, meaning gaining the support of the American people, you cannot do this without the support of the American people, is an approach that begins by proving that once and for all, illegal immigration is under control.MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. We want to turn to health care in this country, and for that, author and commentator, Mary Katherine Ham tonight.HAM: Thanks, David.Good evening, guys.TRUMP: Good evening.RUBIO: Good evening.CHRISTIE: Good evening.KASICH: Good evening.CARSON: Good evening.CRUZ: Good evening.BUSH: Good evening.HAM: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Yes.HAM: In the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton has criticized Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan for single payer government health care, noting it would require big, across the board tax increases for Americans. In doing so, she\u2019s doubling down on Obamacare, despite its persistent unpopularity.Mr. Trump, you have said you want to appeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be covered,\u201d adding, quote, \u201cThe government\u2019s going to pay for it.\u201d Are you closer to Bernie Sanders\u2019 vision for health care than Hillary Clinton\u2019s?TRUMP: I don\u2019t think I am. I think I\u2019m closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better. And there are so many examples of it. And I will tell you, part of the reason we have some people laughing, because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here.I am self-funded. The only one they\u2019re not taking care of is me. We have our lines around each state. The insurance companies are getting rich on Obamacare. The insurance companies are getting rich on health care and health services and everything having to do with health. We are going to end that.We\u2019re going to take out the artificial boundaries, the artificial lines. We\u2019re going to get a plan where people compete, free enterprise. They compete. So much better.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: In addition to that, you have the health care savings plans, which are excellent. What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don\u2019t want that to happen. We\u2019re going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else and we\u2019re going to take care of those people.And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree...(BELL RINGS)... you\u2019re not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you\u2019ve got, quote, \u201cno heart\u201d. There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama\u2019s broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan \u2014 change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it.How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?CRUZ: Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing.You have a scarcity of doctors. You have rationing. And that means the elderly are told, we\u2019re going to ration a hip replacement, we\u2019re going to ration a knee replacement. We\u2019re going to ration end- of-life care.We\u2019re right now heading into a medical system with about a 90,000-doctor shortage in America and socialized medicine; whether proposed by the Democrats or proposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country.What should we do on health care? If I\u2019m elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And once we do that, we will adopt common sense reforms, number one, we\u2019ll allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines that will drive down prices and expand the availability of low cost catastrophic insurance.CRUZ: We\u2019ll expand health savings accounts; and we will de-link health insurance from employment so that you don\u2019t lose your health insurance when you lose your job, and that way health insurance can be personal, portable and affordable and we keep government from getting in between us and our doctors.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Dr. Carson, you have some experience with this matter. In the past, you have said that Obamacare should be replaced before it\u2019s repealed. How and why?CARSON: Well, thank you. You know, I was hoping to get a chance to talk about North Korea. I was the only one who didn\u2019t get to do that, and I\u2019ve got stuff to say about it, let me tell you.But at any rate, you have to replace it with something that makes sense. It doesn\u2019t make sense. And the reason that I dislike Obamacare is because the government comes in and tells the people \u2014 which the nation is supposed to be centered on \u2014 that we don\u2019t care what you think, this is what we\u2019re doing. And if you don\u2019t like it, too bad. That\u2019s a problem. And we can\u2019t afford to do that because that will fundamentally change America.I have proposed a health empowerment account system. Everybody gets a health empowerment account the day they are born, they keep it until they die. They can pass it on. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with, recognizing that we spend twice as much as many countries per capita and health care and don\u2019t have as such access.We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account so that each family basically becomes its own insurance company without a middleman; that saves you a awful lot of money. And that will lower the cost of your catastrophic insurance tremendously, because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic health care.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Thank you, Dr. Carson. David, Martha, back to you.MUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you. We want to turn now to the issue of eminent domain, which is being debated right here in New Hampshire. And Josh McElveen is the political director and the anchor of WMUR TV. Josh?MCELVEEN: Thank you, David. And good evening, candidates. Mr. Trump, you have said, quote, \u201cI love eminent domain\u201d which is the seizure of private property for the sake of the greater good theoretically. You tried to use the measure in business endeavors, you\u2019ve said you\u2019d support its use for the Keystone Pipeline project.Here in New Hampshire, a project, though, known as the Northern pass would bring hydro-electric power from Canada into the Northeastern grid. Do you see eminent domain as an appropriate tool to get that done?TRUMP: Well, let me just tell you about eminent domain because almost all of these people actually criticize it, but so many people have hit me with commercials and other things about eminent domain.Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a country, for our country. Without it, you wouldn\u2019t have roads, you wouldn\u2019t have hospitals, you wouldn\u2019t have anything. You wouldn\u2019t have schools, you wouldn\u2019t have bridges. You need eminent domain. And a lot of the big conservatives that tell me how conservative they are \u2014 I think I\u2019m more than they are \u2014 they tell me, oh \u2014 well, they all want the Keystone Pipeline. The Keystone Pipeline, without eminent domain, it wouldn\u2019t go 10 feet, OK? You need eminent domain. And eminent domain is a good thing, not a bad thing.And what a lot of people don\u2019t know because they were all saying, oh, you\u2019re going to take their property. When somebody \u2014 when eminent domain is used on somebody\u2019s property, that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair market value, and if they are smart, they\u2019ll get two or three times the value of their property. But without eminent domain, you don\u2019t have roads, highways, schools, bridges or anything.So eminent domain \u2014 it\u2019s not that I love it, but eminent domain is absolutely \u2014 it\u2019s a necessity for a country. And certainly it\u2019s a necessity for our country.MCELVEEN: So would that be yes on the Northern Pass project?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Yes.BUSH: The difference \u2014 the difference between eminent domain for public purpose \u2014 as Donald said, roads and infrastructure, pipelines and all that \u2014 that\u2019s for public purpose. But what Donald Trump did was use eminent domain to try to take the property of an elderly woman on the strip in Atlantic City. That is not public purpose, that is down right wrong.(APPLAUSE)And here\u2019s the problem with that. The problem was, it was to tear down \u2014 it was to tear down \u2014 it was to tear down the house...TRUMP: Jeb wants to be \u2014 he wants to be a tough guy tonight. I didn\u2019t take the property.BUSH: And the net result was \u2014 you tried.TRUMP: I didn\u2019t take the property.BUSH: And you lost in the court.TRUMP: The woman ultimately didn\u2019t want to do that. I walked away.BUSH: That is not true. And the simple fact is to turn this into a limousine parking lot for his casinos is a not public use.(APPLAUSE)And in Florida, based on what we did, we made that impossible. It is part of our Constitution. That\u2019s the better approach. That is the conservative approach.MCELVEEN: Mr. Trump, take 30 seconds.TRUMP: Well, let me just \u2014 you know, he wants to be a tough guy. A lot of times, you\u2019ll have \u2014 you\u2019ll have \u2014 and it didn\u2019t work very well.BUSH: How tough it is to take away property from an elderly woman?TRUMP: A lot of time \u2014 let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times \u2014 a lot of times...BUSH: How tough it is to take away a property from an elderly woman?TRUMP: ... you \u2014 let me talk. Let me talk. Quiet. A lot of times...(BOOING)... that\u2019s all of his donors and special interests out there.(BOOING)So \u2014 it\u2019s what it is. That\u2019s what \u2014 and by the way, let me just tell you, we needed tickets. You can\u2019t get them. You know who has the tickets for the \u2014 I\u2019m talking about, to the television audience? Donors, special interests, the people that are putting up the money.(BOOING)That\u2019s who it is. The RNC told us. We have all donors in the audience. And the reason they\u2019re not loving me...(BOOING)... the reason they\u2019re not \u2014 excuse me. The reason they\u2019re not loving me is, I don\u2019t want their money. I\u2019m going to do the right thing for the American public. I don\u2019t want their money. I don\u2019t need their money. And I\u2019m the only one up here that can say that.Eminent domain, the Keystone pipeline \u2014 do you consider that a private job? Do you \u2014 do you consider that...BUSH: I consider it a public use.TRUMP: No \u2014 no, let me ask you, Jeb.(BELL RINGS)Do you consider the Keystone pipeline private?BUSH: It\u2019s a public use. It\u2019s a public use.TRUMP: Is it public or private?BUSH: It\u2019s a public use. TRUMP: Real \u2014 a public use?BUSH: Yeah.TRUMP: No, it\u2019s a private job.BUSH: It\u2019s a public use.TRUMP: It\u2019s a private job.BUSH: Established by the courts \u2014 federal, state courts.TRUMP: You wouldn\u2019t have the Keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain.MCELVEEN: All right, gentlemen...TRUMP: You wouldn\u2019t have massive \u2014 excuse me, Josh \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t have massive factories without eminent domain.(BOOING)MCELVEEN: Gentlemen, we do have to move forward. Dave, Martha, back to you.MUIR: Josh, thank you.When we come back here tonight, jobs, ISIS, and what it means to be a conservative.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: The Republican debate continues right here from New Hampshire on ABC. We\u2019ll be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates taking a quick break. I\u2019m here with Jon Karl right now, and boy, Jon. Marco Rubio came into this debate with a head of steam, ran right into Chris Christie.KARL: I have never seen Christie tougher in this race. I have never seen Marco Rubio more rattled. He repeated himself three times, precisely when Chris Christie\u2019s criticism was you always repeat yourself with the same canned speech. This was a tough moment for Marco Rubio.STEPHANOPOULOS: Donald Trump started out more subdued than in the past for most of the debate, right up until the end of that first section when the issue of eminent domain came up, and Jeb Bush was ready.KARL: It almost makes you wonder where would we be in this race right now if Jeb Bush had been that energetic, and that forceful in going after Donald Trump from the start in the previous debates.STEPHANOPOULOS: He has been hitting Donald Trump, but this...KARL: ... But not effectively...STEPHANOPOULOS: ... He did seem to draw some blood, and he seemed to have the crowd on his side, at least for part of that answer tonight. OK, we\u2019ll be right back. The candidates on the stage in just a minute.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(UNKNOWN): Live from Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, here again are David Muir, and Martha Raddatz.MUIR: And, we welcome you back to the Republican debate from New Hampshire tonight here on ABC. We\u2019re going to turn now to what it means to be a conservative, and I want to turn to Governor Kasich.Governor, while campaigning here in New Hampshire, you were already asked about groans from some conservatives after your endorsements from the New York Times, and the Boston Globe. You said, quote, \u201cWhat conservatives have to know is they have to say, look isn\u2019t it nice to have a conservative like me liked? And, maybe the ought to think about it because if I get elected president, the Republican party and the definition of conservatism is going to change.\u201dHow would you change conservatism?KASICH: Well, first of all, look. As the New York Times said, he\u2019s certainly not a moderate, but he can bring people together to solve problems. The fact of the matter is I\u2019ve cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year. I have balanced budgets, the federal budget, the state of Ohio budget, we\u2019re running a $2 billion dollar surplus, we\u2019re up 400,000 jobs, and in Washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which I was the architect.But, here\u2019s the beauty of it, it\u2019s not just balancing a budget, it\u2019s about jobs. You know, when I was kid growing up in a neighborhood where Dad went home at night and said, \u201cI lost my job today\u201d, it just killed the family.It just was a devastating effect. We have to have economic growth, but once we have economic growth I believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows. I believe we need to help the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor. We need to help the developmentally disabled to rise, and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship. In other words, in American, conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles, but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their God given purpose. That\u2019s what conservatism should be.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve heard the argument from many of the candidates on this stage that you\u2019re not a true conservative. Tell the voters watching tonight why you are.TRUMP: Well, I think I am, and to me, I view the word conservative as a derivative I \u2014 of \u2014 of the word conserve. We want to converse our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that and they are not doing it, and it\u2019s a very important word and it\u2019s something I believe in very, very strongly.MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Senator Rubio, you have said yourself that you don\u2019t think Donald Trump is running as a conservative. Did he convince you?RUBIO: Well, I think conservatism is about three things and Donald touched on one of them, but it\u2019s about three things. The first is conservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal level. The federal government is a limited government, limited by the Constitution, which delineates its powers. If it\u2019s not in the Constitution, it does not belong to the federal government. It belongs to states, local communities and the private sector.It\u2019s about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows everyone to rise without pulling anyone down. The reason why free enterprise is the greatest economic model in the history of the world is because it\u2019s the only economic model where you can make poor people richer without making rich people poor.And it\u2019s about a strong national defense. It\u2019s about believing, unlike Barack Obama, that the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military and the strongest nation on this planet. That\u2019s conservatism.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. I want to turn this discussion to the economy now.And Mr. Trump, Governor Christie has said, \u201cI tell everybody who goes to a Donald Trump event, if you get to ask a question, just ask him how.\u201d Christie said, \u201cI don\u2019t care which of the things he talks about, just ask him how.\u201d You have said that you\u2019d be the greatest jobs president God ever created. Tell Americans watching tonight how many jobs you would create in the first term and how.TRUMP: Well, before I go there, I will tell you, I will bring jobs back from China. I will bring jobs back from Japan. I will bring jobs back from Mexico, where New Hampshire, by the way, has been virtually wiped out. They\u2019ve lost so many businesses going to Mexico because of horrible trade deals. And now we\u2019re about to sign another trade deal, TPP, which is going to be a disaster for this country because they don\u2019t talk about monetary manipulation. It is going to be a disaster.I\u2019m going to bring jobs back and I\u2019ll start bringing them back very fast. Under my tax plan \u2014 right now, we\u2019re the highest taxed country in the world. Under my plan, we cut not only taxes for the middle class, but we cut taxes for corporations. We will bring back trillions of dollars that\u2019s offshore. Right now, they have $2.5 trillion, and in my opinion, it\u2019s much more than that. That\u2019s what the government says. All of that money is going to come back.And we\u2019re not going to lose Pfizer, which is now leaving, and other great companies, which is now leaving. And they\u2019re all leaving. We have many, many companies that are leaving this country. We\u2019re not going to lose them anymore because we\u2019re going to have a tax structure that is going to keep them in our country.MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.There are a lot of governors on this stage tonight and Governor Christie, Governor Kasich said of you, quote, \u201cIn Ohio, we balanced a budget. They don\u2019t have one over in New Jersey. Our credit has been strengthened. Their credit has been downgraded. We\u2019ve got more jobs.\u201dHow important are those metrics in choosing the next president? And is his job \u2014 is his record on jobs, I should say, actually stronger than yours?CHRISTIE: Well, he deserves credit for his record on jobs. He\u2019s done a very good job as governor of Ohio. Never said that John hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s done a very good job.(APPLAUSE)But \u2014 but unfortunately, John\u2019s been so busy doing over stuff, he\u2019s using old statistics. That\u2019s OK. New Jersey had its best year of job growth in the last 15 years under five different governors this year in New Jersey. New Jersey cut spending over $2.3 billion and we have 10,000 fewer employees than we had when I walked in the door. John has a bigger government now and more employees than he had when he walked in the door.But all that doesn\u2019t matter. What really matters is this, that executive experience really matters. You heard this on the stage tonight. We\u2019ve heard it said on the stage that President Obama knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.I\u2019d like to ask all the veterans listening out there tonight, who are waiting in line for healthcare, who are literally dying because the Veterans Administration doesn\u2019t work, do you think Barack Obama knows what he\u2019s doing? I don\u2019t. And I\u2019ll tell you something. Anybody who evaluates him is knowing what he\u2019s doing and managing the government doesn\u2019t know how to manage a government themselves.And one last thing, David, which I think is really important. I listened to Senator Rubio\u2019s answer on his bill. He said his bill couldn\u2019t pass on the gang of eight. He acted as if he was somehow disembodied from the bill. It was his bill. He said this idea doesn\u2019t work. It was his idea.See, when you\u2019re a governor, you have to take responsibility for these things. You can\u2019t just act as if it happened out of nowhere. We have to take responsibility as executives. I take responsibility for my record in New Jersey. We\u2019ve rebuilt the economy and rebuilt after the second-worst natural disaster in American history. I\u2019m proud of my record. And by the way, I like Kasich\u2019s record, too. He\u2019s a good governor.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: David?MUIR: Thank you, Governor.Governor Kasich?KASICH: Look, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not here \u2014 I like Chris.MUIR: He didn\u2019t say your record was better than his.KASICH: Let \u2014 but let me \u2014 let me just tell you. First of all, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years.Secondly, we have grown government at the rate of inflation. And I went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. And we\u2019ve grown jobs by 400,000 \u2014 that\u2019s one of the fastest growing states in the country. Our pensions are secure and our credit is rock solid.Now, I\u2019ve learned that, what makes things work, what gets the economy going, not just in Ohio, but in Washington \u2014 and it\u2019s three things. Common sense regulations, which we have, lower taxes, which we have, the lowest taxes, tax cuts in the country. And thirdly, a fiscal plan to balance the budget.When you go from $8 billion in the hole to $2 billion in the black, when you cut taxes by $5 billion and you grow over 400,000 jobs, that is a record that I can take to Washington, using the same formula that I used in Washington when I was part of the effort to balance the budget to give us a surplus and to create jobs.MUIR: Governor Kasich, thank you.KASICH: That\u2019s what I did and I\u2019ll do it again in the first 100 days.KASICH: Governor Kasich, thank you. I do want to turn from jobs to taxes.RUBIO: Now, see, I was mentioned by Governor...MUIR: If you would like to respond to the governor, you can.RUBIO: Yeah.MUIR: I\u2019m coming to you next with a question, anyway. You can respond to that question.RUBIO: OK, good, then I\u2019ll get to it (inaudible). Here\u2019s the...MUIR: We\u2019re going from jobs to taxes, and here\u2019s the...RUBIO: Well, no, sorry. Let me respond to that question.MUIR: To the Gang of Eight bill first?RUBIO: Well, here\u2019s the response. I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn\u2019t doing what he\u2019s doing on purpose doesn\u2019t understand what we\u2019re dealing with here, OK? This is a president \u2014 this is a president who is trying to change this country. When he talked about change, he wasn\u2019t talking about dealing with our problems.Obamacare was not an accident. The undermining of the Second Amendment is not an accident. The gutting of our military is not an accident. The undermining of America on the global stage is not an accident. Barack Obama is, indeed, trying to redefine this country. We better understand what we\u2019re dealing with here, because that\u2019s what Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want to double down on if they are elected.MUIR: The governor wasn\u2019t talking about the president, he was talking about the Gang of Eight bill.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: No. He talked about Barack Obama.MUIR: So, let me ask you about taxes, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yeah.MUIR: A recent poll, 68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than $1 million a year. Are they wrong?RUBIO: I don\u2019t know of any problem in America that\u2019s going to be fixed with a tax increase. We have an economy today, an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough.And one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet. Our combined business rate puts us among the highest in the industrialized world. And then on top of that, we are the only one that has a worldwide system of taxation, where an American company who makes money abroad has to pay taxes where they made the money and then taxes a second time when they bring it back.The combination of these two things has stranded over $2 trillion, the equivalent of the size of the Russian economy, $2 trillion of American corporate money stranded overseas, combined with all of these inversions of companies leaving us.The solution to the problems we have today are not a tax increase. It is to lower our taxes on both people and on companies, so we can make America globally competitive again.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.I want to bring in Governor Bush. And Governor, I just want to repeat that number for you \u2014 68 percent of Americans favor raising taxes on people making more than a million.What do you say to the people who believe that tonight?BUSH: I would like to see more millionaires. I think we need to grow more millionaires, we need create a prosperity society where people can rise up.(APPLAUSE)This notion that somehow we\u2019re undertaxed as a nation is just fool hearty, when we have entitlements growing far faster than our ability to pay for it. A conservative, because that\u2019s the point of this, believes in limited government, believes in a entrepreneurial capitalism and a strong national defense.But it also has to be, we need to reform things. In my town hall meetings, I went to a place where a woman described her neighbor, who has a better economic deal by not working than her struggling to make ends meet. We need to be on the side of working people. And you know, the problem with the left is, another tax, another regulation, another mandate makes it harder for them to rise up.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Knew that was coming. Governor, thank you.CHRISTIE: David? Hey, David? David? Hey, David? I actually have experience with raising taxes on millionaires in my state. It was done. It was done by my predecessor.And I want everybody in the public who is in that 68 percent, I want to tell you the truth. You\u2019re wrong. And here is why you\u2019re wrong. After New Jersey raised taxes on millionaires, we lost, in the next four years, $70 billion in wealth left our state.It left our state to go where it would be treated more kindly. If the United States raised taxes any further, that money will leave the United States, as well. We won\u2019t have better jobs.Let New Jersey be the canary in the coal mine. It is a failed idea and a failed policy, it\u2019s class warfare. It happened in my state. I\u2019ve stopped it from happening again. But we cannot do it.The 68 percent of the people are wrong about that, it will hurt the American economy. We tried it in New Jersey. Come take a look \u2014 it did not work. (APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Christie, thank you.(APPLAUSE) Martha?RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, you advocate what you call carpet bombing, or saturation bombing, to defeat ISIS, citing the more than 1,100 air attacks that the U.S. carried out during the first Gulf War in 1991.Explain how a strategy to defeat a standing army would work against an unconventional terrorist group that is now hiding amongst the population.CRUZ: Well, sure. It starts with a commander-in-chief that sets the objective. And the objective has to be utterly and completely destroying ISIS. Obama hasn\u2019t started with that objective and everything else flows from there.Once you set that objective, we have the tools to carry that out. The first tool is overwhelming air power. It is one of the blessings of the United States of America, having the greatest military on the face of the earth, is we have the ability to use that air power.As you know, in the first Persian Gulf War, it was 1,100 air attacks a day. Obama is launching between 15 and 30. Now, when I say saturation carpet bombing, that is not indiscriminate.That is targeted at oil facilities. It\u2019s targeted at the oil tankers. It\u2019s targeted at command and control locations. It\u2019s targeted at infrastructure. It\u2019s targeted at communications. It\u2019s targeted at bombing all of the roads and bridges going in and out of Raqqa. It\u2019s using overwhelming air power.You know, couple of weeks ago, it was reported that a facility is open called Jihadist University. Now, the question I wonder, why is that building still standing? It should be rubble. And if you had a president...(BELL RINGS)(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... all though I will say this. I would be willing to wait until freshman orientation before launching those bombs. RADDATZ: Senator Cruz, would you like to expand or loosen the rules of engagement? I was just over in a command center in Erbil and they said they thought the rules of engagement worked. Because you have so many civilians in those populated areas, they don\u2019t want to hit civilians.CRUZ: Martha, I will tell you, I have visited with active duty military, with veterans over and over and over again in town halls all over the state of New Hampshire. What we are doing to our sons and daughters, it is immoral. We are sending them into fight with their arms tied behind their back. They cannot defend themselves. And it is wrong.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: And I will tell you this. Look. America has always been reluctant to use military force. It\u2019s the last step we take. But if and when we use it when it comes to defeating ISIS, we should use it. We should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy and then get the heck out. Don\u2019t engage in nation-building but instead, allow our soldiers to do their jobs instead of risking their lives with politicians making it impossible to accomplish the objective.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: So, loosen the rules of engagement?CRUZ: Absolutely, yes.RADDATZ: Senator Rubio, you said in the last debate that ISIS is the most dangerous, jihadist group in the history of mankind And that will it take overwhelming U.S. force to defeat them. Can you specifically tell us what you mean by overwhelming force?RUBIO: Well, first, we need to understand who they are. ISIS is not just a jihadist group, they\u2019re an apocalyptic group. They want to trigger a showdown in a city named Tibet between the west and themselves which they believe will trigger the arrival of their messianic figure.And I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. The reason why it\u2019s important to understand that is because these are not groups that are just going to go away on their own. They are going to have to be defeated. And I believe they need to be defeated on the ground, by a ground force, made up primarily of Sunni Arabs.It will take Sunni Arabs to reject them ideologically and defeat them militarily. That will require a coalition of Iraqis and Syrians, that are also Sunnis, but it will also require the cooperation of Jordanians, Egyptians. We should ask more of the Saudis.That will need to be backed up with more U.S. special operation forces alongside them. And it will have to be backed up with increased air strikes. And we are going to have to strike them, not just in Iraq and in Syria, but in every other part of the world where they have now created hubs of operation. They have affiliates in over a dozen countries across this planet. They have a sophisticated network of radicalizing people here in the homeland and around the world.(BELL RINGS)But it all begins by taking away their their safe operating spaces with a ground force that a U.S.-led coalition takes on.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Again, Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve already said ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind. So, that would make it more dangerous than Al Qaida, the insurgents we fought in Iraq. We committed hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops to fight those groups. So if ISIS is the most dangerous group in history, why not commit a large U.S. ground force?RUBIO: Because they currently occupy Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by Sunnis themselves. If they are held by Shias it will trigger sectarian violence. The Kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the Kurdish areas, but Kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni villages and towns.RUBIO: It will take Sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities, and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past.And why that is important is because if Sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas, you are going to have a successor group to ISIS. ISIS is a successor group of Al Qaida. In fact, they broke away...(BELL RINGS)... from Al Qaida, because as horrible as Al Qaida is, ISIS thought Al Qaida was not radical enough. This is who we\u2019re dealing with, and they have more money than Al Qaida ever had.BUSH (?): Martha \u2014 Martha, if I...RADDATZ: Well, what would you do \u2014 what would you do differently to try to get those Sunni forces? They have not been coming forward.RUBIO: Well, the problem with the Sunni forces in the region is they don\u2019t trust this administration. This administration cut a deal with their mortal enemies, the Shia, in Iran. It poisoned the well with these countries. It makes it very difficult to cooperate with them as a result.They also, by the way, understand what real U.S. air power looks like. They saw the Iraq war. They saw, up close, also Afghanistan. They know what air power looks like when the United States is committed to the cause. And they see the airstrikes that are being conducted now, and they say to themselves, that\u2019s not real (ph) commitment. We know what real commitment looks like.The \u2014 the Jordanian king was in Washington three weeks ago. He told everyone who would listen that they have begged for permission from the coalition to target caravans. And the coalition \u2014 meaning U.S. leadership on the ground...(BELL RINGS)... would not allow them to proceed with those airstrikes.RADDATZ: Mr. Trump \u2014 thank you very much, Senator Rubio. Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)You have said you will vigorously bomb ISIS. You\u2019ve said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get rid of ISIS, quickly, quickly.\u201d How would you get rid of them so quickly? And please give us specifics.TRUMP: Well, four years ago, I said, bomb the oil and take the oil. And if we did that, they wouldn\u2019t have the wealth they have right now. Now, I still say the same thing, because we\u2019re doing little pinpricks. We\u2019re not even bombing \u2014 if somebody\u2019s driving a truck, they give notice to the person driving the truck, \u201cwe\u2019re going to bomb.\u201d If they don\u2019t get out of the truck, the truck sails away with the oil.We actually have a case where we don\u2019t want to bomb the oil, because we don\u2019t want to hurt \u2014 pollute the atmosphere. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton saying we can\u2019t bomb because we\u2019re gonna hurt the atmosphere?You have to knock the hell out of the oil. You have to take the oil. And you have also back channels of banking. You have people that you think are our great allies, our friends, in the Middle East, that are paying tremendous numbers of \u2014 tremendous amounts of money to ISIS.So we have to stop those circuits. Nobody knows banking better than I do. They have back circuits, back channels. Tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system. So between the oil and the banking, you will dry them up. But it should have been done four years ago, not now.RADDATZ: And \u2014 and what would you do in those cities, where there are people who we are trying to help, who ISIS is essentially holding hostage?TRUMP: You have to go in \u2014 first of all, when you take away their money, when you take away their wealth, that\u2019ll very much weaken \u2014 and it will happen fairly fast.They\u2019ll last for about a year, based on all of the wealth they\u2019ve accumulated. But when you stop the banking channels and when you stop the oil and take the oil \u2014 not just bomb it, take it \u2014 when you do that, it\u2019s going to dry up very quickly. They\u2019re going to become a very weakened power, quickly. Thank you.RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)Let\u2019s turn to Libya. Governor Bush, it is a country in chaos. There is no government. This week, defense officials said there are now 5,000 ISIS fighters there, roughly doubling previous estimates. We know you and others have been critical of the administration\u2019s handling of Libya after the initial air strikes that you supported.But this is a problem you would stand to inherit if you\u2019re the next president. Reports this week said the administration is considering new air strikes, possible special operations raids. Would you support renewed air strikes or any U.S. involvement on the ground?BUSH: I would. And I would do it in concert, again, with our Arab allies and with Europe, most particularly in this case. This is the lesson learned: in history, if you bomb something and not do anything as it relates to deal with the aftermath of this, if you don\u2019t have a stable government, you get what we have in Libya.And this is not \u2014 leading from behind is not an effective policy. We have to lead. Without the United States, nothing seems to work. Europe doesn\u2019t have the ability to \u2014 to \u2014 to lead \u2014 forward lean (ph) in this regard.And so dealing with the caliphate is important, because it now has spawned other areas. There have been 70-plus attacks in 17 countries, either inspired by ISIS or organized by ISIS, Libya being the most important one now.We have to deal with the caliphate, with building a Sunni army there, but we also have to deal with it in Libya. And I think the United States, ultimately, is going to play \u2014 play a significant role in this.The problem with the Obama administration is that they see this incrementally. They\u2019re reluctant. They don\u2019t lead. No one knows whether we\u2019re serious, and when we do it, we do it in increments you can barely see.(BELL RINGS)The United States has to lead in a much more aggressive way than we\u2019re doing right now.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Bush. Dr. Carson?CARSON: I want to say something about this, because I\u2019m not here just to add beauty to the stage.(LAUGHTER)You know, I\u2019ve been talking about Libya for quite a long time. I think I was the first one to start talking about it because I say we have to have a proactive foreign policy strategy. And of course, the next place that ISIS is going to attack to is Libya.If you want to expand your caliphate and increase your influence, then you\u2019re going to go to a place that\u2019s strategically located. You go north, across the Mediterranean. You\u2019re into southern Europe. You go south, you\u2019re into Chad and Sudan and Niger. Not to mention the fact that you have much more oil than you do in Iraq. That\u2019s the kind of place that they\u2019re going to go to, therefore, we need to be thinking about how do we prevent them from tacking over there. They\u2019re already sending their fighters there, we need to be consulting with our military experts and asking them what do they need in order to prevent ISIS from being able to take over Libya. That\u2019s going to have enormous concede for us.RADDATZ: And would you support renewed airstrikes?CARSON: I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in conjunction with our Joint Chiefs and our military people they felt that was an appropriate strategy.The fact of the matter is none of us up here is a military expert, and we sometimes act like we are, but we\u2019re not. And if we actually sit down and talk with them and get them to understand our plan and their impression of what needs to be done, I think we\u2019re going to make a lot more progress.BUSH: Martha and David, I just...RADDATZ: We\u2019re going to move on.BUSH: Martha and David...MUIR: Martha, thank you. We\u2019re just going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to stay on ISIS here and the war on terror, because as you know, there\u2019s been a debate in this country about how to deal with the enemy and about enhanced interrogation techniques ever since 9/11.So Senator Cruz, you have said, quote, \u201ctorture is wrong, unambiguously, period. Civilized nations do not engage in torture.\u201d Some of the other candidates say they don\u2019t think waterboarding is torture. Mr. Trump has said, I would bring it back. Senator Cruz, is waterboarding torture?CRUZ: Well, under the definition of torture, no, it\u2019s not. Under the law, torture is excruciating pain that is equivalent to losing organs and systems, so under the definition of torture, it is not. It is enhanced interrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.MUIR: If elected president, would you bring it back?CRUZ: I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use. And indeed, I joined with Senator McCain in legislation that would prohibit line officers from employing it because I think bad things happen when enhanced interrogation is employed at lower levels.But when it comes to keeping this country safe, the commander in chief has inherent constitutional authority to keep this country safe. And so, if it were necessary to, say, prevent a city from facing an imminent terrorist attack, you can rest assured that as commander in chief, I would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, you said not only does it work, but that you\u2019d bring it back.TRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. In the Middle East, we have people chopping the heads off Christians, we have people chopping the heads off many other people. We have things that we have never seen before \u2014 as a group, we have never seen before, what\u2019s happening right now.The medieval times \u2014 I mean, we studied medieval times \u2014 not since medieval times have people seen what\u2019s going on. I would bring back waterboarding and I\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. Governor Bush, you have said that you won\u2019t rule waterboarding out. Congress has passed laws banning the use of waterboarding by the military and the CIA, as you know. Would you want Congress to change that if you\u2019re elected president?BUSH: No, no, I wouldn\u2019t. No, I wouldn\u2019t. And it was used sparingly, Congress has changed the laws and I \u2014 and I think where we stand is the appropriate place. But what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities.The idea that we\u2019re going to solve this fight with predator drones, killing people somehow is a \u2014 is more acceptable than capturing them, securing the information. This is why closing Guantanamo is a complete disaster. What we need to do is make sure that we are kept safe...(APPLAUSE)... by having intelligence capabilities, both human and technological intelligence capabilities far superior than what we have today. That\u2019s how you get a more safe place is by making sure that we\u2019re fully engaged. And right now, this administration doesn\u2019t do that.BUSH: Governor Bush, thank you.(APPLAUSE)Senator Rubio, I do want to ask you, you have said that you do not want to telegraph to the enemy what you would do as commander in chief. But for the American people watching tonight who want to know where the next president will stand, do you believe waterboarding is torture?RUBIO: Well, when people talk about interrogating terrorists, they\u2019re acting like this is some sort of law enforcement function. Law enforcement is about gathering evidence to take someone to trial, and convict them. Anti-terrorism is about finding out information to prevent a future attack so the same tactics do not apply.And, it is true, we should not be discussing in a wide spread way the exact tactics that we\u2019re going to use because that allows terrorist to know to practice how to evade us.But, here\u2019s the bigger problem with all this, we\u2019re not interrogating anybody right now. Guantanamo\u2019s being emptied by this president. We should be putting people into Guantanamo, not emptying it out, and we shouldn\u2019t be releasing these killers who are rejoining the battlefield against the United States.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you.We want to turn now to the topic of executive orders, and for that, we\u2019re going to turn back to Mary Katharine Ham. Mary Katharine?HAM: Thanks, David. Senator Cruz, on the campaign trail you\u2019ve promised voters a lot, in fact if you\u2019re elected president you\u2019d say you end Common Core immediately, abolish the IRS, and do away with sanctuary cities. You\u2019ve also been a persistent critic of President Obama\u2019s executive overreach, going it alone, not working with Congress. How do you intend to implement this aggressive agenda within your Constitutional authority, especially given that it would require working with Congress and Washington players with whom you\u2019re happy to say you have a strained relationship?CRUZ: Well, thank you for that question. You know, there are three avenues of presidential authority to change the direction of this country. The first is executive power, the second is foreign policy, and the third is legislation. Executive power, as we all know, has been the preferred vehicle of President Obama, abusing his authority, abusing his constitutional authority.Now, the silver lining of that is everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, so I have pledged on day one I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action Barack Obama has done. That means on day one his efforts to restrict the Second Amendment go away with the strike of a pen. That means on day one his illegal executive amnesty goes away with the strike of a pen.The reason I can end Common Core at the federal level is because Obama is abusing executive power using Race to the Top funds in the Department of Education to force it on the states. That\u2019s one avenue.The second avenue of change is foreign policy, and foreign policy can change the fastest. It\u2019s worth remembering that Iran released our hostages the day Reagan...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... Was sworn in. And, the third is legislation, and that can only be done with the people behind you, which is why the two big legislative initiatives I\u2019m campaigning on are repealing Obamacare, and adopting a simple flat tax to abolish the IRS.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz is known for opposing deals, you literally wrote the book on making them. Senator Cruz has mentioned that on the trail. What would you say to those conservatives that are concerned that a deal maker will just perpetuate the same deals in Washington and the way that things run now (INAUDIBLE)...TRUMP: ... No, a good deal maker will make great deals, but we\u2019ll do it the way our founders thought it should be done. People get together, they make deals. Ronald Reagan did it with Tip O\u2019Neil very successfully, you didn\u2019t hear so much about executive orders, if you heard about it at all. You have to be able to get a consensus.Now, the real person like it was mentioned about the deal with Iran, how bad a deal is that? It doesn\u2019t get any more amateurish than that. A good deal maker would never make a deal like that. With Congress, you have to get everybody in a room, and you have to get them to agree. But, you have to get them to agree what you want, and that\u2019s part of being a deal maker. You can\u2019t leave the White House, go to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks and be a real deal maker. It doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to get people in, grab them, hug them, kiss them, and get the deal done. But, it\u2019s got to be the deal that you want.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Governor Kasich, is the problem with Washington that there are too many deals, or too few?KASICH: Well, right now the deals \u2014 there\u2019s no leadership. I mean, a lot of the things that we\u2019re talking about here tonight, on the border, and so many of the things. What we should be doing on foreign policy, you know what the problem is, Mary Katharine? There\u2019s not a leader that gets somebody to rise.You have to have a leader that can inspire, and actually some of what Donald was saying is true. Look, do you know how hard it was...TRUMP: Some?KASICH: ... to get the balance the federal budget balanced? You have to plead with people. To do what we\u2019ve done in Ohio, you have to plead with people, then you go back down to Washington and do the same thing.See, we have to remind people we\u2019re Americans before we\u2019re Republicans and Democrats, and when we wait, and when we delay what we end up doing, Mary Katharine, is we make the United States weaker. In fact, it\u2019s a foreign policy issue because people look at America not solving problems and they say what are they doing over there? The point is you have to work with people.TRUMP: The problem with executive authority for the president, it\u2019s really bad news for this reason. Since he\u2019s given up on working with Congress, he thinks he can impose anything he wants. He\u2019s not a king. He\u2019s a president. An executive order should be used frankly in consolidation and with consulting with the leadership in the \u2014 in the Congress.I\u2019ve done it in Ohio. I consult. I could use executive orders, but I don\u2019t trump the legislature, because if you do, you aggravate them, you anger them and then the long-term prospects get bleak. We have to solve problems in America by coming together, Republicans and Democrats, Americans first, party and ideology second \u2014 in the second back seat of this country. That\u2019s what we need to do.(APPLAUSE)And we can do it. And we can do it.BUSH: This is a \u2014 this is an important subject. I agree with everything that\u2019s been said here about repealing unconstitutional rules and rules that are creating real burdens for investing that creating jobs.But we also ought to get back to being a Tenth Amendment country, as well, a country that respects the states to be able to make more decisions. And in the Bush administration, we would shift transportation dollars back to the states. I trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads and the infrastructure of their states than Washington, D.C.EPA delegated authority, back to the states. Education dollars, back to the states. I would like to see reform take place all across the country, where there\u2019s more vouchers, more freedom.(APPLAUSE)If we did that, we would shrink government\u2019s power in Washington, D.C. and we would have a much more effective government, where people would begin to trust our government again, because now, no one believes it works.KASICH: Mary Katherine, let me just say this to you.(APPLAUSE)You must have an agenda that you are ready to move on in the first 100 days. Jeb is right. If you delay and you wait, the Washington operators will take you down. I can tell you this, in the first 100 days, I will have legislation to freeze federal regulations, have them reviewed by the vice president, reduce state taxes on individuals, reduce taxes on corporations, have a fiscal plan to balance the budget, get the border protected and begin to fix Social Security in the first 100 days.So, anybody who is here tonight, if I get elected president, head out tomorrow and buy a seat belt, because there\u2019s going to be so much happening in the first 100 days, it\u2019s going to make your head spin. We\u2019re going to move America forward. I promise you. We\u2019re going to move us forward.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: You mentioned me. He mentioned me. One other thing that I think we ought to do, along with repealing Obamacare, we need to shift all of this power of healthcare, which is the most egregious form of federal power that is suppressing wages and incomes, and allow governors to have the Medicaid plans so that they can create 21st century Medicaid insurance for people that are stuck in poverty. There\u2019s so much that can be done, but I don\u2019t trust Washington to do it. I trust the state capitals to be the place \u2014 to be the source of innovation and reform in this country.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Thank you, governors. Martha and David, back to you.MUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you.We want to turn to something the governor of New Hampshire said...(LAUGHTER)KASICH: Jeb mentioned me. Time for me to go again.BUSH: I didn\u2019t mention him the second time.KASICH: He says he didn\u2019t mention me the second time. I thought I heard it, Jeb. No. I\u2019m just kidding. Thank you all very much for listening and being patient with all of us tonight. Thank you.MUIR: A connection here on the stage. We\u2019re going to move on to what the governor of New Hampshire said just this week, and that is that heroin overdose is not the second-leading cause of death in this state. You don\u2019t need me to tell you that. But there\u2019s another number, 48 percent of the people here in this state knows someone who has abused heroin.Josh, who covers this for WMUR, has the next question.MCELVEEN: You\u2019re all aware, candidates, this is a major problem here in New Hampshire. It\u2019s a very deadly problem as well. Last month, New Hampshire senators Kelly Ayotte, Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat, they went down to Washington, along with the police chief of the state\u2019s largest city to testify before the Judiciary Committee in D.C.Senator Cruz, you\u2019re a member of that committee. Your campaign schedule didn\u2019t allow you to attend this. Even so, the police chief called your absence outrageous, given the severity of the problem. Last week, though, you told a personal story of a close family member\u2019s struggle with addiction. What can you say to law enforcement right now to convince them that you understand the severity of this problem and you\u2019re not just saying what people want to hear days before the primary?CRUZ: Well, Josh, as you noted, this is a problem that, for me, I understand first-hand. My older sister, Myriam, who was my half- sister, struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction. My father and her mom divorced when she was a little girl and she was angry her whole life, and she ended up marrying a man who had been in and out of jail. She then became a single mom and she herself went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house. CRUZ: I still remember my father and me driving up to get Myriam out of that crack house to try to convince her she needed to be a mom to \u2014 to my nephew Joey.She wasn\u2019t willing to listen. She was not willing to change the path she was on. She was angry. I was \u2014 had just gotten my first job coming out of law school. I took a $20,000 loan on a credit card to put my nephew, Joey, in Valley Forge Military Academy \u2014 he was in sixth grade at the time, to pay his way through that.And about five, six years ago, Miriam died of an overdose. It was \u2014 the coroner ruled it accidental. We don\u2019t know. She went to one night, had taken too many pills, and Joey walked in and found her dead.This is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve it. Solving it has to occur at the state and local level with programs like A.A., and counseling, and churches and charities. But it also has to be securing the borders, because you have got Mexican cartels that are smuggling vast amounts of heroin into this country.We know how to secure the borders. What is missing is the political will to do it.And as president, I will secure the border, we will end this deluge of drugs that is flowing over our southern border and that is killing Americans across this country.MCELVEEN: And Governor Christie, you have talked a lot about this issue here in New Hampshire.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: State reforms, criminal justice reforms, access to treatment.To Senator Cruz\u2019s point, let\u2019s take it a step further. Would you be willing to engage in cross-border enforcement into Mexico, a place where law enforcement in New Hampshire has traced at lot of this supply back to. Would you engage in cross-border enforcement without the cooperation without the Mexican government?CHRISTIE: Of course I would. As a former United States attorney who spent seven years of my life fighting this on the streets of my state, I would do that. But we need to do more. And let me tell you what we\u2019ve done in New Jersey, Josh. We are working with the folks in New Hampshire in their legislature right now to show them how we\u2019re helping to solve this problem in New Jersey.Not just for this campaign \u2014 three years ago, I proposed a law that we signed into effect, which said that anyone who was a non- violent, non-dealing, first-time drug offender no longer goes to prison in New Jersey. They go to mandatory, in-patient drug treatment.What has happened is, crime has gone down 20 percent in those years. The prison population has gone down 10 percent. We\u2019ve now closed the state prison \u2014 closed a state prison, and we\u2019re turning it into a drug rehabilitation facility, so people can get the tools they need.Listen, everyone out there knows this in New Hampshire. This is a disease. It\u2019s not a moral failing, it\u2019s a disease. And we need to get people the treatment they need. And let me tell you why. Because I\u2019m pro-life.And I\u2019m pro life not just for the nine months in the womb, I\u2019m pro-life for when they get out and it\u2019s a lot more complicated.(APPLAUSE)Sixteen-year-old, heroin-addicted drug girl on the floor of the county lockup, I\u2019m pro-life for her life. The 42-year-old lawyer who is taking Oxycontin and can\u2019t get out of bed and support his family \u2014 I\u2019m pro-life for his life. Everyone of those lives is an individual gift from God.And the last thing is this. These efforts we\u2019ve taken over the last three years, 2015 in New Jersey, for the first time in four years, drug overdose deaths have gone down, not up.I\u2019ll bring the same solutions to the country.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: Governor Christie, thank you very much.David, Martha, back to you.RADDATZ: Thank you, Governor Christie. Thank you, Josh.Our partner in this debate, the Independent Journal Review, has collected questions from some prominent conservatives around the country.Here\u2019s a videotaped question from radio host Larry O\u2019Connor.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)O\u2019CONNOR: In 2008, we saw how motivated an electorate can be when they think their vote is making history. Let\u2019s face it: if Hillary Clinton is the nominee for the Democrats, you\u2019ll be running against the prospect of the first woman president.How will you change that narrative and motivate the electorate behind your candidacy?(END VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Well...RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, I\u2019m going to give that question to you. You took it \u2014 you took it away anyway.TRUMP: Yes. OK, good. It looked like he was looking right at me, right there.I think that \u2014 I look at what\u2019s going on, I look at all of the polls, I do very, very well against Hillary Clinton. I can tell you, I\u2019m the last person that she wants to run against.And I think you can see what we\u2019ve done in terms of galvanizing. I\u2019ve been all over the country. We\u2019re \u2014 last night, I was in South Carolina, we had 12,000 people. It set up in about four days. We have galvanized and we\u2019ve created a movement. A lot of it has to do with \u2014 as an example, Josh\u2019s question on drugs.I\u2019m the first person that said, \u201cBuild a wall.\u201d But I mean, a real wall, not a toy wall like they have right now. A real wall. And you\u2019ll solve lots of problems.But we will galvanize the people of this country, and we will beat Hillary Clinton. Because \u2014 assuming that she runs, by the way, how she gets away with the e-mail stuff is hard to believe. So, I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to be running. But on the assumption she runs...(APPLAUSE)I mean, look. And speaking of that, if she runs, she\u2019s running for one reason. She\u2019s going to be able to run for one reason, and that\u2019s because the Democrats are protecting her. Because so many people have done so much less than her, and they were absolutely \u2014 their lives have been destroyed.TRUMP: But on the assumption they do protect her, I will win the election and we will win it by a lot. We will win it handily. We cannot have another four years of essentially Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.I\u2019m going to go to Senator Rubio on this. How would you change that narrative?RUBIO: I think it\u2019s already happening. Look at the turnout in Iowa. A historic number of people came out and voted in those caucuses. There are saying the same thing is going to happen here in New Hampshire. Look at the rallies that every single person on this stage is having. Much higher numbers than you used to see in the past and here is why.Because people are starting to understand, very clearly, that this election is going to be a turning point. That 2016 is not just a choice between Republican or Democrat. It is a referendum on our identity as a nation and as a people.So here is what Hillary Clinton needs to understand. We\u2019re going to have our primary, we\u2019re going to have our debates \u2014 which by the way, are twice as many as the Democrats have been willing to have themselves. But we\u2019re going to bring this party together and we are going to defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is unqualified to be the president of the United States of America.She put classified information on her computer because she thinks she\u2019s above the law and anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country like she did in Benghazi, can never be the commander-in-chief of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Dr. Carson, I want to go to you on Larry O\u2019 Connor\u2019s question. Would you change the narrative?CARSON: It\u2019s the same question?RADDATZ: Yes.CARSON: Yes. Well, first of all, I think it would be a pretty easy contrast, quite frankly, between myself and Hillary Clinton. In one case, you have someone who is known as a deceitful individual. An individual who at Benghazi, which I will never let go, quite frankly, because I think of those two men who went up there on the top of that compound with machine guns, firing away, allowing their colleagues to escape.And I\u2019m sure, in the back of their mind, they were just saying, if we can just hold on, help is on the way. But help was not on the way. When did we in the United States not send people to help our own people? You know, this is not who we are.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: And \u2014 I would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the Washington way.MUIR: Martha?RADDATZ: Thank you very much Dr. Carson. I\u2019m going to go back to David.MUIR: Governor, well come to you in the next segment.When we come back, questions about race, about our veterans and social issues what younger conservative voters are now saying as we continue with New Hampshire with the Republican debate, right here on ABC.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)ANNOUNCER: Live from St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, here again are David Muir and Martha Raddatz.MUIR: Welcome back to New Hampshire, ABC News coverage of the Republican debate, and it\u2019s great to have you back at the podiums, and we want to turn to race in America.And Mr. Trump, there are many who argue cell phones and smartphones are just now exposing what\u2019s been happening in this country for years. Cases of excessive force against minorities.As you know, Mr. Trump, on the other side, the FBI director recently said there\u2019s a chill wind blowing through law enforcement because of increased scrutiny. You have said police are the most mistreated people in America. As president, how do you bridge the divide? TRUMP: Well, there is a divide, but I have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood, and if there is an incident, whether it\u2019s an incident done purposely \u2014 which is a horror, and you should really take very strong action \u2014 or if it is a mistake, it\u2019s on your news casts all night, all week, all month, and it never ends.The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order, and they\u2019re afraid for their jobs, they\u2019re afraid of the mistreatment they get, and I\u2019m telling you that not only, me speaking, minorities all over the country, they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect.They can\u2019t act. They can\u2019t act. They\u2019re afraid for losing their pension, their job. They don\u2019t know what to do. And I deal with them all the time. We have to give great respect, far greater than we are right now, to our really fantastic police.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Great. Mr. Trump, I did ask about bridging the divide though as president. So what would you say to the American families who say we have lived through this, we have seen excessive force? What would you say to those people?TRUMP: Well, they do. And, you know, they sue. Everybody sues, right? They see excessive \u2014 I mean, they go out, they sue. We have so much litigation \u2014 I see the courts, I see what they\u2019re doing. They sue, and you know what? We don\u2019t want excessive force. But at what point \u2014 you know, either you\u2019re going to have a police force that can do its job...I was just up in Manchester, I met with the police officers yesterday. Tremendous people. They love the area, they love the people, they love all the people. They want to do their job. And you\u2019re going to have abuse and you\u2019re going to have problems, and you\u2019ve got to solve the problems and you have to weed out the problems. But the police in this country are absolutely amazing people.KASICH: David, David...MUIR: I do want to ask \u2014 Governor Kasich?KASICH: I wanted \u2014 I wanted to say, look, this \u2014 there can be a win-win here. I have formed a collaborative between police and community leaders because people have to respect law enforcement. A family doesn\u2019t want dad or mom going home in a box. And for our community leaders, many of them think the system not only works \u2014 not only doesn\u2019t work for them, but it works against them.And I created a big collaborative in Ohio made up of law enforcement, community leaders, the head of my public safety and a former Democrat, liberal Senate senator Nina Turner, run it. They got together, they made recommendations on recruiting, on hiring, on the use of deadly force and what we\u2019re about to do is to bring community and police together so we can have a win-win.We need more win-wins in America and we don\u2019t have to pick one over another divide. We love the police, but we\u2019ve got to be responsible to the people in the community. We have to do all of that.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor, thank you. Senator Rubio, I want to ask you next, President Obama visited a mosque this week in America for the first time in his presidency. President George W. Bush visited a mosque after September 11th. You said of President Obama, quote, \u201che\u2019s always pitting people against each other.\u201d So I\u2019m curious, how are the two visits different, and would you visit a mosque as president?RUBIO: I would. But that\u2019s not \u2014 the issue \u2014 my problem with what he did is he continues to put out this fiction that there\u2019s widespread systematic discrimination against Muslim Americans.First of all, let\u2019s recognize this. If you go to a national cemetery in this country, you will see stars of Davids and crosses, but you see crescent moons. There are brave men and women who happen to be Muslim Americans who are serving this country in uniform and who have died in the service of this country. And we recognize that and we honor that. But by the same token, we face a very significant threat of home grown violent extremism.We need to have strong, positive relationships in the Islamic communities in this country so they will identify and report this activity, especially mosques, for example, that are participating not just in hate speech, but inciting violence and taking acts against us.And I do believe it is important also to recognize, you want to talk about religious discrimination in America. Well, I don\u2019t think Barack Obama is being sued by any Islamic groups, but he is being sued by the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are facing in this country Christian groups and groups that hold traditional values who feel and in fact are being discriminated against by the laws of this country that try to force them to vie to violate their conscience.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Senator Rubio, thank you. Martha?RADDATZ: Governor Christie, earlier this week, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a global emergency. The same kind of mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus in Latin America are found here in the United States, and the virus has been linked to severe birth defects.Governor Christie, at the peak of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, you ordered an American nurse who landed at Newark Airport be detained and quarantined. As fear spreads now of the Zika virus and with the Rio Olympics just months away, is there a scenario where you would quarantine people traveling back from Brazil to prevent the spread in the United States? CHRISTIE: You bet I would. And the fact is that because I took strong action to make sure that anyone who was showing symptoms \u2014 remember what happened with that nurse. She was showing symptoms and coming back from a place that had the ebola virus active and she had been treating patients. This was not just some \u2014 like, we picked up her just for the heck of it, alright?We did it because she was showing symptoms, and the fact is that\u2019s the way we should make these decision. You make these decisions based upon the symptoms, the medicine, and the law. We quarantined her, she turned out to test negative ultimately after 48 hours, and we released her back to the State of Maine.But, I want to add something on the issue of mosques. Now, I\u2019m the only one up here who\u2019s had a law enforcement background as a U.S. Attorney after September 11th. I went to mosques throughout my state to build bridges. To build bridges between our community in law enforcement so we can get intelligence and information from these folks.I\u2019ve had the experience of working with them as Governor of New Jersey as well. We cannot nix (ph) the radical Islamic jihadist with everyday Muslim-Americans. New Jersey is the second largest Muslim- American population in America, of any state. These are good, law abiding, hard working people. What they need is our cooperation, and our understanding. They do not just need broadsides against them because of the religious faith they practice.RADDATZ: Governor Christie, thank you.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: I\u2019m going to move to Dr. Carson, and go back to the Zika virus, is that going too far, quarantining? You\u2019re a doctor, what would you do?CARSON: Well, you know, it\u2019s not a simple issue, and now, you know, we\u2019ve gotten evidence that there can been active viruses in other bodily fluids like saliva and urine. So, this is going to be, obviously, a big deal.Do we quarantine people? If we have evidence that they are infected, and that there is evidence that that infection can spread by something that they\u2019re doing, yes. But, just willy-nilly going out and quarantining a bunch of people because they\u2019ve been to Brazil, I don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s going to work. What we really need to be thinking about is how do we get this disease under control?And this is where we need rapid response. We need a rapid response for ebola, we need rapid response for Zika, there will be other things that will come up. These are the kinds of things that the NIH, the CDC, can be very effective in. We need to give the the appropriate support for those kind of things.RADDATZ: Thanks very much, Dr. Carson.I want to move on to the military. Senator Rubio, all restrictions on women in combat as long as they qualify. Positions including special operations forces, like Navy Seals. Just this week military leaders of the Army and Marine Corps said that they believed young women, just as young men are required to do, should sign up for Selective Service in case the Draft is reinstated.Many of you have young daughters. Senator Rubio, should young women be required to sign up for Selective Service in case of a national emergency?RUBIO: First, let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat. That, in fact, whose lives are in very serious danger, and so I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised. But, I support that, and obviously now that that is the case I do believe that Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women in case a Draft is ever instituted.I think the more fundamental challenge we\u2019re now facing is what\u2019s happening to the U.S. military \u2014 I\u2019ve said this many times, and I think it\u2019s important to start paying attention to this. Our Air Force is about to be the smallest it\u2019s been in 100 years. I\u2019m sorry, in our history. Our Army is set to be smaller than it\u2019s been since the second World War, and our Navy is about to be the smallest than it\u2019s been in 100 years.I think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it, and it costs more, and it\u2019s a lot more chaotic and dangerous. When I\u2019m president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Governor Bush, do you believe that young women...BUSH: ... Say it again?RADDATZ: Do you believe young women should sign up for Selective Service, be required to sign up...BUSH: ... I do, and I do think that we should not impose any kind of political agenda on the military. There should be \u2014 if women can meet the requirements, the minimum requirements for combat service they ought to have the right to do it. For sure. It ought to be focused on the morale as well. We got to make sure that we have readiness much higher than we do today. We need to eliminate the sequester which is devastating our military.We can\u2019t be focusing on the political side of this, we need to realize that our military force is how we project our word in the world. When we\u2019re weak militarily it doesn\u2019t matter what we say. We can talk about red lines, and ISIS being the J.V. team, and reset buttons and all this. If we don\u2019t have a strong military than no one fears us, and they take actions that are against our national interest.RADDATZ: Tell me what you\u2019d say to American people out there...(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: ... Who are sitting at home, who have daughters, who might worry about those answers, and might worry...BUSH: ... Why would they worry about it...RADDATZ: ... if the Draft is reinstituted?BUSH: ... Well, the Draft\u2019s not going to be reinstituted, but why \u2014 if women are accessing...RADDATZ: ... Are you saying you\u2019d do away with it?BUSH: No. I didn\u2019t say that. You \u2014 you asked a question not about the draft, you asked about registering. And if women are going to be...RADDATZ: You register for the draft.BUSH: If \u2014 but...RADDATZ: If it\u2019s reinstituted.BUSH: ... we don\u2019t have a draft. I\u2019m not suggesting we have a draft. What I\u2019m suggesting is that we ought to have readiness being the first priority of our military, and secondly, that we make sure that the morale is high. And right now, neither one of those are acceptable because we\u2019ve been gutting the military budget.We also need to reform our procurement process. We need to make sure there are more men and women in uniform than people \u2014 than civilians in our Defense Department. There\u2019s a lot of things that we need to reform to bring our defense capabilities into the 21st century and I\u2019m the guy that could do that. That\u2019s why I have the support of generals, of admirals, of 12 Medal of Honor recipients and many other people that know that I would be a steady commander-in-chief and rebuild our military.(APPLAUSE)CHRISTIE: Martha?RADDATZ: Thank you very much.CHRISTIE: Can I \u2014 can I be really \u2014 can I be really clear on this, because I am the father of two daughters. One of them is here tonight. What my wife and I have taught our daughters right from the beginning, that their sense of self-worth, their sense of value, their sense of what they want to do with their life comes not from the outside, but comes from within. And if a young woman in this country wants to go and fight to defend their country, she should be permitted to do so.Part of that also needs to be part of a greater effort in this country, and so there\u2019s no reason why one \u2014 young women should be discriminated against from registering for the selective service. The fact is, we need to be a party and a people that makes sure that our women in this country understand anything they can dream, anything that they want to aspire to, they can do. That\u2019s the way we raised our daughters and that\u2019s what we should aspire to as president for all of the women in our country.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you very much, Governor Christie.CARSON: Can I say something...RADDATZ: We just covered \u2014 wait one second, Dr. Carson.CARSON: Something about the draft. Very quickly.RADDATZ: Very quickly.CARSON: You know, 14 percent decrease in the number of people applying for voluntary military service, and I think part of it is because of the way that we treat our veterans. You know, we wouldn\u2019t be a free country if it wasn\u2019t for them, and we have 22 veterans per day committing suicide.So, I think what we should do is have an external support system for people once they volunteer and it should follow them throughout their career, should follow them for three years, five years afterwards, a year before they get out, should be working on integrating them back into society, so that they quit on Friday and they start their new job. They should have health empowerment accounts that are subsidized so they can go to any medical facility and be taken care of. They can go to a V.A. if they want to.But if we start taking care of our veterans the right way, we won\u2019t have to ever worry about a draft again.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Thank you very much for bringing up that subject, Dr. Carson, of our veterans.And for another question about our veterans, we go back to Josh McElveen from WMUR. Josh?MCELVEEN: Thank you, Martha. None of you on stage tonight have ever worn a uniform as a member of the armed services. That\u2019s the reality of it. But as commander-in-chief, you\u2019ll also be charged with the care of 23 million active duty service members and veterans in this country.Some have suggested privatizing the V.A. as a way to enhance care and increase the quality of the care and access. Others say that veterans should carry I.D. cards that allow them access to any hospital or health care provider. Governor Bush, what specifically would you do to ensure that those who have sacrificed for us are cared for?BUSH: I totally agree that we need to give veterans more choices. A veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance the quality of the service inside the Department of Veterans Affairs. We need career civil service reform. Only three people were fired after waiting lists were dropped where veterans didn\u2019t get care and people died. It is outrageous. And Hillary Clinton says that that\u2019s acceptable? Because she is captive of the public service uniforms.Career civil service reform would allow the next president to fire people that are \u2014 that are showing sheer incompetence. At a town hall meeting today, someone came \u2014 told a story of their father who looked like he was 85. He had \u2014 he got a bill eight years later from an operation he had, eight years it took. They couldn\u2019t resolve the dispute and then he was told that he died. Literally, the Veterans Administration sent a death certificate to this guy and it took nine months to clarify the guy \u2014 I met him. He\u2019s voting for me. And he is \u2014 likely to be alive.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)This is \u2014 this is outrageous. It is completely outrageous. So, giving veterans more choices, creating centers of excellence, focusing on the true problems that exist. Dr. Carson is completely right. We need to start focusing on this earlier, before they become veterans so that there\u2019s a customized plan so people don\u2019t fall through the cracks. We can do this, but it\u2019s going to require someone who has proven leadership skills to make it happen.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Josh?MCELVEEN: Governor Kasich, do you have a favored approach?KASICH: Josh, I mean, clearly, when a veteran comes home, they should get health care anywhere they want to go. In our state, which is what we should do in the country, you know, if they drive a truck from Kabul to Kandahar in Afghanistan, we say, you can drive a truck from Columbus to Cleveland, and you don\u2019t have to go get a license. We\u2019re going to hand you one.And if you\u2019ve got expertise in the military, we\u2019re going to give you college credit or community college credit for the things that you did for our country. And in addition to that, I\u2019ll tell you, one of the biggest things I think has to be done \u2014 and I would do it as president \u2014 the Pentagon has got to work with the returning soldier, sailor, along with the family, and we \u2014 they\u2019re the most valuable employees in the country. I call them golden employees.Everybody wants to hire a veteran. But there is a disconnect between the job openings and the veteran when the veteran comes back. The veteran is a leader. The veteran is strong. The veteran is drug free. There should be no unemployment among veterans.And if the Pentagon will work with the veterans\u2019 services agencies all across this country, Josh, we can get people jobs and we can get them jobs quickly, get them their health care...(BELL RINGS)... get them their college education. Let\u2019s lift them. They\u2019re the greatest people defending the United States of America and we need to take care of them, and we will. We will.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: Senator Rubio, go ahead?RUBIO: Well, my brother\u2019s a veteran. We\u2019re very proud of him in our family. He served as a green beret in the 7th Special Forces from 1968 through 1971. And as part of his training, he jumped out of an airplane and he lost his two front teeth.And for years, he\u2019s had to go to get these dental claims. And every times he goes to get one of these dental claims filled, the V.A. asks him, \u201cwell, how do we know you lost your teeth in the Army?\u201d And he says, \u201cwell, it\u2019s the only time I ever jumped out of a plane.\u201d(LAUGHTER) But he\u2019s had to fight through this process, and I\u2019ve watched it firsthand. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud that I worked in a bipartisan way. We passed the V.A. Accountability bill that, for the first time, allows us to fire \u2014 allows the V.A. secretary to fire someone who\u2019s not doing a good job, who\u2019s a senior executive.And the governor\u2019s right. They\u2019ve only fired three people up to now. More people will be fired if I\u2019m president. But the portability part of it is incredibly important.Veterans should be able to take their V.A. benefits to any hospital or any doctor they want to go to. When I am president of the United States, veterans will be able to take their benefits to any hospital or doctor that they choose.(APPLAUSE)MCELVEEN: Senator Rubio, thanks very much. Going to move forward now. David, Martha, back to you.MUIR: Josh, thank you. I want to turn to a family that New Hampshire voters know quite well, and Senator Cruz, the issue of hostages has been a very real and painful one here in this state.As we all know, James Foley was killed. His mother, Diane, said our government should be willing to negotiate, arguing that families should also be allowed to raise money for ransom. What would you say to Diane Foley tonight? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom for their loved ones?CRUZ: Well, look, I recognize it is an agonizing experience when anyone is facing a loved \u2014 loved member who\u2019s been kidnapped. But at the same time, putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of ransom has the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans. There is a reason it has been longstanding U.S. policy that we don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists, we don\u2019t pay ransoms.If you look at what President Obama has done over and over again, whether it was the James Bergdahl deal, which was absolutely shameful, releasing five senior Taliban terrorists to bring Bergdahl back, or whether it was this recent deal with Iran, where, again, up to 21 terrorists or potential terrorists were \u2014 were released or not prosecuted in order to bring back four Americans, what that does \u2014 does is it effectively puts a bounty on American servicemen and women serving abroad, on American tourists traveling abroad.And the proper approach...(BELL RINGS)... is a president and commander in chief that defends this country and that goes after \u2014 goes after the terrorists, rather than showing them weakness and encouraging them to target more Americans.MUIR: Senator Cruz, thank you. Mr. Trump, what would you say to Diane Foley? Should families be allowed to raise money for ransom? TRUMP: Well, I \u2014 I know Diane Foley very well. Her husband and \u2014 these are tremendous people. I spoke for them, I raised a lot of money for the foundation. I fully understand, James, one of \u2014 that was really the first that we saw, really visually saw \u2014 it was so horrible.And I will tell you, though, with all of that being said, you can not negotiate this way with terrorists. If you do, you are going to have many, many more James Foleys.James Foley was a great young man. His parents are incredible people. They\u2019ve done such a good job, since his \u2014 since his death. But you just cannot negotiate that way with terrorists, or you\u2019re gonna have so many other James Foleys.And one thing on the vets \u2014 during the last debate, I raised $6 million for the vets, and I will tell you something... (APPLAUSE)MUIR: ... I will tell you that I think nobody here, nobody on this stage, gets along with the veterans groups in New Hampshire better than I do without ball (ph) to sarel (ph) and all of the people that I deal with and these are great people.The one thing that we\u2019re not mentioning, there\u2019s tremendous fraud, waste and abuse in the Veterans Administration and if I\u2019m running things, that\u2019s going to disappear...(BELL RINGS)... and it\u2019s going to disappear quickly.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you.We want to turn now to social issues and young voters and for the question, from Mary Katherine.HAM: Thank you David.Senator Rubio. One of the lazier pieces of political conventional wisdom is that so-called social issues are hurting Republicans with young people. But on the two most prominent social issues, polling with millennials actually moves in different directions.On one hand, it is clear, young people across the political spectrum increasingly favor same sex marriage. However young voters have not moved to the left on abortion. In fact, large numbers of them favor at least some modest restrictions that conservatives have supported. How do you speak to millennials on both these issues, while Democrats will inevitable charge intolerance and extremism?RUBIO: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t believe that believing in traditional marriage the way I do makes you a bigot or a hater. It means that you believe that this institution that\u2019s been around for millenial is an important cornerstone of society. I respect people that believe differently. But I believe deeply, that marriage should be between one man and one woman.(APPLAUSE) RUBIO: On the issue of life, to me, the issue of life is not a political issue. It\u2019s a human rights issue and it\u2019s a difficult issue, because it puts in conflict two competing rights. On the one hand is the right of a woman to choose what to do with her body which is a real right.And on the other hand is the right of an unborn human child to live. And they\u2019re in conflict. And as a policy maker, I must choose which one of these two sides takes precedence. And I have chosen to err on the side of life.Here\u2019s what I find outrageous. There has been five Democratic debates. The media has not asked them a single question on abortion and on abortion, the Democrats are extremists. Why doesn\u2019t the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortion should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.Why don\u2019t they ask Hillary Clinton why she believe that partial- birth abortion, which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country, she thinks that\u2019s a fundamental right. They are the extremists...(BELL RINGS)... when it comes to the issue of abortion and I can\u2019t wait to expose them in a general election.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Governor Bush? I want to come to you. Your allies have recently attacked Senator Rubio for being too pro-life to be elected in November. You made a similar charge stating it in an interview. This is a pro-life party. Do you stand behind that criticism?BUSH: Look, I\u2019m pro-life. In fact, on this stage, I\u2019m the most pro-life person because I\u2019ve acted on it for eight years as governor of the state of Florida.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: Where we abolished partial-birth abortion, where parents have the right to be notified when their teenage child is having an abortion. We were the first state to do a choose life license plate to raise money for adoption. We were the first state to have state monies go to crisis pregnancy centers, which recently was just increased to $4 million a year.We created greater regulation on abortion clinics, where there were horrific procedures. So I\u2019m pro life, but I believe there should be exceptions: rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. And so, that belief, and my consistency on this, makes me, I think, poised to be in the right place, the sweet spot for a Republican nominee. And others may have a different view and I respect it.(APPLAUSE) BUSH: But I think we have to be cognizant of the fact there\u2019s a lot of people that are concerned about having a pro-life position without any exceptions.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: I do support protection for the life of the mother because I\u2019m pro-life. I just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. If I\u2019m president and there\u2019s a bill that\u2019s passed that saves lives but it has exceptions, I\u2019ll sign it.But I do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws. I\u2019ve already said, for me, the issue of life is not a political issue and I want to be frank. I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life.(APPLAUSE)HAM: Governor Christie. You too, have talked about Senator Rubio\u2019s position on the life issue. Some conservative activists have called this line of attack harmful to the pro-life cause.CHRISTIE: Well, I\u2019ve been pretty helpful to the pro-life cause in one of the most pro-choice states in the union. I\u2019ve stood up for the first time and now for the last six years we\u2019ve de-funded Planned Parenthood, not talked about it like they do in Washington D.C.But for six years as governor, Planned Parenthood does not receive that funding from the state budget anymore; over $50 million worth of money that\u2019s been saved now, that is not going to do exactly what Hillary Clinton wants to have done and has advocated for.She believes that organization, which engages in the systematic murder of children in the womb, in order to maximize the value of their body parts for sale on the open market, is an acceptable position.Let me tell you something, I don\u2019t care if you are a millennial or whether you are in your 90s, no one is for that type of activity, unless you are the most radical type of extremist on this issue, like Senator Clinton and her party is on this issue.CHRISTIE: I\u2019ll say one other thing. The fact is, that I believe that if a woman has been raped, that is a birth and a pregnancy that she should be able to terminate. If she is the victim of incest \u2014 this is not a woman\u2019s choice. This is a woman being violated.And the fact is that we have always has believed, as has Ronald Reagan, that we have self-defense for women who have been raped and impregnated because of it, or the subject of incest and been impregnated for it.That woman should not have to deliver that child if they believe that violation is now an act of self-defense by terminating that pregnancy.HAM: Thank you, all. Back to you, David and Martha.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mary Katherine, thank you.We\u2019re going to have closing statements here in just a moment, but before we go, quick lightning round. Come November, two battle-ground states, but they face off tomorrow in the Super Bowl.Governor Kasich, who wins?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: Carolina\u2019s going to win that one. I hate to say it. But they\u2019re going to win that one.MUIR: Governor Bush?BUSH: Peyton Manning is supporting me. And I\u2019m for Denver.(LAUGHTER)MUIR: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, I was going for Peyton Manning, but now I\u2019m rooting for Carolina.(LAUGHTER)MUIR: (inaudible) Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Carolina.CRUZ: With an eye to February 20th, Carolina.MUIR: All right, Dr. Carson?CARSON: With 100 percent certainly, I will predict the winner \u2014 it will either be Denver or Carolina.MUIR: Yeah. Governor Christie, the last word?CHRISTIE: Denver.MUIR: Denver. Thank you so much, gentlemen.Closing statements in just a moment, right here, as the ABC News Republican debate continues from New Hampshire, right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MUIR: We welcome you back. The New Hampshire primary, of course, is Tuesday, but time now for closing statements. And we begin tonight with Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, folks, I\u2019ve done now over 100 town hall meetings and I\u2019ve loved every second of it. It has been the greatest thing in the world. And I want you to know that you\u2019ve changed me, because I\u2019ve listened to your stories and I\u2019ve had your hugs and I\u2019ve seen your tears, and I\u2019ve seen you walk away and say, I now have hope.You know, I\u2019ve had a conservative message, but a positive message \u2014 not just a conservative message, but a positive message about how we can bring people together, how we can restore America\u2019s strength, lift everyone. New Hampshire, please give me a chance to carry this message forward to the United States of America. And then, I will come back. Thank you, loved it. And God bless you.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Governor Christie.CHRISTIE: Thank you. I\u2019ve spent the last 13 years of my life focused on one thing: serving the people who have given me the opportunity to serve them. Not about politics, not about partisanship, but putting the people of my state and our country first. CHRISTIE: I\u2019m proud to have rebuild my state after Hurricane Sandy, and I\u2019m incredibly proud to be on this stage tonight with these men asking for your vote.New Hampshire, I spent 70 days here with you. You\u2019ve gotten to know my heart. My heart is to help you solve the problems of your state...(BELL RINGING)CHRISTIE: ... and the problems of our nation. If you give me your vote on Tuesday I will do just that.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Governor Bush.BUSH: I want to thank the people of New Hampshire, and I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president, Ronald Reagan would have been 105 today.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: President Reagan believed in the future of our country, believed in its greatness, had a hopeful, optimistic message. Drew people towards our cause. We need someone who has a proven record to take our case to the American people because our philosophy is by far the best one. Limited government, entrepreneurial capitalism, of peace through strength. I believe I have the skills to take our party to victory in November.I ask for your support on Tuesday to keep America, and make America a safer, stronger, and freer. Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Dr. Carson.CARSON: For many months, the political class, pundits, the media, have tried to ignore or bury me. They say that politics is too complex, and too sleazy. You can\u2019t survive. Well, guess what? I\u2019m still here, and I\u2019m not going any place either.And, I believe there is still a place in our country for faith, integrity, and common sense. Hundreds of thousands of you drafted me to run for president... (BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... And, I am going to with the help of God, and you, once again place the American people at the pinnacle with the government there to serve it.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Thank you, Dr. Carson. Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you. You know, this week I had the great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I hadn\u2019t\u2019 seen them in a while, and it was great to have them alongside me, but the most important part of it is that it once again reminded me of what\u2019s at stake.Here in New Hampshire in less than 72 hours, we are literally deciding what kind of country we will be like when they are my age. What kind of country they will be able to raise their families in. And, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you for your vote. You vote for me, and we will unite this party, we will grow the conservative movement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what our parents left us. The single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.Thank you.(APPLAUSE)RADDATZ: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: You know, every candidate running for president says they will stand up to Washington. The natural follow up question is when have you ever stood up to Washington.Last week we saw a powerful illustration of that. I campaigned in the state of Iowa four-square (ph) against the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide. My two leading competitors both attacked me for it. The governor of the state said vote for anyone but Cruz, and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in attack ads, but I stood and said we should have no mandates, a level playing field, and the people of Iowa put country and our children above the cronyism and corporate welfare...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... We can turn this country around if we get back to the Constitution. And, I will always stand with the American people against the bipartisan corruption of Washington.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Thank you. Mr. Trump.TRUMP: That\u2019s because he got Ben Carson\u2019s votes, by the way, but we won\u2019t (inaudible). Our country that we love so much doesn\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win with the military, we don\u2019t\u2019 win on the border. You look at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin. Number one thing I hear from the people of New Hampshire, who I love, and developed such relationships, we don\u2019t win with healthcare. We don\u2019t win with trade.You look at what other countries are doing to us. China. Everyone, they\u2019re killing us on trade. If I\u2019m elected president, we will win, and we will win, and we will win. Thank you, thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)MUIR: Mr. Trump, thank you. Thanks to all the candidates on the stage here tonight. We thank the people of Manchester, New Hampshire for having this debate, and to everyone at home. The New Hampshire primary is Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolivian Town Drifts From President Evo Morales, Despite Promises Kept to Left", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosCOBIJA, Bolivia \u2014 When Evo Morales, Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president, took office a decade ago, he vowed to put this impoverished town in the Amazon Basin on the kind of pedestal often reserved for a capital city.He filled its coffers with profits from the country\u2019s natural gas industry. He even seized large estates and handed them to new arrivals like Tania Chao, 19, whose family received a house when it came to Cobija with nowhere to live.Yet when Mr. Morales asked Ms. Chao to vote for him last week, in a referendum to let him run for a fourth term, she did not feel that she could return the favor. The president had improved the town, she said, but he had been in office for longer than most people had lived in Cobija.Latin American leftists like Mr. Morales have suddenly felt their longevity ebb as a tide rises against them.But is the wave of discontent a rejection of the left? Or is it something more personal, aimed at the outsize leaders themselves, not necessarily at the ideas they have promoted?Much as President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the United States and Britain down a more conservative path, leaders like Mr. Morales made a commitment to diminishing inequality that is expected to remain even as governments come and go.\u201cNo leader in Latin America today can afford not to focus on inequality and go back to the neoliberal formulas of the 1990s,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy institute in Washington. \u201cWhatever criticism you might have of the leaders of the left, they put their finger on the legitimate grievance of Latin Americans: that they had been excluded from the political system.\u201dFor some of the opponents now taking power, the question is not about razing the leftist models, but about making repairs and adjustments to them. Then came the perfect storm when oil prices sank last year, creating triple-digit inflation and food shortages. In parliamentary elections, leftists were wiped out after 16 years of control. The opposition rose by criticizing government subsidies, but its plan focuses on cutting them for the wealthy and stabilizing them for the poor. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, agreed to raise the price of gasoline, reducing a subsidy seen as benefiting the car-owning wealthy. No one has suggested making changes that could harm the poor.Argentina\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, has enacted sweeping changes that have shifted the country to the center-right, including shrinking the state payroll and reducing electricity subsidies.But Mr. Macri has maintained price control strategies intended to shield people from inflation. He also extended a child benefit program that was the cornerstone of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s social policy.\u201cMacri, as well as the rest of Latin America, now understands that it\u2019s necessary to maintain and improve the social agenda,\u201d said Alejandro Grisanti, a former Latin America economist at Barclays Capital.Here in Bolivia, many point out that while Mr. Morales was blocked from running in the next election, no successor could undo his work in Cobija.This small Amazonian rubber port became a laboratory for Mr. Morales\u2019s project to bring the government to the country\u2019s poor periphery. The portion of Cobija\u2019s annual municipal budget from national gas taxes increased to $40 million today from $1.2 million in 2006, the year Mr. Morales took office, and helped underwrite a public university and a large solar plant in a place where there had been cows, jungle and dirt roads.\u201cI don\u2019t know why other governments never sent any resources here before,\u201d says Luis Adolfo Flores, the governor of Pando, the state that includes Cobija, and a member of Mr. Morales\u2019s Movement Toward Socialism party.Twenty years ago, Alipio Rodr\u00edguez Su\u00e1rez, 74, lived in an isolated patch of jungle next to a river. Now he has hundreds of new neighbors and an asphalt road with a median in front of his house.He also receives pension under a program established by Mr. Morales. He says the modest $36 a month covers his bills. \u201cI can be retired now,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents worked in the rubber industry until they died.\u201dThe population here has doubled to 47,000 in 10 years, an increase that includes many indigenous Aymara and Quechua people who relocated. Storefronts have opened with facades that reflect indigenous traditions. Government workers are now learning Cabibe\u00f1o, an Amazonian language.The elevation of indigenous culture \u2014 one of Mr. Morales\u2019s trademarks \u2014 has had a lasting effect, residents say.\u201cThe mentality of the people has changed,\u201d said Juan Carlos Arequipa, a taxi driver in Cobija. \u201cNone of us thought we would have a satellite,\u201d he said, referring to Bolivia\u2019s T\u00fapac Katari 1 satellite, built and launched by the Chinese in 2013 and named after an indigenous leader. \u201cWe have the ability to do great things.\u201dYet Mr. Shifter, of the policy institute, said that development had backfired on Mr. Morales, raising expectations in an electorate that became more critical of him, especially as his presidency dragged on.\u201cHe became a victim of his own success,\u201d Mr. Shifter said. \u201cPeople now have pride and demands.\u201dCorruption allegations surround the president. On Friday, the authorities arrested Gabriela Zapata Monta\u00f1o, with whom Mr. Morales had a child out of wedlock. Ms. Zapata, who was the director of a Chinese company that received millions in government contracts, was under investigation in connection with peddling favors, the authorities said.Similar complaints surfaced in Cobija, where the Evo Morales School sits empty, a $650,000 project that was never completed because a developer vanished after receiving government money. Only half of the first story was built, and vines are growing on the exposed rebar.On Thursday, protesters here blocked a road, demanding that the city provide water, gas and electricity to a neighborhood they had created after seizing land. Mr. Morales once supported such takeovers but had not supported these people, and they wanted to know why.\u201cWe are in the middle of a city, and we have no lights,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Estera, a 61-year-old teacher.Finally an organizer said the government had relented and would begin installing electricity.\u201cWe will have lights by 6 p.m. tomorrow,\u201d he said to cheers.The protest broke up.\u201cWe have learned from Evo how to do this, and we can use it against them,\u201d one of the demonstrators said. \u201cWhen he was a peasant, this was the strategy that he used.\u201dMaria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela, Jonathan Gilbert from Buenos Aires, and Wilsson Asturizaga from Cobija.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Referendum to Let Bolivian President Seek a Fourth Term Appears Headed for Defeat", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byTelevision exit polls showed that a slim majority of voters, in the single digits, had turned down Mr. Morales\u2019s bid to change the Constitution to allow him to run again and possibly serve as president until 2025.\u201cToday we have buried the project of converting our country into a single party, of converting our country into an authoritarian state,\u201d said Samuel Doria Medina, an opposition legislator. \u201cThis is a victory of the people over abuse.\u201dHowever, \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, Mr. Morales\u2019s vice president, said the opposition had declared a premature victory. He said that the polls showed a \u201ctechnical tie\u201d and that the final result might vary from them.If the margin holds, it will represent a sharp turn of fortunes for Mr. Morales, perhaps Latin America\u2019s most visible leftist leader and his country\u2019s first indigenous president.But 10 years in office left his popularity strained. As the referendum campaign drew to a close, Mr. Morales struggled to defend himself against a scandal involving an illegitimate child and accusations of corruption. He also faced abandonment by many members of the groups that had brought him into office, including indigenous people and coca growers.\u201cWhat we have seen is the fractures in the socialist movement,\u201d said Franklin Pareja, a Bolivian political scientist. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t imploded, but the implosion is beginning.\u201dSome of the indigenous constituents who made Mr. Morales\u2019s movement possible, however, now say the opposite.One arena of dispute is the National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu, a powerful federation of indigenous tribes that once backed the president. When its leadership began to disagree with Mr. Morales several years ago, the president created a parallel body that was friendlier to his administration.\u201cOur brother Evo can\u2019t do anything about climate change, but he always speaks about Mother Earth and does little to defend it,\u201d Mr. Huanca said.Accusations of strong-arm tactics echo in El Alto, a large, indigenous city high in the Andes. Residents there broke with the president\u2019s party last year, electing as mayor Soledad Chapet\u00f3n, who opened corruption investigations against union leaders aligned with the party.On Wednesday, a fire set by a mob at the mayor\u2019s offices destroyed documents related to the investigation and killed six people, including the lawyer heading the inquest. On Thursday, Braulio Rocha, a union leader, and Wilmer Sarzuri, a former candidate from Mr. Morales\u2019s party, were arrested in connection with the fire.Although the government has denied any connection to the killings, voters like Rita Ticona, a 32-year-old teacher in El Alto, said that the events had frightened her and that she would be voting against giving Mr. Morales a chance at a fourth term.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame for this country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe political situation has been taken advantage of to commit crimes and end lives.\u201dAs all this happened, Mr. Morales was struggling to defend himself against a sex scandal and revelations that he had fathered a child out of wedlock.Last month, Bolivian journalists reported that Mr. Morales\u2019s 29-year-old girlfriend had profited as a senior executive at a Chinese company with $500 million in state contracts.At first, Mr. Morales, who is not married, said he had ended the relationship, but photos soon surfaced of the couple embracing last year.In a related scandal, Mr. Morales said that he had fathered a child with the same girlfriend, but that after \u201cbad luck\u201d the baby died in 2007. He has not produced a death certificate.The scandals have not gone over well with voters, said Ludwig Valverde, a Bolivian political scientist. \u201cIf your son died, what father could brush this off so lightly?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a terrible image it\u2019s made, especially with women.\u201dOther misconduct accusations have dogged Mr. Morales.One fraud allegation says the fund had pledged to give an indigenous community a shipment of blackface sheep, known for their high-quality wool and meat. But during a rainy presentation ceremony, officials were chagrined when paint on the sheep\u2019s faces washed away, Professor Ayo said.\u201cIt\u2019s become a negative cycle of arrogance,\u201d Professor Ayo said.Yet for voters like Jaime Apaza Choque, a 25-year-old taxi driver, accusations of corruption will not be enough to change their minds. Mr. Choque, a father of five, said that he had managed to hold down steady work under Mr. Morales and that he would reward the president with his vote.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one to steal; the others did exactly the same,\u201d Mr. Choque said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know that what\u2019s been said is true. In the meantime, I am able to care for my family and I\u2019m good. So I support him.\u201dAn article on Feb. 22 about a vote in Bolivia on a constitutional amendment that would allow the president, Evo Morales, to run for a fourth term misstated, in some editions, the year that Soledad Chapet\u00f3n, the mayor of El Alto, an indigenous Andean city whose residents broke with the president\u2019s party in 2015, was elected the city\u2019s mayor. It was last year, not 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Many Flint Residents Are Desperate to Leave, but See No Escape", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byFLINT, Mich. \u2014 Charles White, a carpenter, sat on the couch in the living room of his small bungalow, his gaze fixed on his 5-month-old, Vaughn, nestled in a bouncy chair at his feet.Mr. White, who has lived in Flint most of his life, said that he was at his job the day before when his girlfriend, Tia, called in a panic after coming from the pediatrician. Both of their children have lead poisoning.\u201cShe spent all day crying, trying to figure out how we\u2019re going to get out of here,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to sell everything I own to get out and save my children.\u201dYet Mr. White, like many people here, says he is as good as trapped in this poisoned city.Because the drinking water flowing from their pipes is contaminated, tens of thousands of people here may have been exposed to lead and other toxic chemicals. Untold numbers of them are desperate to leave. But few see a way to pick up and move to a place where the water that flows from the taps is clean and safe.Homeowners have little hope that they will be able to sell. Renters, like Mr. White, who pays $450 a month for a three-bedroom house, worry about the costs of moving and the difficulties of picking up and starting over in a new place.\u201cIt costs money to move,\u201d said Sandra Ballard, a 62-year-old retiree who lives on the impoverished north side of Flint. She said she struggled to pay her $350-a-month rent for a three-bedroom apartment with a patched ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to put first and last month\u2019s rent down. Believe me, I wish I could get out of here.\u201dPeople in poor and crime-ridden pockets of cities like Detroit and Baltimore often share the sense of being trapped because of market forces and limited resources. But the people of Flint have a special urgency about leaving.Because of the health crisis stemming from their tainted water, they spend their days dealing with the consequences.They use bottled water for drinking, washing their hands and preparing food. In between, they shuttle children to pediatricians for blood tests, lug bottled water home from firehouses and install and change water filters on their home faucets. (Even so, city and state officials have warned that lead levels were still so high in some homes that the filters might not be strong enough to be effective.)Yet many people here see no alternative but to stay.\u201cI couldn\u2019t rent out my house now if I wanted to,\u201d said Joyce Cruz, 35, a homeowner and the mother of five. \u201cWho would want to move to Flint?\u201dMr. White said he was furious that officials did not take action to address the danger that many residents clearly saw and smelled pouring into their homes. In his neighborhood, he has endured the sight of drug sales, prostitution and other crimes. The playground where he and his girlfriend take their children is rundown. But before the lead poisoning, he still felt \u201ccontent\u201d in Flint, he said. Not anymore.\u201cAt this point, I\u2019d be willing to move anywhere,\u201d he said.Few \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs are visible on Flint\u2019s worn-down streets, but brokers said that was not because there was no interest in selling. Chris Theodoroff, the president of the East Central Association of Realtors in Michigan, said that before the water crisis, properties in Flint were still \u201ca tough sell,\u201d with houses languishing on the market and homeowners underwater on their mortgages. The median value of owner-occupied homes in Flint was only about $41,700.\u201cWe never recovered completely in the city from the economic downturn,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat this did was absolutely stop any momentum we had.\u201dJust last week, Mr. Theodoroff came close to a sale on a $25,000 house in Flint, but the buyer backed out at the last minute, citing fears over the city\u2019s water supply.Even if buyers were to be found, some are finding lenders unwilling to make loans. Bank of America and Wells Fargo both said on Thursday that they would ensure that a house had a safe water supply before lending, as they would anywhere. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be testing every house for a while, to satisfy the lenders,\u201d Mr. Theodoroff said.Timeline of the critical moments leading to the public health emergency.Flint was a city on the precipice long before its water crisis. In some respects, it resembles a miniature Detroit, marked by unemployment, blight and violent crime. Neighborhoods are pockmarked with abandoned homes, front doors missing and windows smashed. \u201cNo Metal\u201d is scrawled in spray paint across some of the empty houses, a message meant to deter thieves looking for steel or copper to sell for scrap.The auto plants that once made this a booming middle-class city have mostly closed. In 1960, nearly 200,000 people lived here; now, fewer than half that do.Then came the current catastrophe: In 2014, an emergency manager appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder oversaw the switch of the water supply from Lake Huron to the polluted Flint River, a waterway that flows through the center of town. The decision left untold numbers of residents poisoned by lead.\u201cPeople are going to stay away from Flint,\u201d said David Ellis, a retired autoworker who has lived here since 1968. He said he entertained thoughts of returning to his home state, Louisiana, but believed he would stay: \u201cIt\u2019s so bad now, it can only get better.\u201dDave Murray, a spokesman for Mr. Snyder, said that top members of his administration were working to \u201cfocus on improving the quality of life for generations to come,\u201d and that Flint would receive money and resources to aid its recovery. \u201cWe all have a common goal of helping Flint,\u201d he said in an email.Ms. Cruz said that before the water crisis, she used to tell herself that Flint was on the verge of a renaissance, that jobs and people would come back. \u201cNow that this happened, I don\u2019t think it can ever get better,\u201d she said. \u201cFlint is going to be a ghost town.\u201dBusiness owners in Flint said that it was too soon to gauge the effect of the disaster on the local economy, but that they had seen some worrisome signs. Ron Sims, an owner of the Torch Bar and Grill, a cozy spot downtown that is locally admired for its burgers, said that his business was down by 5 percent to 10 percent year over year. If Flint was in a nascent recovery before the water crisis \u2014 a previous mayor had pushed for improvements to downtown, recruiting new businesses and an indoor farmers market \u2014 now the city would be set back again.\u201cWe were already about three to five years behind Detroit,\u201d Mr. Sims said. \u201cThis will push us back another five to 10 years.\u201dAt a firehouse where residents stood in line to collect bottled water from National Guard members, Demetrius Williams, 45, said he resolved last week to move to Tulsa, Okla., where he had lived before and could find work easily. \u201cI\u2019m getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just talking to a friend of mine. He owns seven houses here and he said, \u2018If I wasn\u2019t this established, I\u2019d be out, too.\u2019\u00a0\u201dSome people have already left. LeeAnne Walters, one of the most vocal Flint residents to speak out against the water after it made her family ill, said Monday that she was living part time in Norfolk, Va., where her husband is stationed with the Navy. He went back on active duty, she said, partly to get their children away from Flint water.They have held onto their house in Flint. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody would want to buy it,\u201d she said. \u201cWho is going to want to buy a house in a city that\u2019s been contaminated by lead?\u201dEven while at their new home in Virginia, she said, the effects of the Flint water have lingered. \u201cMy kids are afraid of water,\u201d she said. \u201cIt affects you emotionally. What happened in Flint doesn\u2019t go away from you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tension Simmers as Cubans Breeze Across U.S. Border", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byLAREDO, Tex. \u2014 They are crossing the border here by the hundreds each day, approved to enter the United States in a matter of hours.Part of a fast-rising influx of Cubans, they walk out to a Laredo street and are greeted by volunteers from Cubanos en Libertad, or Cubans in Freedom, who help them arrange travel to their American destination \u2014 often Miami \u2014 and start applying for work permits and federal benefits like food stamps and Medicaid, available by law to Cubans immediately after their arrival.The friendly reception given the Cubans, an artifact of hostile relations with the Castro government, is a stark contrast with the treatment of Central American families fleeing violence in their countries. And it is creating tensions in this predominantly Mexican-American city, where residents saw how Central American migrants, who came in an influx in 2014, were detained by the Border Patrol and ordered to appear in immigration courts.\u201cThe people here are starting to feel resentment,\u201d said Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, whose congressional district includes the city. \u201cThey are asking, is it fair that the Cubans get to stay and the Central Americans are being deported?\u201dThe disparity will be in sharp relief next week when Pope Francis comes to the border at El Paso to offer prayers for the many migrants who have faced danger or arrest trying to cross the United States border.Town officials have warned Cubans not to loiter in the streets. Local bus companies complain that Cubans are chartering special vans to travel. Some residents here have also begun to speak up.A group of veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq held two protests by the border bridge in recent weeks, saying the federal government was spending money on Cubans when it was not meeting the needs of people here.\u201cWe make everyone from Central America wait in line, while the Cubans walk in even though they are not refugees,\u201d said Gabriel Lopez, a Mexican-American Navy veteran who is president of the group of veterans. \u201cWe are saying, don\u2019t open the borders to Cubans and give them instant benefits while we have American veterans living on the streets.\u201dIn coming weeks the number of Cubans is expected to spike, as more than 5,000 who have been stalled in Costa Rica since late last year will leave there on regular plane flights agreed to by governments in Central America and Mexico. Already about 12,100 Cubans entered through Laredo and other Texas border stations in the last three months of 2015, according to official figures. Border officials say as many as 48,000 Cubans could cross here this year, more than all those who came in the last two years combined.Under the Cuban Adjustment Act, a law Congress passed in 1966 in the early years of enmity with Fidel Castro, any Cuban who sets foot on American soil is given permission to enter, known as parole. Cubans are also eligible for federal welfare benefits including financial assistance for nine months under separate policies from the 1980s. After a year, they can apply for permanent residency, a gateway to citizenship.The recent exodus from Cuba began in mid-2014, even before President Obama in December of that year announced a restoration of diplomatic relations with the government, now led by Mr. Castro\u2019s brother Ra\u00fal. In a major change, President Ra\u00fal Castro allowed Cubans to leave the country without exit visas. Many Cubans have said that rumors that the special entry to the United States would be canceled had caused them to pack up and go.\u201cThe rumors are unfounded,\u201d Alan Bersin, assistant secretary of Homeland Security, said in an interview, seeking to dispel the fears. \u201cThe Cuban Adjustment Act is still in effect and is part of the overall immigration policy and there is no intent presently to change that.\u201dMr. Cuellar has called for the act to be repealed, but he acknowledges there is little prospect that Congress will act this year.Frank Longoria, assistant director of field operations for United States Customs and Border Protection, said that despite their numbers, the Cubans\u2019 entry has not affected the huge flows of people and freight trucks each day through Laredo, the country\u2019s largest land port of entry.At the border, Cubans are fingerprinted and pass through routine criminal and terrorism background checks. There is no special vetting for Cubans, and there are no medical examinations or vaccination requirements.\u201cRight now I feel like the freest Cuban in the whole world,\u201d said Rodny N\u00e1poles, 39, a coach of the Cuban national women\u2019s water polo team who crossed into Laredo this week.This week, the first direct flights from northern Costa Rica to the Mexican city just across the border brought more than 300 Cubans, including at least 41 pregnant women and their families.One of them, Yadelys Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00edn, 28, who was 19 weeks pregnant, sat down to rest and enjoy a moment of relief on the front steps of Cubanos en Libertad, right after emerging from the border station. After traveling through Ecuador and being stuck for three months in Costa Rica because of a political dispute in the region, she said she was stunned by how quickly she had been admitted into the United States.\u201cWe are not used to things happening so fast,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said.No threat of persecution or attack had driven her to leave, Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said. Like many Cubans arriving here, she left, she said, to escape a moribund economy. As a civil engineer, she was earning the equivalent of $25 a month.Others said they could no longer stand the Castro government\u2019s stifling control. \u201cI am looking for freedom of expression,\u201d said Janet Sague Gonz\u00e1lez, 27, who was seven months pregnant and clutching her new parole document. \u201cI want my child to be born in a free country.\u201dAlejandro Ruiz, a Cuban-American who left New Jersey in 2014 to found Cubanos en Libertad here, said the federal stipend and food stamps that Cubans receive during their first months had proved invaluable in giving them time to get oriented and learn English while they found jobs.But Laredo residents recall the days in 2014 when women and children from Central America, who said they were fleeing from murderous criminal gangs, were packed in frigid detention cells here and crowded the bus station after they were released carrying only orders for a date before a judge. With no blanket admission, they faced uphill battles in court to win asylum that often ended in deportation.\u201cPeople are not saying, don\u2019t let the Cubans in,\u201d said Ricardo de Anda, a lawyer and rancher in Laredo who helped mobilize aid for the Central Americans. \u201cThey are pointing out the irony of an immigration system that allows them to come in at will and causes so much hardship to others.\u201dBut at the border station, one Cuban, Milton Borges Gonz\u00e1lez, 38, knew only that he was \u201cthe happiest man on earth\u201d when his pregnant wife, Lisbeth Torres, emerged with her parole in hand. He had come before her and was living in Houston.\u201cI came to work,\u201d Mr. Borges said, \u201cand here they let you work and they pay you if you work. The United States gives us a lot of help because we are Cubans,\u201d he said. \u201cThank God for that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Due out Tuesday afternoon, the company\u2019s numbers, bolstered by sales of \u201cStar Wars\u201d-related merchandise, are expected to be spectacular. Rather, the question is whether Robert A.

Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, will speak publicly for the first time in almost two months when she testifies on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee and on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee. Ms. Yellen was last seen in mid-December explaining why the Fed planned to keep raising its benchmark interest rate in 2016.European Union authorities are expected on Wednesday to propose new rules for gas buyers aimed at curbing the bloc\u2019s dependence on Russia and Russia\u2019s energy giant Gazprom for natural gas. Weaning the bloc off Russian gas has been a priority for a decade, and European regulators are taking several approaches, including a separate antitrust case against Gazprom.Retail sales figures from the Commerce Department on Friday are expected to show tepid consumer spending for the month of January, hurt by a blizzard that shut down much of the East Coast during one of the critical post-holiday weekends. Heavy discounting by retailers desperate to get rid of inventory after a similarly slow December also points to further weakness in retail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Choices That Led Small Business Owners to Wealth", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported by\u201cI\u2019ve never made a bad decision,\u201d said William Greenblatt, chairman of SterlingBackcheck, which does employment screening. \u201cI\u2019ve just had bad results.\u201dThat confidence enabled Mr. Greenblatt, 58, to take the company, which he founded to administer lie-detector tests in 1975, when he was still a college student looking for extra money, to a global business with 3,900 employees.\u201cWe\u2019re going to do $500 million in revenue this year,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work when you\u2019re doing things at $8, $10, $12 a pop. It\u2019s an enormous operation.\u201dSmall-business owners are generally focused on the day to day, if not the minute by minute, to keep their enterprises moving forward.But they still have to make decisions to professionalize the business, put systems in place and have a plan that allows them to do longer-term planning. Those decisions can make the difference between being a small-business owner and a business executive with significant wealth.Of course, which of those decisions matter most is generally clear only in hindsight.\u201cThere is no bright-line test when a company gets to a certain size or age to do these things,\u201d said Kevin M. Harris, head of the family business group at Northern Trust. \u201cIt is based on where the company wants to go.\u201dDetermining which decisions were the ones that made the difference is sometimes not an easy task, and the stories that are retold are often the ones that turned out well. Yet it is worth considering what can go wrong.Entrepreneurs who failed to find success were often resistant to change, said David Reimer, chief executive of Merryck & Company, which uses former chief executives as coaches.\u201cThe reason tends to boil down to self-awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of C.E.O.s and entrepreneurs develop a Teflon coating in order to cope. That\u2019s not a bad thing. The bad thing is when there is no longer a distinction between your Teflon coating and who you are, and you can\u2019t take on any other input.\u201dSo from the vantage point of hindsight, what were crucial decisions for a selection of business people whose wealth was tied to the businesses they started or inherited?The decisions were generally of an operational nature, rather than part of a great innovation, these business owners said: a way of propelling their company forward and their net worth up.Boot-strapping, the term given to starting a business with an idea, passion and little else, is as much a necessity as a badge of honor for many entrepreneurs. And part of that do-everything ethos is a desire to run the business cheaply, with an awareness that lack of cash has killed many small businesses.Fourteen years ago, when Tom Bernthal got the idea for a market research firm that is today Kelton Global, he and his partner, Gareth Schweitzer, expected to crisscross the country from their base in Los Angeles. \u201cAll of a sudden we realized what we had as a business was our people, and it was all we had to sell,\u201d Mr. Bernthal said. \u201cSo we went out there and started being willing to pay for this really top-notch talent.\u201dThe firm now has 70 employees, he said. In addition to increasing the founders\u2019 overhead, that decision in 2010 to make those hires freed Mr. Bernthal, 42, and Mr. Schweitzer to focus on the higher-level projects that would expand the business.\u201cIf you don\u2019t hire those types of people, the client always wants you,\u201d he said, joking that this insight came after his 14th overnight flight for a meeting in three months.For Mr. Greenblatt, the growth of his background-checking company had been steady but slow. He credited the company\u2019s faster growth to hiring a president in 1999 to help him expand. To afford it, he was prepared to halve his own pay.\u201cI never had to take that cut because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized every single person you hire has to be amazing.\u201dBut such leaps can be daunting because they lock the entrepreneur into a higher payroll, which in many new economy businesses is the largest cost.Charles R. Barrett, president and managing direct of FZ Media Design, a digital marketing company outside Philadelphia, said he faced such a prospect in 2009. He had been doing projects for various small companies and relying mostly on freelance designers when extra work came in. But after doing a small job for CareerBuilder.com, he was given the opportunity to do a lot more work for the jobs site.\u201cIt was that first \u2018put up or shut up\u2019 moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw tremendous opportunity there. The door was open. How could I kick this door down? I needed bodies.\u201dHe took the chance and began building a full-time team, which is now eight people. It paid off. More and more jobs came in from CareerBuilder.com, including the recent introduction of the worldwide jobs portal for Hilton Hotels. He has also been able to step back and focus on the larger strategy.\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the life it\u2019s afforded me,\u201d Mr. Barrett, 48, said. \u201cWe have a nice house that I\u2019ve rebuilt and a beach house in New Jersey that my wife loves. I bought a new Mustang and a 1967 Mustang coupe that I\u2019ve completely rebuilt. You carry the stress load of everything, but it also gives you the freedom to reap the reward.\u201dMike Cagney, 45, a co-founder of Social Finance Inc., also known as SoF, an online lender focused on student loan refinancing, personal loans and mortgages, said he wanted to make the company\u2019s customer service the best it could be.When he looked into setting up a call center in Sonoma County, Calif., an hour north of San Francisco, the going wage for such work was $12 an hour. \u201cI looked at that and said there is no way I can pay $12 an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one can live on $12 an hour.\u201dHe considered the decision an investment. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the front line of your business talking to your members worrying about making rent that month,\u201d he said. \u201cI said we needed to pay people a living wage. I committed to paying $20 an hour, and some members of my board said, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 \u201dThe result has been low turnover rates for workers and high satisfaction scores from customers. The company, which started four years ago with $80 million in financing, recently raised $1 billion and is now valued at $4 billion. It has been profitable for two years.Larry Perkins, 38, applied three times for a job at Alvarez & Marsal, a top corporate restructuring firm, before he was hired in its Los Angeles office in 2006.\u201cThat was a huge achievement in my life to get the job there,\u201d he said. But 15 days into his dream job, he said, \u201cI was on a jog and I said, \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019 \u201dIt wasn\u2019t the restructuring business, which he loved, that bothered him, but the job itself. So in 2007, at 29, he decided to start his own firm. Three years later, his company was bought by another restructuring firm. A year into that arrangement, he was miserable all over again.\u201cI got into a position that is not my favorite one,\u201d he said. \u201cI was working for someone, trying to do all the right things, but at the end of it I didn\u2019t feel like I was building the thing I wanted to build.\u201dSo with five core members, he bought the firm back, a long, messy process that cost him most of the money he made on the initial sale. Since becoming independent again in 2013, the firm has grown to 20 people and business has increased sixfold, he said.\u201cThe challenges I had as a small firm were the same problems I had at a big firm,\u201d he said. \u201cA big chunk of the problem I was having was with the guy in the mirror.\u201dMr. Cagney said he had a similar revelation about his leadership skills. In his first venture, a wealth management technology firm he started in 2000, he thought he was a great chief executive.\u201cNo one left the company, which I took as an endorsement of my management style,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize there weren\u2019t any other jobs out there. Then my board sat me down and said, \u2018You\u2019re the worst C.E.O. ever.\u2019 \u201dTo his credit, he listened and came to agree with the board. So when he started SoFi, he brought in a former colleague 10 years his senior to handle management and other technical roles. \u201cIt was a great thing to do because I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI could worry about other parts of the business.\u201dNo account of wealth accumulation can ignore tales of risk-taking. But these entrepreneurs who built wealth did what could be called responsible risk-taking.For Paul Darley, 53, it was a mathematical problem: The business could not support the people in the next generation of his family if they joined the company at the same rate as his generation. So after nearly 100 years of focusing on the firefighting business, he decided that W.S. Darley & Company should expand into military contracting.\u201cThe driver was making the company big enough to support the next generation,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the defense business when we went into it, so we had to surround ourselves with good people.\u201dIt worked, though not without fits and starts. But he said he listened to advisers and was willing to modify his strategy.Blaine Vess, who 16 years ago founded StudyMode, a college note-sharing site, in his dorm room, ran it as a hobby business until 2005, he said. Then, five years after starting the company, he switched it from an advertising model to a subscription model.He was worried that it would lose customers, but almost at once its revenue spiked, going from $60,000 a year in 2004 to more than $1 million a year in 2007, with just Mr. Vess and his co-founder involved. A third partner they took on in 2008 pushed them to expand internationally. Last year, they hired a chief operating officer.\u201cWe could have kept running this thing the way we were running it even a year ago and get it to higher levels by asking more questions,\u201d Mr. Vess, 34, said. \u201cBut getting someone in who\u2019s been through it before and getting comfortable that this person is doing an awesome job and better than I could do, this has been great.\u201dFor those risks, the company has pushed its annual revenue to more than $20 million today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Skip the Upkeep and Rent the Jet, or Island, Instead", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byOwning an island is the quintessential \u201cI\u2019ve arrived\u201d declaration, but many among the well-heeled are arriving through an alternate route: They\u2019re renting.Ownership does not have the cachet it once commanded, and renting is shedding its d\u00e9class\u00e9 image. Even among the very wealthy who could easily afford to buy an island, renting simply makes more sense.And not just renting property. In other luxury categories, including exotic automobiles, designer frocks, private jets, flashy diamond jewelry, spacious villas and sleek yachts, the well-to-do are taking a cue from the broader shift to a sharing economy, epitomized by the ride-hailing service Uber, city bike programs and the peer-to-peer sharing of many goods and services.\u201cAffluent individuals are now recognizing the benefits of renting, as opposed to owning,\u201d she said, \u201cand are more open than ever to renting luxury vacation homes when they travel.\u201dMr. Vladi suggested another motivation: \u201cIf you own a property, you have to pay taxes, insurance, and manage the property. We can see it. There is a change in the market. They rent and have fun for two weeks, and then they go.\u201dBesides a budding enthusiasm for a more uncluttered lifestyle, patrons say these sharing-based services offer more convenience and choices.\u201cWhile some of our clients have owned yachts in the past, the allure of charter is that they have the freedom to choose any charter destination, anywhere in the world, selecting from a choice of different yachts,\u201d said Jeni Tidmarsh, director of Luxury Charter Group, a global company specializing in luxury yacht charters. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-strings relationship.\u201dHere are six luxury categories in which the rich are opting to rent.Many of the world\u2019s better-off choose to rent their vacation homes instead of buying for a range of reasons, including a desire to avoid burdens like maintenance and homeowner association, or HOA, fees.That is why Geoff Tracy, a Washington restaurateur, bought into Exclusive Resorts with his wife, Norah O\u2019Donnell, anchor of \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d It is \u201clike owning exquisite vacation homes all over the world without having the responsibility or the headaches that come with homeownership,\u201d he said. The starter plan costs $45,000 for 20 days over two years.\u201cI have a friend who owned a place in the Cayman Islands for years, but he got worn down with HOA fees, hurricane insurance, maintenance upkeep, etc.,\u201d Ms. Peddicord said. \u201cNow he goes to the Caymans for the month of February every year. He pays ridiculous rent for a penthouse at a Ritz-Carlton community. But when the month is over, he simply leaves and has no worries the rest of the year and no carrying costs.\u201dThen too, there are tax considerations. \u201cAnother reason not to own property can have to do with residency and taxes,\u201d Ms. Peddicord said. For \u201csomeone who has citizenship in a country where the tax system is based on residency\u201d \u2014 as it is in most European countries \u2014 \u201cit can make sense to rent to avoid becoming a tax resident.\u201d\u201cRenting vacation homes in St. Barth,\u201d she said, \u201cfits with their globe-trotting lifestyle and provides them with the flexibility needed for their superbusy schedules.\u201dRates for renting Musha Cay in the Bahamas, the 700-acre private island of the magician David Copperfield, start at $39,000 a night for a four-night minimum for up to 12 people (it can accommodate 24).A 25-hour jet card from Bloom Business Jets, for instance, allows purchase of individual flights on demand and permits selection of the specific jet type for each flight. Jet card rates range from $128,100 to $249,750, depending on the size of the jet.\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t want to own their own plane because it\u2019s a big undertaking,\u201d said Steven W. Bloom, chief executive of Bloom Business Jets, whose charter business grew around 10 percent in the last year.But for most people, chartering\u2019s benefits are clear, he said. \u201cThe convenience and time savings, you don\u2019t have a big capital outlay, you don\u2019t have to manage the plane and the crew, and you just make one call and someone shows up with an airplane.\u201dThe disadvantages of chartering are that the plane is usually different every time, and its condition may vary.Many wealthy people \u201cdon\u2019t want the hassles of owning a yacht,\u201d said Ms. Tidmarsh of Luxury Charter Group.\u201cThey\u2019ve done the figures and realize they can charter the latest and greatest superyacht for a completely unique vacation, personalized for them, with none of the ongoing expenses of ownership,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s walk-on, walk-off convenience. There are no maintenance logistics or crew to manage, no cleaning, no paperwork and no ongoing invoices and expenses for berthing and upgrades.\u201dAn upside to chartering is that experts estimate it might easily cost $1 million annually to keep a $10 million mega-yacht running. Even for well-to-do yacht owners, fixed costs for fuel and paying a captain and crew, on top of docking fees and maintenance, can be formidable.David Spencer, 38, splits his time between New York and Los Angeles for his business, Talent Resources. Although he owns a 2015 BMW 750, when he is in California he prefers to rent a black Cadillac Escalade for up to three months at a time, at around $2,500 to $3,200 a month. He does that through the Exotic Car Collection of Enterprise, the rental car company.\u201cThey know my preferences,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cWhen I get off the five-hour plane in L.A., I like it to be streamlined. I don\u2019t have to deal with insuring, storing and maintaining the car.\u201dLuxury-car rentals are growing rapidly. Enterprise has expanded its Exotic Car Collection to 31 locations in the United States and Canada, recently adding two locations in Houston and one in Washington.\u201cThis rapid growth is evidence of the strong demand we continue to see for luxury rentals,\u201d said Brice Adamson, the senior vice president at Enterprise who oversees the Exotic Car Collection.Affluent customers who own similar luxury vehicles that are in the shop for repairs are behind some of the demand, Mr. Adamson said. Other renters include those who are shopping for new high-end autos and want to rent for a few days to get a feel for the ride.The company has raised $126 million in venture capital funding from investors that include Bain Capital Ventures, Highland Capital Partners and Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond\u00e9 Nast.After six years of steady expansion online, Rent the Runway has opened retail stores in New York, Chicago, Washington and Las Vegas, which serve as distribution centers for particular regions.Four-day rentals are $30 to $800 for apparel in sizes 0 to 22. Accessory rentals run $5 to $400. Many customers are professional women making six figures, who use the \u201cdelivered to your door\u201d service.The concept is unpretentious: Customers select a dress, rent it for four days and then return it to the company in a prepaid carrying case. Want to wear a Naeem Khan dress that retails for $5,180? It rents for $800 for four days. A Jason Wu leather handbag that retails for $1,965 rents for $300.\u201cIt\u2019s about being a smart shopper,\u201d said the chief executive and co-founder, Jennifer Hyman. \u201cMany clothing items have very low utility. Over 50 percent of a woman\u2019s closet women have worn three times or less.\u201d\u201cAnd there is the emotional depreciation of your clothes,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not as exciting to wear something the third time. And with all the social media, everyone sees what you have worn.\u201dAlso, owning a dress adds work to your life, Ms. Hyman said: \u201cYou have to care for it. You have to store it and dry-clean it.\u201d\u201cThere is a feeling of euphoria,\u201d she said, \u201cto only surrounding yourself with things that you need.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rising Call to Promote STEM Education and Cut Liberal Arts Funding", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byFrustrated by soaring tuition costs, crushing student loan debt and a lack of skilled workers, particularly in science and technology, more and more states have adopted the idea of rewarding public colleges and universities for churning out students educated in fields seen as important to the economy.\u201cThere will be more incentives to electrical engineers than French literature majors, there just will,\u201d Mr. Bevin, a Republican, said after announcing his spending plan. \u201cAll the people in the world who want to study French literature can do so; they\u2019re just not going to be subsidized by the taxpayers like engineers will be, for example.\u201dDemocrats have, for the most part, avoided denouncing the humanities, but they have argued that education and training should be better aligned with the job market.But the particular focus on jobs and earnings \u2014 originally limited to vocational programs and community colleges \u2014 is gaining momentum.Education tends to be justified in terms of personal exploration and fulfillment, as well as creating informed citizens who make a functioning democracy possible. The humanities have traditionally been seen as crucial to both endeavors.\u201cThe problem is that education is now the principal determinant of earnings, and we pay no attention to it at all. That\u2019s gone too far,\u201d Mr. Carnevale said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers\u2019 regret out there.\u201dMr. Carnevale argues that there should be much more information available to students about employment and wage prospects before they choose a major so that they can make informed choices. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take away Shakespeare. We\u2019re just talking about helping people make good decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a lifelong learner if you\u2019re not a lifelong earner.\u201dA graduate with a higher-earning degree could make up to $4 million more in lifetime earnings than other college graduates, Mr. Carnevale said. Most of the top earners in the liberal arts end up matching only the bottom earners in science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2014 known as the STEM fields \u2014 and some will earn less than high school graduates who have vocational skills, like welders and mechanics.The average salary for new graduates who majored in humanities \u2014 including French literature \u2014 is projected to increase slightly from last year to $46,065, up from $45,042. Although data is more limited, these graduates seem to attract the most interest from employers in finance, insurance and real estate, the survey found. The average for social science majors is $46,585.But informing students better is one thing. Penalizing certain majors in the form of reduced funding is another.Not surprisingly, humanities professors were among the most vocal critics of Mr. Bevin\u2019s remarks. In an op-ed article last month in The Lexington Herald-Leader, Jeffrey N. Peters, who teaches French literature at the University of Kentucky, noted that Mr. Bevin graduated from the liberal arts university Washington and Lee with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Japanese and East Asian Studies after studying abroad in Japan.\u201cI would like to thank Bevin for drawing on that formative experience to remind Kentuckians during his Tuesday budget presentation that the study of world languages, literatures and cultures is a valuable pursuit that has led countless college students to successful careers in education, business, international relations, the arts and \u2014 as his own story demonstrates \u2014 public service,\u201d Mr. Peters wrote.Other critics expressed concerns about allowing government officials to pick work force winners and losers.\u201cWe are not good at predicting what jobs are going to be required in five years and 10 years down the road,\u201d said Debra Humphreys, a senior vice president at the Association of American Colleges and Universities. She worries that underfunding the humanities will not only undermine educational quality but be bad economic policy. \u201cYou run a huge risk when you say you are going to divert money from this major to that major.\u201dThe question of whether to reward colleges for turning out STEM graduates or for higher job placement rates has generated a lot of debate in Tennessee, where all of the state\u2019s higher education funding is tied to various performance measures, said Russ Deaton, the interim executive director of Tennessee\u2019s Higher Education Commission.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I trust myself to decide which degree programs or which fields deserve that premium and what that premium should be,\u201d Mr. Deaton said.\u201cA lot of the feedback we get from employers is not only about the necessity of technical skills, but the soft skills as well \u2014 the ability to think creatively, to work in groups, things that you traditionally get in the liberal arts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as STEM is valued and worthy of incentives and everything else is not.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Deals Feel the Chill From Washington", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byDeal ProfessorAs growth slows at home, more and more Chinese companies are looking to do deals in the United States. And they are increasingly running smack into the American national security apparatus.Such scrutiny will have implications for United States and China relations, as well as for mergers and acquisitions more broadly.The latest Chinese deal to feel the chill from Washington was a planned $3.78 billion investment by the Tsinghua Unisplendour Corporation of China in the American hard disk drive maker Western Digital. On Tuesday, Tsinghua said it was abandoning the purchase of a 15 percent stake in Western Digital, citing a decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the deal.What is this government body that holds such power?The committee, better known by the acronym Cfius, has a long history, going back to the Exon-Florio amendment of 1988. At that time, there were concerns about Japanese acquisitions in the United States, a fear whose legacy is several mediocre movies like \u201cRising Sun,\u201d a tale about Japanese corporate corruption, and the comedy \u201cGung Ho,\u201d which starred Michael Keaton as an executive at a car plant struggling under Japanese ownership.Since then, Cfius has grown increasingly powerful. In 2006, an uproar erupted over DP World of Dubai\u2019s acquisition of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, a British company that owned ports in the United States. Washington lawmakers from both parties attacked the deal, choosing to ignore that the United Arab Emirates is an ally of the United States. Congress again acted to give Cfius even broader reach. DP World soon sold the American P.&O. ports.Potential foreign acquirers make a filing for a national security review. In 2014, there was a record high of 147 filings, up from 97 in 2013. The increase in 2014 was mainly a result of acquisitions in manufacturing, primarily technology. The most filings were by China with 24. Next was Britain with 21, and after that was Canada with 15. (Yes, even our closest allies are subject to Cfius review.)Once a filing is made, the committee can decide to do nothing or investigate to see if the transaction poses a national security problem. In 2014, there was a record high of 51 investigations, fully a third of all filings.After an investigation, if Cfius finds that the transaction has a national security issue, it will make a recommendation to the president, who can then decide to block the deal.But Cfius rarely gets that far. There has been only one presidential action to block a transaction in the last five years. That was the 2012 acquisition of a wind farm by a Chinese company. Why would a wind farm implicate national security? Well, it was too close to a military base. Instead, what typically happens is that Cfius signals to the acquirer that it will recommend against the transaction. In that case the acquirer will withdraw the transaction to avoid the public stain of a full presidential action.This is what happened in the case of Western Digital. Similarly, Cfius has acted to block an acquisition of a gold mine by a Chinese company because it also was too close to a military base. Philips withdrew the sale of its lighting subsidiary last year under similar concerns.Some pending deals are coming into Cfius\u2019s cross hairs. The biggest is the China National Chemical Corporation\u2019s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta, a Swiss giant in farm chemicals and seeds with big operations in the United States.It may seem odd that an agriculture company would become a matter for national security, but this is all about food technology. The market is betting that Cfius is almost certainly going to require divestitures or restrictions on access of the Chinese company to Syngenta\u2019s American operations and technology.To be sure, Cfius actually approves most acquisitions, even the Chinese ones. For example, it approved the acquisition of Smithfield Foods and the battery maker A123 despite some protest.These types of national security reviews also occur in other countries, including China, and can sometimes take on an absurdist flavor. France famously stated that it would not allow the acquisition of Danone, since the yogurt maker was a national champion.But we are entering into a new phase with Chinese acquisitions. The United States\u2019 national security service, never considered a transparent process, is going to have to grapple with how far it can allow these Chinese companies to go. When is food technology important? Is a stock market really something that needs protection, particularly one that is dying?If you want to know how heated these debates can become, think about what is going on with Apple now and the controversy over whether it should be forced to unlock an iPhone. Then imagine a foreign company is substituted for Apple.Would it be better to let the money in, as we did with the Japanese, and watch them overspend and mismanage? After all, even in the best of times foreign acquisitions are difficult. And it may just be that this money and new viewpoint will make American companies better.And ultimately, there is the issue of xenophobia and commerce. These acquisitions create value for the United States. Is blocking them based on rationality, or simply on fear?Deal-making, particularly cross-border deal-making, is always hard, but it is about to get much harder over the next few years as the United States decides how vigorous its national security review process will be. This will be a debate that will primarily be about China.The Deal Professor column on Wednesday, about federal scrutiny on national security grounds of Chinese bids for American companies, misstated the reason Canada reviewed Burger King\u2019s acquisition of the coffeehouse chain Tim Hortons. It was reviewed to determine the impact on the country\u2019s economy, not for national security reasons.Advertisement"}

But this February, Britons are more fixated on a political divorce.\u201cBrexit,\u201d the shorthand term for a British exit from the European Union, is finally on the table. For many of my compatriots, the idea is not a negative one; indeed, an escape from the ever greater encroachment of the European superstate on our national sovereignty is a goal we have devoutly wished for since Prime Minister John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty back in 1992. Today, at last, we are positively giddy at the thought of freedom.The mood of the country, though, is optimistic. An amicable divorce, many consider, is better than a bad marriage. Brexit campaigners are excited by the possibilities of an independent future in the world. We believe that this vision is better not just for Britain, but also for our European allies.Brexit offers Britons more money, more control, free trade and planned immigration.We also note that many are young men, of fighting age, who appear to have abandoned their families; the recent sexual assaults on women in Cologne, Germany, by marauding groups of migrants have confirmed the fears of many in Britain. With no curbs on the free movement of migrants under Europe\u2019s Schengen Agreement, British voters expect a wave of unwanted immigration once these migrants are given asylum elsewhere in Europe. We are unwilling to close our eyes to this, and we want our borders back.The pro-European camp used to tell us that joining the euro was a good idea, and that to stay outside presaged disaster; instead, we\u2019ve seen a meltdown in Greece.

{"Headline": "A Little Reality on Immigration", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byDonald Trump built his campaign on the promise to build a wall along the Mexican border. The idea is attention-grabbing (and unworkable). But the striking thing is that it\u2019s not too far away from the current Republican orthodoxy.But times have changed. Now you prove your conservative credentials by saying you want to deport undocumented aliens. Now you prove it by opposing higher immigration flows. Now Donald Trump brings Republican crowds to their feet by bashing the supposed criminal hordes sneaking up from Mexico.The problem with this new orthodoxy is that it is completely obsolete. It\u2019s based on a view of immigration that may have reflected 1980s realities, but that has little to do with reality today.One study of 103 cities between 1994 and 2004 found that violent crime rates decreased as the concentration of immigrants increased. Numerous studies have shown that a big share of the drop in crime rates in the 1990s is a result of the surge in immigration.Trump plays up the threat of terrorism. But the real threat is that our border agencies spend so much time tracking down people who want to be gardeners that they don\u2019t have the resources to track down the people who want to be suicide bombers. Fighting terrorism by going after the whole swath of immigration policy is like fighting germs with a sledgehammer.There\u2019s a reason Republicans from Reagan to Bush supported reasonably open immigration policies. They are and have always been good for America.The way for Republicans to address these concerns, though, is not to build a wall and treat immigrants as suspicious alien invaders. It\u2019s to work on our legal immigration system \u2014 make the system ample and streamlined enough so that most people come here in the right way, in a way they can be vetted.Admit more skilled immigrants and fewer unskilled ones. This would be a giant boon to the economy over all. It would make our immigration policies less geared to serving the elites \u2014 giving them ample supplies of nannies and nail polishers. Reducing the supply of unskilled immigrants may do something to raise the wages of unskilled natives and ease their legitimate concerns.Donald Trump\u2019s G.O.P. is a rear-window party pining for a white America that is never coming back. Ronald Reagan\u2019s G.O.P., and maybe some future G.O.P., will fix the immigration system and attract the people who will make the country innovative, dynamic and interesting for decades to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Political Economy of Interest Rates Revisited", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "A few months back there was a debate over the sources of pressure on the Fed to raise rates; part of what drove that debate was the clear division between Fed insiders, like Stan Fischer, who seemed eager to raise rates, and outsiders, like Larry Summers and myself, who were strenuously against a rate hike. What was odd about that debate was that there was little if any obvious difference in economic ideology between the two sides. So what made Keynesian central bankers much more inclined to raise rates, much less receptive to the argument that risks are asymmetric \u2014 waiting a bit too long is no big deal, moving too soon can be a disaster \u2014 than their colleagues/counterparts/former students outside the system?But the collapse in banking stocks suggests strongly that negative interest rates are not compatible with our current economic institutions. The system relies on the banks, and the banks need to make money, and they struggle to do so in a negative rate environment. Should it be any surprise that the threat of global negative rates is slamming the financial sector? And surely the adverse effects don\u2019t begin precisely at zero; low rates must already put a squeeze on banks.So I think we have an explanation of rate-hike bias: it\u2019s the influence of the financial industry. At the same time, however, we also see that we\u2019re talking about influence, not complete control or anything like it. The Fed has, I\u2019d argue, been swayed by banks\u2019 interests \u2014 not by crude corruption, but by the fact of who they talk to all the time. But that influence hasn\u2019t stopped the Fed and other central banks from pursuing policies that the banks really hate in an effort to pursue their primary job, which is stabilizing the economy. At most we\u2019re talking about a tilt in policy. Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dividends, Wall Street\u2019s Battered Status Symbol", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cInvestors look at that record, and they count on it,\u201d said Douglas J. Skinner, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cAfter a while, the dividend becomes sacrosanct.\u201dCompanies hate to cut dividends because they know that such an announcement would hurt their reputation with investors. Yet in a difficult financial environment, startlingly large numbers of corporations are slashing dividends anyway. That trend is disturbing.Look at the statistics: In 2015, 394 companies trimmed dividends, according to data provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was a whopping 38 percent increase over the previous year, and it was 23 percent more than in 2008, an awful time for the stock market and for the economy.They were happy exceptions. A host of other major companies \u2014 like Alcoa, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Macy\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 decided, under considerable pressure, that it was time to capitulate. They all cut their dividends.You may recall 2009 with a shudder. The market hit bottom that March, before beginning a long climb upward. That upward trajectory has now been interrupted. And the ebb and flow of dividends is an important part of the story.The situation today isn\u2019t nearly as dire for most companies as it was in 2009, and the stock market and the economy generally appear to be much stronger. Nor are all companies cutting dividends. In fact, over all, corporate dividends rose last year and, barring a severe economic shock, they are likely to do so in 2016. So are stock buybacks, the other widely used method of returning cash to investors. But as a market indicator, a wave of dividend cuts is an indication that many companies are troubled.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re in another 2009, or that the bottom is falling out,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. But it\u2019s hard to put a positive spin on it: So many companies cutting dividends is not a good thing.\u201dPockets of pain have become more apparent, especially in the energy and commodities sectors. Battered by falling oil prices, for example, ConocoPhillips and Anadarko Petroleum announced this month that they were cutting most of their dividends. And on Thursday, Rio Tinto, the Anglo-American mining giant, said that the prospects for commodity prices remained dim \u2014 and it, too, slashed its dividend.But he warned that others wouldn\u2019t be able to do the same: \u201cIn the volatile years, especially if you look at some of the high-paying dividend stocks today, I think you\u2019re going to see quite a few companies are going to have to lower their dividends.\u201dQuite a few are likely to cut their share buybacks, too. Depending on the size of their cash hoards, companies tend to turn buybacks on and off much more rapidly than they do dividends. For example, the value of buybacks exceeded that of dividends in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index before the financial crisis, but by the second quarter of 2009, that reversed. With the return of corporate prosperity, buybacks surged and by 2015, the value of buybacks was roughly 50 percent greater than that of dividends.That is a puzzle for academics. As a fundamental economic proposition the two modes of payouts amount to the same thing, Professor Skinner said.While there may be different practical consequences, both return economic value to shareholders. Yet the reality is that investors tend to drive up the shares of companies that raise dividends and punish companies that reduce them, while reacting much less to shifts in buybacks.The explanation may come from signaling behavior. When a company can keep its dividends steady, it may be signaling that it is managed more deftly and more conservatively than its peers. At least that\u2019s often the way it\u2019s seen in the markets.By the same token, investors may see buybacks as inherently transitory, so they don\u2019t get as riled when they lose them. In any case, as a practical matter, buybacks are often a more flexible tool for corporate financial officers. Consider ExxonMobil\u2019s moves early this month. They were drawn from the classic corporate finance playbook. It said that dividends were a \u201cpriority,\u201d and unlike Conoco, it said that it would maintain them and preserve its ability to make important capital investments during the oil price downturn.Once the biggest practitioner of buybacks in the stock market, Exxon has been paring them for the last two years, and announced that it would reduce them more radically to conserve cash. Exxon\u2019s shares have actually risen slightly this month while Conoco\u2019s have fallen sharply.For investors, these corporate maneuvers are just another indication that the stock market is operating under duress. In the long run, it is the financial and earnings strength of companies that matters, not whether they are paying dividends or buying back shares. The problem, of course, is determining whether a specific company is merely being prudent by paring payouts, or whether it is revealing that its business is seriously troubled.If you have long-term investments in broad index funds, and not in individual stocks, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about particular companies, and even if dividend cuts portend market declines, you can prosper if you can endure some pain.Even with recent declines, the S.&P. 500 index has returned more than 200 percent \u2014 17.5 percent annualized \u2014 since the market bottom of March 2009. Indexes of stocks with high and stable dividends did even better. That may be because steady dividend payers are more solid. It may simply be that investors prefer dividends. We don\u2019t really know.But people who have truly relied on dividends for income may have to face a sad truth. Dividends aren\u2019t bonds, and they may be cut at a company\u2019s discretion. So love dividends if you must. Just don\u2019t count on them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hamptons Rental Season Starts Early", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byAlthough some early birds can be counted on to buck the trend, most people seeking summer rentals in the Hamptons tend to start their search around Presidents\u2019 Day weekend in mid-February, real estate agents say. But inquiries for the summer of 2016 started coming in much sooner, some as early as October and November of last year. \u201cPeople were decisive about renting a solid three months before normal,\u201d said Andrew Saunders, the president of the real estate firm Saunders & Associates, which handled more than 500 rentals in the Hamptons last year. Balmy fall temperatures, which continued off and on into December, helped jump-start the rental season, brokers said, as more New Yorkers found themselves driving out to eastern Long Island for a weekend getaway well into late fall.\u201cI think people were already out here for other reasons because the weather was so good,\u201d said Erin Keneally, an agent in the Bridgehampton office of the Corcoran Group. \u201cSo they killed two birds\u201d with one stone, she said, \u201cby looking for a summer rental and hanging out with friends.\u201dMs. Keneally said it was much easier to show homes when there is little snow or freezing temperatures, especially if their pools have not been covered yet or the outdoor furniture taken in. So far, she has doubled the number of early bookings compared with previous years, she said, without providing specific numbers. The weather was not the only factor. Anxiety over terrorist attacks in Europe made some repeat renters, especially those who work on Wall Street and keep close tabs on global news events during the trading day, nervous about spending time overseas. These travel concerns also may have helped fuel the early start, Mr. Saunders said. Many high-end homes with leases of $200,000 to $400,000 for a full season have been snatched up earlier than usual, he added. Inventory, though, remains good, with hundreds of homes available in that price category. Jonathan Davis, an agent at Compass, said he found it rather odd when a client called him in November asking for a full-season rental, which covers Memorial Day through Labor Day. The client, a hedge fund manager who is married with three children, had always rented a home in East Hampton for the month of July, and usually took off for France in August.\u201cWhen I asked my client why he was changing his usual plan, he said he was nervous about taking his family to France,\u201d especially after the November terrorist attacks in Paris, Mr. Davis said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame him; I feel nervous about going to Europe, too,\u201d he added. The client leased a five-bedroom East Hampton home for $250,000 for the full season. Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist for the Manhattan brokerage firm Convergex, said most Wall Street professionals don\u2019t take much vacation, so when they do, they try to make it count.\u201cWith parts of Europe battling all kinds of things \u2014 a weak economy, a migrant crisis and terrorist attacks \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of concern on Wall Street about security and the political climate,\u201d said Mr. Colas, who is the author of a Hamptons summer rental report that takes a look at the fortunes of those who work on Wall Street and how they affect the high-end rental market on the East End of Long Island. \u201cFrom what I sense at work and in the Hamptons, security concerns are trumping foreign exchange rates,\u201d added Mr. Colas, who has had a home in Southampton for about 20 years. He noted that when the dollar is stronger than the euro, or close to its value, as it is now, it is less expensive \u2014 and normally more attractive \u2014 for American vacationers to head to Europe. \u201cI think the fear of travel is more than anecdotal,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cPeople are concerned about getting on a plane and going to France. Not since post-9/11 have I heard so much concern about safety.\u201d The Hamptons market largely mirrors regional trends, but price increases there are also linked to the performance of Wall Street. And in the last five years, money made from deferred Wall Street bonuses that flowed into the Hamptons market was a huge factor, Mr. Colas said. After the recession, many financial institutions asked their employees to take company stock instead of cash bonuses, which they couldn\u2019t sell for a few years, dampening the Hamptons real estate market until 2011. Setting aside recent stock market volatility, this action turned out to be a windfall for those employees, because shares of bank stocks have been strong since the end of the recession, Mr. Colas said. As of Feb. 3 the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index had risen about 13 percent over the last five years. \u201cWhen Hamptons real estate, which has such a limited supply when compared to Manhattan, saw all the liquidity from money made from deferred bonuses, prices went higher,\u201d Mr. Colas said.Beate V. Moore, an associate broker in the Bridgehampton office of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said rental inquiries so far have been about the same as in previous years. But she was happy to be able to rent out a seven-bedroom home in Sagaponack last fall for $400,000 for Aug. 1 through Sept. 15. \u201cIt\u2019s an unusual rental because the home is off the water and doesn\u2019t have a tennis court,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of my high-end clients always want to upgrade from what they had the previous summer, so they start early.\u201dMarcy Bloom, a publishing executive who lives in Manhattan, is feeling the pressure to find a suitable summer rental. After looking to buy a summer home in the Hamptons for the better part of last year and not finding one to her liking, in December Ms. Bloom called the owner of her previous rental in Water Mill, N.Y., to see if she could lease it for the summer. To her dismay, the five-bedroom home had already been rented to someone else. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d Ms. Bloom said. \u201cI was absolutely in love with that house.\u201dNow, she added, \u201cI keep swinging back and forth between searching for sales and rentals, but I know I need to move quickly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rising Yen Adds to Abe\u2019s Challenges as Japan\u2019s Economy Contracts", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan began a campaign three years ago to turn around his country\u2019s economy, he took aim at areas as varied as taxes, trade and women in the workplace. The campaign, given the nickname Abenomics, relied heavily on one strategy: weakening the country\u2019s currency.Initially, it worked, as Japan\u2019s stock market soared and corporate profits rose. But now that weapon is misfiring, and Abenomics may be in trouble.Turmoil in global markets is making the yen rise in value again. That has resulted in big hits to the Japanese stock market and has raised worries among economists that Mr. Abe will not be able to deliver the economic growth his country needs to get back on track.\u201cAbenomics is in danger of falling apart,\u201d said Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.The challenge mounted on Monday, after officials said the Japanese economy \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest, after those of the United States and China \u2014 shrank more than expected in the last three months of 2015. The economy has now contracted in five of the past 12 quarters, and for all of 2015 it grew an anemic 0.4 percent. Japan will hold elections this summer, putting more pressure on Mr. Abe and his governing coalition to turn around the economy.Japanese officials say they do not manage the currency. But until recently, it was working in Mr. Abe\u2019s favor.In the eyes of many Japanese policy makers and business leaders, a weaker yen is a better yen. It makes big employers like Toyota and Panasonic more profitable by inflating the value of their overseas earnings. A weaker currency also drives up the cost of imported goods, but even that can be beneficial: It helps Japan shake off a vicious cycle of falling prices that has led to lower profits and less spending.Currency depreciation goes a long way to explaining how Toyota\u2019s profit in North America rose five times faster than its sales volume from 2012 to last year. Toyota is now on course to become the first Japanese company to earn 3 trillion yen ($26.4 billion) in operating profit this financial year.The currency windfall is a byproduct of Abenomics.The central bank, under Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor Mr. Abe appointed in 2013, has been flooding financial markets with yen by buying vast quantities of government bonds. The explicit goal of the strategy is to make it as easy as possible for people to borrow and spend.An unspoken goal, many economists says, is to weaken the yen. Three years after Mr. Abe took office, the yen had fallen against the dollar by about 40 percent.But growing worries about the global economic outlook have undone some of that weakening. Since December, the yen\u2019s value has risen about 10 percent against the dollar. Investors have flooded into the currency, which they see as a haven for their money.The shift could hurt Japanese companies that have been counting on the yen\u2019s weakness, Mr. Adachi of JPMorgan Chase said. So far, companies have been saving most of their windfalls.Toyota has more than \u00a515 trillion in so-called accumulated retained earnings, essentially the profit that a company keeps rather than distributing it to shareholders. Honda has nearly \u00a57 trillion, while Canon\u2019s exceeds \u00a53 trillion.But those savings will shrink with a more expensive yen. If it grows too strong, they are likely to start cutting costs \u2014 crimping wages and investment, which experts see as vital to helping the economy rebound.The problems are playing out in the stock market, which has been volatile of late.Last week, the Nikkei 225 stock average plunged 12 percent, as the yen strengthened to its highest level in more than a year. It was the worst performance of Japanese stocks since the depths of the global financial crisis seven years ago.Then on Monday, stocks roared back. The Nikkei gained more than 7 percent, after a reprieve in foreign equity and energy markets on Friday took some of the upward pressure off the yen.The stock surge came despite news that gross domestic product had declined at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the final quarter of last year, dragged down by anemic consumer spending and exports. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected, on average, a contraction of 0.8 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that they will push the policy rate even further into negative territory or take some other easing steps,\u201d he said.As he looks to revive the economy, Mr. Abe also faces political pressure.Japan\u2019s governing coalition must contend with an election for the upper house of Parliament this summer. Analysts and advisers say Mr. Abe has been counting on public support for his economic policies to extend the coalition\u2019s majority there. The strategy now looks less certain, though it is unclear whether Japan\u2019s weak opposition parties can capitalize on voter disappointment.Their attacks have focused mostly on Mr. Abe\u2019s hawkish security policies. On the economy, they have offered little in the way of alternatives.Government spending was one of two areas that made a positive contribution to growth last quarter, according to the economic report on Monday. The other was business investment, which increased by an unexpectedly strong 1.4 percent from the previous quarter \u2014 though that is an area that is often subject to significant recalculations in revised G.D.P. reports.Naohiko Baba, an economist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, said that the government, which is heavily indebted, could be tempted to raise spending as well as to endorse more printing of the yen by the central bank. Mr. Abe, he said, was \u201cincreasingly likely to face pressure to prepare additional fiscal stimulus ahead of the July upper house elections.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Feb. 16 about the state of the economy in Japan misstated what trends in the value of the yen might encourage Japanese companies to cut costs, wages and investments. That could be a result of a stronger yen, not a weaker one.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup to Sell Retail Units in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Citigroup announced on Friday that it would sell its retail businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, countries in which it has been trading for more than a century.Determined to quash any perceptions that the move was related to the struggling economies of these South American nations, the bank said it was streamlining its operations so it could place greater emphasis on its corporate arm, which is larger and more profitable.Just 10 percent of Citigroup\u2019s operations in the three countries involve its retail businesses, according to rough estimates at Citi Latin America. Its share of the countries\u2019 retail banking markets is less than 5 percent, while its share of their corporate banking markets is about 15 percent to 20 percent.Citigroup wants to sell the retail divisions, where local banks and competitors like Santander R\u00edo are stronger, so that it has more capital to expand corporate lending, an area that it already leads. The retail divisions include about $6 billion of assets.\u201cWe allocate our resources where they can generate the best possible returns for our shareholders,\u201d Michael L. Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s chief executive, said in statement.Argentina was the first country in which Citigroup opened a branch outside of the United States, in 1914, although it is unclear whether that branch offered retail services. The group has often drawn attention to this history in local marketing campaigns. It expanded into Brazil in 1915 and Colombia in 1916.The move fits into Citigroup\u2019s broader maneuvers to shrink its international retail banking division, according to Nicholas Watson, who monitors Latin America for Teneo Intelligence, a global advisory firm based in New York.But sweeping market-oriented economic changes by the country\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, which were intended to foster a healthy investment climate, are being viewed favorably by banks. The steps include a devaluation and the scrapping of export taxes and currency controls. Citigroup is looking to strengthen its corporate arm so it is in place to pounce on the opportunity to provide financing to a potential wave of investors and public institutions, said Juan Pablo Ronderos, an economist at Abeceb, an economic analysis firm in Buenos Aires.Citigroup has not spoken yet to potential buyers for the retail businesses and closing out a deal could take most of the year. It has 71 branches in Argentina and 71 in Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren Buffett, in Annual Letter, Rejects Candidates\u2019 Message of U.S. Decline", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported by\u201cFor 240 years it\u2019s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAmerica\u2019s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs.\u201dMr. Buffett cautioned, though, that while the \u201cpie to be shared by the next generation will be far larger than today\u2019s,\u201d the way it is divided will \u201cremain fiercely contentious.\u201d Many of the negative effects of innovation and greater efficiency tend to harm the worker, he said.He gave the example of how competition had forced his Dexter shoe operation to fold, leaving 1,600 employees in a small Maine town without work, many of whom were past the point where they could learn another trade. He said the same situation unfolded at the original New England textile plant of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway.Mr. Buffett\u2019s suggested solution: providing safety nets for those who want to work but find their talents out of favor because of market forces.\u201cThe price of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the unfortunate,\u201d he wrote.While praising 3G\u2019s method as \u201cextraordinarily successful,\u201d Mr. Buffett said that it encompassed buying companies with the intent to immediately cut costs. Berkshire, he said, also \u201ccraves efficiency,\u201d but looks for companies that are avoiding bloat, ones that are already run by efficient managers.Much smaller acquisitions were also a focus last year, when Berkshire\u2019s subsidiaries made 29 \u201cbolt-on\u201d acquisitions, costing $634 million. Mr. Buffett said that the company would make dozens more such acquisitions in future years.Berkshire Hathaway is a big insurer, meaning that changes in weather patterns that could cause catastrophes, such as hurricanes, could hurt the company.Addressing a proposal to discuss climate change at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April, Mr. Buffett wrote that it seemed \u201chighly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet.\u201d He said that because insurance policies are rewritten each year, Berkshire Hathaway should not be exposed to high losses.Mr. Buffett also defended the Clayton Homes subsidiary, whose mortgage practices have been scrutinized because they aim at lower-income homeowners. He sought to differentiate Clayton from what he said were the destructive and corrupt practices that contributed to the Great Recession of 2008.Clayton, he said, keeps all of the mortgages it originates, rather than siphon them off to banks that could structure them into new, complicated securities. Last year, however, Clayton foreclosed on 8,444 mortgages at a cost of $157 million, and paid almost $750,000 in fines and refunds to customers.By giving so much attention to Clayton Homes in the letter, Mr. Buffett was making a \u201cpre-emptive strike toward criticism there,\u201d said Cathy Seifert, an analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.Berkshire\u2019s noninsurance companies also include what Mr. Buffett called the \u201cPowerhouse Five\u201d: Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Marmon (an industrial holding company), Lubrizol (specialty chemicals), IMC (metalworking) and BNSF Railway, which together earned $13.1 billion last year.Last year, Mr. Buffett increased Berkshire\u2019s stock stakes in what he called the \u201cBig Four\u201d \u2014 American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. Berkshire\u2019s portion of the Big Four\u2019s 2015 earnings amounted to $4.7 billion, he said.\u201cWoody Allen once explained that the advantage of being a bisexual is that it doubles your chance of finding a date on Saturday night,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIn like manner \u2014 well, not exactly like manner \u2014 our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances for finding sensible uses for Berkshire\u2019s endless gusher of cash.\u201dDespite Mr. Buffett\u2019s wide array of topics in his 30-page letter \u2014 including that he has yet to use the mobile matchmaking service Tinder \u2014 there were several topics that were notably absent.At age 85, Mr. Buffett again did not identify his successor, a vital question among investors and Berkshire enthusiasts. He also did not go into great detail about the slump in commodity prices \u2014 nor the volatility in the markets \u2014 except to say how they could affect volumes at BNSF Railway and Berkshire\u2019s industrial products manufacturers.When it comes to risks, however, Mr. Buffett said there is really only one enduring danger that he cannot fix: the threat from cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States.\u201c \u2018Innovation\u2019 has its dark side,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Reaches Debt Deal With 2 Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byArgentina has offered to pay $6.5 billion to a group of hedge funds holding bonds it defaulted on 14 years ago in a historic effort by the nation to put a bitter legal battle behind it.Montreux Partners and Dart Management, two of the hedge funds, have accepted the proposal, which would pay three-quarters of a $9 billion claim on defaulted bonds, according to emailed statements from Daniel A. Pollack, a court-appointed arbiter, and Argentina\u2019s finance ministry.The news comes after a week of high-profile talks between senior Argentine government officials and principals at a group of holdout hedge funds, so named for their refusal to partake in Argentina\u2019s debt restructurings after its 2001 default and who have sought billions in bond repayments, according to a statement from Mr. Pollack.Noticeably absent from the deal on Friday was NML Capital, a hedge fund owned by the billionaire Paul E. Singer, which has led the holdouts in years of litigation. Without the agreement of all six hedge funds, Argentina will continue to be locked out of international markets and foreign investment.\u201cThe negotiations were intense, but civil, and I am pleased to report that enormous progress has been made,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.The legal fight has pitted a larger group of hedge funds against Argentina, a nation of about 43 million people. They have sought Argentina\u2019s assets around the world, at one point seizing a navy ship in Ghana as collateral. At a low point of the standoff, neither side would talk to the other.Earlier this week, Argentina struck a deal to pay $1.35 billion to another group of holdouts \u2014 Italian investors who had held onto defaulted bonds, paving the way for an agreement with some of the hedge funds. The fact that Argentina has been able to settle with some of the holdout hedge funds could apply pressure on the remaining hedge funds to resolve the dispute.The legal battle harks back to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on billions of dollars in debt. Bondholders were given two chances to exchange the defaulted bonds for new, cheaper ones over the years, but some rejected the restructurings.\u201cThis litigation has gone on for nearly 15 years, since the original Argentine default of 2001, and the proposal by Argentina is a historic breakthrough, which, if the conditions mentioned above are met, will allow Argentina to return to the global financial markets to raise much needed capital,\u201d Mr. Pollack said. He added that he hoped the other hedge funds and Argentina would be able to \u201cresolve their differences\u201d and also reach an agreement.Mauricio Macri, Argentina\u2019s newly elected president, has pledged to resolve the dispute with the hedge funds as part of a broader plan to reform his nation\u2019s economy.It is unclear how soon Argentina would complete the offer, which requires congressional approval. Argentina\u2019s Congress does not reconvene from a summer recess until March 1, although Mr. Macri has called special sessions in the Senate for Feb. 11 to expedite his appointment of Supreme Court judges and other officials.If there is significant progress between the government and creditors over the proposal in the coming days, there is a chance the offer may also be debated during these special sessions, said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm in Buenos Aires.Mr. Macri does not have a majority in either the Senate or the lower house, but he was bolstered this week when a group of lawmakers once loyal to former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a political opponent of Mr. Macri, defected from her bloc in the lower house. They have promised to be collaborative, making Mr. Macri\u2019s negotiations to pass pivotal legislation an easier task. Mr. Macri has also been maneuvering to gather cross-party support in the Senate.Dart Management could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Elliott Management, which owns NML Capital, declined to comment. Michael Straus, a principal of Montreux Partners, said he had nothing to add to the publicly issued statements of the special master and the government of Argentina.Senators respond largely to the interests of state governors. Across the political spectrum, these governors are keen to increase funding by issuing their own debt in international markets, Mr. D\u00edaz said. \u201cI believe Macri is very close to securing congressional support for the offer,\u201d he added.Twelve years ago, NML Capital sued Argentina seeking full repayment \u2014 principal and interest. In 2011, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that whenever Argentina paid one group of bondholders, it would also have to pay the holdouts.The deal with New York creditors hit rock bottom under Ms. Kirchner, after the country defaulted on its debt again in 2014, after it failed to make a $539 million interest payment on newer discounted bonds.\u201cDefault is not a mere technical condition, but rather a real and painful event that will hurt real people,\u201d Mr. Pollack said at the time, after failed attempts to get NML Capital and the administration of Ms. Kirchner to sit down together.The move left Argentina largely cut off from the international markets. Mr. Macri\u2019s pledge helped usher in new talks and raised hopes for an agreement.In addition to senior government officials, Luis Caputo, Argentina\u2019s finance secretary, traveled to Manhattan this week for the talks. It was not always apparent that a deal would emerge. To start, Mr. Macri promised to publicly announce a proposal for the hedge funds this week. But those holdouts had requested that Argentina sign a nondisclosure agreement to not to reveal the details of the negotiations publicly.Another sticking point for both sides has been just how much interest Argentina would be willing to pay to the hedge funds.Earlier this year, Argentina\u2019s economic minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, foreshadowed potential friction between the two parties. Speaking at a news conference with reporters in Buenos Aires, he estimated that the debt owed to holdout bondholders \u2014 including NML Capital and the Italian bondholders \u2014 totaled $20 billion, adding that 60 percent of that amount fell under New York jurisdiction.For holdout creditors who want Argentina to pay significantly more in interest than on the original amount of the debt owed, Mr. Prat-Gay said, \u201cYou\u2019d perhaps have to go before Christ to get a such a big return.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those props have now eroded.Mr. Sanders translates stagnant middle-class incomes and rising inequality into outrage against Wall Street \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d who prosper in a global economy under rules they\u2019ve written. His message is attractive to liberals, especially young Democrats facing large college debt and lackluster earning prospects.\u201cTonight we serve notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy,\u201d he declared in New Hampshire. \u201cWe will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top 1 percent.\u201dMr. Trump voices similar sentiments, his own wealth notwithstanding. He invokes his experience as a donor to highlight campaign finance corruption, accuses hedge fund managers of dodging taxes and joins Mr. Sanders in denouncing various industries for what he says are undeserved profits.But Mr. Trump\u2019s message, targeted toward the swelling Republican ranks of working-class whites, points more toward external threats on immigration and trade policies.\u201cWe are going to make America great again,\u201d he declared as the returns rolled in. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to do it the old-fashioned way. We\u2019re going to beat China, Japan. We\u2019re going to beat Mexico at trade. We\u2019re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s challenge will be to maintain his edge after the field of rivals narrows, allowing the large cadre of anti-Trump Republicans to coalesce their support.The hurdle facing Mr. Sanders is largely demographic. Hillary Clinton begins the next phase with a big advantage among African-American and Hispanic voters, who represent a much bigger share of the Democratic electorate than in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire.Yet regardless of how the candidates finish, their populist messages will continue to influence the White House race \u2014 and President Obama\u2019s final year in office.Mr. Trump has offered a tax-cut plan that, like those of his Republican rivals, would provide disproportionate benefits to the wealthy. But his call for higher taxes on income for hedge-fund managers and for curbs on the influence of campaign donors has lent bipartisan legitimacy to longstanding Democratic arguments. So has his support for competitive bidding to cut government health care payments to pharmaceutical companies.All four winners in the opening Iowa and New Hampshire contests \u2014 Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz \u2014 have opposed Mr. Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. That diminishes the likelihood that Congress will approve it this year.Business and political leaders backing the trade deal question how it could stall as the economy grows steadily enough to drop unemployment below 5 percent. The answer lies in the anxiety revealed by New Hampshire election exit polls: Fewer than one in five voters in both the Democratic and Republican contests believe their families are getting ahead financially.That\u2019s enough to make a voter angry.Advertisement"}

I say production possibilities yes, Edgeworth box no \u2014 which, strange to say, is how we deal with this issue in Krugman/Wells. But students who go on to major in economics should be exposed to the box \u2014 and those who go on to grad school really, really need to have seen it, and in general need more simple general-equilibrium analysis than, as far as I can tell, many of them get these days.There was, clearly, a time when economics had too many pictures. But now, I suspect, it doesn\u2019t have enough.Beyond that, pictures are often the best way to convey global insights about the economy \u2014 global in the sense of thinking about all possibilities as opposed to small changes, not as in theworldisflat. I also retain, even after all these years, a soft spot for at least some of the profusion of diagrams that characterized trade theory when I was a student.

They can do game theory, they can solve sets of equations, but their sense of how the pieces fit together is lacking, and \u2014 at least in some seminars I\u2019ve sat in on \u2014 too many don\u2019t have the technique to cut through what should be easily avoidable confusion.

Worse, it was funny, which means that it has gone viral. And it reinforced the narrative that he is nothing but an empty suit. But really, isn\u2019t everyone in his party doing pretty much the same thing, if not so conspicuously?The truth is that the whole G.O.P. seems stuck in a time loop, saying and doing the same things over and over. And unlike Bill Murray\u2019s character in the movie \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d Republicans show no sign of learning anything from experience.Think about the doctrines every Republican politician now needs to endorse, on pain of excommunication.Then there\u2019s the assertion that taxing the rich has terrible effects on economic growth, and conversely that tax cuts at the top can be counted on to produce an economic miracle.This doctrine was tested more than two decades ago, when Bill Clinton raised tax rates on high incomes; Republicans predicted disaster, but what we got was the economy\u2019s best run since the 1960s. It was tested again when George W. Bush cut taxes on the wealthy; Republicans predicted a \u201cBush boom,\u201d but actually got a lackluster expansion followed by the worst slump since the Great Depression. And it got tested a third time after President Obama won re-election, and tax rates at the top went up substantially; since then we\u2019ve gained eight million private-sector jobs.But don\u2019t all politicians spout canned answers that bear little relationship to reality? No.Like her or not, Hillary Clinton is a genuine policy wonk, who can think on her feet and clearly knows what she is talking about on many issues. Bernie Sanders is much more of a one-note candidate, but at least his signature issue \u2014 rising inequality and the effects of money on politics \u2014 reflects real concerns. When you revisit Democratic debates after what went down Saturday, it doesn\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re watching a different party, it feels as if you\u2019ve entered a different intellectual and moral universe.So how did this happen to the G.O.P.? In a direct sense, I suspect that it has a lot to do with Foxification, the way Republican primary voters live in a media bubble into which awkward facts can\u2019t penetrate. But there must be deeper causes behind the creation of that bubble.Whatever the ultimate reason, however, the point is that while Mr. Rubio did indeed make a fool of himself on Saturday, he wasn\u2019t the only person on that stage spouting canned talking points that are divorced from reality. They all were, even if the other candidates managed to avoid repeating themselves word for word.Advertisement"}

They use 10,000 gallons of paint a year. It is crazy that people repaint a bridge all year \u2026 The Golden Gate Bridge, which is orange, is the best-known and best-loved bridge in the world. It is best known because it is bold and courageous and unusual and even strange. It is best loved because it is bold and courageous and unusual and even strange.\u2014 Dave Eggers, \u201cThis Bridge Will Not Be Gray\u201dAwe.American infrastructure is deferred home maintenance on a massive scale. We just keep putting it off until something major \u2014 and often catastrophic \u2014 happens, and then it ends up costing twice as much as it would have had we taken care of it proactively. This is a bad strategy \u2014 yet it\u2019s the strategy that seems to define United States infrastructure.A century later, we\u2019ve lost our collective faith in the power of great projects like the Golden Gate, not to mention our trust in the government to fix a pothole on time and on budget, let alone create an inspiring bridge. How can we restore that faith in possibility?Let\u2019s take some inspiration from Atlanta \u2014 yes, Atlanta! \u2014 which is putting the finishing touches on the Atlanta BeltLine, one of the largest, most wide-ranging urban redevelopment programs currently underway in the United States.The BeltLine is a 22-mile loop of old railroads encircling downtown Atlanta that connects 45 neighborhoods. The project repurposes this historic rail corridor as a new transit greenway, featuring streetcars that connect to existing rail and 11 miles and counting of trails for running, walking and biking. Mostly underutilized industrial properties surround it. These are now becoming perfect sites for new mixed-use, dense projects, including 5,600 units of affordable housing.Ryan and his expanding group of partners were able to develop an unprecedented community-oriented grass-roots movement around the project, which got the attention of other elected officials, regional planners and developers. With their support, the project took on a life of its own, expanding beyond transit, trail and economic development to include new parks, affordable housing, an arboretum and more. This further empowered political leadership, who then enabled the creation of a tax increment finance district in 2005 and a new agency assigned to build it.The timing and politics were right. Atlanta, which had been losing population until the 1990s, was growing faster than any of the suburban neighborhoods. \u201cPeople saw the change coming, saw new apartments coming, saw it was bringing a better economy to the city, so they were excited about the project,\u201d says Gravel. \u201cThe BeltLine became the tool for that change. It would help protect quality of life in the face of growth. In the south or west, where there was nothing new, this was a great new source of investment.\u201cBeltLine was a compelling vision,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a trail, wasn\u2019t just a transit line. It was a catalyst. Everybody could be part of it. It tapped into the ambition that the city had for itself, that it could be a great city.\u201dThis level of enthusiasm seemed utterly foreign to me, living as I do in the Bay Area, which is having trouble coming to any agreement on how to manage growth and address change (and the success or failure of that growth has a lot to do with investing in not just new, but the right, infrastructure). Nimbyism and dissent are ascendant. Gravel\u2019s description of working together toward a common goal was enviable \u2014 so full of awe, so short on arguing.\u201cIt\u2019s an added layer of beauty to the BeltLine that it is built on railroad,\u201d Gravel says. \u201cAtlanta is a railroad town, it\u2019s why it exists. It\u2019s a loop, it ties people together across divides and there\u2019s something beautiful about it.\u201dYet engineers, planners and policy makers tend to focus on wonky stuff like percentage of parkland per person. They\u2019re awash in acronyms like V.M.T. (vehicle miles traveled), too reliant on planning terms like modeshare that don\u2019t resonate with the general public. These things may be useful in measuring the metrics of a city, but they sure don\u2019t get to the reasons people want to live there. You don\u2019t move to one city because it has 35 percent more parkland per person than another city. You move there because you fall in love with it, or with someone there, or you get a job there, or your family is from there. We need to address metrics, but the bigger goal is to make cities that we love.In an age of cost overruns, project delays, safety risks and the other, seemingly infinite obstacles to infrastructure, this all might sound awfully reductive, even na\u00efve.

The associate questioned the reported sum but said the funds were part of a business deal.The attorney general\u2019s decision shut down an investigation by Malaysia\u2019s anticorruption commission, leading the panel to seek a review of the ruling, and the country\u2019s former law minister filed suit to reverse it.The decision has not stopped international inquiries. Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States are investigating transactions involving the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. Mr. Najib set up the fund and is the chairman of its advisory board.The announcement said the Swiss were looking into several business deals between United Arab Emirates state-owned companies and 1MDB, as well as allegations involving a small oil company called PetroSaudi that carried out a joint venture with 1MDB.On Monday, Singapore said it had seized \u201ca large number of bank accounts\u201d in connection with the investigations.Opposition politicians in Malaysia have demanded that Mr. Apandi, the attorney general, prove that 1MDB was not used as Mr. Najib\u2019s political slush fund.The question for Mr. Apandi was \u201chow did he satisfy himself that, even if the funds deposited into the prime minister\u2019s personal bank accounts came from the mysterious Arab donor, the money did not originate from 1MDB?\u201d said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament from the Democratic Action Party.Mr. Apandi has said that his office will cooperate with the Swiss inquiry, though some Malaysian officials complained that the Swiss announcement could strain bilateral ties and create bias in the news media. 1MDB says that it has not been contacted by foreign legal authorities, but it would cooperate with any investigation.But if Mr. Apandi\u2019s version of events is true, that raises other troubling questions.A political donation of $681 million, equal to about 2.6 billion Malaysian ringgit, would be an exorbitant sum in Malaysian politics. An American presidential campaign costs about $1 billion. Malaysia has less than a tenth the population of the United States.Such a large donation would not necessarily be illegal. Malaysian law restricts candidates for Parliament to about $50,000 a campaign, but there are no limits on spending by political parties or curbs on overseas funding.The funds arrived in 2013, when Mr. Najib\u2019s party, which has led Malaysia since its independence from Britain in 1957, faced a powerful election challenge. What some analysts have described as an orgy of campaign spending helped the party win a tight race.Members of Mr. Najib\u2019s cabinet have previously described the funds as political donations, and at least one prominent party member has acknowledged receiving funds from Mr. Najib.\u201cBy the very fact that his party members have admitted they got a lot of money from the prime minister to run their campaigns, it\u2019s an admission that they are privy to sources of funding, which they have not disclosed,\u201d said Terence Gomez, a professor at the University of Malaya who researches money in the nation\u2019s politics. \u201cNow it\u2019s been exposed, and we find out that a foreign country is supporting the prime minister and the party.\u201dAt the same time, the attorney general suggested that Mr. Najib did not need $681 million for the election since he returned most of it. Mr. Apandi did not say how, when or to whom the money was returned, nor what Mr. Najib did with the remaining $61 million.In his news conference, the attorney general also addressed another deposit in Mr. Najib\u2019s account, about $13 million that was transferred from SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1MDB now owned by the Finance Ministry, which Mr. Najib controls. Mr. Apandi said that there was no evidence Mr. Najib \u201chad any knowledge\u201d of the deposit.Mr. Najib has not commented on the transaction.Mr. Apandi raised more questions after he briefly waved a copy of his investigative report before reporters. Cameras flashed, photographs were scrutinized, and it appeared that an additional $8 million from SRC flowed into one of Mr. Najib\u2019s accounts in 2014.Neither the attorney general nor Mr. Najib have explained that transaction.\u201cThey\u2019ve stopped caring about whether the story makes any sense,\u201d said Ambiga Sreenevasan, a lawyer and former president of the Malaysian Bar Council. \u201cThey just want the image of closure.\u201dDespite public concerns, Mr. Najib seems to have consolidated his position, last year dismissing a deputy prime minister who raised questions about the 1MDB scandal. Likewise, Mukhriz Mahathir, the son of Mr. Mahathir and a leading critic of Mr. Najib, was ousted on Wednesday as the top official of a federal state, in what he called retribution for publicly criticizing Mr. Najib.But the slowing economy, the low price of oil and a recently introduced tax on goods and services as well as the continuing 1MDB scandal have dampened broader public support, said Ibrahim Suffian, director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency in Malaysia. Mr. Najib is likely to face a tough challenge to retain his position in elections expected in 2018.Ben Hubbard contributed reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva.Advertisement"}

The stock ended the session down 4.2 percent, falling more than the broad indexes.Since late November, JPMorgan\u2019s stock price has dropped 17 percent. Many banks are trading even lower, reaching levels near those hit in 2011.JPMorgan\u2019s stock has performed better than that of most of the other large banks and JPMorgan executives insisted on Tuesday that they were optimistic about nearly all of their business lines and planned to report record profits once again this year.\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of noise out there,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, told the investors gathered at JPMorgan\u2019s Manhattan headquarters. \u201cThere are pretty good odds the noise will sort out and we\u2019ll be O.K.\u201d\u201cI look at it as just a very good long-term buy,\u201d he said on Tuesday.On Tuesday, the bank\u2019s executives were fighting against new economic data from the Conference Board showing that consumer confidence fell in February to a seven-month low.Mr. Dimon and other executives said that when they look at the bank\u2019s data, they are not seeing any sign that consumers are cutting back. Fewer consumers are having trouble paying loans, and new loans are growing.But much of the recent damage to the stock market has come from concerns over the global economy and the declining price of oil, and those were the subjects many of the analysts and investors were asking about on Tuesday.Douglas Petno, head of the JPMorgan division most involved in the energy industry \u2014 the commercial bank \u2014 said the real impact of the lower price of oil has not yet been felt on what was a booming American energy sector.\u201cI think we\u2019ve only begun to see the range of bankruptcies in oil and gas,\u201d Mr. Petno said.He and other executives said JPMorgan and most other banks had limited their overall exposure to these sorts of losses.Marianne Lake, the chief financial officer, said that by the end of this quarter, JPMorgan would have put aside $1.3 billion to cover for possible losses in the energy sector, up 60 percent from the end of 2015. The bank has $44 billion in loans to the oil and gas sector.As in recent years, the bank\u2019s profits have come, in part, from lowering its head count and expenses. On Tuesday, JPMorgan executives emphasized the investments in technology the bank is making and that should allow it to continue to reduce its staffing levels and expenses.Unlike other banks, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s Wall Street operations, Daniel Pinto, said that the bank was not cutting significantly from its bond and currency trading operations, which have been hit by new regulations.\u201cAt some point, this business will go back to growth \u2014 it\u2019s not going to be contracting forever,\u201d Mr. Pinto said.An article on Wednesday about JPMorgan Chase\u2019s efforts to reassure investors as its shares drop misstated the bank\u2019s profit expectations. It envisions profits of $30 billion a year within the next few years, not this year, and that figure is an assumption based on the trajectory of earnings, not a prediction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Officials, at Meeting, Found Economic Outlook Cloudy", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal Reserve officials threw up their hands in January, deciding that they could not decide whether market turmoil would impede domestic economic growth.\u201cMost policy makers thought that the extent to which tighter conditions would persist and what that might imply for the outlook were unclear, and they therefore judged it was premature to alter appreciably their assessment of the medium-term economic outlook,\u201d the meeting account said.It was the first time since March 2003 that the Fed declined to characterize the risks to its outlook, according to Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.The Fed is unlikely to raise its benchmark interest rate while this confusion persists, suggesting that investors are right to discount chances of a rate increase at the Fed\u2019s next meeting, in March. But according to the account, Fed officials remain optimistic that the market turmoil will not leave a lasting mark, indicating that rate increases could resume this year.\u201cLack of agreement on the balance of risks puts the committee into a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 posture,\u201d said Kevin Logan, the chief United States economist at HSBC. \u201cIn our view, it is nearly certain that the committee will not be raising the federal funds rate at the March or April meetings. It is not likely that enough time will pass before those meetings take place for the uncertainty surrounding the international economic and financial market situation to clear up.\u201dFed officials probably wish they hadn\u2019t scheduled a meeting for late January, given the convulsions in financial markets caused in part by falling oil prices and broader concerns about the health of the global economy. Officials worried that investors were tightening financial conditions, raising interest rates for riskier borrowers while plowing money into safe havens like Treasuries.And the persistent sluggishness of inflation provided one more source of uncertainty. The Fed maintains an official expectation that inflation will rise as job growth continues. Yet the continued decline of oil prices and the dollar\u2019s strength are delaying any such rebound, and some Fed officials noted worrying signs that people\u2019s expectations for future inflation also were eroding.Some officials thought the costs and benefits of the forces roiling the global economy, taken together, would have a surprisingly small effect on the domestic economy. Lower stock prices are draining wealth from households, but falling oil prices put money right back into the same pockets. Moreover, those officials continue to expect faster growth later this year.Others, however, thought tighter financial conditions already had increased risks to the economic outlook. Several Fed officials, according to the minutes, argued that \u201cwaiting for additional information regarding the underlying strength of economic activity and prospects for inflation before taking the next step to reduce policy accommodation would be prudent.\u201dEric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and one of the 10 voting members of the policy-making committee this year, said on Tuesday that recent economic developments meant the Fed should wait before raising rates again.According to the account, few officials felt confidence in their assessments. It was easy enough to leave rates unchanged, but they still had to say something. So the Fed professed honest bewilderment. \u201cMost participants indicated that it was difficult to judge at this point whether the outlook for inflation and economic growth had changed materially,\u201d the account said.Mr. Feroli of JPMorgan Chase described the minutes as downbeat, emphasizing economic risks like the impact of tighter financial conditions. \u201cThe effects of these financial developments, if they were to persist, may be roughly equivalent to those from further firming in monetary policy,\u201d the account said.Yet in keeping with the Fed\u2019s uncertain mood, the account also echoed recent comments by the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, suggesting that investors had overreacted and could reverse themselves. \u201cThe large magnitude of changes in domestic financial market conditions was difficult to reconcile with incoming information on U.S. economic developments,\u201d it said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eurozone Economy Grows, but Total Output Still Lags 2008", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byEurope is still trying to crawl back to where it was in 2008.That was the subtext of the economic data for the eurozone published on Friday.The 19-country eurozone, the core of Europe\u2019s economy, grew at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the last quarter of 2015. But total economic output remained just slightly lower than when the global economic crisis began, in 2008.And yet many of the eurozone\u2019s problems are a result of policy missteps \u2014 or policies that simply could not be executed because of the fragmented nature of a loose affiliation of 19 countries that share a currency but each have their own taxing and spending regimes.After the financial crisis, the centralized United States economy took only until the third quarter of 2011 to surpass its previous peak at the end of 2007. That was largely because the federal government quickly stepped in to clean up the commercial banks. And the central bank \u2014 the Federal Reserve \u2014 kept interest rates low and embarked on an unprecedented program of huge stimulus spending to revive the American economy.Many eurozone governments, however, responded to the crisis by cutting spending, engaging in austerity economics that thwarted growth.Along the way, the European Central Bank, under its previous president, actually raised interest rates before reversing course. Even under its current president, Mario Draghi, who came to power in late 2011, the central bank was unable to mount a stimulus program comparable to the Fed\u2019s until March of last year \u2014 as the members of the bank\u2019s Governing Council, coming from various eurozone countries, argued over when or whether to take action.Adjusting for inflation, the countries sharing the euro currency produced goods and services valued at 2.465 trillion euros, or $2.788 trillion, in the last three months of 2015. That brought the eurozone close to \u2014 but still short of \u2014 the \u20ac2.471 trillion that it produced in the first quarter of 2008.The eurozone could, finally, hit a new high during the first quarter of 2016 if it manages another quarter of growth as strong as the last quarter of 2015. But that is by no means a certainty.Even if the eurozone does recover its previous economic strength soon, the wealth will not be divided equally. A closer look at the numbers released on Friday by Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency, shows that the eurozone is divided into two kinds of countries.There are those that have recovered the lost economic ground, like Germany and Denmark.And there are those that have not recovered and are not likely to soon, like Spain, Italy and \u2014 above all \u2014 Greece. All three of these countries are substantially poorer than they were in 2008. Greece\u2019s economy is only three-quarters the size it was then.Spain has recently become the fastest-growing large country in the eurozone as it has bounced back from a banking crisis caused by a housing bubble.But Spain still has a lot of catching up to do. Spanish unemployment is still almost 21 percent, and overall economic output remains well below what it was in 2008.Pilar Caba\u00f1eros, 44, who comes from Barcelona, said she is feeling better about her own situation because she now lives in Britain, which is not in the eurozone and where the economy is doing fairly well.But in Spain, which she visits often, \u201cI don\u2019t think people are positive about the economy,\u201d Ms. Caba\u00f1eros said. \u201cDefinitely not.\u201dThe diverging fortunes of the eurozone countries have political consequences.The northern countries like Germany preach debt reduction, while the southern countries like Italy plead for more spending on public works to create jobs. The two groups have also differed on measures to prevent future crises. For example, Germany has objected to plans to create a eurozone fund that would protect depositors in the event of a banking crisis. The conflicts have threatened the unity of the eurozone.\u201cWhen economic forces diverge in what is supposed to be a common enterprise, that creates political unrest,\u201d said Thomas F. Cooley, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.Fearing a political backlash, governments have been reluctant to take steps that may cause short-term pain while helping long-term growth, like loosening rules that make it difficult for companies to hire and fire.The countries that have made changes tend to be the ones whose economies have performed the best. They include Germany, where unemployment has fallen throughout the crisis and is now at 4.5 percent. Britain, which uses the pound currency and has tried to keep its economy somewhat buffered from the eurozone\u2019s, also has a relatively low jobless rate, 5.1 percent, which is comparable to the unemployment rate in the United States.France has recovered the ground it lost since 2008 but just barely. The Socialist French government has been reluctant to take on labor unions and make changes to work rules that critics say hobble entrepreneurship.There are some positive signs in Europe. On much of the Continent, credit is cheap because of stimulus measures taken by the European Central Bank. Low fuel prices have left people with extra money they can spend on other goods and services.One of the biggest bright spots is consumer spending, which has rebounded and helped make eurozone growth better than it would otherwise be.\u201cThe interest rates on my loans have gone down, the purchasing power has gone up, there is confidence again,\u201d said Jocelyn Assor, 36, who was helping to raise funds for a French H.I.V. advocacy group outside the Les Halles shopping mall in central Paris.Experts used to argue whether the eurozone would suffer a lost decade like Japan. There are some similarities. For example, Europe and Japan both have aging populations, with more people depending on pensions and fewer young people in the work force. Both were slow to clean up their banks.Europe\u2019s demographic problems are not as severe as Japan\u2019s, Mr. Cooley of New York University pointed out. But, he asked: \u201cIs this Europe\u2019s lost decade? They\u2019re struggling with a lot of the same things.\u201dMadeleine Kruhly contributed reporting from London, and Milan Schreuer from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Saudis See Cushy Jobs Vanish Along With Nation\u2019s Oil Wealth", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 In pressed white robes and clutching crisp r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, young Saudi men packed a massive hall at a university in the capital city this month to wait in long lines to pitch themselves to employers.It was one of three job fairs in Riyadh in two weeks, and the high attendance was fueled in part by fear among the younger generation of what a future of cheap oil will mean in a country where oil is everything.For decades, the royal family has used the kingdom\u2019s immense oil wealth to lavish benefits on its people, including free education and medical care, generous energy subsidies and well-paid (and often undemanding) government jobs. No one paid taxes, and if political rights were not part of the equation, that was fine with most people.But the drop in oil prices to below $30 a barrel from more than $100 a barrel in June 2014 means that the old math no longer works. Low oil prices have knocked a chunk out of the government budget and now pose a threat to the unwritten social contract that has long underpinned life in the kingdom, the Arab world\u2019s largest economy and a key American ally.The shift is already echoing through the economy, with government projects delayed, spending limits imposed on ministries and high-level discussions about measures long considered impossible, like imposing taxes and selling shares of Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil giant that is estimated to be the world\u2019s most valuable company.For younger Saudis \u2014 70 percent of the population is under 30 \u2014 the oil shock has meant a lowering of expectations as they face the likelihood that they will have to work harder than their parents, enjoy less job security and receive fewer perks.\u201cFor the older generation, it was easier,\u201d said Abdulrahman Alkhelaifi, 20, during a break from his job at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cThey\u2019d get out of university and get a government job. Now you need an advanced degree.\u201dOf his generation, he said, \u201cThe weight is on our necks.\u201dThe oil boom over the past decade helped all of this, and was good for Saudis at home. Household incomes rose, and the number of men and women pursuing higher education multiplied. But the fat years left the economy poorly structured, economists say: 90 percent of government revenues are from oil; 70 percent of working Saudis are employed by the government; and even the private sector remains heavily dependent on government spending.Nor did advances in education create a large professional class or inculcate a culture of hard work. Most of the country\u2019s engineers and health care workers are foreign, and many government employees vacate their offices midafternoon, or earlier.But with oil revenues crashing and the numbers of young people reaching the work force growing by the day, those jobs have become harder to get as the government cuts costs and pushes Saudis toward the private sector, where job security and salaries are lower on average.\u201cThere is an issue with the sustainability of the economic model in Saudi Arabia, and the oil price can be seen as a wake-up call,\u201d said Fahad Alturki, chief economist at Jadwa Investment in Riyadh.Saudi Arabia still has room to maneuver, he said, thanks to large cash reserves, low public debt and lots of new infrastructure that can aid economic growth.But the generational differences are clear.One woman who recently earned a Ph.D. in a medicine-related field in the United States said that her father had been tracked into the military, where he got training abroad, free housing, medical care and schooling for his children. When her mother finished her degree in Arabic, she immediately got a job near her house \u2014 and a cash bonus from the state, just for graduating.Their daughter has struggled to find work, despite being better educated and fluent in English. Her husband, also educated in the United States, is also unemployed, and they live with her family.\u201cMy parents had great opportunities,\u201d she said, requesting anonymity so as not to hinder her job search. \u201cThey provided well and we had a comfortable life, so I always thought it would be the same for us.\u201dThese economic stresses come at a time of chaos in the Middle East and of generational change in the royal family.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Prince Mohammed, who is also the defense minister and second in line to the throne, has launched a costly war in Yemen and talks about radical changes to the economy, like raising fuel prices, imposing taxes on undeveloped land and some consumer goods, and privatizing state-run companies.But details on implementation are scarce, causing uncertainty over many issues like what it will cost to fill a gas tank or power a factory in five years. That has made it hard for businesses to plan for the future, which further undermines the sputtering economy.At the same time, Saudis are not accustomed to the government taking bold, fast action. Change tends to be introduced incrementally. That cultural trait is now complicating the need to move fast to meet the economic and demographic challenges.A Saudi executive in the construction industry said that change was needed, but that moving too fast could hurt businesses.\u201cIt has to be done and I am with it, but you can\u2019t change decades\u2019 worth of problems in a few years,\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his business interests. \u201cNo way.\u201dEconomists say that at least 250,000 young Saudis enter the job market every year, and that making them effective members of the work force is a major challenge.The glut of graduates was clear at the job fair, where most applicants had come from large public universities that often fail to give students the language and technical skills employers want. Most of those interviewed had never had a job before and said their fathers worked for the government. While some thought private companies offered better experience, many wanted the perks of a government job.\u201cIt\u2019s a good experience, but there is no rest and no job security,\u201d said Ali al-Ariyani, 24, who worked at a private hospital and wanted a change. \u201cThe days are long and you can\u2019t even go out to smoke.\u201dAt a separate location for women, many applicants complained that their degrees had not given them the skills, like fluency with computers, that employers want. One group of women had earned degrees in microbiology only to learn that they lacked the required licenses for hospital jobs.\u201cOur main issue is that our university did not prepare us for the job market,\u201d said Khuloud al-Khateeb, 23, adding that many hospitals preferred to hire foreigners for lower salaries.In recent years, the government has pushed for greater Saudi employment, penalizing companies with few Saudi employees. Many employers hate the program, saying it forces them to swell their payrolls with people who contribute little.Even companies that have hired lots of Saudis have often had to rely on significant social engineering to get them working.Saudis made up one-third of the crew at a Riyadh McDonald\u2019s on a recent morning, manning the drive-up window and cash register and making fries.\u201cIs this spicy?\u201d one yelled to a colleague. \u201cOne large fries, please!\u201dWhile they do the same work as foreigners, they earn much more. Salaries for foreign crew start at $320 a month, while Saudis get $1,460, part of which is subsidized by the government.The company also gives Saudis more flexibility and has created fast-track programs to move them into management.Four Saudi workers gathered in a break room said they liked their jobs but worried that they would not be as successful as their fathers, all of whom worked for the government. They knew the government had less money to employ citizens, which meant their generation would have to work harder.\u201cThe government is good, but our generation is spoiled,\u201d said Ahmed Mohammed, 21. \u201cEveryone wants a government job.\u201dHis colleagues agreed. \u201cEveryone wants to sit at home and get paid,\u201d Mr. Alkhelaifi said.Sheikha al-Dosary contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Left-of-Center Wonks Are Skeptical of Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceBernie Sanders has a problem with the liberal wonkosphere \u2014 or, more precisely, the liberal wonkosphere has a problem with Bernie Sanders.With every upward tick in Mr. Sanders\u2019s poll numbers in the last few months, there has been a corresponding rise in a very specific type of commentary: Left-of-center policy experts and former staffers for Democratic officials have questioned his plans as unwise, unrealistic or both.Behind the critiques: Mr. Sanders\u2019s advisers have often worked off assumptions that their policies would sharply increase economic growth, reduce health care costs and create other salutary effects, making the policies in question look more affordable and desirable than they would with more cautious assumptions.The former White House economic advisers find these numbers implausible. After all, a lot of policies look great and affordable if you assume they will generate incredible growth. They equate this to Republicans who argue that large tax cuts will not increase the deficit because they will unleash extraordinary economic growth.But there may be something broader going on here beyond the specific disagreements about growth assumptions, or cost savings from a single-payer health system, or how to regulate the financial system.Behind closed doors, among the left-of-center policy types who populate the congressional offices, executive agencies and think tanks of Washington, I\u2019ve seen enough eye rolls when Mr. Sanders\u2019s name comes up to suspect something more tribal is going on.The wonkosphere vs. Bernie clash is not just a story of center-left versus left-left. It is also a clash between those who have been in the trenches of trying to make public policy for the last seven years versus those who can exist in a kind of theoretical world of imagining what public policy ought to be.Suppose, for a moment, that you worked as a staff member to a Democratic member of Congress, or perhaps in the Obama administration, or in the world of academics and think tank experts advising both.Perhaps you worked countless all-nighters on the language of the Affordable Care Act or the Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 or maybe you were at an agency trying to write the thousands of pages of regulations to institute those laws, or even an advocacy group trying to nudge all of the above to the left.You know the compromises that were made back in 2010 and why \u2014 uniting 55 or 60 senators with wildly different political temperaments and local politics was really hard. You had to come up with a bill that could get a \u201cYes\u201d vote from both a centrist like Joe Lieberman or Joe Manchin and, well, a democratic socialist like Bernie Sanders.You\u2019re convinced that those laws \u2014 much hated by both conservatives and the industries they overhauled \u2014 made the United States a better place, helping millions more people afford health care and reining in the financial industry. You know the laws aren\u2019t perfect \u2014 but also believe that future presidents and Congresses should build on them, much as Social Security and Medicare are now much expanded from their original charters.Now comes a man who has had to answer only to voters in the most liberal state in the nation, who has never had the responsibility to actually pull together the disparate center-left coalition that is the Democratic Party to enact concrete legislation.When Mr. Sanders argues for scrapping Obamacare\u2019s intricately constructed mix of private health insurance with public subsidies for a single-payer government program, he\u2019s essentially saying your efforts were useless, hopelessly corrupted by the health insurance industry. Same with Mr. Sanders\u2019s call to break up the largest banks, as opposed to the current approach of just regulating them more intensively.Then, if you criticize Mr. Sanders\u2019s plans, or question their political feasibility, his supporters assail you as a member of a corrupt establishment.Mr. Sanders \u201cpresents himself as not only free of responsibility for anything that happened during his tenure, but vigorous in his insistence that nothing that was done while he was there had any value in addressing the problems that he discusses,\u201d Mr. Frank wrote.\u201cMany congressional Democrats, myself included, feel deep resentment at this wholly negative portrayal of our efforts,\u201d he added.No one would suggest that huge numbers of Democratic primary voters are taking their voting cues from former White House economists and think tank analysts. But if Mr. Sanders wins the nomination, a fascinating test for how he will govern will be whether he mends fences with left-of-center policy wonks \u2014 or views them as part of the problem of establishment thinking he is trying to overcome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Finance Leaders Meet as Economic Skies Darken", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The global economy looks shaky. Markets for things as diverse as oil and European bank shares have plumbed new lows. The tried-and-true cures no longer seem to work.The task for global leaders this week: Come up with Plan B.Finance ministers and central bank governors from the world\u2019s biggest industrialized and developing economies now arriving in Shanghai face their toughest task since the worst days of the global financial crisis. Europe is mired in low growth and Japan is teetering on the brink of recession, even though the Bank of Japan and a lengthening list of European central banks are pushing interest rates ever deeper into negative territory.China, the world\u2019s leading engine of economic growth in recent years, is struggling with heavy debts, a slowdown in manufacturing, stagnant exports and a flood of money leaving its borders. Countries that depend on selling oil and other resources are struggling under persistently low prices. The United States is facing a drag on growth as the strong dollar makes it cheaper for many consumers and companies to import goods instead of buying them from American businesses.That leaves a difficult situation for the economic policy makers of the Group of 20 nations, who will be hard-pressed to come up with solutions during their meetings in Shanghai.\u201cWhat to do about the increasing risks to the recovery is perhaps the single most important question before the finance chiefs in Shanghai,\u201d the International Monetary Fund said this week. It added: \u201cThe G-20 must plan now and proactively identify policies that could be rolled out quickly, if downside risks materialize.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.During and right after the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the Group of 20 produced broad agreements on many financial regulations, most notably a tightening of international capital standards. But in the years since, the disparate collection of economies from Argentina to the European Union has been known mostly for agreeing on generalities and making few changes, culminating in an unproductive series of meetings in Turkey last year.\u201cThe Turkish presidency of the G-20 led to no progress on any front,\u201d said Ken Courtis, a prominent international economist and fund manager.China, which holds the Group of 20 presidency this year, is one major concern. In August, China devalued its currency, the renminbi, by 4 percent with no warning, setting off sharp sell-offs in global markets. China now faces pressure to weaken the currency further as money leaves the country because of slowing growth \u2014 a prospect that could further hurt the global economic outlook.\u201cWhat we\u2019re concerned about is China. Could there be a break on China\u2019s currency that could tip the global economy into recession?\u201d said Charles Collyns, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury for international finance in the Obama administration who is now the chief economist of the Institute of International Finance.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, held a rare news conference Friday morning, frankly acknowledging that borrowing in China\u2019s corporate sector and by local governments was high.But Mr. Zhou also said that China\u2019s overall economy was still strong, and that a recent decline in the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, still the world\u2019s largest by far at $3.2 trillion, was not a cause for worry.The Shanghai stock market was up 0.4 percent late Friday morning, steadying after a plunge of 6.4 percent on Thursday..China\u2019s devaluations put pressure on rival exporters to do the same or risk losing their competitiveness. Many emerging markets, like Russia and Brazil, have allowed their currencies to fall steeply against the dollar or been forced into it, raising fears of devaluations of the sort seen in the 1930s, which led to a collapse of international trade. Countries with currencies that have stayed strong as safe havens, including the dollar and the Japanese yen, have seen growth suffer.One of the biggest question marks over the group lies in how much it might do on currencies, beyond a general call for more stable exchange rates. But Chinese officials have worked to deflate expectations that the Shanghai meeting could be a reprise of the Plaza Accord, a deal between major economies in 1985 to fix volatile currency markets.As the most prosperous communities in the United States have gotten richer since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, economic conditions in many distressed areas have deteriorated even further.A senior United States Treasury official said that he expected countries to reiterate previous commitments to manage their currencies responsibly, rather than shift their value. \u201cI see those commitments as being a strong indication from G-20 members that they will manage their currencies in ways that are globally consistent,\u201d he said.The official, who insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic considerations, said that the United States would push instead to call on countries with broadly measured surpluses on trade and royalties to stimulate domestic spending, particularly by consumers.Yet China has already stepped up infrastructure spending so much in the last decade that it is becoming harder to find projects that justify the investment. In Europe, the longstanding caution of the German government about large-scale spending has been a deterrent. In the United States, Republicans in Congress have been leery of the extra borrowing that could be needed to finance additional roads, bridges and rail lines.One question is whether China\u2019s presidency this year can make the group more productive.Except on climate change, for which it made a large commitment to slow down emissions before the Paris agreement in December, China has sought to be recognized as a leader of global diplomacy without taking responsibility for specific results. In Syria, in South Sudan, and at times even on its own border in North Korea, it has been leery of trying to dictate any resolution to longstanding international concerns.In the Group of 20, China has to cope not only with its own reluctance to take strong stands but also with the lack of a strong international consensus among the disparate nations on what the world should do to strengthen economic growth.\u201cIt\u2019s hard in the context of a G-20 communiqu\u00e9 to get really concrete initiatives,\u201d Mr. Collyns said. \u201cSo what I would expect is some kind of framework.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The European Dream: A Requiem", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorParis \u2014 Jihadist attacks, a migrant flood, Greek debt, surging nationalism: Across the European Union, anxiety and division are brewing in a way not seen since the 1940s.Confronted with this, Europe is paralyzed. And the element most dangerous to the European dream is barely noted: A rift is widening between France and Germany over how to pursue prosperity and security, their deepest national interests.If France and Germany can\u2019t work together, the dream of a united Europe will shatter. In the 1950s, that premise drove Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and President Charles de Gaulle to a historic understanding: Franco-German cooperation would be the bedrock on which to build Western Europe\u2019s revival. France would lead Europe\u2019s political reconstruction while West Germany powered its economy.It seemed logical. On the still-smoldering ruins of World War II, the two nations had comparable power, and for 30 years they worked in concert toward a Common Market, a Europe-wide visa policy and plans for a common currency.But in the 1990s, German reunification undid the balance. French influence waned as Germany\u2019s economy became a juggernaut. The French struggled with globalization, refusing to exchange their social benefits for competitive efficiency. So Germany became the primary voice within the European market.The common currency arrived, with German banks in the lead. But by 2005, France\u2019s voters had soured on surrendering more sovereignty: In a trendsetting plebiscite, soon followed by one in the Netherlands, they stopped momentum toward an all-Europe constitution. Then came the 2008 financial crash, laying bare the economic gap and political resentments between Northern Europe, driven by Germany, and the less industrious South.Even more dangerous politically, but less discussed, the crash exposed a growing gap between French and German attitudes toward each other \u2014 their labor forces, welfare policies and diplomacy. Last year, terrorism and the Middle East refugee crisis brought that, too, into focus.Now when they meet, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Chancellor Angela Merkel speak of solidarity, but in different terms. Mr. Hollande declares France \u201cat war with the Islamic State,\u201d while German leaders talk of \u201cfighting terrorism.\u201d The French take on military operations in Mali, Iraq and Syria, while Germans prefer international humanitarian operations. Germans fret that the French have become warmongers, while many French see appeasement rather than remorse when today\u2019s Germans pronounce: \u201cNever again war, never again Auschwitz.\u201dIn economics, Germany is a powerhouse of free-market liberalism, strong on austerity and scornful of budget profligacy, which Germans associate with \u201cthe Euro welfare state,\u201d a very French idea.The very definition of Euro-power is up for grabs: For the French, as they intervene in Africa and the Middle East, it is military and political. For the Germans, power is as much economic as it is political, with an eastward focus toward Russia and its neighbors.Looking ahead, the most perilous clash may be over the flood of Muslim refugees and other migrants. Last year, Germany, acting solo, invited more than a million while France took in \u2014 reluctantly \u2014 a few thousand. France wants to shut the Continent\u2019s borders, while Germany wants Turkey to help bring in more refugees \u2014 a clash not over conscience as much as competing economic imperatives. Germany requires more workers, since its native population is aging at a rate second only to Japan\u2019s. France, by contrast, lives with enormous unemployment \u2014 and a birthrate among Europe\u2019s highest.France has also recognized that its greatest social challenge is to integrate millions of Muslim French citizens into its secular society \u2014 a crisis of identity for both. That type of tension is something Germans have not worried about nearly as much. As Joschka Fischer, a former foreign minister, wrote last year in Vanity Fair, \u201cAngela Merkel governs a Germany where the sun shines every day, the dream of any politician democratically elected.\u201dUntil a few weeks ago, that is. The horrific culture clash in Cologne on New Year\u2019s Eve, between a mob of Arab immigrant men and groups of young German women whom they assaulted, was a wake-up moment for many Germans \u2014 a hint that they can\u2019t remain forever a self-confident island in a sea of increasingly insecure neighbors. Yet Ms. Merkel still clings to Germany\u2019s open door for immigrants, even though that stance now isolates her from her German constituents as well as the rest of Europe. It also prolongs Europe\u2019s inability to find a unified approach to the problem, most recently last week in Brussels at a failed summit meeting on the subject.Last fall, Ms. Merkel\u2019s signature advice for Germans was \u201cWir schaffen das\u201d \u2014 We\u2019ll make it. But now she is missing an opportunity to listen more closely to her newly traumatized citizens and to the jittery rest of Europe and invite France to narrow the gulf between them. Surely, if they tried, these two partners could find some middle ground between ignoring a threat and refusing to help innocent victims.But this has not been an auspicious time for such collaboration. Even though radical Islam, mass migrations, Russian revanchism and military interventions are challenges that no European state can meet alone, political sentiments across the Continent are all in the wrong direction. Frightened Europeans retreat into their sovereign little states, propelled by the popular right and xenophobia. In Hungary and Poland, those forces have taken power. By 2017, they may well do so in France, and Britons may have quit Europe altogether. That would leave no nation in a position to take the reins from France or Germany in leading Europe\u2019s imperfect union.So what comes next? Can we reasonably believe Europe will snap out of it? Will there be a Franco-German turnaround in shamed memory of the slaughter at Verdun 100 years ago? I don\u2019t think so.It is a matter of leadership. In the 1990s, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl, like Adenauer and De Gaulle before them, could work together, in part because they had experienced the ultimate alternative \u2014 the horrors of war. But those giants have long left the stage. There exists today neither any guiding program nor true solidarity, and historical memories have grown very short. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande are more than ever focused on their own national conundrums: for France, how to control terrorism; for Germany, how to treat refugees.What Europe\u2019s heads of state have not done, and simply must begin to do, is prepare their citizens for the one great requirement for progress toward more unity \u2014 an enormous leap of faith and optimism, even while in the grip of fear. Instead, they betray their peoples\u2019 fondest dreams by pecking at one another. And even my generation, who were 15 to 20 years old when the Berlin Wall fell, fails to stand up to them and demand that they save the dream we were promised \u2014 a Europe finally at permanent peace and working in unison after all the divisions and horrors of the 20th century.Olivier Guez is a French essayist and a screenwriter for the film \u201cThe People vs. Fritz Bauer.\u201d This essay was translated by Edward Gauvin from the French.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Securities Regulator Is Out, but Little May Change", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byUnderperforming officials in China often get shuffled to less-influential jobs or are allowed to resign quietly. Most officials who have been fired of late have been ensnared by the broad crackdown on corruption by Mr. Xi.Mr. Xi appears to be betting now that in heeding public opinion and replacing Mr. Xiao in such a high-profile fashion he can buy time to limit damage to the party\u2019s reputation from the stock market mess and the broader economic slowdown. But if the problems continue, he risks further undermining faith in his leadership and his government\u2019s ability to navigate a difficult economic transition.For decades, the party oversaw spectacular growth, buttressing its authoritarian rule and cementing China\u2019s role in the global economic hierarchy. Now growth has fallen to its slowest pace in a quarter-century and the party\u2019s failed attempts to control the markets and the currency are unnerving investors around the world. Mr. Xiao\u2019s dismissal came days before global finance ministers are to meet in Shanghai, expecting answers from China\u2019s leaders on how they will restore confidence in their ability to competently manage the economy.Replacing Mr. Xiao is only a first step to cleaning up the mess in the markets. His successor will need to follow up with swift action, to improve the functioning of China\u2019s equity markets and wean them off state intervention, without doing further damage to the economy\u201cThis will be a positive for the stock market, but the key will be the economic policies issued by the government in the next few months,\u201d said Chen Bo, an Beijing-based investor and independent political scholar. Without them, he said, the \u201cshort-term gains in the stock market in the next couple of months could be followed by another serious slump.\u201dBut Mr. Xiao\u2019s replacement, Liu Shiyu, may not necessarily offer the bold change the markets need. Mr. Liu, chairman of the Agriculture Bank of China, has little experience in equity markets.The shake-up also does little to solve the underlying problem: a government increasingly under the control of one man, President Xi, who is trying to subdue economic turbulence. It is this penchant for control, investors and analysts say, that is driving talent away from the technocratic bureaucracy and rewarding officials who fall in line.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem of a very top-down policy style that\u2019s emerging in China now,\u201d said Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the confluence of finance and politics in China. \u201cNo one dares to challenge whatever preconceived notion the top leadership has.\u201dChina has a wealth of talented financial professionals, many educated at top universities in the United States, who are now entering the prime of their careers. But unlike in the United States, where talented people rotate in and out of government, few of them may be willing to take jobs in the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China\u2019s equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission.The pay is too low and the risks are too high. Mr. Xi\u2019s anticorruption drive in recent months has focused on the financial sector and the securities regulator itself, making it a difficult environment even for officials free of graft, said Mr. Chen, the investor.\u201cThe professional makeup of the C.S.R.C. is really not even up close to that of the big brokerages,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThis problem isn\u2019t found only in the equities sector. It\u2019s much more widespread than that.\u201dMr. Liu is typical for a top financial official. He spent his career working in government committees and at the central bank.Fred Hu, the chairman of Primavera Capital Group and the former chairman of Goldman Sachs for China, called Mr. Liu a \u201chighly experienced and results-oriented financial official,\u201d but said he would \u201cfind himself in a challenging position,\u201d like his predecessor.\u201cOver and time again the regulators have struggled to meet some of the difficult tasks \u2014 modernizing securities markets, engineering rising equity prices, while protecting investors and ensuring market stability,\u201d Mr. Hu said in an email.While Mr. Liu has little experience with markets, he does have connections. In the mid-1990s, he worked the state-owned China Construction Bank. The bank, at the time, was headed by Wang Qishan, who is now overseeing the anticorruption campaign as one of seven members of the Communist Party\u2019s ruling Politburo Standing Committee.\u201cHe\u2019s definitely not a bold reformer,\u201d Mr. Shih said of Mr. Liu.The new securities chief may be in an impossible position, expected to control inherently uncontrollable markets and take the blame if the efforts fail. The push by Mr. Xi\u2019s to assert state control over the markets and the economy go against the philosophy of China\u2019s early reformers under Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who sought to give more space to the market.\u201cThe approach that they took toward the stock market is telling me that they are not willing to let go control,\u201d Yasheng Huang, a professor of political economy and international Management at M.I.T., said of China\u2019s current leaders in a December interview.One former Chinese financial official, who requested anonymity so he could freely discuss personnel issues, said Mr. Xiao, the former securities chief, might be heading to a new post to help oversee economic policy under China\u2019s cabinet. The influential magazine Caijing also reported that Mr. Xiao may be moving to a new government position.The shake-up at the securities regulator is also likely to result in renewed questions about the eventual retirement of Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of China\u2019s central bank since 2002.When Prime Minister Li Keqiang criticized the government\u2019s handling of financial markets at a meeting last Monday of the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, he cited management of the currency. The currency falls under the direct purview of the People\u2019s Bank of China.Mr. Zhou, 68, was widely revered as the man who spearheaded considerable financial deregulation. He also led the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi, to recognition by the International Monetary Fund last November as one of the world\u2019s main reserve currencies.Three years ago, said Minxin Pei, a specialist in Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College, it would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d for anyone to suggest that Mr. Zhou retire.\u201cHe would be a good scapegoat now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Aims to Strengthen North\u2019s Cities", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byLIVERPOOL, England \u2014 London churns out so much wealth that its annual economic output is equal to Saudi Arabia\u2019s. No other city in Britain comes close.It has eight times the population of the country\u2019s second-largest city, Birmingham, and 18 times that of Liverpool, which once flourished as the most important trading hub of the British Empire.Now, the British government is scrambling to link cities like Liverpool and Manchester to counteract London\u2019s ever-growing dominance and correct a growing imbalance that many say is unhealthy for Britain\u2019s economy.Under a \u201cNorthern Powerhouse\u201d plan led by George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, the government has pledged to build more roads and railways, invest in technology and research hubs, and even appeal to China\u2019s development bank for funds.The central government also passed a law last month granting cities new powers on taxes and spending, as well as the freedom to elect their own mayors.There is only one catch to these new policies: With public spending cuts initiated to reduce the national deficit, the amount of money transferred from the central government is fast dwindling. Decades-long local rejuvenation efforts in cities like Liverpool, which have attracted private investment, created jobs and stemmed a brain drain to London, are at risk of being undermined.\u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can, but the government is just hellbent on reducing funding,\u201d said Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool and a candidate for the city\u2019s first so-called metro mayor, with expanded authority over six extra boroughs.Mr. Anderson supports devolution and self-sufficiency, he said in an interview, but the government\u2019s austerity program is undermining efforts to build new businesses and retain investment. The city has lost 58 percent of public funding since 2010, he said, and next year it will no longer have extra income for discretionary projects like art fairs.\u201cWe\u2019re frustrated because we\u2019re raising new money, but we\u2019re having to spend it on social care,\u201d he said.Mr. Anderson said that the government\u2019s investment in transport, skills, jobs and culture in the south was more than 12 times what the north receives. London and the southern region have built-in advantages that make them more resilient to austerity, he said, while Liverpool is still fighting social deprivation and is less able to withstand government cuts.\u201cWe never started on a level playing field,\u201d Mr. Anderson said, and catching up with the south is going to take time. \u201cIt\u2019s not like flicking a light on.\u201dLike Mr. Anderson and Ms. Tallant, most people in Liverpool welcome the government\u2019s recent interest in the north, but say it continues to lavish attention on the south. London alone contributes 24.5 percent of Britain\u2019s economic activity, measured as gross value added, compared with just 13.3 percent for the entire north, according to the Center for Cities, an urban policy research group.The government has pledged 13 billion pounds (about $19 billion) in infrastructure spending and about \u00a3450 million worth of funding in scientific and computing research centers in and around Manchester.Mr. Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, who hopes to succeed Prime Minister David Cameron, is betting his political career on his Northern Powerhouse plan. Part of his vision is to complete a high-speed rail link connecting London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, with another possible connection between Liverpool and Hull.In spite of the grand vision, at the current pace of investments, the gap between north and south will not be closed anytime soon.Despite these headwinds, cities like Liverpool have until now made strong efforts to close that divide, and mostly, residents insist, on their own initiative.Liverpool was one of the jewels of the British Empire, its prosperity built on managing trade involving Europe, the Americas, and Britain\u2019s colonies, including slavery (Nathaniel Hawthorne was the American consul in Liverpool in the 1850s). But it went into a long decline and was considered the most deprived city in Europe in the 1980s when it was consumed with riots and rampant crime, until it picked itself up again in recent years.The city is doing everything it can to attract new people, not least by the lure of cheap rent \u2014 some houses in the derelict Kensington ward are being sold for \u00a31 each. By contrast, similar houses in Kensington, the most expensive borough in London, cost an average of about \u00a34 million.Some of the effort has paid off. Liverpool\u2019s population of around 466,000 has risen for the first time since World War II, said Paul Johnston, a spokesman for the mayor. Simon Meyer, a former Londoner and operations director of Human Recognition System, a small company that makes biometric identification machines for airports and government agencies, said that an increasing number of new employees were from London.David Pichilingi runs Liverpool Sound City, an annual music festival that is now also regularly staged in China, the United Arab Emirates and South Korea.\u201cEverything that devolves power from London is a good thing,\u201d Mr. Pichilingi said. \u201cPart of our mission is to give confidence to young people that you don\u2019t need to go to London anymore.\u201dAn article on Feb. 14 about Britain\u2019s plan to strengthen its northern cities, like Liverpool and Manchester, which are overshadowed by London\u2019s economic might, misstated the year that Liverpool became a European Capital of Culture. It was 2008, not 2012.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "MetLife Makes Its Case Against \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Label", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d label is finally having its day in court.A federal judge raised tough questions on Wednesday over regulators\u2019 decision to designate the insurer MetLife as \u201csystemically important\u201d to the financial system.Judge Rosemary Collyer focused on how a body of regulators, known as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made its decisions about companies that could harm the economy, as well as whether regulators followed their own guidelines in the MetLife case.\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out if this is a reasonable way for this process to work,\u201d she said in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.MetLife sued the government in January 2015 after regulators determined the insurer was a \u201csystemically important financial institution,\u201d or a Sifi, that could damage the entire economy in times of distress. The company is being represented by Eugene Scalia, a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and the son of Justice Antonin Scalia. He has accumulated a handful of decisive wins against the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over the last decade.While banks are subject to stricter supervision based on asset size under the Dodd-Frank reform law, regulators are empowered to look at insurers and other financial institutions based on a variety of factors, including how a firm is interconnected with other companies and the scope of existing regulation, when deciding whether it is systemically important. Designated firms are subject to stricter oversight by the Federal Reserve. The financial oversight council has also labeled Prudential Financial and the American International Group, along with General Electric\u2019s financial unit, GE Capital.Judge Collyer examined several aspects of the government\u2019s defense of the MetLife designation. She took issue, for example, with the structure of the council, asking whether it has appropriate systems in place to separately gather the evidence and analyze the numbers about possible Sifis and then fairly judge the firms.There is \u201cnobody neutral\u201d in the process, the judge said.She also raised questions about whether regulators changed their designation process for the insurer from that laid out in earlier interpretive guidance.MetLife has argued that the agency improperly imagined a situation in which the insurer was in financial distress and measured the predicted impact, as opposed to considering the probability that it would find itself on the brink of bankruptcy. The government, MetLife says, initially said it would do the latter when looking at a firm\u2019s riskiness.Regulators \u201ckeep changing the rules of the game and raising the bar so that MetLife cannot win,\u201d Mr. Scalia said in court.The judge noted that the council was focused on a need for consolidated oversight by regulators, which could make it hard for any large institution to ultimately \u201cescape\u201d designation once it is being investigated.Eric Beckenhauer, a lawyer for the Justice Department, sought to alleviate the judge\u2019s concerns, arguing that there was no mandate that regulators could not blend their functions when making a designation. He defended regulators\u2019 interpretation of the Dodd-Frank law and its own guidance document in the MetLife case.Still, despite the sharp questioning, MetLife may face an uphill fight, given the courts are often inclined to defer to the judgment of regulators.Judge Collyer, who will decide the case, noted several times that the Dodd-Frank law asked regulators to designate institutions that \u201ccould\u201d threaten the financial system, language that invites a certain amount of discretion.\u201cYou can\u2019t run away from it,\u201d because the wording is in the statute, she said, adding that it is \u201cnot a high bar.\u201dAt the same time, the designation process is already having a real-world impact on the financial industry, even as the legal challenge plays out. MetLife announced last month that it was selling a large chunk of its American life insurance business, partly in response to regulatory factors. General Electric is also divesting its financial unit to escape new rules and A.I.G. is streamlining parts of its business.MetLife is the first to take the battle over the designation process to court, but others could follow if it is successful.While those worried about \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d see this downsizing as a sign the financial reform law is working, financial industry officials argue that it is unfairly disruptive to the system. \u201cPerhaps this wasn\u2019t intended as punishment,\u201d but being labeled systemically important has \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cburdens,\u201d Mr. Scalia said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Heresy on Wall Street: Look Past the Quarter", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byDealBookMost money managers clamor for companies to provide detailed guidance on their next quarter, down to the penny \u2014 but not the world\u2019s largest investor.Laurence D. Fink, co-founder and chief executive of BlackRock, which with more than $4.6 trillion in assets under management makes it the world\u2019s largest investor, sent a letter to 500 chief executives late Monday urging them for the first time to stop providing quarterly earnings estimates.\u201cToday\u2019s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria is totally contrary to the long-term approach we need,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote.The proposal, a provocative recommendation from the influential Wall Street executive, is aimed at trying to curb companies\u2019 short-term focus on quarterly results.\u201cTo be clear, we do believe companies should still report quarterly results \u2014 long-termism should not be a substitute for transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cBut C.E.O.s should be more focused in these reports on demonstrating progress against their strategic plans than a one-penny deviation from their E.P.S. targets or analyst consensus estimates.\u201d (E.P.S. stands for earnings per share.) Mr. Fink has made a series of proposals over the last several years to encourage longer-term thinking by companies, including a plan to change the tax code and the treatment of capital gains. But his latest proposition goes further than his previous efforts. Mr. Fink, co-founder and chief executive of BlackRock, sent a letter to 500 chief executives urging them to stop providing quarterly earnings estimates, as a way to curb the focus on short-term results.While Mr. Fink wants to eliminate quarterly guidance, he is also making perhaps an even more controversial request, asking chief executives and company boards to provide a \u201ca strategic framework for long-term value creation\u201d that could extend to multiple years. In other words, a company should give shareholders a detailed long-term plan for its business.\u201cAnnual shareholder letters and other communications to shareholders are too often backwards-looking and don\u2019t do enough to articulate management\u2019s vision and plans for the future,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote. Without management providing a road map for the next few years, he said, \u201csome short-term investors (and analysts) offer more compelling visions for companies than the companies themselves, allowing these perspectives to fill the void and build support for potentially destabilizing actions.\u201dActivist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to return money to shareholders or buy back shares. Last year through the end of the third quarter, according to Mr. Fink, buybacks skyrocketed 27 percent over the previous year, which itself had been a record. Companies that buy back shares reduce the amount of stock they have outstanding, a move that can have the effect of increasing earnings per share and the stakes of existing shareholders. Mr. Fink\u2019s call comes at a time of stepped-up chatter among big investors and other business leaders to try to encourage companies and investors to be less focused on short-term efforts to lift earnings. Critics of buybacks question whether the purchases are a productive use of profits, rather than investing in their businesses and creating jobs. BlackRock, along with other mutual fund giants like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price, recently held a meeting with Warren E. Buffett at the invitation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to devise a series of voluntary standards that companies should adopt, according to people briefed on the meetings. Another meeting is planned for next month. The discussion of short-termism on Wall Street has also become part of the presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton made a policy speech last year that endorsed many of the ideas Mr. Fink had raised. There has long been speculation that Mr. Fink could eventually land a senior government post in Washington.In an interview, Mr. Fink said he wrote this letter now to get ahead of proxy season, a period during the spring when many companies hold their annual meetings and vote on shareholder resolutions. He hopes to influence how chief executives discuss their companies\u2019 performance and goals in their annual letters to shareholders.Of course, some companies in fast-moving businesses like technology might argue that it is impossible to present a multiyear road map without telegraphing plans to rivals.Mr. Fink dismissed that possibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think a public discourse on how a company\u2019s C.E.O. sees their position is going to result in proprietary secrets being revealed.\u201dInvestors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.He doesn\u2019t want to put all of the responsibility on the chief executive. His letter presses company boards to publicly affirm the chief executive\u2019s long-term plan. All too often, there is a disconnect between the vision of a chief executive and the board, especially when things go wrong.Of course, the other challenge with a company offering a long-term vision is not only meeting its goals, but also changing them if the market or economy change. Mr. Fink said he appreciated that argument, but contended that boards that lay out multiyear plans won\u2019t feel locked into them.\u201cGiven the right context, long-term shareholders will understand, and even expect, that you will need to pivot in response to the changing environments you are navigating,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote. \u201cBut one reason for investors\u2019 short-term horizons is that companies have not sufficiently educated them about the ecosystems they are operating in.\u201dThat may be true, but it is admittedly difficult for executives to reverse course without worrying about losing face.Mr. Fink is also pushing for companies to consider environmental, social and governance issues \u201cranging from climate change to diversity to board effectiveness.\u201d These issues have long been an afterthought for most companies, and in particular, for investors, who have simply sought companies that deliver the highest returns.\u201cThese issues offer both risks and opportunities, but for too long, companies have not considered them core to their business \u2014 even when the world\u2019s political leaders are increasingly focused on them, as demonstrated by the Paris climate accord,\u201d Mr. Fink wrote. Finally, Mr. Fink suggests that business actually needs to take on a greater responsibility in pushing for change in Washington. He says that tax policy needs to be reformed and investment in infrastructure must become a priority. If the government fails to invest in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, it \u201cwill not only cost businesses and consumers $1.8 trillion over the next five years, but clearly represents a threat to the ability of companies to grow.\u201dHe says he believes that corporate America needs help from Washington to shift to a more long-term focus. \u201cWe recognize that the culture of short-term results is not something that can be solved by C.E.O.s and their boards alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He asked Mexicans to turn their nation into \u201ca land of opportunities, where there will be no need to emigrate in order to dream, no need to be exploited in order to work, no need to make the despair and poverty of many the opportunism of a few, a land that will not have to mourn men and women, young people and children who are destroyed at the hands of the dealers of death.\u201d\u201cThey take advantage of us with lies, while they sell the country bit by bit,\u201d said Valdomero Guzm\u00e1n Peros, 60, a resident of Ecatepec who rode his bicycle to the Mass, describing the government. \u201cWe are all hoping that the pope will bring a message to the powerful of our country that they must work for both the rich and the poor.\u201dThe Mass marked the beginning of Francis\u2019s tour of the Mexican peripheries, touching down in locales his predecessors largely skipped before his planned departure on Wednesday evening. Among other places, he will go to the southern border to meet with Mexico\u2019s indigenous people, and to the north to address immigration.In Ecatepec, violence by organized crime is on the rise even as chunks of the city are being transformed into luxurious shopping centers well out of reach of its residents. During his years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis dedicated much time to working in slums that had many of the same problems. While not the poorest of the cities and towns surrounding the capital, Ecatepec, population 1.7 million, is home to the largest number of people without access to health care and social services in the State of Mexico.\u201cEcatepec gathers victims at the economic and urban level,\u201d said Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst in Mexico, \u201ca place that symbolizes the devastation of the quality of life of most of its population. It is also a symptom of the way in which organized crime is slowly penetrating Mexico\u2019s biggest cities and how this has resulted in a spike of murder rates, kidnapping and extortions.\u201dThe crowds pulsed with energy early Sunday, walking miles down closed highways from across the region to attend. For the Mass, officials designated a giant open field, which had been covered in gravel and outfitted with more than 30 giant television screens and towering speakers to pump out the pontiff\u2019s message. Families gathered in the heat, using blankets strung up on the fencing for shade.In his homily, Francis warned against the \u201cthree temptations\u201d of wealth, vanity and pride, and, in what could be interpreted as an oblique swipe at the Mexican elite, warned against societies in which the few enrich themselves and take the \u201cbread\u201d on the \u201ctoil of others.\u201d\u201cThis is the bread that a corrupt family or society gives its own children,\u201d Francis said.Upon his arrival, Francis traveled through a new development of tidy condominiums, as well as a megamall with stores like Starbucks, Sears and Burger King less than a mile from one of the country\u2019s worst slums. Many Mexican commentators said the picture of prosperity that the government hoped would be validated by Francis\u2019s presence was false.Later in the day, Francis was again swept into the economic divide while visiting a hospital for children in Mexico City. There, he was joined by the first lady of Mexico and, according to the event itinerary, the son of the richest man in Mexico, Carlos Slim.Along the route in Ecatepec, industrious street vendors created a bustling papal market, where hundreds of entrepreneurs spent the morning hawking plates, T-shirts and key chains bearing Francis\u2019 image.And yet even that commerce, to some degree, reflected Mexico\u2019s split reality. More than 60 percent of Mexico\u2019s economy remains informal, and workers say the burden of taxes and bureaucracy prevents them from joining the formal sector.\u201cI know these people are coming to ask for help, but who is there to help them?\u201d asked Claudia Rodriguez Ayala, 46, a vendor selling sandwiches, water and cigarettes along the papal route. \u201cMost feel if they come, they can get some manner of help through faith.\u201dAs throngs of people marched past, she smiled and fished out a bottle of water from her cooler.\u201cOr at least lower taxes ordered by the president,\u201d she said.Paulina Villegas contributed reporting from Chiapas, Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Falling Asleep to Grenades: Mexicans Tell Pope How They Live", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byA young mother living in one of Mexico\u2019s most violent states said she had gone to sleep with the sound of grenades and guns outside her home. Another woman, in Mexico City, wrote that kidnappings had become so commonplace, they are spoken of like the weather. Many others complained about living under a corrupt government.Here is a selection, edited and condensed for clarity:Out of view: corruption, bad infrastructureThe pope should know that the Mexico he will be shown is NOT the real Mexico. He will not see the corruption, insecurity and bad infrastructure. Mexico is certainly in no position to squander the amount of money it is spending on his visit.Missing the old daysI would like Pope Francis to know that we\u2019re missing the old days. Those days when we could go out and play outside. Those days were real, they were safe.Our children don\u2019t know what it is to go out and not worry about the insecurity and kidnapping and everything that should not be happening in our Mexico. Our children think as adults and their childhood is being stolen, and it\u2019s sad to see them worry about things we didn\u2019t even worry about when we were 6 years old.But we will still welcome you because Mexicans have warm hearts, and we like pretending that nothing bad is going on around us.Corruption and insecurityI think the pope should know (if he doesn\u2019t already) that we are sick of living with the high levels of corruption and insecurity. We are also tired of having to pay for stupid expenses made by our government, like the pope\u2019s visit.Raising a baby amid violenceI live in one of the most violent states in Mexico with my husband and my baby daughter. I\u2019ve seen decapitated people on my way to college, I\u2019ve gone to sleep with the sound of grenades and AK-47s, and I have had to lie on the floor during a shooting.Where kidnappings are commonplaceI would like the pope to know that the kidnapping and dismemberment of people is so commonplace, the neighbors talk about it like they do the weather.I hope I don\u2019t get kidnapped for speaking out.Mr. Pope, to say what you feel here gets you murdered or desaparecido. How is it we can\u2019t find the missing 43 students from Iguala yet? LIFE IS BEYOND NORMAL HERE. HELP!A government distractionThe pope was invited to the country just as a strategy to calm down the people\u2019s general anger about many issues (e.g. economy, violence, poverty and insecurity).This man (the pope) is not a fool and knows perfectly the kind of country he is going to find, and the kind of politicians he is going to meet, but he is going to act with his natural diplomacy. Nothing, nothing will change.Millions of Mexicans don\u2019t really want him to visit, and we have actually nothing against him as a person or as a spiritual leader, but against the \u201copportunity\u201d that our authorities found by planning this event.Multiple realitiesThe pope should know and realize that in Mexico City there are several realities. If you are lucky, you can have a great life full of beautiful experiences, but if you are not, you are one of the thousands trying to survive every day\u2026A hunger for knowledge and foodThe pope should know that Mexico is the most dangerous country for a woman, that our government is the biggest circus in the world, that here in Mexico slavery exists in many forms, that our children receive a poor education, they have hunger for knowledge and real hungry too; this is the most beautiful country and we have fear of living here.Hope, courage and faith lives onI think the pope should know that in Mexico there are still young people with hope, courage and above all with faith in the midst of a society distorted by so much corruption.Sick and tired of our governmentUs Mexicans are so sick and tired of our government and their antics that we now think ill of everything that might look like an event to appease the masses.Young people losing faithThe pope should know that he\u2019s arriving to a Mexico where Catholicism is not as strong as it was before. Young people are losing our \u2018faith\u2019 in the Catholic Church, because of corruption and situations like pederasty among priests.Be our voiceA war zone in Mexico, where we daily live in fear of being robbed, kidnapped, or killed. I would like him to speak up for us, the people who are being silenced by fear. He has the power to tell the truth of the depth of the corruption in our government and how that has led to years of horror in this country.I would like him to come not as a representative of the Vatican, but as the representative of God on earth, and bring truth and hope.We Mexicans need you, Pope Francisco!Anger over cost of tripIf he truly preaches peace, poverty, etc., wouldn\u2019t the country benefit more by building schools, hospitals or just feeding the innumerable poor? Why must our taxes pay for what a lot of us frankly see as a waste and a terrible inconvenience?I, like most Mexicans, was raised a Catholic, but it is impossible for me to welcome him.We stand with the ChurchWe are a very faithful nation and even though many things are changing in our country, mostly for bad, the majority of us stand up with the church and defend life and human dignity.Looking for spirituality elsewherePope should know that Mexicans are very much disappointed with the Catholic Church. The arrogance (and stupidity) of the bishops, the nearness of the church with caciques, narcos and all kinds of harmful people and, above all, the silence of the Catholic hierarchy regarding child abuse.People are looking for spirituality in other places.A country that belongs to the drug warThe pope should know that Mexico is not a country that belongs to spirituality. Mexico is a country that now belongs mostly to the drug war and anything to do with it. It\u2019s a place where both women and men now do what they can to survive even against their moral convictions.He should be honest and tell the people that the church won\u2019t save them, that it can be a guiding light to the individual becoming the best version of his/herself. But that we must look inside to find godliness and we must start to be brave and stand against corruption, against journalists kidnapped and murdered by corrupt officials, against university students disappeared and never heard from again.He should know that a country such as this with such a rich and beautiful culture deserves better. Its average citizen deserves a greater chance at stability, security, joy, and freedom.Advertisement"}

It was Bacon; Deakin had made an artful introduction, and Peppiatt, however accidentally, had found his apprenticeship. Over the next 30 years, Peppiatt would emerge as a critic, curator and publisher, and ultimately Bacon\u2019s biographer. Joining Bacon for his nightly rounds, from restaurants to clubs, Peppiatt would ply Bacon with \u201cinterview\u201d questions \u2014 a writer challenging the bromides of his celebrity subject. \u201cFrancis Bacon in Your Blood,\u201d arriving some 20 years after Peppiatt\u2019s seminal biography, \u201cFrancis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma,\u201d is the result, a gouache d\u00e9coup\u00e9 of a friend, against a background of art history.As of the 1960s, and Peppiatt\u2019s arrival in Soho, the landscape of Cold War painting had been thoroughly mapped; Pablo Picasso\u2019s new way of seeing had been assimilated; Surrealism was as familiar as an old show tune; Abstract Expressionism had been packaged for global export; and Existentialism had been offered in abridgment, Jean-Paul Sartre advising that we act and Jack Kerouac advising that we be. In its historical place, Bacon\u2019s aesthetic was both courageous and compromising. His paintings nestled in the between \u2014 not quite abstraction, Surrealism, Cubism or representation. At the same time, Bacon vociferously objected to the direction his contemporaries had taken. \u201cJackson Pollock?\u201d asked Bacon. \u201cOh are you talking about the old lace maker?\u201dPeppiatt catalogs Bacon\u2019s presumed vices \u2014 cruelty, avarice, debauchery. But in Peppiatt\u2019s rendering, the deaths of Peter Lacy and George Dyer, Bacon\u2019s lovers, evidenced Bacon\u2019s penchant for self-destructive people, not cruelty. \u201cEveryone I\u2019ve ever been really fond of,\u201d Peppiatt quotes Bacon, \u201chas always been a drunk or a suicide.\u201d Bacon\u2019s avarice \u2014 drink and sumptuous meals \u2014 is a last gasp of Western Empire, which, in the context of today\u2019s pressboard furniture, is tempting to recall with nostalgia. \u201cI think I\u2019ll move into a hotel like this just so that I have a place to die in,\u201d Bacon pondered. \u201cI love the atmosphere of these luxury hotels, though I suppose with the way the economy is going and everything else, they won\u2019t exist for much longer.\u201dBacon\u2019s debauchery is patiently questioned by Peppiatt\u2019s devoted telling. Bacon gambled, usually losing, and his sexual escapades, mostly in retrospect by his late 50s, tended to the rough stuff, the violent couplings of his paintings. But 60 years later, the criticism of Bacon\u2019s homosexuality is uncomfortably anachronistic, especially in counterpoint to Bacon\u2019s contemporary and onetime friend Lucian Freud, who fathered 12-plus children out of wedlock. But Bacon himself was disposed to midcentury intolerance. His maxims about sex and art are his own, but also the bluster of cafes; Peppiatt portrays Bacon as a man of his times. As with Alberto Giacometti, who opined, \u201cOne day perhaps I shall reach my goal,\u201d Bacon had a creative attitude, forged in an era of pervasive repression, that was dogged and fatalistic: \u201cI would like to make images that bring you closer to what being human is actually like. .\u2008.\u2008. Of course, after all these years, I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s ever worked.\u201dBacon\u2019s entourage, which included Sonia Orwell, was no cheerier. The influential critic and editor Cyril Connolly casually remarked to Peppiatt, \u201cThe very idea of Sonia being happy is obscene.\u201d Orwell, among Bacon\u2019s gallery of rogues, is a highlight of Peppiatt\u2019s memoir; after their near sexual incursion is foiled by Connolly\u2019s lurking presence, Orwell asks Peppiatt how Connolly can still be lusting for her \u201cafter all these years.\u201dWith the arrival of the 21st century, Bacon\u2019s works have fetched exorbitant auction prices, drawing fire from critics, who call for reappraisal. But Peppiatt\u2019s remembrance is neither tribute nor apologia. \u201cFrancis Bacon in Your Blood\u201d is a candid portrayal of a famous man who could be very generous, even with his foes, and very petty, even with his friends \u2014 and Bacon, to his credit, was acutely aware of his own frailties. When Peppiatt, always anxious about exciting Bacon\u2019s temper, ventured that \u201cpeople only have the despair they can afford,\u201d Bacon conceded, \u201cYou\u2019ve just said something very profound.\u201dFRANCIS BACON IN YOUR BLOODA MemoirBy Michael Peppiatt401 pp. Bloomsbury. $35.John Reed has written for Artforum, Art in America and other \u00adpublications.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low Oil Prices Claim New Victim, an Offshore Drilling Company From Texas", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byYet another oil company has filed for bankruptcy, as the energy industry and its lenders brace for a prolonged slump.Paragon Offshore, which operates offshore drilling rigs from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sunday evening, the latest filing in a painful shakeout buffeting the oil industry.Over the last 16 months, about 60 oil and gas companies have filed for bankruptcy as commodity prices slide, and that figure is expected to double in the coming months if prices remain low. All told, analysts say as much as a third of the sprawling oil and gas industry in the United States could be consolidated as a result of the downturn.Paragon, based in Houston, was one of the more fortunate companies that has contemplated bankruptcy. The company was able to negotiate a deal with its lenders \u2014 a mix of bondholders and banks \u2014 ahead of its bankruptcy filing.The so-called prepackaged bankruptcy agreement sealed last week allowed Paragon to cut its $2.7 billion of debt by about $1.1 billion and to keep operating.Unlike other recent oil restructurings, which have all but wiped out equity holders, Paragon\u2019s existing equity investors will retain 65 percent of the company.Paragon, which traces its roots to the Great Depression and now employs about 2,900 people around the world, had not run out of cash when it filed, but company executives determined that it could not hold out forever, said Lee M. Ahlstrom, Paragon\u2019s senior vice president for investor relations, strategy and planning.Paragon\u2019s biggest customers for its drilling services, including the Mexican oil giant Pemex and Petrobras of Brazil, have been cutting back on new projects as the global supply remains high.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.In the shale oil fields of the United States, there are very few wells that are profitable to drill at current prices. With large producers like Saudi Arabia showing no signs of cutting back production and the global economy slowing, oil executives and investors expect the market to remain in turmoil until 2017.Last week, oil prices rallied, but not nearly enough to convince investors, lenders and companies like Paragon that a recovery was near at hand.\u201cEven if oil jumps up to $50 tomorrow, I don\u2019t think you will see a resurgence in drilling activity,\u201d Mr. Ahlstrom said.Paragon was spun out of Noble Corporation, a large drilling company, in 2014 \u2014 joining a highly fragmented industry that includes thousands of small oil producers and companies that service them.During the boom, hedge funds, banks and private equity investors showered these many oil and gas companies with debt. Energy companies on average have more than twice as much leverage as companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Now all that debt is squeezing companies, as lower oil prices deplete cash flow. Many oil companies are still trying to hold out. Some are increasing production just to make interest payments.But banks are under pressure from regulators to reel in their credit lines as the default risks mount, while bond investors are looking to salvage whatever they can from their debt investments.Many lenders will end up owning their former borrowers, as they swap their debt for equity stakes in oil companies.Paragon, which is being advised by the law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges and the investment bank Lazard, has been taking steps to lower its debt load. Last week, it deferred an interest payment, while it was in talks with its lenders. And as part of the prepackaged bankruptcy deal, bondholders that were owed $984 million will receive $384 million in cash and a 35 percent equity stake in Paragon \u2014 which could gain in value when the market recovers.The hope among oil executives like Mr. Ahlstrom is that production has been curtailed so sharply during the slump that drilling activity will increase quickly again when the oversupply of oil burns off. \u201cThings could come a-roaring back,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iranian President and Moderates Make Strong Gains in Elections", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byThough hard-liners still control the most powerful positions and institutions of the state, two national elections last week appeared to build on the slow but unmistakable evolution toward a more moderate political landscape \u2014 now and into the future.Allies of President Hassan Rouhani made strong gains in parliamentary elections, controlling the entire 30-seat delegation representing the capital, Tehran, and carving out an influential minority bloc. At the same time, the two most radical clerics were ousted from the Assembly of Experts, a panel with the constitutional duty to select the nation\u2019s next supreme leader, should that position become vacant.The voting was seen as a referendum of sorts on the nuclear deal, and virtually every prominent critic of the pact was defeated.The results also gave some weight to President Obama\u2019s carefully couched hopes that the nuclear deal \u2014 which was heavily criticized by his American political adversaries \u2014 might introduce changes that could gradually bring Iran out of its confrontational posture with the West and, most pointedly, with the United States.\u201cNo more trivial debates, no more complaining of shaking hands with American officials, no more shouting and screaming from the Parliament seats,\u201d said Farshad Ghorbanpour, an analyst with close ties to the Rouhani government. \u201cThe next Parliament will support the government; it will be reasonable and rational.\u201dWhile the hard-liners still remain firmly in control of the judiciary, the security forces and much of the economy, the success of the moderate, pragmatic and pro-government forces seemed to give Mr. Rouhani political currency to push a course of greater liberalization of the economy at home and accommodation abroad.In the parliamentary elections, Mr. Rouhani and the moderates not only swept all seats in the capital but also appeared to run strongly in other urban areas. By Monday afternoon, in the absence of official results, conclusions were being thrown around freely. State television reported Sunday that the hard-liners had won, and then reversed itself on Monday and gave the moderates the victory.Part of the problem was that so many candidates had been eliminated by a conservative vetting council that it was hard to know what faction some of the winners identified with. There are no political parties in Iran, and the candidates all run in loose coalitions along a relatively narrow political spectrum. There is no opposition to speak of, and the range of views was sharply curtailed when the reform movement was crushed after protesting what it called the fraudulent results of the 2009 election.But it seemed clear that Iran\u2019s ailing hard-line faction, having used every weapon in its arsenal against the moderate supporters of the Rouhani government, had come up short. In addition to the disqualification of thousands of candidates, street campaigning was kept to a minimum, and grass-roots activists were detained and intimidated.When Election Day came, the president\u2019s support base of middle-class Iranians turned out in big numbers, even though the overall turnout declined to 62 percent from 64 percent four years ago. A diverse group of Gucci lovers, student philosophers and family men carrying children wearing \u201cFrozen\u201d shirts, they came out for revenge against the hard-liners and appear to have exacted it.Hard-liners, representatives of the sharper edges of Iran\u2019s Islamic revolutionary ideology, have long had trouble attracting a large voter base. Iranian society has changed rapidly in 15 years, with the middle classes feeling more alienated by the harsh political talk against the United States, Western culture and any form of social relaxation.Obtaining a strong minority in Parliament is not only Mr. Rouhani\u2019s victory but also a result of a broader trend in which the Iranian political discourse is shifting away from a polarized universe of hard-liner versus reformist. Those supporting Mr. Rouhani prefer to call themselves pragmatists, centrists and moderates.While the victory is significant, those expecting major social change in Iran will be proved wrong, both supporters of the government and hard-liners say. Those who made it into Parliament under the banner of reforms seem mostly to be cautious politicians. The original reformist leaders, who have pleaded for radical changes in law and ideology, are either in jail or prohibited from participating in the political process.\u201cThey will quickly face division among themselves, since the supporters of the government is a mixed bag of individuals with different political backgrounds,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Iran\u2019s leadership. \u201cTo write off the hard-liners would be a major mistake.\u201dNevertheless, it is increasingly clear that Ayatollah Khamenei is supporting the moderate trend, at least in foreign policy and on economic issues. He was the main architect of the nuclear agreement. While he continues to warn against the United States, he has allowed continuing contacts between his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and Secretary of State John Kerry. He also welcomes and meets with European heads of state, most recently the president of Switzerland, Johann Schneider-Ammann, on Friday, urging the Swiss to invest in Iran.In Tehran, the epicenter of middle-class culture, Mr. Rouhani has been criticized for his failure to deliver on any of his promises of more freedom and domestic political change. But fear of another four years of hard-liners in Parliament, combined with the successful nuclear deal and the lifting of the sanctions, prompted many to come out and vote for the president and his followers.At a polling station in Shahrak-e Gharb, in western Tehran, families joined the older men who pass the days in a neighboring park for hours of waiting before casting their ballots. \u201cI\u2019m not into politics,\u201d said Reza Sharji, 35, a graphic designer with a long hipster beard. \u201cBut I do know what I don\u2019t want, that is more hard-liners.\u201dSocial change is a highly delicate matter, and efforts there seem likely to meet continuing resistance. But economic changes and an opening to the world, a major focus of Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government, might gain greater support. The shift toward the political middle gives Iran\u2019s president the support of moderate conservatives, like the current head of the Parliament, Ali Larijani. To achieve such changes, they will have to overcome hard-line resistance to foreign investment and ownership of Iranian assets.They are optimistic they can. \u201cNow, such criticisms can be ignored,\u201d said Mosayyeb Naemi, the editor in chief of a pro-government weekly. \u201cThe next Parliament will surely support the new economic policies.\u201dFor those who came out in large numbers on Friday, the government victory, gnawing away at hard-liner power, was sweet, but their expectations remain low.\u201cWe need better conditions for youths, women and minorities,\u201d said Tahoura Ayati, 26, a translator of English literature. \u201cI really hope for change, that is all I can say.\u201dAdvertisement"}

None of it happened.With that track record of broken promises and with Mr. Trump emerging as the likely Republican presidential nominee, it\u2019s good to look at his prominent promises and the critiques:This doesn\u2019t impress many foreign policy experts. \u201cHe has said very little of substance,\u201d said former Senator Richard G.

American Action estimates that the cost to the economy would be $1 trillion.The Pew Research Center, which is nonpartisan, calculates that the deportations would cause big job losses in sectors of the economy: 26 percent of farming, fishing and forestry workers; 17 percent of building maintenance and cleaning personnel; and 14 percent of construction workers. Studies showed that many of these jobs would go unfilled, devastating the economy, says the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.Experts ridicule that possibility. \u201cThe Mexicans treat this with total disdain,\u201d said Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute, a libertarian organization. \u201cI don\u2019t know any policy people that take this seriously.\u201dBut trade specialists note that he couldn\u2019t do this unilaterally.\u201cNo president in our lifetime has ever contemplated anything like this, but I believe Congress would have to act,\u201d said Susan Schwab, who was the United States trade representative under President George W.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Forget Darfur", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorDarfur has become a focus again because the regime in Khartoum is desperate to end one of three active rebellions in the country, conflicts that have left its military badly overstretched while a failing economy is causing civil unrest.A campaign by regular government forces, once again working in concert with Arab militias, has moved westward from North Darfur to the strategic Jebel Marra massif. The assault on the Darfuri rebels there began in earnest in mid-January and has reportedly involved tanks, artillery and aerial bombing \u2014 the latter often inaccurate and resulting in heavy civilian casualties, the overwhelming majority of them African farmers and their families.The head of the regime for more than 25 years, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, has been charged by the International Criminal Court with multiple counts of genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur. Yet it seems unlikely the court\u2019s arrest warrant will ever be served. International economic sanctions against Sudan have been too patchy and partial to bring results.Bad as things are, they will get worse if the Jebel Marra offensive is not halted. Stopping it will require the international community to act in a concerted way. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has been too passive on Darfur; he should bring up Khartoum\u2019s new offensive at the Security Council.To be sure, Russia and China may block action: Both have trade in arms with Sudan, and China has invested heavily there, particularly in the oil industry. But Mr. Ban could at least force a discussion in this forum, and highlight the Security Council resolutions that Khartoum has breached.The African Union, too, has been far too accommodating of the Sudanese regime: Its Peace and Security Council needs to speak out about the military action in Jebel Marra and enforce a continentwide travel ban on the officials responsible.Khartoum has a keen ear for cant.

{"Headline": "Atlanta Pulls a Chair to the Table for Culinary Greats", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported by18 PhotosGetting traction as a great restaurant city has been harder. It has been tough to compete with neighbors like Charleston, S.C., New Orleans or that sexy food upstart, Nashville. As a national food contender, Atlanta never had the culinary firepower or customer base of New York, Los Angeles or Chicago. Diners made do with a parade of meals at local or national chains, punctuated by the occasional steak in a pretty room.But now, as the nation\u2019s infatuation with Southern food matures and Atlanta\u2019s recession-battered economy recovers, a city that often looked over its shoulder for culinary validation and inspiration is coming into its own.Over the last couple of years, a record number of new and independent restaurants have opened. Especially in the urban core \u2014 what people here call intown Atlanta \u2014 veteran chefs and newcomers alike have taken advantage of cheap rents and a growing cadre of good line cooks who don\u2019t feel the need to prove themselves in bigger ponds.Now, eaters grin at one another across dishes of spicy pork confit or kimchi curd with Ethiopian kale, cross their fingers and talk about their good fortune.\u201cAll of the sudden you see this very intense communal sense of pride about being an Atlanta chef,\u201d said Sean Brock, the Southern food revivalist behind Husk, which operates in Charleston and Nashville, and a cheerleader for Atlanta\u2019s new restaurant rigor.Adam Evans, a favorite local chef, runs the Brezza Cucina kitchen. That\u2019s important in a city that has never liked carpetbaggers. Several big-name chefs \u2014 Emeril Lagasse, Tom Colicchio and Jean-Georges Vongerichten \u2014 have all opened and closed restaurants in Atlanta over the years. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give the hug,\u201d Mr. Acheson said. \u201cThe hug \u2014 the table touch \u2014 is an important thing in the South.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult town for an outsider,\u201d said Guenter Seeger, considered one of the city\u2019s most skilled chefs until he left in 2008 at the height of the recession. Mr. Seeger, who plans to open a restaurant in the meatpacking district in New York in April, calls what\u2019s happening in Atlanta \u201ca food revolution.\u201dTo be sure, Atlanta still faces challenges. Managers at top-flight restaurants complain that they still sell more steaks than they\u2019d like to. And like Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d diners can place appearances ahead of everything else.\u201cIt\u2019s more inventive visually than it is gastronomically,\u201d said Corby Kummer, the Boston-based food writer and restaurant critic for Boston Magazine who took on a side job as the restaurant critic for Atlanta Magazine while his spouse is stationed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is headquartered here.Some diners worry that Atlanta has still not shaken off its penchant for chasing trends or stuffing fancy versions of pimento cheese into Mason jars and making hummus out of peanuts.\u201cWe still need a few more years to be Atlanta and not be everyone else,\u201d said Tami Cook, a culinary producer and recipe developer who used to work for Alton Brown (who also lives in the Atlanta area) and is now a food stylist and cook.The city\u2019s divisions \u2014 cultural, geographical and even racial \u2014 remain a challenge, too. It takes a long time to get around, and most of the metropolitan area\u2019s 5.5 million residents live outside the city limits. Even the drive to Decatur, a small city one might call Atlanta\u2019s gastronomic equivalent of Berkeley or Brooklyn, can seem too long.Most of the restaurants selling food from South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico and other countries remain concentrated on the Buford Highway, a busy road that stretches north from the city into the dense suburbs. And the city\u2019s star chefs remain mostly white men.\u201cAtlanta has a lot of things that make it not an easy story line,\u201d said Linton Hopkins, who with his wife, Gina, opened the local food stalwart Restaurant Eugene 11 years ago. His newest venture, however, will be a steakhouse. He plans to open it near the new Atlanta Braves stadium, scheduled to open in 2017 north of the city in Cobb County.Read more on where to eat in Atlanta.Advertisement"}

The referendum expected this June on whether the country should stay in the European Union will define his legacy.Among the major points in the draft deal were assurances that non-eurozone countries would not be discriminated against; cutting back on clumsy European Union regulations; and an exemption from the European Union\u2019s stated goal of \u201cever closer union\u201d with, instead, a strengthening of the role of national parliaments. On these points, the package looked promising for Britain.But even as Mr. Cameron toiled to win the backing of Britain\u2019s European partners, he faced the bigger test of selling the package to his Conservative Party and his own ministers, as well as a hostile press and a skeptical public.British leaders, including the current prime minister, have usually played down the benefits of European Union membership. This has tended to enable the so-called euroskeptics to hijack the debate.At the same time, the Cameron government has hardly trumpeted the British role in the European Union\u2019s leadership on climate change. Without Britain\u2019s efforts, alongside those of its union partners, France would probably have struggled to reach the new global agreement on climate change that was sealed in Paris in December.Political leaders have rarely spoken of the value and importance of working with Britain\u2019s European neighbors on sharing intelligence about terrorists or confronting organized crime. Tellingly, the United States wants Britain to stay in the union; Russia, on the other hand, would be delighted if it left.If a majority in England votes to leave the Europe Union, while a majority of Scots votes to remain, this could lead to another referendum on whether Scotland should remain in the United Kingdom. Nationalists would push for an independent Scotland to rejoin the European Union. Mr. Cameron\u2019s legacy could then include the breakup of Britain.Mr. Cameron already pledged to step down as party leader before the next general election, in 2020. Because of this, some contenders may view the referendum as a wedge issue in the future leadership contest. One likely candidate, Boris Johnson, London\u2019s mayor, has already announced that he will campaign against Mr. Cameron\u2019s deal.This framing of the debate in party terms distracts from a serious conversation about Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. Britain faces this referendum not in response to any crisis within Europe, but because Mr. Cameron decided he had to appease the euroskeptics in his own party.Managing the Conservative Party\u2019s neurosis about Europe will now take bold leadership. Only if Mr. Cameron is clear about the consequences of Brexit \u2014 and the benefits of staying in \u2014 can he win the argument and secure a favorable legacy.Geoffrey Edwards is an emeritus reader in European studies at the University of Cambridge, England.

{"Headline": "Is Humanity Getting Better?", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "I.London, 1665. The capital smelled of death in its last large outbreak of the Plague, the worst since the Black Death of the 14th century. The diarist Samuel Pepys mourned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery day sadder and sadder news of its increase. In the City died this week 7,496; and of all of them, 6,102 of the Plague. But it is feared that the true number of the dead this week is near 10,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 partly from the poor that cannot be taken notice of through the greatness of the number.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAs the deaths mounted and the streets filled with waste, Londoners noticed that dogs and cats were everywhere in the city. And so the order went out from the Lord Mayor.Kill the dogs and cats.The Chamberlain of the City paid the huntsmen, who slaughtered more than 4,000 animals. But the dogs and cats were chasing the rats that were feeding on the waste \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the rats were carrying the fleas that transmitted the Plague. Now spared from their predators, the rats spread the affliction even more fiercely. The medical advice from London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s College of Physicians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to press a hen hard on the swellings until the hen died \u00e2\u0080\u0094 did not slow the disease. In the end, the Plague of 1665 is thought to have killed almost 20 percent of London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population (the equivalent of a million and a half people today). A great fire then consumed a third of the city.Many humans and animals died in this crisis of ignorance. Now that we understand the Plague bacterium, we know what procedures and medicines will keep the disease from becoming epidemic. Ignorance, we might say, no longer plagues us.The 20th century marked an inflection point \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the beginning of humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transition from its ancient crises of ignorance to its modern crises of invention. Our science is now so penetrating, our systems are so robust, that we are mostly endangered by our own creations. Our bomb-making is now informed by particle physics; our computers are becoming ever-better informed about our private lives.In 1665, half a billion humans sweated to sustain the species near subsistence with their crude implements. Now our global economy is so productive that 16 times that number \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some 8 billion humans \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will soon be alive, and most will never have known such poverty.Indeed, our machines have multiplied so much that a new crisis looms because of the smoke coming off them as they combust. Future food crises, if they come, will be driven by anthropogenic climate change. Famine will descend not from the wrath of God but from the growth of gross domestic product. We ourselves are outfitting the Horsemen of the future, or perhaps it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to say that we are creating them.An anthology of essays from The Times\u2019s philosophy series, published by Liveright.Our new crises of invention are so challenging because the bads are so tightly bound with the goods. Breaking the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slave chains was a moral triumph; breaking the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply chains is not an option. Climate change is a crisis of invention. So many more people, living longer, eating better, traveling more to see the world and one another \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is it not poignant that these human goods are engendering a mortal danger?II.Molecules are heavy and expensive; bits are fast and cheap. So if the past was about scarcity, the future should be about abundance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the future may well be abundant with trouble. Whether humans can overcome their coming crises of invention will turn on the philosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old question of whether individuals are essentially good or evil, which is a hard question \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but recent news will tempt many thumbs to turn downward.A more positive answer emerges if we switch to a systems perspective, evaluating humanity as a whole as we would an ecosystem or a complex machine. What happens when humanity \u00e2\u0080\u009cadds\u00e2\u0080\u009d energy to itself \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what happens when humanity produces and consumes more energy, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done massively in the transition from wood and muscle power to fossil fuels and alternatives?The encouraging answer is that with more energy the species grows like crazy. And adding more energy has also activated some potentiality that has made humans generally more tolerant, more cooperative and more peaceful. Humans have, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true, developed energy weapons powerful enough to destroy the entire system. Yet so far, they have not used those weapons to do so. So far, at least, more energy = more humanity.Something is happening to our species, and especially over the last 70 years. The years since 1945 have seen many horrors: the partition of India, China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Great Leap Forward, the Vietnam War, the Biafran crisis, the Khmer Rouge and the Rwandan genocide, wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, mass slaughters, civilizational dictatorships, widespread famines and the grueling civil conflicts that have become watchwords for evil in our time. Today our screens overflow with chaos and hate, and today our screens follow us everywhere.Yet this has also been the most prosperous time in human history by far. And by a long way the time with the greatest increase in democracy around the world. It has also been the most peaceful era in recorded human history. What Hegel called the slaughter-bench of history is becoming less bloody.That thesis about \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most peaceful era in history\u00e2\u0080\u009d is naturally the hardest to believe, yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true. As Joshua Goldstein puts it in \u00e2\u0080\u009cWinning the War on War,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have avoided nuclear wars, left behind world war, nearly extinguished interstate war, and reduced civil wars to fewer countries with fewer casualties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Goldstein continues:The percentage of states perpetrating mass killings of civilians is also well down since 1945, and fatalities from armed assaults on civilians (and from genocide) are down since reliable records have been kept. And while the numbers on deaths from terrorism vary according to the definition of that word, all agree that the numbers of terrorism deaths are quite small compared with those caused by (increasingly rare) wars.These statistics definitely do not prove that animus or madness has ended. No decent person would deny that violence is still much too high everywhere. And there is no guarantee that any of these positive trends will continue.Still, the big picture of postwar history shows significant improvements in nearly all indicators of lived human experience. The average life span of humans is today longer than it has ever been. A smaller proportion of women die in childbirth than ever before. Child malnutrition is at its lowest level ever, while literacy rates worldwide have never been higher. Most impressive has been the recent reduction in severe poverty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the reduction in the percentage of humans living each day on what a tall Starbucks coffee costs in America. During a recent 20-year stretch the mainstream estimate is that the percentage of the developing world living in such extreme poverty shrank by more than half, from 43 to 21 percent.The real trick to understanding our world is to see it with both eyes at once. The world now is a thoroughly awful place \u00e2\u0080\u0094 compared with what it should be. But not compared with what it was. Keeping both eyes open gives depth to our perception of our own time in history, and makes us better able to see where paths to more progress may be open.III.It would be ungenerous to be impatient with humanity, which \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like each one of us \u00e2\u0080\u0094 needs time to learn. It was quite a shock for humankind to wake one day with atomic weapons suddenly in its midst, especially as a world war was then ablaze. In 1945, humanity had little idea how to handle this novel existential threat. But it learned, through death and nightmares, and at least so far, it has done better than many first feared. With ever more crises of invention emerging, humanity will need to learn again, and it will need to learn quicker and better.Humanity does learn, painfully and often only after thousands or even millions have died \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like a giant starfish hurrying over a jagged reef, with only primitive vision, slicing off spines on its way, yet regenerating as it grows and slowly adapting its motion. The currents are pushing the starfish faster, the reefs ahead are sharper \u00e2\u0080\u0094 humanity must become sharper, too. Mainly, humanity learns as identities alter to become less aggressive and more open, so that networks can connect individual capacities more effectively and join our resources together.Many people are still beyond ruthless in pursuing their own interests, yet interests are now more pacific than they once were. Most people around you now do not want to kill you to get your phone, torture you until you profess their religion, or prey on your credulity until you join a racist gang. Some may \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not many. If these profound changes for the better remain unseen, it is likely because of what we now take for granted.What we take for granted frames the size of our concerns. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to expect that mayors and police chiefs will not endorse, much less order, the lynching of minorities. Within that frame, racial profiling and deaths in police custody are top priorities. After decades, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to expect enduring peace among the great powers. Within that frame any military action by a major power, or a civil war in a resource-rich state, rightly becomes top news.We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t relax; the upward trends in time\u00e2\u0080\u0099s graphs may crest at any point. Yet batting away the positive facts is lazy, and requires only a lower form of intelligence. There are immense challenges: climate change, resource scarcity, overpopulation, and more. Still, these are the follow-on problems of species achievement, as the world gets more crowded and productivity grows. These are the burdens of our success. Something is happening \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially since World War II \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as we add more energy to our species. What future generations might marvel at most will be if we, in the midst of it, do not see it.More From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A College Education for Prisoners", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialStates are finally backing away from the draconian sentencing policies that swept the country at the end of the last century, driving up prison costs and sending too many people to jail for too long, often for nonviolent offenses. Many are now trying to turn around the prison juggernaut by steering drug addicts into treatment instead of jail and retooling parole systems that once sent people back to prison for technical violations.But the most effective way to keep people out of prison once they leave is to give them jobs skills that make them marketable employees. That, in turn, means restarting prison education programs that were shuttered beginning in the 1990s, when federal and state legislators cut funding to show how tough they were on crime.President Obama pointed the country in the right direction last year by creating a pilot program that will allow a limited number of inmates to receive federal Pell Grants to take college courses behind bars. The program will include colleges that either run prison education programs or want to start them. So far, more than 200 schools in 47 states have expressed interest.New Yorkers pay about $60,000 per inmate per year \u2014 a considerable burden given that 40 percent of those who are released return within three years, most for economically driven crimes. But inmates who attend privately financed college classes before release fare much better. A prison education program created by Bard College in 2001 boasts a remarkable recidivism rate of 4 percent for inmates who merely participated in the program and 2.5 percent for those who earned degrees in prison. In addition, research has shown that the public saves $4 to $5 in reimprisonment costs for every $1 it spends on prison education.New York lawmakers who should have jumped at the governor\u2019s proposal ridiculed it instead. Mr. Cuomo has devised a new plan \u2014 paid for partly with private funds \u2014 that does not require legislative approval. But such funding is unreliable and probably unsustainable over the long run. Moreover, the case for full public financing of prison education is stronger than it has ever been.The bar association report calls on all colleges in New York to refrain from using criminal history information in admissions, which has been shown to have virtually no value in predicting lawbreaking on campus. Applicants who check \u201cyes\u201d are now pushed into a supplementary application process that costs them more money and often asks them to produce court and legal documents that do not exist.Nineteen states and 100 cities and counties prohibit public agencies \u2014 and in some cases, private employers \u2014 from asking applicants about criminal convictions until later in the process, when they have had a fair chance to prove their qualifications. The New York State Bar Association wisely calls for colleges to take that same prudent approach in the interest of giving qualified former inmates a better chance at a college education.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Transparency May Give Investors False Confidence, Economists Say", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byThe Federal Reserve may be guilty of sharing too much information.In contrast to its behavior under previous leaders, the Fed under Janet L. Yellen, the current chairwoman, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, has sought to clarify its intentions by publishing long descriptions of policy-making deliberations, convening regular news conferences and releasing quarterly rounds of economic forecasts by senior Fed officials.But a new paper by a group of economists argues that the Fed\u2019s efforts in recent years to speak more clearly about its plans for monetary policy are imbuing investors with false confidence and setting up markets for disruptive disappointments when those plans change.Amir Sufi, a University of Chicago professor and one of the five authors, said that investors were now reacting more strongly to the Fed\u2019s pronouncements than to the publication of key economic indicators like the government\u2019s monthly jobs report.\u201cThe meetings themselves are generating big movements in interest rates,\u201d Mr. Sufi said. \u201cMy personal interpretation is that that is a little bit worrisome.\u201dThe Fed is trying to find its way in a new world. It is raising interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. It is also raising rates for the first time since fully embracing the idea \u2014 now conventional wisdom among central bankers \u2014 that clarity is a central element of effective monetary policy.Shaping the expectations of investors enhances its control over interest rates, and thus the broader economy. But there is no consensus about the best way for a central bank to speak clearly.Mr. Sufi and his collaborators argue the Fed is sharing the wrong information. The Fed sets policy based on its expectations for the economy and a set of informal rules about the best way to meet its goals of moderating inflation and maximizing employment. Economists call those informal rules a \u201creaction function.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s prediction in December that it expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by about one percentage point in 2016 combined these two elements.The paper argues that it would be better for the Fed to draw a clearer distinction between its expected economic outlook and its desired policy. That way, investors who disagree with the Fed\u2019s economic forecasts can plug in their own forecasts to predict the Fed\u2019s reaction if the Fed\u2019s forecast is incorrect.Instead, the news media and investors tend to latch on to the projected timetable, encouraging too much equanimity about the course of policy, only to be surprised when changes in economic conditions produce changes in the Fed\u2019s plans.\u201cThe Fed has relied much too heavily on time-based forward guidance,\u201d said Frederic Mishkin, a professor of economics at Columbia University and a former Fed governor, who presented the paper. The other authors were Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase; David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley; and Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.An audience heavily seeded with Fed officials greeted the paper with skepticism.After the 2007-08 financial crisis, the Fed was able to increase the effect of low interest rates by predicting that rates would remain low for years to come. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, compared that kind of date-based guidance to a sledgehammer that was no longer needed, and he noted that the Fed already had moved away from offering such specific predictions.Now the Fed faces the opposite challenge: An environment in which it must convince investors that it does not know where rates will be next year.But being vague may not be the best way to communicate uncertainty.Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Minneapolis Fed who is now a University of Rochester professor, suggested that neither side in the debate was right and that the Fed might want to seek other counsel.There is an \u201cidea that economists are necessarily going to be great at communication,\u201d he said. \u201cMany non-economists tell me that\u2019s wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shukhin, a burly, mustachioed worker said of the factory\u2019s management, stomping his feet against the cold at a labor protest this month on Machinists Square.Day after day, he said, the workers trudge to the factory by the thousands, only to sit out their shifts at idle assembly lines.Now, as far as many workers at Uralvagonzavod are concerned, all that might as well have occurred in a different country, or lifetime. \u201cI don\u2019t think Uralvagonzavod will vote for Putin again \u2014 we saw what that led to,\u201d Mr. Shukhin said. \u201cThis is the opinion of a lot of workers, but a lot of them are afraid to say it. We just don\u2019t understand why they are firing people.\u201dBack then, as oil prices flirted with the $100-a-barrel mark, cash was rolling in and work was plentiful. Mr. Putin, his government sitting on far larger cash reserves than today, was burnishing his image as the savior of factory towns, often arriving at troubled industrial centers in a swirl of television reporters to announce miraculous bailouts.But the economic slump is now starting to bite. Real wages, or salaries adjusted for inflation, a common gauge of how working people feel the economic slump, dropped 6.3 percent in January, compared with the year before.New automobile sales are down a staggering 40 percent, in a country that was recently seen as sailing on a trajectory of growth that would surpass Germany as Europe\u2019s biggest car market. With fewer goods to move, railroads are shunting rolling stock onto sidings and canceling new orders.The economic chill has settled on Nizhny Tagil like a Siberian cold front.The result, here and scattered throughout Russia, has been stirrings of labor unrest, the once widespread scourge of the late Soviet period.Nizhny Tagil has two pivotal industrial plants: one making steel and the other, Uralvagonzavod, turning out train cars and tanks. Both have announced layoffs, though Uralvagonzavod has since said any \u201coptimization\u201d of its work force of roughly 30,000 will be voluntary.The fate of the plants reflects another broad economic trend, as Mr. Putin\u2019s reluctance to cut military spending despite the recession and budget crunch has left that side of the Uralvagonzavod humming. While workers on the train-car side of the factory have been put on two-thirds pay \u2014 about $260 a month \u2014 the tank assembly lines are still rolling full speed, and workers are paid in full.Out on the snowy streets not far from the factory gates, at the recent protest\u2019s scheduled start time, more police officers than protesters appeared on Machinists Square. A surveillance van pulled up.A crew of street cleaners in orange vests blocked the pedestrian walkway to the factory, as if clearing snow, lest workers wandered over after their shift.In the end, a hundred or so people turned out, looking over their shoulders at the uniformed and plainclothes police officers mingling in the crowd, grinning and ostentatiously filming the scene on video cameras.Ilya Korovin, a local activist, stretched a red banner reading \u201cFor Workers\u2019 Rights!\u201d across the pedestal of a statue of Lenin. People milled about on the sidewalk beside a berm of sooty snow; whether taking in the spectacle or joining the protest, it was hard to tell.The assembly lines were idled, the workers\u2019 pay was cut, and the prices of groceries was sky high, Mr. Korovin said. And the management had no plan.\u201cFor more than a year, people go to work but do nothing,\u201d Mr. Korovin said.\u201cThe factory is just broke. But some still think, \u2018Putin loves us; he will throw us some money,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut we have a market economy. You cannot force somebody to buy our products. Most people are counting on Putin, but my comrades, we cannot remake the communist economy.\u201dMikhail G. Scherbakov, a retired shift boss at Uralvagonzavod, said that after 43 years on the assembly line he had a pension was 13,600 rubles, or about $175, a month. \u201cThey either have no conscience, or they have no money,\u201d he said.\u201cThey are just hanging spaghetti on our ears!\u201d Nikolai I. Kalugin, from a political group called the Party of Pensioners, said of the management\u2019s claim to have a pipeline of train car orders, using a Russian expression meaning playing people for fools.In Moscow, Ilya V. Yashin, a leader of the opposition movement that Mr. Kholmanskikh had threatened to crush with his \u201cboys\u201d from the factory, had a message for the laborers.\u201cDear Workers of Uralvagonzavod!\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cIn the end, the workers who not so long ago threatened to scatter the protesters were themselves forced to go to protest against layoffs and violations of their labor rights.

{"Headline": "Federal Reserve Won\u2019t Backpedal on Interest Rates, Janet Yellen Says", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve and financial markets are having a difference of opinion.The Fed expects the domestic economy to keep chugging along. Investors fear a global downturn.The Fed says it is still thinking about raising its benchmark interest rate again as soon as March. Investors are betting the Fed will not move before 2017.The split-screen divide was on display Thursday, as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, delivered a relatively upbeat assessment to the Senate Banking Committee while investors were dumping stocks and shoveling money into safe havens like government debt and gold. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day down nearly 255 points, or 1.6 percent.\u201cA lot has happened\u201d since December, when the Fed predicted it would spend 2016 gradually raising rates, Ms. Yellen acknowledged. And risk-averse investors could disrupt slow-and-steady economic growth, she allowed.But her tone was far from bleak. Asked about the risk of a recession, Ms. Yellen responded that anything is possible but \u201cexpansions don\u2019t die of old age.\u201d She made clear that Fed officials were still debating when, not whether, they should raise rates again.\u201cWe will meet in March, and our committee will carefully deliberate about what impact these developments have had,\u201d Ms. Yellen told Congress and the cameras, referring to the market turmoil and next month\u2019s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. \u201cToday I think it\u2019s premature to render a judgment.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s mainly our policy,\u201d she told Mr. Heller.But some analysts say the Fed is playing a role. They worry that the Fed, and its counterparts around the world, either cannot or will not move to shore up growth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has lost 10 percent of its value this year, closing Thursday at 1,829.08. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury climbed to the highest level since 2012.\u201cIt seems central banks have reached the end of road,\u201d said Markus Schomer, the chief economist at PineBridge Investments in New York. \u201cNo support for scared financial markets here.\u201dThe price of Fed funds futures, bets on the future level of the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate, now reflect roughly a 10 percent chance the Fed will raise rates this year. That means investors don\u2019t expect the Fed to make things worse. But they see little prospect that the Fed will expand its efforts.Indeed, Ms. Yellen said on Thursday that the Fed did not intend to cut rates back to zero.She also continued to play down the possibility that the Fed would seek to provide new stimulus by imposing negative interest rates \u2014 basically reversing the normal order of things so that lenders pay a fee for lending while borrowers collect a fee for borrowing.Ms. Yellen surprised some members of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday when she testified that the Fed had not considered the idea in detail. On Thursday she was slightly less dismissive, telling senators the Fed was reviewing the issue, but emphasizing again that she did not foresee a need for negative rates here.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take those off the table, but we would have work to do to judge whether they would be workable here,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen also played down some reasons for pessimism. She has previously pointed to stronger wage growth as an important sign that the economy is improving, and on Thursday she said that she was not overly impressed by signs of acceleration in the recent data. \u201cAt best the evidence of a pickup is tentative,\u201d she said.But in an exchange with Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, Ms. Yellen also appeared to back away from her previous emphasis on that indicator.\u201cI would not say that wage growth is a litmus test for changes in monetary policy,\u201d she said.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, emphasized that a crucial reason for the slow pace of economic growth in recent years was the relatively slow growth of productivity, or the economic output of the average worker.\u201cDoes monetary policy affect workers\u2019 knowledge or skills?\u201d he asked Ms. Yellen.As she began to answer, he interjected, \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous notion, is it not?\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s our job.\u201dHe meant that Congress could improve productivity by effective investment in areas like education or by changing the tax code to encourage innovation.Ms. Yellen said she generally agreed, but she noted that the Fed did have a role to play by encouraging economic growth. Companies curtail investments during downturns, and workers without jobs begin to lose their skills.Asked by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, what more the Fed could do to reduce long-term unemployment, she emphasized the point.\u201cWhat we are trying to do to contribute to the solution of that problem is to keep the economy growing at a steady pace, to keep the labor market improving, in the hope and expectation that a stronger labor market will improve the status of all groups,\u201d she said.Yet Ms. Yellen disappointed Democrats too by suggesting that in her view the Fed was doing enough. She reiterated the Fed\u2019s position that it was necessary to raise interest rates to maintain control of inflation as job growth continued.\u201cI see it just the other way,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cI am less worried about inflation and more worried about slow wage growth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

There have been coding lessons in schools, so-called weekend hackathons for students to code together for as long as 24 consecutive hours and training institutes for teachers across the borough as educators, leaders and others aim to help students navigate an increasingly digital world and better prepare for jobs in the future.\u201cThe problem is there aren\u2019t enough quality, free programs out there,\u201d said Brandy McNeil, the library\u2019s associate director of technology training programs. She added that the library, which currently has 10 technology instructors teaching coding, was seeking financing to expand the program and to hire additional instructors.For students like Joshua Lee, 17, learning to code is another way to address issues in daily life. Joshua, who said he grew up watching young black men in his Harlem neighborhood get roughed up by the police, was part of the group of students who built the Protect & Swerve website and app during a Bronx hackathon in January.\u201cIt creates a community for teens to gather together and learn and read about the topic and see it\u2019s not overhyped,\u201d he said.Coding has taken on particular importance in the Bronx, which has lagged behind every borough except Staten Island in attracting technology jobs, according to census data compiled by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. Of the estimated 148,598 people employed by technology companies across the city in 2014, just 3,093 of them, or 2 percent, worked in the Bronx.

{"Headline": "Varieties of Voodoo", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byAmerica\u2019s two big political parties are very different from each other, and one difference involves the willingness to indulge economic fantasies.Republicans routinely engage in deep voodoo, making outlandish claims about the positive effects of tax cuts for the rich. Democrats tend to be cautious and careful about promising too much, as illustrated most recently by the way Obamacare, which conservatives insisted would be a budget-buster, actually ended up being significantly cheaper than projected.But is all that about to change?That\u2019s harsh. But it\u2019s harsh for a reason.And the analysis is really something. The Republican candidates have been widely and rightly mocked for their escalating claims that they can achieve incredible economic growth, starting with Jeb Bush\u2019s promise to double growth to 4 percent and heading up from there. But Mr. Friedman outdoes the G.O.P. by claiming that the Sanders plan would produce 5.3 percent growth a year over the next decade.Sorry, but there\u2019s just no way to justify this stuff. For wonks like me, it is, frankly, horrifying.Still, these are numbers on a program that Mr. Sanders, even if he made it to the White House, would have little chance of enacting. So do they matter?Unfortunately, the answer is yes, for several reasons.One is that, as the economists warn, fuzzy math from the left would make it impossible to effectively criticize conservative voodoo.Beyond that, this controversy is an indication of a campaign, and perhaps a candidate, not ready for prime time. These claims for the Sanders program aren\u2019t just implausible, they\u2019re embarrassing to anyone remotely familiar with economic history (which says that raising long-run growth is very hard) and changing demography. They should have set alarm bells ringing, but obviously didn\u2019t.And there\u2019s an even larger issue here: Good ideas don\u2019t have to be sold with fairy dust.Mr. Sanders is calling for a large expansion of the U.S. social safety net, which is something I would like to see, too. But the problem with such a move is that it would probably create many losers as well as winners \u2014 a substantial number of Americans, mainly in the upper middle class, who would end up paying more in additional taxes than they would gain in enhanced benefits.By endorsing outlandish economic claims, the Sanders campaign is basically signaling that it doesn\u2019t believe its program can be sold on the merits, that it has to invoke a growth miracle to minimize the downsides of its vision. It is, in effect, confirming its critics\u2019 worst suspicions.What happens now? In the past, the Sanders campaign has responded to critiques by impugning the motives of the critics. But the authors of the critical letter that came out on Wednesday aren\u2019t just important economists, they\u2019re important figures in the progressive movement.The point is that if you dismiss the likes of Mr. Krueger or Ms. Romer as Hillary shills or compromised members of the \u201cestablishment,\u201d you\u2019re excommunicating most of the policy experts who should be your allies.So Mr. Sanders really needs to crack down on his campaign\u2019s instinct to lash out. More than that, he needs to disassociate himself from voodoo of the left \u2014 not just because of the political risks, but because getting real is or ought to be a core progressive value.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oil Output Freeze Has a Catch: Attracting OPEC Unity", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 As prices have dropped ever lower, smaller oil producing nations on precarious financial ground have regularly pushed their bigger brethren to stop pumping at record levels and help calm the markets.Now, even the giants are joining the chorus, with Saudi Arabia and Russia on Tuesday calling for a coordinated effort to freeze production.The plan, which also included Venezuela and Qatar, is a tentative sign that major oil producers are ready to cooperate. And it indicates how deeply prices have fallen, as Russia and Saudi Arabia have previously resisted tempering production.But whether the plan actually goes anywhere \u2014 or is just chatter meant to bolster prices \u2014 is an open debate. The four countries said they would proceed only if others commit.It is not an easy sell.A glut of crude oil on the markets is pushing the price of oil down to levels not seen since the global financial crisis.\u201cIt throws the ball in Iran\u2019s court, because they have said their output is going to increase,\u201d said Bhushan Bahree, an oil analyst at IHS, a research firm in Washington.The markets have little confidence in the plan.Brent Crude oil prices initially surged above $35.50 a barrel on discussion of a deal. But the details prompted a drop in prices below $33.\u201cThe market does not need a freeze. It needs a reduction,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research in Massachusetts. \u201cThey are not offering anything like that.\u201dHe added that the plan announced on Tuesday was in the early stages. \u201cPeople are talking and admitting to concerns about price levels,\u201d he said.Even a speculative deal represents a step forward, albeit a somewhat symbolic one.For months, the market chatter focused on the possibility of production cuts. But countries are generally less willing to cut, because doing so means giving up market share for their oil, which might be hard to win back.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.By holding steady, producers can help ease the pressure on the markets without making difficult decisions. Saudi Arabia, which has kept production at near record levels, cannot pump much more. Venezuela and Qatar have already been maintaining.Russia in January, the month chosen as the high-water mark for output, produced oil at a post-Soviet record of 10.88 million barrels a day. Maintaining this gusher through the year, far from limiting supply on the global market, would allow Russian oil companies to pump more this year than last.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t cost them much,\u201d said Ildar Davletshin, oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank. For Russia, \u201cthis deal only means maintaining the status quo.\u201dThe plan, even at this early stage, is a change of tack for Saudi Arabia. As oil prices have slumped, the country, the de facto leader of OPEC, has declined to cut its own production to try to manage the markets.The rare cooperation reflects the extreme weakness in oil, with prices falling about 70 percent in the last 18 months.Now, the biggest players feel the need to do something about production, or at least talk about it.Although Saudi Arabia still has more than $600 billion in financial reserves, the low price of oil has pushed it to make budget-cutting moves like raising the price of gasoline, electricity and water. Its government is also considering raising money through the sales of assets like airports and, possibly, a stake in the national oil company, Saudi Aramco.In Russia, oil and natural gas taxes make up about 50 percent of the federal budget. And President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia depends deeply on oil, to pay the public sector salaries and pensions that underpin his popularity. It also helps Mr. Putin keep up the army that gives Russia its geopolitical muscle.The next step in the process will be rallying support.The Venezuelan and Qatari oil ministers will meet with their counterparts in Iran and Iraq. They will also visit non-OPEC producers like Oman, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. Assuming all are on board, the oil glut could begin to ease, particularly with American output on the decline.\u201cIt is a positive step in the right direction in a transition period,\u201d said a gulf oil official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the nature of the talks. \u201cThe main driver is prices going below $30 a barrel, which was very disturbing.\u201dHe added that it was important that four major oil powers, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar, were involved in the discussions. He cited a \u201cclear road map\u201d of what countries to approach next, which he said could lead to a more formal agreement on production.Andrew E. Kramer reported from Moscow, and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Puerto Rican Officials Warn Congress of Major Defaults Without Restructuring", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Puerto Rico and its top advisers made their case in Washington on Friday for a law that would allow broad restructuring of the island\u2019s multibillion-dollar debt, saying that if Congress did not act soon, major defaults were likely this spring.The officials also said they knew that any legislative help would come at a stiff price: Puerto Rico would have to submit to a federal control board, something viewed by some on the island as colonialist-style interference.\u201cI think everybody has acknowledged that a control board is an essential feature,\u201d Jim Millstein, a financial adviser to the Puerto Rican government, said in a briefing for staff members of the House of Representatives, which is considering some form of legal help.For the last week, Puerto Rico has been meeting with creditor groups over the government\u2019s proposal to restructure about $49 billion of its $72 billion total debt. Time is short, officials said, because Puerto Rico cannot pay the big principal and interest payments that are due in May and June.The island has already defaulted on smaller amounts and is being sued by the affected creditors.Mr. Millstein and the other officials said they doubted they could get enough creditors to agree to the $49 billion restructuring without the kind of leverage that only an act of Congress could provide.Negotiating debt relief \u201cis a difficult endeavor in any circumstance,\u201d said Richard J. Cooper, a partner with Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, who is representing Puerto Rico in the talks. \u201cBut in the Puerto Rican circumstance, the challenge is quite enormous. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve asked for a restructuring authority.\u201dThe $49 billion debt that Puerto Rico hopes to restructure, most of it in the form of municipal bonds, was issued by 11 separate branches of the Puerto Rican government. It is held by a wide range of investors with diverse and competing interests. They are not only at odds with Puerto Rico, but also with one another, over whose bonds have priority.Some of the creditors have reason to give concessions, by accepting lower payments, for instance, but others want to hold out for payment in full. Although the bankruptcy code has tools for getting reluctant creditors to go along when a majority agrees to a settlement, Puerto Rico does not have access to bankruptcy.\u201cPuerto Rico will be thrust into litigation battles, or into a place where you can\u2019t predict what the future is,\u201d Mr. Cooper said.Mr. Millstein said he envisioned 11 different lawsuits by creditors of the 11 different branches of government, all moving at cross purposes through the courts and getting conflicting rulings by their respective judges. The process could easily drag on for five years, he said.\u201cThe impact of five years of litigation on the economy of Puerto Rico is obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a bad result. It would make the creditor recoveries even lower.\u201dAs Mr. Millstein spoke, a Treasury official, Antonio Weiss, made a similar argument at the Bipartisan Policy Center, which hosted a panel discussion on a legal framework for resolving Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis.\u201cWithout the backstop of a restructuring authority, our biggest concern is that a decade of recession could become another lost decade,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.The officials said it was not essential to grant Puerto Rico access to Chapter 9 bankruptcy, an approach that was considered last year but now appears to have been discarded. Instead, they said Congress could enact other measures to help Puerto Rico restructure its debts under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.The most important element would be a mechanism to bind holdouts to agreements by other creditors, they said.The restructuring plan would cover the $49 billion of debt backed by various types of taxes. Debts backed by user fees and rates, such as revenue bonds issued by Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority, would be handled separately.To determine how much of the $49 billion Puerto Rico\u2019s taxpayers could reasonably be expected to repay, the officials reviewed the debt burdens of taxpayers in states. They said that the typical state was spending about 5 percent of its tax revenue on payments of interest and principal to bondholders.But in Puerto Rico, they said, payments on this type of debt were now consuming an unsustainable 36 percent of the island\u2019s tax revenues.Next, they looked for a state with a financial profile roughly similar to Puerto Rico\u2019s, and decided that Hawaii came closest. In Hawaii, they said, debt payments consume 13 percent of annual tax revenue.\u201cWe thought, \u2018We\u2019ve got to be closer to Hawaii,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Millstein said. \u201cWe aimed at 15 percent. That would mean we can\u2019t have debt service in excess of $1.7 billion a year. That\u2019s our upper boundary.\u201dBy spreading $1.7 billion of annual debt-service payments over 30 years and discounting the total at a rate of 5 percent, they came to the conclusion that the taxpayers of Puerto Rico could carry $26.7 billion of debt instead of the current $49 billion.\u201cThat involves, therefore, a $22 billion haircut on the debt, which is huge,\u201d Mr. Millstein said. \u201cThere is no way to discount that.\u201dTo give the bondholders some hope of a better recovery, the restructuring proposal would replace investors\u2019 current bonds with two new bonds. One of them would have a fixed interest rate and a total par value of $26.7 billion. The other would make payments only to the extent that Puerto Rico recovers.The officials also sought to defuse a controversy over Puerto Rico\u2019s failure so far to produce audited financial statements for 2014 and 2015. Some members of Congress, especially Republicans, have warned they will be hard-pressed to assist Puerto Rico if it cannot present basic public records.Melba Acosta Febo, president of Puerto Rico\u2019s Government Development Bank, said at the Friday briefing that the financial statements were undergoing frequent revision as the island struggled to meet its various obligations.\u201cWe don\u2019t want people to think we\u2019re hiding something, because we\u2019re not hiding anything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to understand what we\u2019re living with right now.\u201dEven without the reports for 2014 and 2015, Ms. Acosta said anyone who wanted to understand Puerto Rico\u2019s finances could look at 15 prior years\u2019 worth of financial statements and they would see \u201cdeficit after deficit.\u201d\u201cTrust me, 2014\u2019s going to be the same,\u201d she said. \u201cThe situation is just as bad as ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What You Get When You Mix Chickens, China and Climate Change", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byOpinionIT was a gray, damp January afternoon a few years back when I visited the Jiangfeng wholesale poultry market on the outskirts of Guangzhou, in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. With its bleak wire enclosures and grid of cement paths, the place had the feel of a neglected 1970s-era urban zoo. And despite the comparatively narrow range of species there \u2014 chickens, geese, ducks, quails and partridges, mostly, with a smattering of rabbits and one large slumbering hog \u2014 it smelled like one, too. As I walked around, watched suspiciously by the market\u2019s handsome young security guards, a slimy mix of bird droppings and decomposing feathers slowly crept up the heels of my clogs.I\u2019d come to see their birthplace. Highly virulent and easily transmissible, these viruses emerge from open-air poultry farms and markets of the kind that stretch across Asia. Thanks to rising demand for chicken and other poultry, they\u2019ve been surfacing at an accelerated clip, causing nearly 150 percent more outbreaks in 2015 than in 2014. And in late 2014, one strain managed to cross the ocean that had previously prevented its spread into the Americas, significantly expanding its reach across the globe.Novel avian influenza viruses are mongrels, born when the influenza viruses that live harmlessly inside the bodies of wild ducks, geese and other waterfowl mix with those of domesticated animals like the ones at Jiangfeng, especially poultry but also pigs. It\u2019s possible to squelch their emergence. One way is to protect domesticated animals from the excreta of waterfowl, which can spread infection. But no such protections are in effect at markets such as Jiangfeng, which, like the rest of southern China\u2019s booming poultry industry, lies within the East Asian flyway, one of the world\u2019s most important waterbird migration routes.The poultry enclosures are open to the air. Droppings from the birds in cages as well as the birds flying overhead coat the floor. Stony-faced women with shovels push the mess into reeking, shoulder-height heaps of wet mush. Any virus that lurks in those piles can easily spread to the birds and the people who tend them. Up to 10 percent of poultry workers in Hong Kong, a study has found, have been exposed to bird flu. A fine dust of desiccated bird waste permeates the air. It settles on the leaves of the workers\u2019 makeshift vegetable plots behind the cages and on the window panes of their nearby flats.These markets and the unique viral ecology they enable are not new, as Malik Peiris, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, points out. But \u201cnow the situation is very different,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is being done on a much bigger scale than it was years ago.\u201dIt\u2019s not just the growing scale of the poultry industry in Asia that increases the probability that new avian influenza viruses will emerge. It\u2019s also the peculiar nature of the trade. About half of China\u2019s poultry trade traffics in live birds. That\u2019s because many Chinese consumers, wary of the safety of frozen meats, prefer to buy their chickens while they\u2019re still clucking. This creates a wealth of opportunities for new viral strains to spread and adapt to human bodies. Rather than visiting the sterile frozen-food aisles of grocery stores, shoppers crowd into poultry markets, exposing themselves to live birds and their viral-laden waste. And to serve the markets, more birds travel from farms into towns and cities, broadcasting viruses along the way.Most novel strains of avian influenza cannot infect humans. But some can, including three currently circulating strains: H5N1, a mash-up of viruses from geese and quail; H7N9, an amalgam of viruses from ducks, migratory birds and chickens; and H10N8, the product of viruses from wild birds, ducks and chickens. These viruses kill roughly 30 percent to 60 percent of their reported human victims. None can spread efficiently from one person to another, for example through sneezes and coughs, yet. But, given the opportunity, they will continue to evolve. And if they fine-tune their transmissibility among humans, the result will almost certainly be the kind of pandemic that epidemiologists most fear \u2014 one that could sicken a billion, kill 165 million and cost the global economy up to $3 trillion.For years, experts considered the Americas comfortably isolated from the virulent avian influenza viruses hatched on distant Asian poultry farms and markets. \u201cBeing in North America,\u201d said Carol Cardona, an avian disease expert at the University of Minnesota, \u201cwe weren\u2019t bothered.\u201dSome of the novel strains of avian influenza emerging from the Asian poultry trade can be picked up and spread far and wide by migratory birds. But the migratory routes of these birds don\u2019t cross the oceans. Even as they spread H5N1 and other pathogens into dozens of countries in Europe, Asia and Africa, the Americas remained untouched.That changed in late 2014, when a highly virulent avian influenza from Asia infiltrated North America. Its prospects here differed from those in Asia. Relatively few people are regularly exposed to live poultry and their waste. And farmers protect their domesticated flocks from pathogens by screening and controlling ventilation in barns and by regularly disinfecting farm equipment.Remarkably, none of these safeguards arrested the virus\u2019s inexorable spread. It was as if the virus \u201cknew the weaknesses of each individual farm,\u201d said Dr. Cardona, \u201cand found that and exploited it.\u201d Infected farms euthanized entire flocks by smothering them with carbon dioxide or firefighting foam. From December 2014 to last June, more than 48 million domesticated poultry in 21 states were slaughtered, the majority in waterfowl-rich Minnesota and Iowa, in what the Department of Agriculture called the worst animal disease epidemic in United States history. By the time it ended, a 12-foot-wide ridge of bird carcasses from a single farm in Iowa stretched more than six miles.Nobody knows just how this virus migrated over the oceans protecting the New World. But it\u2019s possible that another consequence of human appetites \u2014 climate change \u2014 played a role.While Asian and European birds don\u2019t migrate into North America, they can pass on viruses to birds that do. That could happen in a place where millions of birds from both the Old World and New World are instinctively drawn every spring: the Arctic lands surrounding the Bering Strait, known as Beringia.In the past, New and Old World birds in Beringia visited numerous ponds spread out across the tundra. But with temperatures in the Arctic rising twice as fast as anywhere else, conditions are changing rapidly, shifting the distribution of creatures and their pathogens. Historically segregated species are coming into novel kinds of contact. As birds are forced to migrate earlier and farther, feeding at new times and in new places, they overlap with other bird species in unprecedented ways that pathogens can exploit.Some already have. In 2012, a parasitic roundworm normally found some 1,000 miles southeast turned up in birds in western Alaska. In 2013, birds in Alaska suffered their first epidemic of avian cholera, which typically infects birds in the lower 48 states.WHILE the precise conditions under which the virulent Asian-origin virus arrived in North America in 2014 remain murky, what\u2019s known is this: Migratory birds picked up the virus from a poultry farm in Asia, carrying it with them into Siberia and Beringia for the breeding season. There, whether it was because of the new intimacy of the changed landscape, or because of something about the virus itself, the pathogen spread into other bird species, including those that would later head into North America, such as gyrfalcons and northern pintail ducks. By December 2014, they had brought the virus into British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, infecting wild and domesticated birds along the way and igniting the epidemic.If this strain had been one that could infect humans, a deadly and disruptive public health emergency would have ensued. Luckily, it was not.But there are more where it came from, at the growing interface between live poultry and humans on the other side of the Pacific. The workers at Jiangfeng, with their bare hands and tall boots, toil at its border. I watched them in the crowded enclosures as they lassoed birds around the neck with long, curved poles, stuffing them into plastic bins and loading them onto trucks. When a security guard caught me staring, I quickly walked away, footsteps muted by the membrane of bird waste encasing the soles of my shoes. Perhaps I could scrounge some bleach solution at my hotel with which to sterilize them, I thought to myself, although of course the birds whose lives and peregrinations are shaped by our appetites would not be so circumspect.As I padded toward the exit, a stream of vehicles crammed with fowl, and whatever viruses replicated inside their feathery bodies, steadily rumbled out of the market, bound for points unknown.An opinion article last Sunday on avian flu and the poultry industry in Asia included an outdated reference to Tyson Foods\u2019 expansion plans in China. In 2014, the company indefinitely suspended plans to double production in China.Advertisement"}

Mr. Sanders then hosted a town-hall-style meeting at the University of South Carolina. He was accompanied by State Representative Justin T. Bamberg of South Carolina, the lawyer for the family of Walter L. Scott, who was fatally shot last year by a police officer in North Charleston, S.C.; and Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, who died in New York in 2014 after the police used a chokehold to subdue him.Flanked by Ms. Garner and Mr. Bamberg, Mr. Sanders told the crowd of 300 mostly young white people that he wanted not only to overhaul the criminal justice system, but also make sure that police officers who break the law were held accountable.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of seeing videos, videos of Erica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad and other videos of unarmed people being killed by police officers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is going on now, especially with regard to African-Americans \u2014 this is not new. It has been going on decade, after decade, after decade. The only difference is the cellphone video. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only difference because what was going on in the past was never recorded and the police officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s testimony was accepted as truth. This video, this cellphone, makes all the difference in the world. So clearly as a nation we need criminal justice reform.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe senator also said he wanted to make sure that recidivism rates decrease and that people coming out of jails and prisons receive the job training needed to rebuild their lives. He also said that blacks in general need to be treated more fairly by the police, and he expressed disappointment in the way some police forces have systematically discriminated against blacks.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got to achieve the day when young black males and women can walk the streets without worrying about being harassed by a police officer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have talked to African-American Ph.D.s who get nervous when they have to travel or drive across the country. That should not be happening in the year 2016.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHe also pledged that if elected he would work to change things. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo count me in as somebody who if elected president will help lead the country in the fight against institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders made his remarks as he and his rival, Hillary Clinton, are scrambling for black support heading into the Feb. 27 primary in South Carolina, where Mrs. Clinton holds a lead in polls but  Mr. Sanders is working hard to gain ground. Mrs. Clinton was also giving a civil rights speech Tuesday, in Harlem.Mr. Sanders said he believed he could win the Democratic primary here. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn South Carolina, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how far behind we started,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have come a long way here in South Carolina. I think we are going to surprise people here.\u00e2\u0080\u009dEarlier in the day, at Allen University, Mr. Sanders highlighted that a high percentage of black children live in poverty (he said 35 percent)  and that an even higher percentage of young black people \u2014 51 percent \u2014 were unemployed.While delivering parts of his standard stump speech, Mr. Sanders also stressed that the \u00e2\u0080\u009crigged economy\u00e2\u0080\u009d was leading him to focus on the plight of blacks and propose changes to improve their conditions.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we talk about inequality, it goes without saying that the African-American community is suffering even more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders told the crowd of 400 mostly black people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when we talk about what is going on in this country, and the fact that virtually the entire nation suffered terribly as a result of the greed and reckless and illegal behavior of Wall Street, which drove this economy into a terrible recession, the African-American community suffered more and has recovered in a much less significant way.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTuesday evening, Mr. Sanders planned to travel to Morehouse College in Atlanta as part of his tour of historically black colleges and universities.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Again Puts F.C.C. General Counsel at Center Stage", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Every day for one month last fall, Jonathan Sallet, the general counsel at the Federal Communications Commission, sneaked into a small, windowless office at the agency, its location undisclosed except to senior staff.From 6 a.m. until early evening, with Bach streaming in the background, he worked mostly alone, marking up stacks of law books and standing in front of a lectern. His job: Defend in court the F.C.C.\u2019s most contentious policy \u2014 rules to classify broadband Internet providers as utilities, widely called net neutrality.\u201cI did nothing for one month but prepare,\u201d Mr. Sallet said in an interview. \u201cI talked a lot to the wall.\u201dHis arguments, though \u2014 like nearly all of his actions for the agency \u2014 have had far-reaching reverberations.In his two years as the F.C.C.\u2019s general counsel, Mr. Sallet, 63, has taken center stage in some of the most divisive debates in Washington. He helped shape and then defend the net neutrality law. His input helped kill the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger last year. In recent days, the cable industry has closely tracked his thinking about a merger between Charter and Time Warner Cable, concerned about a similar result.\u201cTypically a general counsel is like an administrator,\u201d said Reed Hundt, a former Democratic chairman of the F.C.C. \u201cBut in Jon you have an administrator who is also a policy maven and political strategist.\u201dMr. Sallet will draw more of the spotlight in coming months, a period that could shape the tech and cable landscape for years to come. The agency is set to take a position on the Charter and Time Warner Cable deal, as well as vote to open the market of set-top cable boxes to new competitors. And the decision in the net neutrality case, the one he prepared so long and hard for, is also expected.Each weekday morning, Mr. Sallet is among a small cadre of top advisers who meet at 8:45 to discuss policy and strategy with Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C. Mr. Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable and wireless industries, knows firsthand how the agency\u2019s actions can be derailed by the pressure of lobbying by the powerful businesses he used to represent.\u201cHe is a multifaceted talent with the ability to see all angles of an issue and provide sage counsel,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said of Mr. Sallet.In the recent interview in his office, where the slim and soft-spoken Mr. Sallet keeps a keyboard and a guitar, he said swift changes in how people communicate and consume media have thrust the agency \u2014 and him \u2014 into the spotlight.For decades, Mr. Sallet has been an inside player in telecom policies. After graduating from law school at the University of Virginia and working as a clerk for Justice Lewis F. Powell, he spent 30 years representing companies like MCI and working on tech policy at the Commerce Department.While at the Commerce Department, he was introduced to the Mosaic web browser by Vice President Al Gore. That was in 1993, the same year Mr. Wheeler showed him a demonstration of a wireless phone.These days, Mr. Sallet said, policies related to smartphones and the Internet get such strong reactions that they require more than a broad view of economics and markets. They also require an ability to navigate pointed political criticism.That climate makes sticking to a set of principles all the more important, he said. For him, those ideas are that networks should be open for consumers and that the F.C.C. should \u201ctake actions to avoid a society of haves and have-nots.\u201dNet neutrality \u201cinvolves competition issues, the mergers are quite clearly about competition,\u201d he said.Mr. Sallet\u2019s stance has not slowed criticism. The F.C.C. recently proposed an overhaul of the TV set-top box market, a move that could open a new area of business for tech giants like Google and Amazon. Cable and media companies are fighting the plan, saying it would erode the core of their business.In addition, some academics criticized the agency\u2019s decision last spring to block Comcast\u2019s merger with Time Warner Cable, after a review led by Mr. Sallet. Critics said the companies did not compete in the same markets and would not reduce the number of options for consumers.The review of Charter\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Cable is expected to yield a decision this spring. Though analysts are generally confident it will be approved, the agency is likely to attach several requirements that ensure the merged company doesn\u2019t use its size to keep programmers from offering content to streaming providers.The harshest criticisms have been for Mr. Sallet\u2019s role in advising and writing up net neutrality policy \u2014 with technology and telecom companies arguing that Mr. Sallet, a Democrat, has made too many decisions based on politics.In October 2014, Mr. Wheeler, also a Democrat, introduced rules that could have let cable and telecom firms carve the Internet into various high-quality and low-quality tiers, according to some legal experts and net neutrality advocates. Top officials at the agency were reluctant to create stronger rules that ban such practices by regulating Internet service providers like utilities.The pressure intensified the next month, when President Obama took the unusual step of saying that broadband service providers should be treated like utilities, subject to rules akin to those placed on phone services. Soon after, Mr. Wheeler directed Mr. Sallet to rewrite the draft rules to more aggressively regulate the Internet service providers.\u201cUltimately Jon is the lawyer and Wheeler is his client,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.To complicate the situation, the rules were almost guaranteed to face strong legal challenges. Telecom and cable companies immediately sued to overturn the regulations, and the case was handed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the same court that had struck down net neutrality rules twice before.Mr. Sallet made his arguments defending the latest rules in December, winning plaudits from all sides for his work in the courtroom. A decision is expected this spring. Other legal challenges to the policy are likely.Mr. Sallet and his supporters said his positions, and those of the F.C.C., should not come as a surprise. Mr. Sallet and top advisers have talked frequently about the agency\u2019s push to keep big telecom and cable firms \u2014 which control the video and broadband pipes into homes \u2014 from stifling new technologies.There are even echoes of this philosophy in a speech he helped write in 1994 for Mr. Gore. In the speech, at University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Gore called for an overhaul of rules for phone and cable communications to encourage the development of the coming Internet economy.\u201cWe look back now and see that was incredibly prescient,\u201d Mr. Sallet said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Both Parties Lost the White Middle Class", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONG after the dust settles in Iowa \u2014 and New Hampshire, and even the 2016 campaign itself \u2014 one question will remain: Why, after decades of supporting the liberal and conservative establishments, did the white middle-class abandon them? Wherever Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders end up, their candidacies represent a major shift in American politics. Since World War II our political culture has been organized around the needs, fears and aspirations of white middle-class voters in ways that also satisfied the interests of the rich and powerful. That\u2019s no longer true.As we know, the rich are now quite a bit richer. In itself, this need not disrupt the old political consensus. More decisive is the fact that the white middle class is in decline, both economically and culturally.This story of decline is often told in racial and ethnic terms: White America is being displaced by a multicultural America, and especially on the right, voters are retreating to racist posturing. There may be some truth to this story, but for the most part it\u2019s a huge distraction.In fact, the real cleavage is not interracial, but intra-racial: The populism we\u2019re seeing stems entirely from the collision of whites who flourish in the global economy \u2014 and amid the cultural changes of the last 50 years \u2014 with those who don\u2019t.And while we\u2019ve heard a lot about the economic decline of the middle class, the cultural decline of the white middle class isn\u2019t discussed nearly as often. It should be.First, there are the consequences of the great success of the upper middle class, which today lives in a separate world of well-manicured neighborhoods with good schools, intact families and cultural confidence. We compliment ourselves that a generally meritocratic system is open to far more people than was true 50 years ago. And it has been \u2014 but the resulting culture of ambition paradoxically erodes middle-class confidence. Today, the vast middle of the middle fears that unless you\u2019re on the way up, you\u2019re on the way down.And it\u2019s not just competitiveness that is eroding the white middle class. When I was coming of age in the 1970s, drug use was already undermining the white middle class. Since then marriage rates among high school-educated whites have declined and illegitimacy has increased. A priest I know serves three small-town parishes in rural, white Pennsylvania. I asked about his pastoral challenges. The biggest: Grandparents parenting their grandchildren, as their own children are too messed up to raise them.Cultural instability compounds economic instability. A person near the median in our society is on shaky ground. He feels that what was once reliable is now eroding. This is as much a source of today\u2019s middle-class anxiety as stagnant household incomes.What\u2019s striking \u2014 and crucial for understanding our populist moment \u2014 is the fact that the leadership cadres of both parties aren\u2019t just unresponsive to this anxiety. They add to it.The intelligentsia on the left rarely lets a moment pass without reminding us of the demographic eclipse of white middle-class voters. Sometimes, those voters are described as racists, or derided as dull suburbanites who lack the \u00e9lan of the new urban \u201ccreative class.\u201d The message: White middle-class Americans aren\u2019t just irrelevant to America\u2019s future, they\u2019re in the way.Conservatives are no less harsh. Pundits ominously predict that the \u201cinnovators\u201d are about to be overwhelmed by a locust blight of \u201ctakers.\u201d The message: If it weren\u2019t for successful people like us, middle-class people like you would be doomed. And if you\u2019re not an entrepreneurial \u201cproducer,\u201d you\u2019re in the way.Is it any surprise that white middle-class voters are in rebellion?Democratic and Republican Party establishments appeal to the interests of these voters, promising to protect them (Democrats) or spur growth that will renew economic opportunity (Republicans). But these appeals miss the point.Our political history since the end of World War II has turned on the willingness of white middle-class voters to rally behind great causes in league with the wealthy and political elite: Resist Communism! Send a man to the moon! Overcome racism! Protect the environment! Today, white middle-class voters want to be reassured that they can play an active role in politics. They want someone to appeal to their sense of political self-worth, not just their interests.This is precisely what Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders offer. Mr. Trump speaks about restoring American greatness, rhetorical gestures akin to Barack Obama\u2019s vague 2008 slogan, \u201cYes, we can.\u201d We can mock both as empty. But voters who feel disempowered and marginalized latch on to this promise. They want to be partners with the rich and powerful in defining our future as a country, not recipients of their benevolent ministrations, which explains why they\u2019re untroubled by Mr. Trump\u2019s great wealth.Mr. Sanders also appeals to the strong desire that the white middle class has to recover its central role in the national project. While he attracts support from a wealthier stratum of the middle class than Mr. Trump, the appeal is the same. He asks them to join him in fundamentally remaking our political economy. We can dismiss his socialism as an unworkable throwback, but he\u2019s doing something our political establishment can\u2019t or won\u2019t: asking middle-class voters to undertake a nation-defining transformation.If these candidates have traction, it\u2019s because over the last two decades our political elites, themselves almost entirely white, have decided, for different reasons, that the white middle class has no role to play in the multicultural, globalized future they envision, a future that they believe they will run. This primary season will show us whether or not they\u2019re right.R.R. Reno is the editor of First Things.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bridging a Digital Divide That Leaves Schoolchildren Behind", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byMcALLEN, Tex. \u2014 At 7 p.m. on a recent Wednesday, Isabella and Tony Ruiz were standing in their usual homework spot, on a crumbling sidewalk across the street from the elementary school nearest to their home.\u201cI got it. I\u2019m going to download,\u201d Isabella said to her brother Tony as they connected to the school\u2019s wireless hot spot and watched her teacher\u2019s math guide slowly appear on the cracked screen of the family smartphone.Isabella, 11, and Tony, 12, were outside the school because they have no Internet service at home \u2014 and connectivity is getting harder. With their mother, Maria, out of work for months and money coming only from their father, Isaias, who washes dishes, the family had cut back on almost everything, including their cellphone data plan.So every weeknight, the siblings stood outside the low-slung school, sometimes for hours, to complete homework for the sixth grade.\u201cThere\u2019s just no funds left,\u201d Maria Ruiz said later outside the family\u2019s white clapboard rental home. \u201cIt worries me because it will become more important to have Internet when they have to do more homework.\u201dThe challenge is felt across the nation. Some students in Coachella, Calif., and Huntsville, Ala., depend on school buses that have free Wi-Fi to complete their homework. The buses are sometimes parked in residential neighborhoods overnight so that children can connect and continue studying. In cities like Detroit, Miami and New Orleans, where as many as one-third of homes do not have broadband, children crowd libraries and fast-food restaurants to use free hot spots.\u201cThis is what I call the homework gap, and it is the cruelest part of the digital divide,\u201d said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of the commission who has pushed to overhaul the Lifeline program.The Lifeline plan has drawn strong criticism from the two Republicans among the five F.C.C. commissioners, and from some lawmakers, who say the program, which was introduced in 1985 to bring phone services to low-income families, has been wasteful and was abused.In 2008, when the commission added subsidies for mobile-phone services to discounts for landlines, some homes started double-billing the program, and the budget for the fund ballooned. Various investigations, including a government review in early 2015, questioned the effectiveness of the phone program and whether the commission had done enough to monitor for abuse.But advocacy groups for children and minorities have backed the F.C.C. plan, saying it will be important in preventing students from falling further behind their peers.\u201cFor young people, broadband is like the air we breathe,\u201d said James P. Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group known for its reviews and age-based ratings of videos, websites and books that has campaigned for the changes in Lifeline. His organization earns licensing fees from Internet service providers that may stand to gain from the expansion of the F.C.C. program.\u201cIt\u2019s essential for school and future job opportunity,\u201d Mr. Steyer said. \u201cSo it is desperately important that we make broadband affordable for low-income families and minorities, because we can\u2019t be a society of haves and have-nots.\u201dFew places better illustrate the challenges faced by students without broadband than McAllen, in South Texas, and the surrounding area in the Rio Grande Valley. Poverty rates in the region are high. In some towns, as many as 40 percent of households have no access to the Internet, among the lowest access rates in the country, according to a 2014 study by the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.Brigida Castro, who lives in a concrete home off a one-lane road in the town of Donna, said the main local Internet provider had told her it could not bring service to her street. Her daughter, Perla, 16, is a junior at a high school in the South Texas Independent School District geared toward directing students into medical professions. The school district has put Wi-Fi on more than 100 school buses to help students who do not have access at home, and Perla relies on school bus rides \u2014 nearly three hours a day \u2014 to finish homework.\u201cI could go home on a shorter bus route, but I want to get A\u2019s,\u201d Perla said.Marla M. Guerra, superintendent of the school district, said that it had little choice but to require more technology in class work, even though many families did not have broadband access.\u201cWe try to accommodate those without access in every way we can,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we can\u2019t hold back on our use of technology in the classrooms because we have to prepare our children for the world that is waiting for them.\u201dIn McAllen Independent School District, which has 33 schools and 25,000 students, each location runs wireless hot spots 24 hours a day so that students can sit in parking lots or crouch against school walls to do homework into the night.Some municipalities are trying other solutions. The city of Pharr, with the help of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has proposed using local tax funds to bring Internet service to all homes and to put free hot spots around town.But the biggest boon would be the Lifeline overhaul.\u201cThis is a population tailor-made for this F.C.C. plan,\u201d said Jordana Barton, a community development director for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. \u201cLack of broadband has inhibited their ability to participate in the economy, and over and over, what I see is the homework divide that is keeping children behind.\u201dTeachers do their part to help. In the McAllen school district, an eighth-grade math teacher, Sandra Guerra, recently chatted online with six students who were stuck on a problem about polynomials. She sent them a digital photo of the equation and detailed steps to solve the problem.The next morning, knowing some students had no Internet at home and were working off worksheets she had prepared for them, Ms. Guerra started class with a review of the problem that had troubled other students the night before.\u201cI have 50 minutes with them in class, and I can\u2019t cover everything in that time, so the learning continues when they are home and they can go online,\u201d Ms. Guerra said.Not every teacher is as understanding. Yunuen Reyes, 17, a high school senior in Pharr, does not have Internet at home and typically has three hours of homework a day that require research and collaboration with classmates online. Some assignments and take-home exams are due by midnight and must be submitted over the web.So after her shift working at the drive-up window of a Chinese restaurant, Yunuen scrambles to find Wi-Fi at a nearby Starbucks or at fast-food restaurants. Often, she goes to the home of a friend who lets her use the family computer and Internet connection. Recently, she got a C on an English assignment that she had not completed before the deadline to submit it online.\u201cIt\u2019s stressful and embarrassing to keep asking my friend,\u201d Yunuen said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep bothering her. But I also don\u2019t want my teachers to think I\u2019m making excuses.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Should Just Say Yes to a $15 Minimum Wage", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byEditorialOn the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has eloquently defined workers\u2019 rights as human rights. She could assert both more forcefully by championing a stronger federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.So far, Mrs. Clinton has proposed lifting the federal hourly minimum to $12, from its current level of $7.25 an hour. Bernie Sanders is pushing for $15. Under both proposals, the increase would be phased in over five years, which means 2022 at the earliest, assuming that legislation to raise the minimum becomes law in 2017, the first year of the next president\u2019s term.Reasonable people can disagree about the ideal level for the minimum wage. There is no doubt, however, that the longer it takes to get to a new minimum, the higher it should be, and that by any political or practical calculation, 2022 is a long way off. This alone argues for Mr. Sanders\u2019s more generous proposal.Mrs. Clinton has argued that $15 might be too high for employers in low-wage states, causing them to lay off workers or make fewer hires. There is no proof for or against that position. There is solid empirical evidence showing that moderate increases in the minimum wage do not harm employment. But there is no similarly rigorous research on the effects of large increases, mainly because there haven\u2019t been very many, either in the United States or internationally.The question is what to do in the face of uncertainty. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s argument for $12 overlooks the fact that a long phase-in would give employers and the economy time to adjust to a higher, $15 minimum.Her minimum-wage proposal is also inconsistent with her larger agenda to increase middle-class wages. Historically, a robust minimum is one that equals at least half the average wage for typical workers, recently $21 an hour. Assuming Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan raised middle-class wages \u2014 through profit-sharing, paid sick and family leave, updated overtime-pay rules, fair-scheduling policies and labor-law enforcement \u2014 then $15 in 2022 would be a logical goal for the federal minimum wage.Worse, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s stance misses the big picture, which is that the risk in keeping the minimum too low is bigger than the risk of raising it too high. One reason a third of Americans today live in or near poverty is that many jobs in the United States do not pay enough to live on. This is due in part to the steady erosion in the minimum wage \u2014 even as labor productivity, corporate profits and executive compensation have gone up. A raise to $12 an hour in 2022, or a mere $24,000 a year for a full-time job, would only lock in that dynamic. Even a $15 minimum works out to only $31,000 a year.Economic obstacles are not standing in the way of a $15-an-hour minimum wage. Misplaced caution and political timidity are. The sooner Mrs. Clinton overcomes those, the stronger her candidacy will be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senator Rob Portman to Oppose Pacific Trade Pact", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In a clear sign of the trouble facing President Obama\u2019s trade pact with Pacific Rim nations, one of the most influential congressional Republicans on trade issues announced on Thursday that he would oppose it unless significant changes were made.The lawmaker, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who was a trade ambassador under President George W. Bush, objects to the accord\u2019s provisions on currency manipulation, auto parts and pharmaceutical industry protections. Lawmakers in both parties have raised the same issues, but Mr. Portman\u2019s authority on trade is certain to carry extra weight with colleagues.Democrats especially complain that the accord lacks enforcement measures against countries like Japan, Vietnam or Malaysia, for example, that are suspected of devaluing their currency to make their exports cheaper. The Ford Motor Company, which has plants in Ohio, also strongly opposes the trade agreement on this basis.The separate objection of many Republicans, that the pact weakens patent protections for pharmaceutical companies to make drugs more affordable and accessible globally, has been led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate committee responsible for trade, a longtime proponent of the drug industry.Mr. Portman took his stand a day after the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership accord was formally signed by the countries\u2019 trade ministers in Auckland, New Zealand, four months after they concluded years of negotiations.Now the pact \u2014 the largest regional agreement in history, linking the United States with developed countries like Australia and Canada as well as developing ones like Brunei and Malaysia \u2014 is subject to approval in each nation. Only Malaysia has ratified it so far.But the overriding question is the one a reporter put to Mr. Obama\u2019s trade ambassador, Michael B. Froman, right after the signing ceremony: \u201cWill it get through Congress?\u201dMr. Froman told the assemblage that despite opposition among some interest groups and lawmakers, \u201cI am confident that at the end of the day\u201d members of Congress will support the deal because of its benefits for their constituents and for the economy over all.Mr. Portman, however, made it plain that he would take some persuading \u2014 and only if the pact were to change. \u201cWe need to do better for the sake of American workers who are depending on the administration to give them a level playing field,\u201d he said in a written statement, adding, \u201cI cannot support the T.P.P. in its current form because it doesn\u2019t provide that level playing field.\u201dMr. Portman\u2019s position is not a total surprise because he has criticized the agreement before. Also, he is running for re-election in November in a state where opposition to global trade runs strong, all the more so in a year when presidential candidates in both parties are stoking anti-trade sentiment.Yet he has a long record of support for international trade agreements in the Senate and the House, and as Mr. Bush\u2019s trade ambassador, when he negotiated bilateral accords and helped win passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.Given that record, Mr. Portman\u2019s Democratic rival for the Senate seat, former governor and congressman Ted Strickland, said Mr. Portman\u2019s opposition now to the Pacific nations\u2019 pact is disingenuous. \u201cThe difference between Senator Portman and myself when it comes to trade is clear: He voted for eight trade deals and I opposed them,\u201d Mr. Strickland said in a statement. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, this week reiterated privately to business lobbyists and conservative activists that he opposes bringing the Pacific pact to a Senate vote before the election. That means action in Congress in December at the earliest, in a lame-duck session.Republicans worry about losing their narrow majority, given the vulnerability of several senators, including Mr. Portman. But Mr. McConnell tells business groups supporting the pact that it would be rejected if brought to a vote sooner, according to representatives of those groups.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Launches Rocket Seen as Cover for a Missile Test", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Defying warnings of tougher sanctions from Washington, North Korea launched a rocket on Sunday that Western experts believe is part of a program to develop intercontinental ballistic missile technologies.The rocket blasted off from Tongchang-ri, the North\u2019s main satellite launch site near its northwestern border with China, a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said.President Park Geun-hye of South Korea called an emergency meeting of top national security advisers on Sunday to address the launch, her office said. South Korea, the United States and Japan also requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry called the launch a \u201cmajor provocation, threatening not only the security of the Korean Peninsula, but that of the region and the United States as well.\u201d Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, said it was \u201ca flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions.\u201dNorth Korea earlier notified the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations agency overseeing navigation safety, that it planned to launch a rocket between Sunday and Feb. 14 to put a satellite into orbit. After the launch on Sunday, North Korea said that it had succeeded in doing so, and South Korea acknowledged that it appeared to be the case.Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whose family has ruled the country for seven decades, wanted to show off advances in his missile and nuclear programs just before the Feb. 16 birthday of his father, Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011. Pyongyang has timed some of its earlier nuclear and rocket tests to major national anniversaries.But the United States and its allies consider the program a pretext for developing technologies that can also be used to build an intercontinental ballistic missile. The North\u2019s launch of a three-stage rocket on Sunday, after a similar test in 2012, showed that the country was determined to acquire them despite sanctions imposed by the Security Council.With the launch, North Korea was also defying China, which had issued strong appeals not to proceed. In flouting China, the North\u2019s only treaty ally, Mr. Kim was showing the ultimate disrespect to the government that has continued to trade with him, including sending oil that keeps the military and the rudimentary economy working.In a statement released on Sunday after Japan, South Korea and the United States pressed for firmer action, China called for calm and said the major powers should \u201cact cautiously.\u201dThe Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said, \u201cChina expresses regret over the launch with ballistic missile technology carried out by North Korea despite wide opposition from the international community.\u201dDialogue was the best solution, the statement said, echoing a long-held position by Beijing that talks with North Korea that include the United States and China should be resumed.South Korea said the launch on Sunday showed that efforts to end the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs through dialogue no longer worked.\u201cThey just gave North Korea time to advance its nuclear capabilities,\u201d Cho Tae-yong, first deputy director of national security of the South Korean presidential office, said in a statement.Mr. Cho said \u201cthe only way to make North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons development\u201d was through \u201ceffective and strong sanctions.\u201d\u201cWe will continue to apply pressure so North Korea has no option but to change,\u201d he said.The North\u2019s latest move is sure to add impetus to the United States\u2019 call for tougher sanctions and for a more vigorous missile defense for its allies in the region.Hours after the North declared the success of its launch on Sunday, the United States and South Korea jointly announced that they had begun discussing deployment of the American Thaad ballistic missile defense system. China, the South\u2019s largest trade partner, has warned it would consider the system\u2019s presence in the South a threat to its security.Washington and its regional allies, South Korea and Japan, deployed Aegis destroyers and PAC-3 missile interceptors in case debris from the rocket hurtled toward them. North Korea is widely believed to have at least several nuclear weapons. Although North Korea can learn much about the technology to build ballistic missiles from satellite launches, putting a satellite into orbit does not guarantee an ability to deliver a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile.North Korea has never tested a ballistic-missile version of its Unha-series rockets. After four nuclear tests by the North, Western analysts were still unsure whether the country had mastered the technology to build a warhead small enough to mount on a long-range missile.They were also debating how close the country had come to acquiring the ability to build a warhead that could survive the intense heat while re-entering the atmosphere, as well as a guidance system capable of delivering a warhead close to a target.The Unha-3 rocket, if modified to carry a 2,200-pound warhead instead of a satellite, could have enough range to reach Alaska and possibly Hawaii, David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote in his blog on Friday.Somini Sengupta contributed reporting from the United Nations, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Little Separates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in Tight Race in Iowa", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byThe close results were deeply unnerving to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as well as her advisers, some of whom had expressed growing confidence in recent days that they had recaptured political momentum after weeks when Mr. Sanders was drawing huge crowds and rising in the polls. The Clintons had appeared optimistic at rallies over the weekend, thanking Iowans for their support as much as urging them to turn out to vote.The Clinton team was counting on its huge, well-trained army of volunteers, covering all of Iowa\u2019s 1,681 voting precincts, to counter the enormous enthusiasm of voters who jammed into events to hear Mr. Sanders. But his well-financed Iowa organization was able to convert the energy of his crowds into voters on Monday night, as he drew huge numbers of first-time caucusgoers, young people and liberals who responded to his rallying cry against the nation\u2019s \u201crigged economy.\u201dThe virtual tie between the two candidates instantly raised the stakes for their next face-off, the primary next Tuesday in New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders holds a solid lead in polls there and has the advantage of being from Vermont; candidates from neighboring states have won the state\u2019s primary in recent decades, and Mr. Sanders is admired in the state.Clinton advisers said late Monday night that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton were discussing bringing on additional staff members to strengthen her campaign operation now that a pitched battle may lie ahead against Mr. Sanders. The advisers said they did not know if a significant staff shakeup was at hand, but they said that the Clintons were disappointed with Monday night\u2019s result and wanted to ensure that her organization, political messaging and communications strategy were in better shape for the contests to come.At her caucus night party here, Mrs. Clinton sought to put the best face on a tight result that had nearly half of Democrats voting against her. \u201cAs I stand here tonight breathing a big sigh of relief \u2014 thank you, Iowa!\u201d she said, joined on stage by Mr. Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.Mr. Sanders, who spoke shortly after she finished, laughed as his crowd chanted \u201cfeel the Bern,\u201d his campaign\u2019s unofficial slogan. \u201cThank you \u2014 Iowa, thank you!\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Noting that he began his Iowa campaign with \u201cno name recognition\u201d and \u201cno money,\u201d Mr. Sanders drew ecstatic cheers as he said he took on the Clintons \u2014 \u201cthe most powerful political organization in the United States of America\u201d \u2014 and drove them into a tie.\u201cI think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment, and by the way, to the media establishment,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThat is, given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.\u201dThe results suggested that Mr. Sanders would be a strong opponent of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s for a long time. The voters sent a clear message that income inequality weighed on their minds, with more than one in four Democratic voters saying the issue was the most important facing the nation, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls.Mr. Sanders\u2019s strong performance in Iowa was a significant milestone in a campaign in which he began 40 percentage points behind Mrs. Clinton when they both declared their candidacies last spring. Many Democrats privately dismissed Mr. Sanders as a left-wing fringe candidate who had no real chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton anywhere other than his home state of Vermont, where his democratic socialist politics were not as exotic as many Democratic Party leaders found them.But Mr. Sanders proved to be a rigorously disciplined candidate, delivering the same powerful message inveighing against establishment politics, Wall Street and the benefits enjoyed by the wealthy and the well-connected.The Clintons are now hoping for a surprise performance in New Hampshire, where they have campaigned and connected with voters since 1992, when Mr. Clinton came in a strong second place in the state\u2019s primary, and Mrs. Clinton won the 2008 primary over Barack Obama, then a senator who had earlier won the Iowa caucuses.Steve Duprey, a Republican national committeeman from New Hampshire, said if Mrs. Clinton ekes out a clear victory in Iowa, however small, it would give her \u201csome much-needed momentum in New Hampshire \u2014 and if she can build that into a New Hampshire win, I think it will start the death rattle of the Sanders campaign.\u201dGeorge Maglaras, a Clinton supporter who is a commissioner of Strafford County, N.H., predicted that Mrs. Clinton would have a lock on the Democratic nomination if she won New Hampshire on top of a close race in Iowa.\u201cAny other combination means we are in for a longer nomination process than many had anticipated early on,\u201d Mr. Maglaras, a former mayor of Dover, N.H., added. Referring to New Hampshire residents, he said, \u201cIf they vote with their heads it will be Clinton. If they vote with their hearts it will be Sanders.\u201dAfter losing the Iowa caucuses in 2008 to Mr. Obama, another insurgent candidate who she led in the polls for months, Mrs. Clinton vowed to campaign differently here this time around, holding small events with handpicked voters to learn about the lives and issues for voters here \u2014 and to be shown doing so, humbly and thoughtfully, in Iowa television newscasts. While she long said that Iowa would be a tight race, and improved upon her 2008 performance when she won 29.5 percent and fell to third place behind John Edwards, Mrs. Clinton nonetheless hoped that she would start exorcising the ghosts of 2008 with a victory here, and she campaigned hard for it.Mrs. Clinton, 68, performed well on Monday night among women, moderates and older Iowans who rallied behind her promises to build on President Obama\u2019s policies and fight for the needs of families. Her shifts to the left on trade, the environment and gay marriage helped her win over Democrats, though not the many liberals and young people who mistrusted her pragmatic style of politics and her ties to wealthy interests and Wall Street.11 PhotosMr. Sanders, 74, drew strong support from first-time Democratic caucusgoers, who accounted for more than four in 10 voters, according to polls conducted by Edison Research of voters as they entered caucus locations throughout the state Monday evening. But these voters made up a smaller share of the Democratic electorate on Monday than they did in 2008, when 57 percent of Democratic caucusgoers were first-timers. Mr. Sanders was also widely supported by younger voters and independents, but voters 65 and older accounted for about three in 10 Democratic voters and they strongly favored Mrs. Clinton.As the results trickled in, the third candidate in the Democratic contest, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, announced that he was pulling out of the race.With Iowa accounting for only 1 percent of the delegates at stake in the Democratic nomination race, Mrs. Clinton is already far ahead of Mr. Sanders in the delegate count that matters most, given her support from several hundred superdelegates who count toward the nomination. The Clinton campaign has expressed confidence to allies that she can afford to lose Iowa, as well as the New Hampshire primary because of her strength in big-state, delegate-rich primaries and in the South .Both candidates planned to fly to New Hampshire overnight and planned to resume campaigning there on Tuesday.Mr. Sanders developed a better-financed operation here than the Clinton team expected, thanks to robust online fund-raising that netted $20 million in January alone, compared with $37 million for Mrs. Clinton in the last three months of 2015. (The Clinton campaign on Monday declined requests for its January fund-raising number.)Sanders advisers say he now has both money \u2014 $28.3 million on hand, compared with $38 million for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 and the political momentum to compete vigorously not just in New Hampshire but in upcoming primaries in South Carolina, Massachusetts, and Georgia and caucuses in Nevada, Minnesota, and elsewhere.Amy Chozick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Sam Brownback, a Republican, and the state Legislature, which will probably have to find tens of millions of dollars in its budget for additional education funding.Kansas is already facing deep fiscal woes in the wake of Mr. Brownback\u2019s decision to cut taxes, which he predicted would help bolster the state economy. Revenue has fallen short of projections and he and lawmakers are scrambling to fill a roughly $200 million budget gap before the close of the session.John S. Robb, a lawyer for the school districts and parents who are suing the state, estimated that the Legislature would have to add $73 million to the system to satisfy the court.The Legislature\u2019s \u201cchosen path during the 2016 session will ultimately determine whether Kansas students will be treated fairly and the schoolhouse doors will be open to them in August,\u201d the ruling said.\u201cIt really came down to our Supreme Court saying, once again, that the state has not done enough to address the inequities in our finance system,\u201d Mark Tallman, a lobbyist with the Kansas Association of School Boards, said in an interview. \u201cWe hope that the Legislature will respond to the court in a timely fashion.\u201dIn Topeka, the state capital, Republican lawmakers accused the court of judicial overreach.\u201cThe court has once again demonstrated no misgivings on interjecting itself in legislative proceedings and holding Kansas taxpayers and Kansas schoolchildren hostage,\u201d Ray Merrick, the Republican speaker of the House, said in a statement.In a statement, Mr. Brownback said, \u201cKansas has among the best schools in the nation and an activist Kansas Supreme court is threatening to shut them down. We will review this decision closely and work with the Legislature to ensure the continued success of our great Kansas schools.\u201dThe ruling extends a longstanding battle in Kansas over public education. A similar showdown between the Legislature and the Kansas Supreme Court in 2005 resulted in lawmakers agreeing to increase per-pupil spending in schools, but the additional funding stopped amid the national financial crisis.Their temporary solution was to pass a bill that replaced a previous formula with one that used block grants to allocate funds. Supporters of block grants say that they give school districts flexibility to spend where they need it most. But the plan was immediately criticized by education advocates for essentially cutting money intended for poorer districts.Tom Burroughs, the House minority leader, said in a statement that Mr. Brownback and his allies were guilty of mismanaging the state. But \u201crather than take responsibility for our state\u2019s stagnant economy and self-inflicted budget crisis, Republicans chose to blame public education,\u201d he said.Mr. Robb said the ruling was \u201ca great day for the kids in Kansas.\u201d\u201cThe court keeps telling the Legislature to follow the Constitution, and the Legislature keeps wiggling out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now the court has put an absolute line in the sand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Agency Proposes Limits on Airlines\u2019 Carbon Emissions", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byAfter more than six years of negotiations, the global aviation industry agreed on Monday to the first binding limits on carbon dioxide emissions, tackling the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas pollution.The deal is the latest in a series of international efforts to address climate change. Until now, airplanes had not been included in any international climate change deals, like the recent Paris Agreement, or the Montreal Protocol, expected to be completed later this year.The proposed new rules, announced in Montreal by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations\u2019 aviation agency, would apply for all new airplanes delivered after 2028.Airlines account for about 2 percent of global emissions \u2014 about the same as Germany. But many analysts think the emissions could triple by the middle of the century given the expected growth in air travel over the next decades.It took little time, though, for the announcement to set off a debate over how effective the proposed rules would be.Some environmental groups, pointing to the airline industry\u2019s close involvement in crafting the deal, said the proposed rules were too weak and failed to include aircraft currently in use.But advocates of the deal, including the Obama administration, praised it, saying that it was an important first step and that it tackled one of the most intractable rifts over reducing carbon emissions.\u201cThis is another example of the administration\u2019s deep commitment to working with the international community on policies that will reduce harmful carbon pollution worldwide,\u201d Michael Huerta, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, said in a statement.In a statement, the White House said that \u201cwithout additional action, emissions from the aviation sector are projected to grow by nearly 50 percent.\u201dThe proposed rules signaled the first time that the aviation sector had been given emissions standards, just as cars and commercial trucks now have.The new standards would require a 4 percent reduction in fuel consumption of new aircraft starting in 2028 compared with 2015 deliveries. They also set new limits for airplanes in production that are delivered after 2023. Depending on the size of the aircraft, actual reductions would be from zero to 11 percent, with a bigger emphasis on larger commercial airplanes, according to analysts with the International Council on Clean Transportation.Before they become binding, the new standards must be formally adopted by the civil aviation council of 36 member states, in June this year, and then endorsed by the council\u2019s assembly in October. They would then need to be enacted by each member state in its national legislation or regulation, although countries have the option to adopt even stricter restrictions on emissions.Because of the global nature of the industry, however, the administration said at the time it would wait for the new rules before drafting its own standard.The standards should cut carbon emissions more than 650 million metric tons between 2020 and 2040, the equivalent to removing over 140 million cars from the road for a year, the White House said.For some environmentalists, though, that was not enough.\u201cThe standard as proposed is not going to make a dent in the emissions growth curve of airlines, and that is really deplorable,\u201d said Vera Pardee, a lawyer with the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfair for an industry as large as the airline industry not to be called to account on their contribution to climate change.\u201dAutomakers, by comparison, are required to nearly double their fuel economy by 2025.Ms. Pardee\u2019s group called on the Obama administration to implement far more stringent regulations than those put forth by the aviation group.\u201cWe think it\u2019s absolutely incumbent on E.P.A. to implement stronger standards,\u201d she said.Such a move would most likely draw fierce resistance from the airline industry, which has stressed the importance of having a single standard across international airspaces. But if the United States, the largest aviation market in the world, were to issue a tougher rule, \u201cit would be a catalyst\u201d for other countries to follow, Ms. Pardee said.Limiting aviation emissions remains one of Mr. Obama\u2019s major initiatives to combat global warming, following similar new emissions rules on heavy-duty trucks and power plants that were unveiled by the E.P.A. last year. But it is unlikely that the administration could complete work on such a complex aviation rule in the 11 months before Mr. Obama leaves office, leaving the final call to the next president.The accord won praise from the Environmental Defense Fund, which said it was a positive first step but that more effort was required to limit the growth in emissions. Such a goal could be achieved by establishing market-based measures to cap emissions and drive down pollution.Others, like the International Council on Clean Transportation, said the agreement would ensure, at a minimum, that technological gains would help limit the industry\u2019s projected emissions growth.\u201cGiven the substantial lead time for the standards, along with anticipated fuel efficiency gains for new aircraft types already in development by manufacturers, the standards will serve primarily to prevent backsliding in emissions,\u201d the group said in a statement.Following the E.P.A.\u2019s finding in June, the agency said that any domestic rules would be at least as tough as any I.C.A.O. standard.The new aviation rules could force plane makers like Airbus and Boeing to end production of some of their least-efficient airplanes, and would encourage engine makers to develop even-more fuel efficient engines.Airlines have long argued that any emissions limit needs to be apply globally. The opposition to regional standards helped scuttle an earlier attempt by the European Union to include aviation in a 2012 emissions trading scheme.As it headed into the latest talks, however, the European Union was calling for less ambitious goals than those sought by the United States, according to analysts who have followed the discussions closely.The talks at the council are running under a twin-track approach. A first set of rules lays out new fuel efficiency standards for planes. Another would make airlines pay for the cost of carbon dioxide through a market-based system. That second phase is expected to be completed by the end of the year.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s not the level of precision we\u2019re striving for. If you\u2019re not absolutely sure you\u2019ve got the right word, you probably don\u2019t. Look it up!A few recent misfires:\u2022\u2022\u2022This isn\u2019t a word. A good clue is the fact that the adjective is \u201cobstinate,\u201d not \u201cobstinant.\u201d The noun is \u201cobstinacy\u201d or, less often, \u201cobstinateness.\u201d\u2022\u2022\u2022\u201cCompunction\u201d means a feeling of guilt or regret. Certainly one might say Trump feels no compunction about some of the controversial things he has said or done.

We meant something more like \u201cvalue\u201d or perhaps \u201ccherish.\u201d\u2022\u2022\u2022This common error is more a misunderstanding of the idiom than of the word itself. We should say \u201cdifficult to overstate\u201d \u2014 that is, Saudi Aramco is so large that it would be hard to exaggerate its size.\u2022\u2022\u2022This may be a closer call.

Yet versions of this crop up fairly often.

On the other hand, average job gains for the past six months and the past 12 months remain over 200,000, indicating steady if unspectacular growth.On the one hand, the official unemployment rate ticked down last month, to 4.9 percent from 5 percent in December.

{"Headline": "What 74 Years of Crossword History Says About the Language We Use", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementEDUCATED Americans consider themselves a cosmopolitan bunch. We follow the conflict in Ukraine between Donetsk and Kiev, and can probably point to them on a map. We enjoy bibimbap and paella, which we try to pronounce with an appropriate accent. Some of us can identify the work of Igor Stravinsky, Youssou N\u2019Dour and Ai Weiwei. The rest of us are going to go look them up on Wikipedia now.But we are more parochial than our grandparents\u2019 generation, according to one indicator: the New York Times crossword puzzle.With the permission of Will Shortz, the Times\u2019s crossword puzzle editor, I recently downloaded all of the newspaper\u2019s crosswords from February 1942, when the puzzle began, through the end of 2015. I created an algorithm to search all 2,092,375 pairs of clues and answers for foreign language words and place names outside the United States.The results are imperfect, since the puzzles can be tricky and there is a lot of overlap between English and foreign words. But the broad trend is clear. The puzzle today uses one-third fewer non-English clues and answers than it did at its peak in 1966, and makes two-thirds fewer international references than its peak in 1943.For many years, the puzzle expected educated Americans to know the German word for \u201cwith\u201d (mit) and the Latin word for \u201cman\u201d (vir), for example. These words have all but disappeared from the puzzle. Solvers were expected to know details about America\u2019s military operations, such as \u201cMountain battlefield\u201d in 1943 (etna) and (misleadingly, since the answer is actually Japanese) \u201cForever!: Korean battle shout\u201d in 1951 (banzai). Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, by contrast, appear in the puzzle barely more often than before the United States sent troops to each country. Since the 1990s, puzzlers were occasionally asked to recognize \u201cBurkina ____\u201d but over the last few years, they were given additional help, \u201cBurkina ____ (African land)\u201d and \u201cBurkina ____ (Niger neighbor)\u201d (the answer is \u201cFaso\u201d).Over the generations, some foreign words have grown in frequency. For example, ethnic food in the Times crossword tracks well with broader cultural trends. Tacos were first mentioned in the puzzle in 1963 (\u201cMexican sandwich\u201d). Sushi appeared in 1982 (\u201cSauce for sushi\u201d: soy), dim sum in 1985 (\u201cChinese pasta appetizer\u201d) and Thai food in 1993 (\u201cPopular cuisine\u201d: Thai). Churros were first included in the puzzle in 2011 (\u201cSpanish pastry\u201d).Other words have also tracked shifts between languages. \u201cDit\u201d used to be clued as French for \u201csaid\u201d; since 1974 it refers almost exclusively to telegraphy. \u201cHora\u201d shifted from Latin (hour) to Spanish (hour) to Hebrew (dance). Uber (a car service) is no longer clued as a German preposition (over or above).I asked Mr. Shortz about how he chooses which foreign-language words to include.\u201cI try not to be too obscure,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes less common foreign words are allowed if there are English-language cognates. For example, I had \u2018zool\u00f3gico\u2019 in a clue \u2014 the answer was oso, which is Spanish for bear, and the clue was \u2018One in a zool\u00f3gico.\u2019 \u201dI suggested the words \u201cmadar\u201d and \u201cpedar,\u201d which are cognates for mother and father in Persian. Could those words appear in the puzzle? No, he said. \u201cOn the crossword blogs, those would be sharply criticized as obscurities. Besides, solvers would hate them.\u201dSome obscure words do get included, though. Mr. Shortz gave the example of \u201cucalegon,\u201d which is Greek for a neighbor whose house is on fire. It appeared twice in the Times puzzle in the early 1960s. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to use that word, but it\u2019s interesting.\u201dWhen Margaret Farrar was hired to start the Times crossword, two months after Pearl Harbor, the puzzle was envisioned as a sort of weekly news quiz, \u201cwith a flavor of current events and general information,\u201d as the first puzzle page announced. The very first clue in the crossword \u2014 \u201cFamous one-eyed general\u201d \u2014 aligned with this mandate, referring to a British commander who fought in North Africa (Wavell).In the puzzle\u2019s first four years, more than 15 percent of the clues included international geographic references. Ms. Farrar chafed against the puzzle\u2019s focus on current events, Mr. Shortz said, and reduced these references to 8 percent by the 1960s. Small but distinct shifts in the proportion can be detected with the coming of each new puzzle editor: a slight increase under Will Weng in 1969, a slight decrease with Eugene T. Maleska in 1977, and another drop when Mr. Shortz took over in 1993. International references now appear in about 5 percent of clues. Western Europe accounts for a third of these international references, a bit lower than in earlier decades.In Ms. Farrar\u2019s day, French was still the primary language of international diplomacy. German was the most common mother tongue in the United States after English. More Americans had studied Latin in school than any other language. Today, by contrast, six times more Americans speak Spanish than French, and nine times more speak Spanish than German by my analysis. Almost nobody knows Latin. Since 1995, enrollment in college Spanish courses has been greater than enrollment for all other languages combined.Waves of immigration have brought many other languages to the United States as well. According to data from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, the third most widespread language spoken in homes in Texas, after English and Spanish, is Vietnamese. In Virginia, it is Korean. Across the 50 states, about 14 different languages hold the second- or third-place position.A puzzle created from vintage New York Times Crossword words dating back to 1942, using as many foreign answers as would fit.So are we going to see Vietnamese or Korean in The New York Times crossword?\u201cI want the puzzle to reflect our common culture,\u201d Mr. Shortz notes, meaning that the answers and clues should have at least entered the general conversation before they appear. After a moment\u2019s reflection, Mr. Shortz noted that the puzzle did include a Vietnamese word last year. The clue was \u201cVietnamese soup\u201d (pho).\u201cThis is a word I did not know a few years ago, but it has now become embedded enough in American culture that I can expect American readers to know it. With Vietnamese restaurants in many cities, it has become mainstreamed,\u201d he said. Recently, the puzzle added \u201cVietnamese sandwich\u201d (banh mi).One clever puzzle in 1999 made foreign words its theme: tchu tzih, ghiaccio, leumi, wai hua\u2019ai, qoli, masern, akkulroalit, k\u00f6ttbullar (Mandarin orange, Italian ice, Hebrew National, Hawaiian Punch, Persian rug, German measles, Eskimo pies, Swedish meatballs). A puzzle last year included the clue \u201cLanguage in which the first six counting numbers are tasi, lua, tolu, fa, lima and ono\u201d (Samoan). A puzzle last year asked, \u201cBula : Fiji :: ___ : Hawaii\u201d (Aloha). But such clues are rare. Foreign language clues and answers peaked in the 1960s and now make up less than 4 percent.Since The Times introduced its crossword, many other aspects of American life have globalized dramatically. The international proportion of the United States economy has doubled over the past half-century. So has the percentage of foreign-born Americans. International voice calls have increased tenfold in 25 years. Sixteen million Americans use Google Translate each day. We follow world news in real-time, as it happens.But we are more likely to encounter Uma as an actress (117 answers since 1990), and not as a Hindu goddess (five answers, none since 1953). When we turn from the New York Times news pages to the puzzle page, the rest of the world fades away.Charts show a rolling average of how frequently each clue appears, beginning with the start of the daily crossword in 1951.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Gates, the \u2018Impatient Optimist,\u2019 Lays Out his Clean-Energy Innovation Agenda", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "I recently had a 45-minute conversation with Gates in the Seattle headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to explore what drove him to focus so much time and money in pursuit of energy breakthroughs.Andrew Revkin talks to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s richest person about his plan to tackle global warming with a new multibillion-dollar fund.Do you have a vision for the energy and climate norms that the world could have in 2100, given what you know about the climate system and the energy system?Well, I have a strong goal that the price of energy should be lower because of the work of the foundation and looking at the lives of the poorest. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very big deal that we not push energy prices up too much, so that things like fertilizer, lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning eventually \u2014 the kinds of things we take for granted \u2014 by 2100 should be available to everyone on the planet. So we need affordable energy.To me it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 70 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poor people are farmers, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re barely getting by. And a bad year means that their kid doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough nutrition. And so unless we can get their productivity and their resilience up quite dramatically, the increased variance in the weather, including lots of precipitation all at once, they just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the ability to deal with it. When you have resilience, which you have in rich countries, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to be able to make adjustments.Well for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty easy to think of research and innovation as the thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going change the framework. And my interest in getting that on the agenda goes back quite a ways. I had talked to the United States and France about saying, hey, shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this be on the agenda? And in fact, in terms of having Paris be novel for driving solutions, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do the world a service by getting this onto the agenda. After all, raising R&D is a global public good, to invent something that can solve this problem.So it really belongs on this agenda, particularly because the big emitters are pretty much one and the same as the countries with research capacity. They can respond by tilting their R&D budget in the right direction. And energy is so unique in terms of how little is spent on R&D, because if you invent something, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be deployed in big amounts within a 20-year period.So yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wonderful that the countries made that commitment. And at first we thought, you know, if we get five or six countries, including the U.S. and a few big countries, that would be phenomenal. As it was, we ended up with 20 countries, and this is in a time of extremely tight budgets \u2014 every European country, Japan, the U.S.It is very tough. There are very few things that are getting more money. Most of the dialogue is about which things will get less money. So it takes a pretty compelling cause. You know, like when the Ebola epidemic came along. Okay, things related to that got more money.But only things that really get people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention in a big way are allowed to fit that special category. So it was a great announcement. And it was interesting, the idea that the private sector, in terms of high-risk venture investing, would come in and be there so that all we were asking for in this case was the basic research piece. Now, some countries may help with non-research pieces. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic. But this ask was about the piece that really can only be done at the government level. And we said the group of private investors \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add a lot of institutional investors as well \u2014 would bring several billion in so that we can nurture these companies up to a pretty large stage, so that more non-venture type financing would then grab onto them and help with the scale-up.Is it anticipated that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going to operate like an endowment?What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning now is the first five years. And the spending will somewhat grow over the years, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have more companies that are at a later stage. We are going to look at all the companies that are out there, because there are a few that have promising technologies, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a place where getting financing is a little bit difficult. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just going to do start-up companies. We may find a few that are at the stage where getting $50 million or even $100 million would be valuable. And then over the five years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fully invest money, and then, like most venture funds, we would turn around and say to the investors, hey, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy with this, yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do another fund.Are you saying, we wealthy individuals with an investment plan here, we need a hand-off. We need you to work on this, too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of like a quid pro quo thing?It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as fast. But we do expect to make money out of this thing. If you can drive a new approach, then the energy economy is absolutely gigantic. Now, getting it scaled up fast enough, so that you benefit from your invention or your trade secrets, that is tricky. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great that we have that incentive. The financial incentive is to get it out and scaled quickly, and the climate benefit requires that same mentality.Is there a way to make that case to the American people that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been made? You talk to people of all political stripes, I assume. Have you found a way to get traction with the logic of that?Well, research hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been discussed much, but I do think it has a lot of appeal. Everyone wants great companies that are leading the way. We do have amazing universities where the basic technology, the material science, the simulation. You know, the I.Q. around the world large is very strong on this \u2014 to make the case to the U.S. that it should be a leader in doubling its budget. That was pretty important. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think if the U.S. wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t participating, it would be easy to get critical mass. Because even though we underspend, we are about 50 percent of all of the energy R&D spending that gets done.I think everybody can get excited when they hear there are really ideas out there. And when you talk about basic research, you get away from the somewhat partisan divide about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the role of government. Nobody would say it was zero, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get quite a range of views of how much the government ought to try and help out at that later stage.And so I think this one, now that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been highlighted as being so important, it you know, creates jobs in the company that allocates the R&D, it creates business opportunity in the country. And as you say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not relative to the size of the energy market or what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at risk here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually very, very small. You know, capitalism in general underinvests in research because the benefits to society are way more than whoever takes the risk and does the invention gets. And energy is just particularly dramatic in that. In fact, I.T. and health, people are spoiled by those, because those have pretty strong research models, both at the government level and at the private level.Circling back to Paris, could you lay out the general sectors you personally are interested in, and inevitably these investments will be in? Can you remind people what some of the basic concepts are that are out there?The range of possibilities for getting an energy breakthrough that is something that will be cheap and clean, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a few ways to do that. Ah, in the nuclear space there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fusion; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fission.Within wind, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got high [altitude] wind that only a little bit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done in. You have offshore wind, you have whatever improvements you can do to onshore wind, which you know, will likely be a workhorse of the overall system. Then in solar, you have solar electric, which has gone the furthest. You can do a lot more there. You have solar thermal, which has some nice characteristics, because storing heat is easier than storing electrons.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a paradigmatic example because it is not ready for a start-up, but there are some particular problems in terms of material structures and simulation that, if the right research was done, even over the next two or three years, then you could have a set of start-ups that would go into that area.High wind is another one where the challenges are, to some degree, control and materials challenges. This is the golden age of actually rationally designing materials, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for tensile strength or for catalytic capabilities. And if you can look at that area and say, okay scientists, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we need, then you can stimulate a lot of good work. And for us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit like what we do at the foundation where we take a disease problem and then we try and make sure the scientists who might \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have some tool that would help stimulate them to get involved.Biofuels is a category where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re either taking natural photosynthesis or modifying natural photosynthesis to get much higher efficiencies, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a few, you know: trees, grasses, algae. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking current photosynthesis, then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many ways to do cellulosic processing, none of which should have gotten into the large-scale mainstream, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of promise that that might happen.And when we think about climate, we have to think about more than electricity. We have to make materials. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steel, aluminum, cement, plastic, paper \u2014 all of which are big processes we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dependent on, some of which directly generate CO2, like cement production, and a lot of which are big industrial users of electricity or energy. We also have the entire land use, agricultural, livestock area, which is a very significant CO2 emitter.A little bit of the trap people get into is they think, okay if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re meeting some 2030 goal, we must be on the way, because we just do more of what we did. Well, a lot of things you do, like, take [away] coal and build natural gas, for your 2050 goal, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a step backwards because that gas plant is at a higher CO2-per-kilowatt-hour than you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to want to have in 2050. So you thought, oh what a great thing we just did. But in fact it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scale to the sort of near-zero [emissions technology] that we need to achieve.So when you think of the industrial economy, getting 20 or 30 percent out of that by pushing up recycling, labeling things, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy. But you have to plan today for meeting the large target. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just get to get partway there and say, oh well someone else will figure out how to make steel or, you know, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretend we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to make a lot of steel.Well there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a couple ways that it could come in. Poor countries, even if we figure out how to take livestock and land use in rich countries and get that down to zero, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going be a lot of emissions out of poor countries. And we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t force them not to use hydrocarbons. People actually get confused in climate and think this is bad for poor countries so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get them to do expensive intermittent energy systems and then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay.No, developing and truly poor countries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not China or India \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are a rounding error. So anything you do with their energy systems is a hobby, unrelated to climate change. I mean, maybe you could bring some power there, but they should grab onto the cheapest solution.So doing carbon sequestration out of a natural gas [power plant] flue is a lot easier than out of a coal flue, because there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the sulfuric acid. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little going on with that, but we may need that as part of a solution for that backup peaker 20 percent. Or if you have emissions taking place far away, in the poor countries, the idea that you could do free air capture, like Carbon Engineering is trying to do and a few other people are trying to do \u2014 that would have to be part of the mix.So actually, building prototypes now and saying, okay, how hard is it to do that carbon capture at scale, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great that that work is going on. The initial plants will be at very high prices \u2014 on the order of $100 per ton, which is way above even the highest CO2 tax in the world.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like them to be more visible, more integrated perhaps into how kids are learning.You and I grew up in the space race, you know, it was a no-brainer. Science was all around us. But do you see a way to make this story more pervasive?And I would like a boiler room tour in every school in America. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to charter buses. There are no permission slips, and you start to understand an energy system within a school. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be great to see innovation on that front. Maybe not as much as the innovation in laboratories for photovoltaics. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a communicator and an educator, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m biased \u2014 but I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of potential in that arena for innovation, as well. You should go on that boiler room tour. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great template.Not really. Not if your electricity coming in is zero CO2. If the electricity system isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about zero CO2, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to get there. I mean, just ignore the U.S. Assume we could cut some dramatic amount. Just look at India. They will be using over 10 times as much energy. And, yes, some of those light bulbs will be more efficient. Some of those refrigerators will be more efficient. But they will be using more kilowatt-hours. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not any doubt. A lot more. The more the better. And so the generation system really has to do the magical work here.And there are generation systems. I mean, nuclear has got lots of lots of problems, but it does not emit CO2. Hydro, if you manage it properly and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with a reservoir and everything, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to emit CO2.But I certainly agree with you that this is a problem that you can go from thinking it will be solved to thinking that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be solved.And even some of the people who think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to be solved can be frustrating to me, because then the idea of oh no we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to invent anything, we just need to get rid of evil utilities that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying 50 cents a kilowatt-hour for rooftop solar, and as soon as we get them to just realize they should go bankrupt, you know, boom, this thing is solved. It is a very hard problem to solve, because energy systems have to be reliable. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a utility, you are supposed to buy low-cost energy on behalf of those consumers. Utilities are not there to spend money on global public goods, which is what CO2 reduction is.Well India is paradigmatic. And you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only 1.4 billion people. So they have to electrify. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why children don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die. They need to be able to refrigerate their food and heat and cool. And so if you think you have a solution that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slow down India improving the lives of their people to be almost as good as what we take for granted, if you think today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology solves the India problem with no price premium, no reliability problem, then great. Go to India, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a capitalistic market there. Go ahead and do that. That is when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on our way.Then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not saying to them, trade off between these two things. Yes, the United States could afford for energy to cost a lot more than it does today. Europe can afford for energy to cost a lot more. Japan can afford for it to cost a lot more. But the future CO2 emitters are not going to pay some meaningful premium, nor are they going to give up total reliability. Their hospitals want energy; their factories want energy all the time.Well I call myself the impatient optimist, because I want things to go faster. With something like an HIV vaccine, you know, there are a lot of dead ends. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to believe that eventually you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find one and you want to pursue a lot of different things. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very optimistic, you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting smarter all the time, ah, about how to do that. So it really won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen overnight.Well, in software, nobody at Microsoft is sitting there saying, oh yeah, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 2040 thing going look like? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ridiculously long time period, even for a health-care type intervention, to try and think, hey we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing this great work so that we have this tool for 25 years from now.But for good reason \u2014 safety tests and capital costs and just the time it takes to build large-scale things \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time frame that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in. If that is part of the solution, which is hard to say, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really glad the work is being done. It has some meaningful chance of being able to help us with the climate problem.~ ~ ~ ~ReflectionsThis is mainly because I so often see\u00c2\u00a0a natural human bias toward the here and now \u2014 the low fruit \u2014 that tends to downplay the need to work now to build the intellectual and technical capacity for bigger changes later.With that in mind, one result of Gates\u2019s research campaign appears to be some constructive competition from other wealthy investors pursuing financial, instead of technological, breakthroughs.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRadical innovation in low-carbon energy technology is critical to long term climate mitigation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolfensohn said.

{"Headline": "Finding Beauty in the Darkness", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byOpinionWITH presidential primaries in full steam, with the country wrapped up in concern about the economy, immigration and terrorism, one might wonder why we should care about the news of a minuscule jiggle produced by an event in a far corner of the universe.The answer is simple. While the political displays we have been treated to over the past weeks may reflect some of the worst about what it means to be human, this jiggle, discovered in an exotic physics experiment, reflects the best. Scientists overcame almost insurmountable odds to open a vast new window on the cosmos. And if history is any guide, every time we have built new eyes to observe the universe, our understanding of ourselves and our place in it has been forever altered.When Galileo turned his telescope toward Jupiter in 1609, he observed moons orbiting the giant planet, a discovery that destroyed the Aristotelian notion that everything in heaven orbited the Earth. When in 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson of Bell Laboratories detected radio waves emitted by celestial objects, they discovered that the universe began in a fiery Big Bang.One hundred years ago, Albert Einstein used his newly discovered general theory of relativity (which implies that space itself responds to the presence of matter by curving, expanding or contracting) to demonstrate that each time we wave our hands around or move any matter, disturbances in the fabric of space propagate out at the speed of light, as waves travel outward when a rock is thrown into a lake. As these gravitational waves traverse space they will literally cause distances between objects alternately to decrease and increase in an oscillatory manner.This, of course, is far from the realm of human experience. In the absence of alcohol, your living room doesn\u2019t appear to shrink and grow repeatedly. But, in fact, it does. The oscillations in space caused by gravitational waves are so small that those ripples in length had never been seen. And there was every reason to suspect they would never be seen.Yet on Thursday, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, announced that a signal from gravitational waves had been discovered emanating from the collision and merger of two massive black holes over a billion light-years away. How far away is that? Well, one light-year is about 5.88 trillion miles.To see these waves, the experimenters built two mammoth detectors, one in Washington State, the other in Louisiana, each consisting of two tunnels about 2.5 miles in length at right angles to each other. By shooting a laser beam down the length of each tunnel and timing how long it took for each to be reflected off a mirror at the far end, the experimenters could precisely measure the tunnels\u2019 length. If a gravitational wave from a distant galaxy traverses the detectors at both locations roughly simultaneously, then at each location, the length of one arm would get smaller, while the length of the other arm would get longer, alternating back and forth.To detect the signal they observed they had to be able to measure a periodic difference in the length between the two tunnels by a distance of less than one ten-thousandth the size of a single proton. It is equivalent to measuring the distance between the earth and the nearest star with an accuracy of the width of a human hair.If the fact that this is possible doesn\u2019t astonish, then read these statements again. This difference is so small that even the minuscule motion in the position of each mirror at the end of each tunnel because of quantum mechanical vibrations of the atoms in the mirror could have overwhelmed the signal. But scientists were able to resort to the most modern techniques in quantum optics to overcome this.The two black holes that collided, which the LIGO experiment claimed to have detected, were immense. One was about 36 times the mass of our sun, the other, 29 times that mass. The collision and merger produced a black hole 62 times our sun\u2019s mass. If your elementary arithmetic suggests that something is wrong, you\u2019re right. Where did the extra three solar masses disappear to?Too often people ask, what\u2019s the use of science like this, if it doesn\u2019t produce faster cars or better toasters. But people rarely ask the same question about a Picasso painting or a Mozart symphony. Such pinnacles of human creativity change our perspective of our place in the universe. Science, like art, music and literature, has the capacity to amaze and excite, dazzle and bewilder. I would argue that it is that aspect of science \u2014 its cultural contribution, its humanity \u2014 that is perhaps its most important feature.What more can we learn about the universe from a stupefying experimental feat observing a stupefying wonder of nature? The answer is anyone\u2019s guess. Gravitational-wave observatories of the future will be able to explore the exotic features of black holes. This may shed light on the evolution of galaxies, stars and gravity. Eventually, we may be able to observe gravitational waves from the Big Bang, which will push the limits of our current understanding of physics.Gravitational waves emerge from near the \u201cevent horizon\u201d of black holes, the so-called exit door from the universe through which anything that passes can never return. Near such regions, for example, time slows down by a huge amount, as anyone who went to see the movie \u201cInterstellar\u201d knows. (Coincidentally the original treatment for \u201cInterstellar\u201d was written by Kip Thorne, one of the physicists who helped conceive of the LIGO experiment.)Ultimately, by exploring processes near the event horizon, or by observing gravitational waves from the early universe, we may learn more about the beginning of the universe itself, or even the possible existence of other universes.Every child has wondered at some time where we came from and how we got here. That we can try and answer such questions by building devices like LIGO to peer out into the cosmos stands as a testament to the persistent curiosity and ingenuity of humankind \u2014 the qualities that we should most celebrate about being human.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Merger Plans Fall Apart for Oi, Troubled Brazilian Telecom", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Shares of the Brazilian telecommunications company Oi plunged on Thursday after TIM Participa\u00e7\u00f5es, the Brazil operator of Telecom Italia, rebuffed an offer made by the Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman to merge the two companies.A unit of LetterOne, an investment firm founded by Mr. Fridman, said that it had been told by TIM that the telecommunications giant \u201cdoes not wish to enter into further discussions about the facilitation of a merger between Oi and TIM in Brazil.\u201dLast October, LetterOne said that it was willing to invest as much as $4 billion in Oi on the condition that it merge with the mobile operator TIM. Oi has long struggled to adapt to the growing mobile market in Brazil and shift away from its dominance in fixed lines.LetterOne, which is based in Luxembourg, was in negotiations for approximately four months, it said. \u201cThere have been extensive talks with many stakeholders in Brazil, and talks with TIM,\u201d it wrote.Shares of Oi fell by more than 15 percent in trading in S\u00e3o Paulo on Thursday.The Ukraine-born Mr. Fridman had been seeking to gain a foothold in Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest economy. LetterOne has other telecommunications investments, including VimpelCom in Amsterdam and Turkcell in Turkey.Even while there is appetite for consolidation in Brazil\u2019s telecommunications industry, a potential merger between Oi and TIM has been greeted with skepticism. Oi has some 38 billion reais in net debt, which is five times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to a research note issued this month by JPMorgan Chase.That report said that the potential benefits of a merger \u201cmay be outweighed by negative equity value at Oi given its high leverage.\u201dOi is scheduled to report its financial results for the fourth quarter next month, but there isnot much optimism about the results.Credit Suisse wrote in a research note this month that \u201cWe expect revenues in Brazil to decline in all three business divisions.\u201dOi has had a rocky recent history. In 2013 it approved a merger with Portugal Telecom, which already had a stake in Oi. At that time the two companies had the same chief executive.That went forward despite protests from minority shareholders in Oi who complained they were being saddled with debt as a result of the deal. They also said there were numerous conflicts of interest.Brazil\u2019s securities regulator sided with Oi at the time, although the newspaper Valor Econ\u00f4mico reported this month that the regulator had decided to re-examine that deal and investigate whether there was an abuse of power by controlling shareholders.That could create new problems for Oi.An earlier version of this article misstated which company withdrew from merger talks. It was TIM Participa\u00e7\u00f5es, not Oi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Built Up by Oil Boom, North Dakota Now Has an Emptier Feeling", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "As the price of oil has skidded to $30 a barrel, new drilling has dried up, and the flood of wealth and workers is ebbing.Supported byWILLISTON, N.D. \u2014 The \u201cman camps\u201d sprang up from the prairie, rows of trailers and modular steel boxes that housed thousands of workers chasing their fortunes in North Dakota\u2019s oil fields. But these days, the man camps are missing something: men.Roughly eight years ago, at the peak of the last recession, oil drilling began to transform these remote corners of the plains into an economic beacon, attracting billions of dollars in new investments and thousands of workers in search of good-paying jobs and an escape from America\u2019s economic pain. But now, as oil prices have skidded to $30 a barrel, new drilling has dried up here, and the flood of wealth and workers is ebbing.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t find a place,\u201d Brian Resh, 32, said, recalling the busy days one recent morning as he glanced across a nearly empty cafeteria of one of the area\u2019s largest remaining man camps. \u201cTwo years ago, you\u2019d drive at night at 3 a.m. and you\u2019d see 300 people.\u201dIt is hardly a bust \u2014 unemployment is low, and there are still plenty of help-wanted ads for the area \u2014 but the slowdown opens an uncertain second chapter for a place that has spent heavily on new roads, schools, hotels and developments over the past five years.\u201cWe\u2019re overbuilt,\u201d said Marcus Jundt, a businessman who followed the boom to Williston and owns several restaurants here, including the Williston Brewing Company, the place that serves the rib-eyes and brownies. \u201cWe have too many hotel rooms, too many apartments, too many restaurants. People are going to go broke. People are going to lose their jobs. It\u2019s going to be painful.\u201dThe slowdown has hammered governments across North Dakota, forcing some to cut spending or dip into reserves. Williston expects $151 million in revenue this year, down about 23 percent from two years ago. Real estate prices have come down, giving a welcome break to many renters, but agents say there is a glut of about 300 to 400 homes for sale, with more being built. At the State Capitol, Gov. Jack Dalrymple last Monday ordered 4 percent budget cuts and tapped $497 million from a rainy-day fund to close a $1 billion budget shortfall.Rural towns that spent the past years building, spending and taking on debt are now facing grim realities. Williston, for one, has taken on $215 million in debt, and governments around the region are spending to build infrastructure, including a sewer plant and recreation center for the growing population.Some local officials, business owners and academics express optimism, saying the economy here is taking a breather after years of unsustainable growth.\u201cThose communities out there were drinking out of a fire hose,\u201d said Nancy Hodur, a research assistant professor at North Dakota State University who has been studying the boom. \u201cA lot of those communities would come right out and say that pace of growth isn\u2019t good, isn\u2019t sustainable. They\u2019re still playing catch-up.\u201dLocal leaders say they have faith that oil will rebound and fuel decades of economic opportunity. As evidence, they point to rising school enrollments across the Bakken oil patch and rising population numbers statewide. New neighborhoods are filling up with full-time residents, recent arrivals who seem to represent a vote of confidence in the staying power of an oil-based economy that also offers a paradise for hunters and anglers.\u201cWe know where the oil is,\u201d said Howard Klug, the mayor of Williston. \u201cIt\u2019s like money in the bank. It\u2019s just sitting there.\u201dCindy Sanford, who oversees Williston\u2019s job-services center, also sees the bright side. Yes, drilling is down and oil workers have been laid off. But Ms. Sanford pointed out that hundreds of local jobs are posted on North Dakota\u2019s jobs website, which estimated there were still five open jobs for every three people looking for work.\u201cIt sounds like we\u2019re a ghost town, and we\u2019re not,\u201d Ms. Sanford said. \u201cName a job, and I can pull it up.\u201dNorth Dakota\u2019s unemployment rate is still an enviable 2.7 percent, and the jobless rate is even lower here in Williams County \u2014 2.2 percent, up a percentage point from a year ago.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.Camps like the Bear Paw Lodge or Black Gold reflected the allure and growing pains of an oil rush that overwhelmed the housing supply and infrastructure to the point that people camped in parking lots and homes rented for big-city prices \u2014 $3,000 or more. Many camps had their own security and strict rules against alcohol and drugs, as well as maids, fitness centers, high-thread-count sheets and 24-hour meal service.But now, about 50 miles from here, Capital Lodge in Tioga, built for 2,000 workers, is a fenced-off ghost town. About 130 miles away in Dickinson, a 600-bed camp had dwindled to 30 guests when its owners shut it down for the winter.In Williston, where the population soared to more than 40,000 at the height of the drilling frenzy from 12,000 before, local leaders ordered the remaining man camps to close by the summer.In the half-empty cafeteria of one camp operated by Target Logistics just north of Williston, electrical workers and pipe specialists were starting and ending their 12-hour shifts over a breakfast of eggs, sausage, and coffee as thick and black as crude oil one morning.They talked about how many drilling rigs were operating (46 across the state, compared with 190 two years ago), their falling overtime pay and friends who had gone elsewhere for work.\u201cIf you get fired tomorrow, you get fired,\u201d said Scott Benson, 32, an electrical worker who was heading out to make sure compressor parts did not freeze over in the bitter cold. \u201cJust calm down and go to work.\u201dTo Mr. Klug, the mayor, closing the man camps was a step toward becoming a town where workers stayed and raised families, rather than flying home to Texas or Colorado or Louisiana. \u201cI don\u2019t think Williston needs to be a temporary town anymore,\u201d he said.But the promise of ready work is fading for some. At the Fox Run R.V. park north of town, Reid Thibodeaux has been living out of a trailer given to him by a friend. He came up from Lafayette, La., on a bus 16 months ago and quickly found work encasing newly drilled wells.He lost his job in December, and with few new holes being punched in the ground, he said he was on the verge of abandoning his $800 monthly rent and returning to his 13-year-old son in Louisiana. The empty lots around his trailer suggest others have already made that decision.Yet newcomers are still arriving. Jerry Mallett left his home in Mississippi to chase a dream of high-paying work driving trucks out here, but by the time he got to Williston \u2014 the center of it all \u2014 the boom was going slack.\u201cI wish I\u2019d come a couple years ago,\u201d Mr. Mallett, 60, said one afternoon as he sat at a hiring center, waiting to hear about a job hauling sand and water to fracking sites. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be broke.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Artist\u2019s Greatest Subject Was the Panama Canal", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byArts | WestchesterMr. Bland\u2019s enthusiasm for scaffolding, hard hats, winches and pulleys can be explained by a visit to \u201cOh Panama! Jonas Lie Paints the Panama Canal,\u201d an exhibition that began in February and runs through May 8 at the museum in Yonkers.\u201cLie went to a New York movie house and saw a very, very early color movie called \u2018The Making of the Panama Canal\u2019 toward the end of 1912. He was so intrigued by it he was convinced he had to get there,\u201d Mr. Bland said on a recent tour. A 1913 book of hand-colored photographs illustrating images Mr. Lie might have seen in the film \u2014 massive machines entrenched in muck and mosquitoes thousands of miles from civilization, terracelike steps down to a 40-foot deep canal bed where men laid tracks and placed dynamite \u2014 is among a few dozen artifacts arranged in glass cases in the show. So is a postcard that was on sale to Panama City tourists that shows Hercules prying open the earth.Mr. Lie, who was born in Norway in 1880 and died in New York in 1940, was not the only one who packed his bags and his paintbrushes and headed to Panama to witness what is still considered one of humankind\u2019s most ambitious feats of engineering.For those with a tenuous grip on the history, a primer: The construction of the 48-mile Panama Canal across the Isthmus of Panama linked the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. France began the project in 1881, but it was taken over by the United States in 1904 after tropical diseases including malaria flattened French work crews, killing more than 20,000 people and bankrupting the project.For Mr. Lie, the near-completed canal of 1913 presented an opportunity to build on a budding reputation as an artist of the moment.\u201cBetween 1910 and 1915 was a peak time for him,\u201d Mr. Bland said. Before then, Mr. Lie was painting traditional landscapes of countryside and harbors. \u201cHe had been to Paris in 1906 to see the Impressionists,\u201d who may have influenced him; works in the show are muted though vibrant. \u201cThose paintings were popular, but there was this sense of excitement around a transforming metropolis that Lie was starting to feel.\u201dAt the start of the new decade, Mr. Lie had shifted his perspective to dramatic cityscapes and scenes of urban construction. The new focus placed him \u201cat the vanguard of American art,\u201d Mr. Bland said, noting, \u201cHe was by then very involved in the New York art scene.\u201dMr. Lie made roughly 30 paintings during the three months he spent in Panama, but the artwork wasn\u2019t unprecedented. A book of views by Joseph Pennell, \u201cBuilding the Panama Canal,\u201d had been published in 1913 after Mr. Pennell visited the site in 1912.\u201cAt first Lie thought Pennell had covered the territory\u201d with his book of black-and-white lithographs, Mr. Bland said. But he came to realize the book was more reportage than art, and convinced himself that the visual story of the Panama Canal had to be told in color.\u201cIt looks like hell, like an inferno,\u201d Mr. Bland said of the painting. \u201cThere\u2019s all this black smoke.\u201d Blues, whites and earth tones surrounding the smoke and machines are vivid, though, demonstrating Mr. Lie\u2019s painterly skill.\u201cThis was a nice little moment in American art, but Lie is an undervalued artist within it. He was a major figure in his time,\u201d Mr. Bland said. But not anymore. After World War I, his star faded. \u201cHe started to seem old hat, as almost every artist does after they speak to their moment,\u201d Mr. Bland said. \u201cI hope the show helps him have a critical renaissance.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Equality in Marriages Grows, and So Does Class Divide", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byModern FamiliesThe Don Drapers of the world used to marry their secretaries. Now they marry fellow executives, who could very well earn more than they do.With more marriages of equals, reflecting deep changes in American families and society at large, the country is becoming more segregated by class.\u201cIt\u2019s this notion of this growing equality between husbands and wives having this paradoxical effect of growing inequality across households,\u201d said Christine Schwartz, a sociologist who studies the topic at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.From Cinderella to Kate Middleton, fictional and real-life fairy tales have told of women marrying up. But it has been a long time since women said they went to college to earn a \u201cMrs. degree.\u201d In more recent cultural touchstones \u2014 like \u201cThe Intern,\u201d with Anne Hathaway, and \u201cOpening Belle,\u201d the novel and soon-to-be Reese Witherspoon movie \u2014 the protagonists are highly successful women with husbands who don\u2019t work. (Spoiler alert: Conflict ensues.)These changes have been driven by women\u2019s increasing education and labor force participation, new gender roles, and the rise of what social scientists call assortative mating.Assortative mating is the idea that people marry people like themselves, with similar education and earnings potential and the values and lifestyle that come with them. It was common in the early 20th century, dipped in the middle of the century and has sharply risen in recent years \u2014 a pattern that roughly mirrors income inequality in the United States, according to research by Robert Mare, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. People are now more likely to marry people with similar educational attainment \u2014 even after controlling for differences between men and women, like the fact that women were once less likely to attend college.Even though the typical husband still makes more than his wife, the marital pay gap among opposite-sex couples has shrunk significantly in the decades since women started entering the work force en masse. Today, wives over all make 78 percent of what their husbands make, according to an Upshot analysis of annual survey data from the Census Bureau. That\u2019s up from 52 percent in 1970.In opposite-sex marriages in which both spouses work some amount of time, 29 percent of wives earn more than their husbands do, up from 23 percent in the 1990s and 18 percent in the 1980s, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The marriage pay gap varies by education, profession and class. Husbands who are dentists have the greatest pay difference with their working wives, who earn 47 cents for every dollar their husbands earn. Generally, couples in which men have high-earning, white-collar jobs have the largest marital pay gap, while men in service jobs like bartending and child care earn less than their wives.These differences have to do with the nature of the jobs. Hourly workers have a smaller gender pay gap in general. High-paying jobs generally have the least flexibility and the longest hours \u2014 which means someone has to pick up the slack at home, and families can afford for one spouse to work less.\u201cHusbands and wives had different roles in different spheres, so that was the opposites-attract view of marriage,\u201d Mr. Wolfers said. \u201cToday you want people with shared passions, similar interests to you, similar career goals, similar goals for the kids.\u201dAnother reason people are finding mates like themselves is that they are marrying later, so they know more about their partners\u2019 prospects and increasingly meet at work. People were least likely to marry those with similar educational backgrounds around the 1950s, according to Mr. Mare\u2019s research, when people married very young. Americans are increasingly able to make their own romantic choices based on personal preferences, free from family or religious expectations, he found.Technology could also play a role: Dating apps and sites let people filter their potential partners before they even have a conversation.Despite being more common, these marriages are a break from tradition, and that can present problems.When such marriages do form, the women become more likely to seek jobs beneath their potential or to stop working entirely, and the marriages are more likely to end in divorce. Paradoxically, wives who earn more also do significantly more housework and child care than their husbands do, perhaps to make their husbands feel less threatened, the economists said.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like if he\u2019s shorter than she is, she doesn\u2019t wear heels,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in the cultural DNA that if anyone should be bigger, richer, more successful, it should be the man.\u201dWhen these couples struggle, it is often over issues like sexual desire or the division of housework and child care, Dr. Doherty said, particularly if the woman loses respect for the man and the man feels insecure about his role in the family.Alena Taylor, 28, a management consultant, earns 40 percent more than her husband, Matt, 31, a nonprofit executive. \u201cIt has felt like a nonissue,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.They said they knew that conflict could arise over their division of labor when they have children, including because she travels more and he has greater flexibility. \u201cBecause my earnings potential is much higher than his, over time we\u2019ll have to figure that out,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Is Latest Destination for Brazilian Stars", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 In this country\u2019s top soccer league, the Brasileir\u00e3o, team officials are used to the phone calls. They expect them. Agents and executives, middlemen and managers, all of them looking to make a deal in the game\u2019s greatest shopping mall.But where once the interest regularly came from Madrid or Milan, these days the voice on the other end of the line, teams say, is more likely to be calling from Beijing or Shanghai. And increasingly, the Chinese suitors are looking to buy only the best.\u201cBrazil needs to learn to live with this,\u201d said Thiago Scuro, the sporting director of Cruzeiro, which won the Brazilian championship in 2013 and 2014. \u201cWe were always a target, but what\u2019s changed is the big clubs in Europe are taking very young players, to have time to develop them there. But China is signing the star players in their 20s.\u201cWe cannot fight this, as it\u2019s economics, not football.\u201dBrazil has always been a net exporter of soccer talent; no country sends more professional players abroad. But Brazil\u2019s slumping economy and the chronic financial problems plaguing domestic clubs \u2014 it is not uncommon for players to go unpaid for months \u2014 have some regarding China\u2019s current shopping spree as a worrisome asset-stripping of the Brazilian game.The tale of Corinthians is the latest example. Corinthians dominated last season, finishing first by 12 points, and the feeling was a South American title and a return to a World Club Cup was a possibility this year. But that was before the team lost eight players.\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise to lose players when you are champions, but the big surprise was they went to China,\u201d said Edu, who starred in Europe with Arsenal and Valencia during his playing days and is now Corinthians\u2019 sporting director. \u201cIt\u2019s not so frustrating. It\u2019s the market. You just have to replace them.\u201d\u201cWith the crisis here, the prices they are offering, we can\u2019t compete with that,\u201d Edu said of the recent sales. \u201cBut in terms of a player\u2019s career, they are going for money, not the status, and for me, that would have made me think twice, as it could get in the way of playing for Brazil.\u201dChinese clubs might not release players for national team play except in the mandatory official windows, Edu said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a personal decision, but you need to balance it. And if you\u2019re good enough and have the chance to play for Brazil, nothing should get in the way.\u201dIn one sense, the China conundrum is nothing new. But the earlier Brazilian star J\u00fanior Baiano was already 31 when he went to Shanghai in 2001, and of the 134 reported moves of Brazilians to China from 2003 to 2010, almost all were players from minor clubs.But last year the Brasileir\u00e3o\u2019s two best players \u2014 both of them having broken into the national team \u2014 made the switch. One, Diego Tardelli, had just won the Brazilian Cup with Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. The other, Ricardo Goulart, had just won back-to back league championships with Cruzeiro. And the money is only getting better: The onetime Sevilla striker Lu\u00eds Fabiano left S\u00e3o Paulo for China last month for a reported $7 million a year.Guangzhou Evergrande could be described as the team that changed the market in 2011, when it signed the Argentine midfielder Dar\u00edo Conca from the Rio de Janeiro club Fluminense and made him, at the time, the third-highest-paid player in the world behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Guangzhou\u2019s investments quickly paid off: It has won five straight Chinese Super League titles, and its average attendance is nearly 46,000 a game. Last summer, the team hired Brazil\u2019s former World Cup manager Luiz Felipe Scolari; he quickly delivered Guangzhou\u2019s second Asian Champions League title in three years.\u201cFrom originally being a real estate company, their owners saw what football could achieve in terms of strengthening their brand, and they\u2019ve now gone into other areas like entertainment and bottled water and cooking oil,\u201d Christopher Atkins, a player agent in China, said. \u201cOther clubs have seen, too, the political and marketing gains that can be made by representing a certain city or province with a successful team. People talked about China next up being a steppingstone league, but they\u2019ve just skipped that phase.\u201d\u201cBrazil is struggling as a country,\u201d said Ricardo Mello, who works as an intermediary between Brazilian players and Chinese clubs. As the Brazilian real has plummeted in value, he said, the ability to be paid in foreign currency \u201cmeans a lot to players; it can change lives forever.\u201dAnd for Brazilian teams, transfer fees remain a vital source of revenue. A list of the most indebted clubs in the country has 10 owing at least $63 million, with Flamengo topping the list at more than $150 million. Despite its size and recent successes, Corinthians sits uncomfortably on that list, with debts of around $70 million.While some wonder why European teams are not racing to match China\u2019s spending in the market, the simple answer seems to be that they do not value the players as highly. Thus, in Brazil, where once there was pride in selling brilliant artists to those who appreciated them, now there is little joy in selling off lesser players at inflated prices.\u201cThe model here is long broken,\u201d said Amir Somoggi, a sports marketing consultant based here. \u201cWe work on popular governance of teams, not investing into them as companies. And our philosophy is sell, sell, sell.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And that small building they sometimes use as a dorm \u2026\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cAfter the GBU hits, if military-age males come out \u2026\u201d\u201cYes, sir?\u201d\u201cKill them.\u201dLess than an hour later he is briefed again. The two targets are dead. The civilians have fled the compound. All are alive.TARGETED killing using drones has become part of the American way of war. To do it legally and effectively requires detailed and accurate intelligence. It also requires some excruciatingly difficult decisions. The dialogue above, representative of many such missions, shows how hard the commanders and analysts work to get it right.The longer they have gone on, however, the more controversial drone strikes have become. Critics assert that a high percentage of the people killed in drone strikes are civilians \u2014 a claim totally at odds with the intelligence I have reviewed \u2014 and that the strikes have turned the Muslim world against the United States, fueling terrorist recruitment. Political elites have joined in, complaining that intelligence agencies have gone too far \u2014 until they have felt in danger, when they have complained that the agencies did not go far enough.The program is not perfect. No military program is. But here is the bottom line: It works. I think it fair to say that the targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed conflict. It disrupted terrorist plots and reduced the original Qaeda organization along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to a shell of its former self. And that was well before Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011.Not many years before, the targeted killings were fairly limited. But by 2008, we knew that the terrorist threat had increased to intolerable levels, both to American forces in South Asia and to the United States itself. From our surveillance platforms, we could observe training camps where men leapt off motorbikes and fired on simulated targets. Early that year, the C.I.A. and I began recommending more aggressive action.We were confident that the intelligence was good enough to sustain a campaign of very precise attacks. To be sure, it was not, is not, always error-free. In late 2006, for instance, a strike killed a one-legged man we believed was a chieftain in the Haqqani network, a violent and highly effective group allied with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. It turned out that the man was indeed affiliated with the Haqqanis, but he wasn\u2019t the leader we wanted. With all the land mines in the region, there were many one-legged terrorists in South Asia.I demanded a full explanation for the misidentification. There were no excuses. People were thoroughly, maybe even excessively, contrite.But even if I was convinced that we could routinely provide high-quality intelligence to enable precision targeting, we still had to convince policy makers in the government that they should take advantage of it.We had one thing going for us. I got to talk to President George W. Bush directly every week without filters. I briefed him every Thursday morning and began to use the sessions to underscore Al Qaeda\u2019s growing footprint and brazenness in the tribal region of Pakistan. My chief analyst on this, a lanky Notre Dame graduate, met with me almost daily and stressed that as bad as this might be for Afghanistan and our forces there, the threat could also come to our shores.If we had boiled our briefings down, the essence would have been: \u201cKnowing what we know, there will be no explaining our inaction after the next attack.\u201dSo the United States began to test some limits. In early 2008, a charismatic Qaeda operations chief was killed along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The strike was clean and the target so important that even regional reaction was muted. Local people knew who he was and did not mourn his passing.Later in the year another senior Qaeda operative, active in planning attacks in the West, was killed along with several lieutenants in a similar strike that resulted in a similar reaction.By midsummer, when Hellfire missiles killed a senior Qaeda operator who was active in its weapons of mass destruction program, it was clear that the United States had launched a campaign of targeted killings in South Asia.Publicly available sources document nearly three dozen attacks in the last seven months of the Bush administration, almost three times the total of the previous four years. According to those sources, 18 senior and midlevel Taliban and Qaeda leaders were killed.The intelligence used for these strikes was based on human reports, surveillance technology and the near unblinking stare of the Predator itself. The strikes were particularly damaging to Al Qaeda\u2019s operational leaders, who couldn\u2019t afford to hunker down like Bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, whose main contribution to the movement was pretty much just staying alive. Those front-line operators had to move and communicate \u2014 and that made them vulnerable.Other attacks were intended to disrupt known Qaeda locations and activities even when the identities of the people present were not known. Critics said these so-called signature strikes were indiscriminate. They were not. Intelligence for signature strikes always had multiple threads and deep history. The data was near encyclopedic.Many such strikes killed high-value targets whose presence was suspected but not certain. And we made no excuses about killing lower-ranking terrorists. The United States viewed these attacks as legitimate acts of war against an armed enemy \u2014 and in warfare it is regrettably necessary to kill foot soldiers, too.The signature strikes drastically shrank the enemy\u2019s bench and made the leadership worry that they had no safe havens. Almost inadvertently, these strikes also helped protect intelligence sources and methods since the strikes seemed more random than they actually were.It wasn\u2019t long before intelligence reporting began to confirm our success. We learned there was a widespread sense of helplessness among the Qaeda leadership. Years later, documents proved just how anguished they were.\u201cThe strikes by the spy planes are still going on,\u201d it continued. A member named al-Sa\u2019di Ihsanullah was the \u201clatest to become a martyr: He was killed about a week ago, also by air raids.\u201d It noted, \u201cThe midlevel commands and staff members are hurt by the killings.\u201dAl Qaeda gained a healthy respect for American intelligence. \u201cBased on our analysis, they are constantly monitoring several potential or possibly confirmed targets,\u201d the June letter said.The frightened underlings in the field beseeched Bin Laden to help. \u201cWe would like your guidance,\u201d the June letter said. \u201cEspecially on this idea: reduce the work, meaning stopping many of the operations so we can move around less, and be less exposed to strikes.\u201d\u201cThere is an idea preferred by some brothers to avoid attrition,\u201d it continued. \u201cThe idea is that some brothers will travel to some \u2018safe\u2019 areas with their families, just for protection. They would only stay for a time, until the crisis is over, maybe one or two years.\u201dTwo months later another Bin Laden deputy agreed to their taking refuge and \u201ccalming down and minimizing movement.\u201dAll this correspondence was from 2010, but it is consistent with the intelligence picture we were gathering in 2008. Al Qaeda along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border was spending more time worrying about its own survival than planning how to threaten ours.The correspondence also confirmed our intelligence showing that attacking Americans on American soil was central to their plotting.The letters are filled with references to recruits from a host of countries, including the United States. One correspondence emphasized that \u201coperations inside America are some of the most important work of the Organization, as long as they are possible, because they affect the security and economy of the American people as a whole.\u201dThroughout the campaign, civilian casualties were a constant concern. In one strike, the grandson of the target was sleeping near him on a cot outside, trying to keep cool in the summer heat. The Hellfire missiles were directed so that their energy and fragments splayed away from him and toward his grandfather. They did, but not enough.The target was hard to locate and people were risking their lives to find him. The United States took the shot. A child died, and we deeply regret that he did. But his grandfather had a garage full of dangerous chemicals, and he intended to use them, perhaps on Americans.We tried to get better. Carefully reviewing video of one successful strike, we could discern \u2014 as a GBU was already hurtling toward an arms cache \u2014 a frightened woman responding to another weapon that had just detonated. She was running with young children square into the path of the incoming bomb, and they were killed. We realized, once our after-action review was done, that we needed to put even more eyes on targets as they were being struck to try to avoid any future civilian casualties.For my part, the United States needs not only to maintain this capacity, but also to be willing to use it. Radical Islamism thrives in many corners of the world \u2014 Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Libya, Mali, the list goes on \u2014 where governments cannot or will not act. In some of these instances, the United States must.And unmanned aerial vehicles carrying precision weapons and guided by powerful intelligence offer a proportional and discriminating response when response is necessary. Civilians have died, but in my firm opinion, the death toll from terrorist attacks would have been much higher if we had not taken action.What we need here is a dial, not a switch.Michael V.

She is also worried about the state\u2019s heroin epidemic, which is ravaging families and taking hundreds of young lives.She supports Mr. Sanders, she said, because \u201cwe\u2019re here to help each other, and I like what he says about a more fair corporate tax structure.\u201dThat mix of contentment and unease hints at the complex dynamics at play in New Hampshire this election season as the national spotlight swivels from the small, quirky state of Iowa to this even smaller, arguably quirkier state, which votes Tuesday.New Hampshire survived the Great Recession better than many states. Today it ranks at or near the top in several categories that measure a state\u2019s health, like median household income, level of education and general well-being. Its rates of unemployment, crime and people living below the poverty line are among the lowest.Yet despite their relative prosperity and personal happiness, voters still express anxiety.\u201cWe\u2019re better than average, economically speaking,\u201d said Bill Getty, 57, a mental health counselor, after hearing Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican running for president, speak in Exeter at the brick town hall. \u201cBut not everything is milk and honey.\u201dAfter the Iowa caucuses, the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates.Andrew E. Smith, a political scientist and pollster at the University of New Hampshire, said that voters\u2019 mixed feelings reflected in part their generally positive views of their own lives and their more negative views of the country as a whole; 61 percent of New Hampshire voters say the state is headed in the right direction, but only 35 percent say the same about the country.\u201cWe aren\u2019t angry,\u201d Ms. Hoffner said as they waited for Mr. Trump to appear in their high school gymnasium, which was festooned with a banner that read, \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d \u201cWe just don\u2019t want a career politician. The biggest concern for me is getting America back to where it was.\u201dVoters\u2019 outlooks on the country are sharply divided along partisan lines. Polls show that 66 percent of New Hampshire Democrats believe the country is on the right track, but only 5 percent of Republicans agree. Much of the Republican dissatisfaction stems from disapproval of President Obama, his overhaul of the health care system and his support for gun control.\u201cI\u2019m worried sick for my children and grandchildren,\u201d she said.The two parties in New Hampshire also differ on which issues are most important. Since the terrorist attacks last fall in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Republicans have rated national security at the top, with 34 percent citing it as their priority; next are the economy at 26 percent and immigration at 11 percent.Among Democrats, 26 percent rate the economy as the top issue, while 13 percent say national security is.Some of the angst over the economy stems from a recognition that the state\u2019s boom times are over.Even as major corporations like FedEx, UPS and Pratt & Whitney expand here, job growth over all has slowed and in some regions has yet to return to pre-recession levels. The cost of living can be relatively high, especially in the suburbs near the Massachusetts border. New Hampshire\u2019s minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour, the lowest in New England; attempts to raise it have gone nowhere.\u201cI had a good career and saved for retirement, but I would hate to start over now,\u201d Mr. McEntire said. \u201cI\u2019ve got 10 grandchildren, and I can see them being financially strapped.\u201dDemographic shifts, meanwhile, are transforming the landscape.For one thing, the state is getting older. Its median age of 41.8 has surpassed Florida\u2019s (41.2), making it the third-oldest state by that measure. That has implications for health care costs, the state budget and the work force.At the same time, the state is losing young people. From 2000 to 2010, more than 10 percent of those 20 to 29 years old decamped.\u201cI have to leave New Hampshire to do what I want to do,\u201d said Mr. Healy, who is supporting Mr. Sanders.The in-migration that helped expand the economy and kept New Hampshire growing faster than much of the Northeast has also slowed. The state still has a net gain of people 30 to 49 years old, but it is smaller than before the recession.Over all, the state has more turnover than most. Only 45 percent of New Hampshire residents were born here, compared with 68 percent nationwide who live in the state where they were born.\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different state than it was in 2008,\u201d Mr. Smith, the pollster, said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fire at Virginia Smokehouse Leaves Pork-to-Table Movement Reeling", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported bySURRY, Va. \u2014 Sam Edwards learned the art of curing country hams growing up here on the banks of the James River, from his father and grandfather before him. They taught him the secrets of salt and hickory smoke, and how to know when the meat is just the right shade of mahogany, ready to be aged like fine bourbon or wine.\u201cIt\u2019s going to trickle down to everybody in town,\u201d said Mary Alma Savedge, who went to school with Mr. Edwards\u2019s sister. She and her husband own a tractor dealership and an auto-parts store; Mr. Edwards is a customer. She often buys lunch at the Edwards retail shop, closed for now, along with the rest of the business. Her son, a volunteer firefighter, helped fight the smokehouse fire. \u201cThis is all intertwined,\u201d she said.The fire has had ripple effects far beyond Surry. Heritage farmers here and in the Midwest, who raise the rare-breed hogs Mr. Edwards requires for his specialty pork, have lost their biggest customer. A Brooklyn purveyor of sustainable meats who buys those farmers\u2019 hogs and sells Mr. Edwards his pork is grappling with a break in his supply chain. Chefs from Washington to New York are busy adjusting their menus.\u201cWe might bring on another American ham maker \u2014 we always like to rotate \u2014 but Edwards was a staple,\u201d said Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef at Momofuku Ssam Bar in Manhattan. \u201cNothing can replace them.\u201dMr. Edwards, a big man with an easy manner, has vowed to rebuild; he employs 35 people year-round and as many as 60 at Christmastime. He said he would pay them as long as he could.But while hams can be replaced, he said, some of what he lost cannot. The fire consumed priceless family artifacts: photographs, his grandfather\u2019s horse-drawn sleigh, a hand-cranked phone from the 1940s, the brass skeleton key to the original smokehouse his grandfather built.\u201cI look at it like, \u2018This is life,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Edwards said last week after a quick tour of his property, where freezers had been reduced to mangled, twisted wrecks. Fire-blackened hams, picked over by dogs, sat in a pile out back. \u201cAs heartbroken as we are, I\u2019m a plodder. I\u2019ll just keep going on,\u201d he said.Mr. Edwards, born Samuel Wallace Edwards III, has deep roots here. A great-grandfather, Albert Jester, owned and ran the ferry that connected the county to Jamestown. His son-in-law was Mr. Edwards\u2019s grandfather, Samuel Wallace Edwards Sr., a ferry captain whose ham sandwiches so delighted customers that he went into business for himself. Longtime residents remember the elder Edwards carting his hogs on a tractor-driven wagon through the center of town.Here in Surry, Tony Seward, a local farmer, gave up growing row crops in order to breed heritage black-and-white Berkshire hogs for Mr. Edwards. The men have known each other all their lives. \u201cHe\u2019s 90 percent of our market,\u201d Mr. Seward said, \u201cand he\u2019ll be the one that\u2019s going to get me through this.\u201dThe cause of the fire remains a mystery. Tyrone Franklin, the Surry County administrator, called it \u201ca nightmare\u201d for the local economy, adding that \u201cafter the event, I didn\u2019t really get a whole lot of sleep.\u201dThe fire broke out around 12:40 p.m. on a Tuesday. Mr. Edwards said he was in his office, on the phone. \u201cI smelled smoke, and it wasn\u2019t hickory smoke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt smelled like plastic burning.\u201dHe yelled to the office workers to get out \u2014 most others were at lunch \u2014 and called 911, he said, then rushed to the back of the property to cut off the propane gas tanks. He tried to dash back into the office to grab his computer hard drives, but it was too late. \u201cThe offices were fully engulfed,\u201d he said.About 125 firefighters from 12 companies in the region spent two days rotating through Surry to fight the fire, said Mark Seward, the volunteer fire chief in Surry and a distant relative of Tony Seward\u2019s. He deemed it not suspicious; it will be up to insurance investigators to assess the damage and determine the cause.On a cold, gray afternoon last week, Mr. Edwards was holed up with those investigators, working out of the trailer that usually serves as the company\u2019s lunchroom and is now a makeshift office. His national sales manager was hunched over a laptop, filling orders. (The company, which typically ships about 50,000 hams a year, still has 14,000 in cold storage off site.) His plant superintendent was drawing up lists of equipment and inventory.His son, Samuel Wallace Edwards IV, who goes by Sammy, had been digging through the rubble with the maintenance manager, J. C. Judkins III, looking for the old smokehouse key. The younger Mr. Edwards, 26, cradled it in his hands. It was charred but intact.Mr. Judkins, a burly man in a knitted cap, fought back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s not one of those things you can find the words for,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all extended family.\u201dMr. Edwards is more stoic than tearful. Yet there is an image he cannot get out of his mind: a photograph taken as his company burned down. Part of the sign that read EDWARDS had dropped off, leaving only four letters: D-A-D-S.He wondered, he said, if his father and grandfather were talking to him. He could almost hear them saying, \u201cThis was my place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It would seem that the Democratic presidential primary\u2019s mature poet is Hillary Clinton, who has been adopting the progressive words, and style, of her rival Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator\u2019s longstanding call for revolution against a system rigged against the poor and middle class resonates with young Democrats who jam convention halls to hear his booming, Brooklyn-accented voice. Some Democrats say it\u2019s great that Mr. Sanders is nudging Mrs. Clinton to the left. Others say she\u2019s merely parroting the race\u2019s true progressive.Responding to Mr. Sanders\u2019s call for a $15 per hour minimum wage, Mrs. Clinton, who favors raising the federal minimum to $12, now says she supports state and local efforts for higher minimums. Her call for a \u201cfair share surcharge\u201d on people making more than $5 million a year is a response to Mr. Sanders\u2019s signature call for the rich to take on a greater role in caring for the poor.

He also puts equal pay for women front and center in his speeches, another issue Mrs. Clinton, endorsed by many women\u2019s groups, has owned in the past.The merging of the philosophies pursued by these two very different politicians is a fascinating twist in the race. After an entire political career as a voice in the wilderness, Mr. Sanders\u2019s lifelong message is resonating. The challenge for Mrs. Clinton is to listen and adapt to what these voters are demanding, not just to imitate what Mr. Sanders says.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghanistan\u2019s Crippled Power Grid Exposes Vulnerability of Besieged Capital", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 When saboteurs crippled the Afghan capital\u2019s power supply last month, the tailors in Najeebullah\u2019s clothing shop had to abandon their electric sewing machines for hand-cranked models. Their output fell by half.\u201cI\u2019ve lost nearly $215 since the power cuts,\u201d Mr. Najeebullah, a gentle-mannered man with a gray beard, said. \u201cI have four tailors to pay, whether they sew two outfits a day or four. And I have to pay my rent and feed my staff, whether I make money or not.\u201dMr. Najeebullah, who goes by only one name, said he eventually decided to buy a diesel generator, \u201cbut I have to pass the fuel costs on to my customers, and they can\u2019t afford it.\u201dThree decades of conflict have taught Afghans to be resilient and adaptable, but the latest hardships have further soured the mood in this city of five million people.Every day brings promises by the government that the lights will be on again soon, but the cables fell in areas contested or controlled by the Taliban, suggesting a lasting restoration will be possible only with the acquiescence of the insurgents.Many homes and most large businesses here already have backup generators. But the privations are another disappointment for a long-suffering people. The creation of a modern power grid, paid for by international donors, was one of Afghanistan\u2019s signature achievements after the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. Only 5 percent of Afghans had electricity then, compared with 40 percent today, according to Qudratullah Delawari, the chief executive of DABS, Afghanistan\u2019s national power company.So much of everyday commerce and modern social life, even in Kabul, is conducted online, and every temporary return of power creates a dash to surf the web and recharge electrical devices.Assadullah, who was wiping the dust from his Toyota Corolla outside a Soviet-era apartment block in the Macrorayan neighborhood where he lives with his family, said he had only two hours of electricity a day.\u201cIf there is no electricity, then there is no heat,\u201d he said, \u201cand we don\u2019t get running water, which means all the toilets and bathrooms are unusable.\u201d Every evening, the women and children stand in line to fill buckets with water from the downstairs tap, which they then lug up the stairs.\u201cHonestly, we don\u2019t have any expectations for this government; they can\u2019t help the people,\u201d Mr. Assadullah, who also goes by one name, said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening with the problem because there is no electricity to watch the news on TV.\u201dBeyond the inconvenience and the damage to the country\u2019s limping economy, the cuts to power have exposed the vulnerability of a city that already felt besieged. The Taliban have been gaining ground since the departure of most United States and other NATO combat soldiers at the end of 2014, staging daily attacks on police and army checkpoints in Kabul and the surrounding provinces.Traveling by road even a few dozen miles outside the city can be a dicey proposition because of insurgents and brigands.The government has blamed the Taliban for the power failures, though the insurgents, through a spokesman, denied responsibility. Conspiracy-minded Afghans suggest that the destruction of power lines was the work of gangs seeking to profit by selling generators and the diesel to run them. Regardless of who is responsible, the areas where the pylons fell are the scenes of major battles between the army and the Taliban, and repair work cannot begin until hostilities cease and mines are cleared in the area.At the best of times, DABS, the power company, is able to meet less than three-quarters of the capital\u2019s demand of 800 megawatts of electricity, Mr. Delawari, the chief executive, said. Emergency measures, including the use of an American-financed diesel-powered plant, have made up some of the deficit, he said, but the supply is still well short of normal.\u201cExpectations are that we can bring the lines up in days, as soon as the area is secured,\u201d Mr. Delawari said. Last year an avalanche in the Salang Pass, north of Kabul, knocked out three pylons, he noted, requiring 45 days to fix, but that was in far more challenging terrain. In Baghlan, he said, a temporary fix could be rigged quickly if the combatants would stand down.\u201cI\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll be able to restore the electricity supply within the next week,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, a police commander in Baghlan reported that the DABS crew was already reconnecting cables, but a DABS spokesman disagreed, saying that no work could be done until land mines were defused and the area was secured. For now, the power failures are affecting almost every aspect of life in Kabul, including religious observance.\u201cMost people like me used to pray at home,\u201d said Sadiqullah, who had just emerged from a mosque in the Karte Seh neighborhood of the capital. \u201cNow we go to the local mosque, not only to pray, but because we can use the generator there to recharge our cellphones. If you plug in your phone for the whole time you\u2019re praying, you get just enough of a charge for a couple of phone calls.\u201d\u201cThen we come back and charge up again at the next call for prayer,\u201d he said.Jawad Sukhanyar and Ahmad Shakib contributed reporting from Kabul, and Najim Rahim from Kunduz, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why a Push for Online Privacy Is Bogged Down in Washington", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byIn his introduction to the report, President Obama went further, writing that his \u201cadministration will work to advance these principles and work with Congress to put them into law.\u201dFour years later, however, the effort has produced few new data controls for consumers, even as advocates say the need is greater than ever because of the advent of Internet-connected technologies that collect data on people\u2019s sleep habits, the temperature in their houses and the like.The story of how some of the country\u2019s leading civil society advocates came to lose faith in the White House\u2019s privacy initiative does not follow the typical plot of Washington gridlock. It is a tale of clashing visions for American society and commerce. And it provides an instructive preview of looming battles among government agencies for control over industries like drones, smartphones and gadgets yet to come.The ability of companies to freely amass and analyze the personal details of consumers also provides a counterpoint to the current fight between Apple and the F.B.I., in which Apple says it wants to protect consumer information from government snoops.At issue was not the classical notion of \u201cprivacy\u201d as the right to keep out prying eyes.When people freely search and share their personal concerns online, their data footprints can leave clues about their most intimate health worries, family matters and financial difficulties. Regulators warned that companies could use those details to narrowly categorize consumers, potentially leading to inferior or unfair treatment.Separately, officials at the Commerce Department were focusing on privacy as an economic issue. They did not want consumers to lose trust in digital services and stop patronizing them, said Cameron F. Kerry, the department\u2019s general counsel at the time. Commerce officials also wanted to ensure that American technology companies could continue to innovate with data.Over the next three years, administration officials developed the privacy initiative. They titled the effort the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to underscore the idea that, among other things, Americans had the right to expect that companies would not use their personal details for unexpected purposes.The document posited consumer privacy as a basic American right that was not dependent on the kindness of app makers.In addition to calling for consumer privacy legislation, the 2012 report proposed a parallel self-regulatory process: Under the auspices of the Commerce Department, industry and consumer groups were to work together to devise voluntary privacy practices for mobile apps, drones and other technologies.\u201cThe Obama administration released the first-ever comprehensive consumer privacy blueprint to provide a template for stakeholders from across the public and private sectors to implement policies that safeguard American consumers and innovation,\u201d Jennifer Friedman, deputy White House press secretary, said in an email.The lofty aims ran into challenges.The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a division of the Commerce Department, began to convene meetings to encourage technology companies, trade groups and consumer advocates to reach consensuses on privacy practices in various industries; the biometric industry would weigh in on facial recognition, for example.\u201cThat is a major success,\u201d said John Verdi, director of privacy initiatives at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The app notices, he said, were intended to make \u201cmore transparent to consumers what their privacy policies are, what data they collect, what data they share.\u201dThe multistakeholder talks on facial recognition technology were more contentious. Facial recognition can be used to identify unknown people by taking scans of their faces and comparing them with facial scans from a photo database of named people.\u201cThis is the single best process for moving this forward,\u201d he said.But David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the consensus process had proved to be of little benefit to consumers.\u201cIf you want to protect consumers,\u201d Mr. Vladeck said, \u201cyou don\u2019t simply allow industry to decide what to do in a way in which they don\u2019t have any incentive to compromise.\u201dThe clash continues between consumer advocates who warn that unfettered commercial data collection could chill the daily routines of Americans \u2014 where they go, what they say, how they shop \u2014 and industry advocates who warn that any restrictions on data collection could chill innovation.Administration officials say legislation is still needed.\u201cWe continue to call on Congress to advance legislation in line with the common-sense protections outlined in the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights,\u201d said Ms. Friedman, the White House spokeswoman.\u201cAn individual should have control over their information,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, \u201cnot a Facebook, Google or Internet service provider.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Russel, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cIt is an open discussion among the leaders.\u201dWhile officials said the gathering was not an \u201canti-China\u201d meeting, Washington is clearly trying to exert its leadership in Southeast Asia through investment, analysts said.\u201cChina\u2019s actions in the South China Sea have undermined its narrative of a peaceful rising and fostered new suspicions about its economic and geopolitical intentions in the region,\u201d said Kevin G. Nealer, a China expert and a partner with the Scowcroft Group, based in Washington. \u201cAmerica\u2019s most difficult relationships in the region are healthier and more high-functioning than China\u2019s best relations, and the deep and consistent American investment there has created habits of cooperation and shared goals with Asean that trade alone doesn\u2019t yield.\u201dChina has been Asean\u2019s largest trading partner since 2009, with two-way trade surpassing $366 billion in 2014, according to Asean trade data. The United States was fourth last year behind the European Union and Japan. Southeast Asia was also America\u2019s fourth-largest export market that year.However, America\u2019s strategy has focused on direct investment, where it is far ahead of China. American companies poured $32.3 billion into Southeast Asia from 2012 to 2014, according to Asean data, compared with $21.3 billion from China.From 2000 to 2014, the United States invested $226 billion in Southeast Asia, according to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, more than American investment in China, Japan and India combined.The United States aims to maintain its dominance in investment while taking the lead in trade, according to analysts, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the chief weapon in that quest. Four of Asean\u2019s 10 member states have already joined the pact, while three others \u2014 Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand \u2014 have either declared their intention to join or said they were considering doing so.Alexander C. Feldman, president and chief executive officer of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, said the summit meeting was the culmination of American economic strategy in the region dating back to Mr. Obama\u2019s first weeks in office.\u201cI think the strategy by the Obama administration has been a long-term one which reflects a whole vision of Asia and realizes that Asean is a critical piece of the puzzle often not focused on by past administrations,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cSince Day 1 they have focused on this region and understood that it was really the battleground for the future of Asia.\u201dThe region\u2019s trade with China has been robust. Southeast Asia has been a huge source of raw materials and commodities to feed both China\u2019s economic engine and its growing consumer class, supplying products like minerals and palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and electronics components from Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u201cChina is also a big aid donor, particularly for infrastructure projects, an area in which U.S. companies have had trouble competing because Southeast Asian governments produce so few bankable projects that U.S. banks are willing to finance,\u201d he said.The region\u2019s leading economies, including Indonesia, will feel the pain, according to economists. \u201cThe sensitivity of Indonesia to China\u2019s economy is very large, and that\u2019s also the case for Asean,\u201d said Destry Damayanti, an economist and commissioner at the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation who is based in Jakarta.It remains to be seen whether the United States can profit from China\u2019s downturn to increase its trade with the region.But the American edge in direct investment may be the greater long-term benefit, said Mr. Dean, the retired General Electric executive.\u201cOur business progress and biggest deals have been driven by investing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ensures a long-term presence, builds long-term relationships and makes us a local company in each country where we invest.\u201cTrading is short term and can go away faster than investment, and China will always have a competitive advantage due to its proximity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Crony Capitalist", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFour years ago, in the first draft of my book \u201cA Capitalism for the People,\u201d I had a section dedicated to how worrisome a Donald J. Trump presidential bid would be for America. I was not prescient. It\u2019s just that having grown up in Italy, I knew how a real estate tycoon \u2014 in this case, Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 whose career exemplified crony capitalism could become the leader of supposed pro-market forces, and I knew what it meant for the country.I cut this section after being told that my point was irrelevant: In America, there was no chance that a character like Mr. Trump would ever be seriously considered as a candidate.Then 2016 happened: After sweeping wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Mr. Trump has shattered that notion. The Trump phenomenon caught everybody by surprise. Yet it is a manifestation of a fundamental contradiction long present in the Republican Party: Despite fierce anti-big-business sentiment among many Republican voters, no Republican candidate has emerged to champion them.This contradiction created the space for Mr. Trump. In spite of being every bit a part of that pro-business establishment, Mr. Trump can pretend to be anti-establishment by sometimes reviling big business, because he doesn\u2019t need its funding for his campaign.Among self-identified Republicans in a 2010 Booth-Kellogg survey, 43 percent agreed that \u201cbig business distorts the functioning of markets to its own advantage,\u201d and only 22 percent disagreed. But the Republican establishment has happily become big business\u2019s mouthpiece. This fracture became evident during the congressional debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program: Many Republicans in the House voted against it, even though it came from George W. Bush, a Republican.Why have so few serious anti-establishment candidates emerged in the Republican presidential primaries? A grass-roots campaign for a House or Senate seat is within financial reach for some people, but not a presidential run. Without the support of big business, a Republican candidate would be unable to raise that kind of money.But Mr. Trump does not need rich donors. To his supporters, he appears to be a free-market evangelist. According to the latest Booth-Kellogg survey, 38 percent of American voters think that Mr. Trump has the most pro-market platform of any candidate (a lead of 13 points over the next candidate). If a cursory glance at his very vague platform \u2014 heavy import tax on China, a wall against immigration, etc. \u2014 is not sufficient to see how misplaced this trust is, look at Mr. Trump\u2019s career.As a businessman Mr. Trump has a longstanding habit of using his money and power aggressively to obtain special deals from the government. For example, his Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan was built with the benefit of a decades-long tax abatement obtained through government connections.In 1985, Mr. Trump circumvented New York State campaign-finance laws by making a $30,000 donation, through several Trump companies, to Andrew Stein, the Manhattan borough president who was running for president of the City Council. Mr. Stein was also a member of the New York City Board of Estimate, the body then responsible for land-use decisions in New York.Finally, Mr. Trump has a long history of promoting eminent-domain abuses to expropriate private land he wanted.He is, in short, the essence of that commingling of big business and government that goes under the name of crony capitalism.We cannot blame voters for being confused about pro-business versus pro-market politicians. The Republican establishment deserves most of the responsibility. Being pro-market means being in favor of competition and against excessive concentration, as Theodore Roosevelt was. Business executives are pro-market when they want to enter a new sector.But when they become established in a sector, they favor entry restrictions, excessive licensing, distortive regulation and corporate subsidies. Those policies are pro-business (in the sense that they favor existing businesses), but they are harmful and distort a competitive market economy.With the pretense of defending free markets, the Republican Party consistently supported big business. When did any Republican presidential candidate \u2014 other than Mr. Trump \u2014 speak in favor of some antitrust enforcement? When did he campaign for tougher enforcement against white-collar crime? When did anyone call for free trade in pharmaceuticals? Or for more competitive pricing of drugs bought by Medicare?The forced identification between the interest of markets and that of business practiced by the Republican establishment in the last 30 years made it easier for Republican voters to fall for Mr. Trump, a businessman who pretends to uphold free-market principles.It is an indication of a country\u2019s institutional corruption when inside a main party the only alternative to the prevailing crony capitalism is a tycoon with a long history of shady deals.Luigi Zingales is a professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Conservative Case for Campaign-Finance Reform", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorALL Americans should be alarmed about the effects of money in politics. But it is conservatives who should be leading the fight for campaign-finance reform. Unfortunately, none of the Republican candidates for president have taken on this issue.Why should conservative voters care? First, big money in politics encourages big government. Campaign contributions drive spending on earmarks and other wasteful programs \u2014 bridges to nowhere, contracts for equipment the military does not need, solar energy companies that go bankrupt on the government\u2019s dime and for-profit educational institutions that don\u2019t educate. When politicians are dependent on campaign money from contractors and lobbyists, they\u2019re incapable of holding spending programs to account.Campaign contributions also breed more regulation. Companies in heavily regulated industries such as banking, health care and energy are among the largest contributors. Such companies donate with the hope of winning narrowly tailored exceptions to regulations that help them and disadvantage their competitors. Politicians sometimes say they want to roll back regulations wholesale, but they rarely follow through because they know that less regulation will remove the incentive for future contributions. Some would call it extortion, but that is how the regulatory game is often played.Social conservatives and faith-based voters should care about big money in politics because it drowns out their voices on issues from abortion and euthanasia to gambling and pornography. Churches and other charitable groups are prohibited from contributing to campaigns or even endorsing candidates. Politicians pay them lip service, but their influence pales in comparison to large for-profit enterprises. Values don\u2019t pay for campaigns; health insurance companies, entertainment businesses, the gambling industry and its online counterparts do.It is, of course, illegal for foreigners and foreign companies to contribute to American political campaigns. Those restrictions, however, are as easy to evade as underage drinking laws on college campuses. There is a big money party going on in Washington and telling well-heeled foreigners that they can\u2019t attend simply won\u2019t work. They may act more discreetly than their American counterparts, but they will be there, and that so little of what goes on at the party is disclosed makes foreign participation that much easier.More important, the system is a betrayal of the vision of participatory democracy embraced by the founders of our country. They rebelled against oligarchy and corruption in England. They tossed the British tea into Boston Harbor in 1773 and demanded taxation only with representation. We should do the same.Taxation in the United States should be conditioned on every individual taxpayer\u2019s being allowed to designate the first $200 of his or her taxes to support a political candidate. Such a \u201ctax rebate for democracy\u201d would bring billions of small donations to political candidates, who would no longer depend on a tiny sliver of the population for the money they need to get elected. Government contractors and other beneficiaries of wasteful spending would have less influence, and ordinary voters would have a fighting chance to make sure the rest of their tax dollars were spent conservatively and responsibly.This and other reforms, including greater transparency about who is paying for election ads, and a less activist Supreme Court that would allow Congress and state legislatures to address campaign finance, would go a long way toward restoring the republican form of government that our founders embedded in the Constitution.Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, is the author of \u201cTaxation Only With Representation: The Conservative Conscience and Campaign Finance Reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Primary Exit Polls Show Terror Fears Aided Trump and Young Voters Helped Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byTwo-thirds of New Hampshire Republican primary voters agree with Donald J. Trump\u2019s proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States. And they overwhelmingly express fear of another terrorist attack.On the Democratic side, young voters and those most concerned about inequality and political integrity gave Bernie Sanders a convincing victory.Surveys of Democratic voters entering the caucuses in locations throughout New Hampshire on Tuesday evening.Those concerns helped drive Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders to victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday night. Exit polls offered a portrait of the first wave of American voters to cast ballots in a 2016 election that has already defied expectations and posed a sharp challenge to leading political dynasties. Democratic voters valuing honesty or empathy over experience or electability propelled Mr. Sanders to a solid victory. As in Iowa a week ago, the Vermont senator trounced Hillary Clinton among young voters and among those who said trustworthiness and \u201ccaring about people like me\u201d were critical to their votes.A quarter of Democratic voters said the right experience was most important to them, while slightly more than one in 10 said it was someone who can win in November. They strongly backed Mrs. Clinton.Mrs. Clinton topped Mr. Sanders by a wide margin among voters who said the next president should generally continue President Obama\u2019s policies. But they accounted for only about four in 10 Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire \u2014 far fewer than in Iowa. Instead, just as many voters said the next president should change to more liberal policies \u2014 and eight in 10 of these voters backed Mr. Sanders. Almost two-thirds of Democratic voters said they support replacing the current health care system with a single taxpayer-funded plan for all Americans.The New Hampshire results offer little clue to how Mr. Sanders will fare when the primary race moves to Southern and Midwestern states, where Mrs. Clinton enjoys strong support among African-Americans, Latinos, lower-income voters and union members. But his dominance so far among young people, independents and very liberal voters \u2014 a growing segment of the Democratic electorate \u2014- has put him in a surprisingly strong position after the first two contests.In New Hampshire, Mr. Sanders was backed by more than half of women, particularly younger women.Kelley Harrington, 28, a registered Democrat, cast her ballot for Mr. Sanders in Dover, N.H., on Tuesday morning.\u201cHe just seemed really humble and, like, a decent person, which is not often come by in politicians,\u201d said Ms. Harrington, a catering manager at a Panera Bread restaurant. \u201cI like how he likes the middle class, and wants to take away from the rich and give to the poor.\u201dMore than four in 10 of those who voted in the Republican primary identified as independents, and they largely backed Mr. Trump. Only about 15 percent of voters in the Republican primary were first-time voters, compared with 12 percent in 2012. They, too, overwhelmingly supported Mr. Trump, a sign that he has succeeded in bringing new voters to the polls.Independents accounted for four in 10 Democratic primary voters on Tuesday, and seven in 10 of them supported Mr. Sanders. In last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses, Mr. Sanders received about as much support from independents, but they made up only 20 percent of Democratic caucusgoers. New Hampshire Democrats were closely divided between the candidates.Donald J. Trump recorded a lopsided victory in the Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday.Republican voters saw Mr. Trump as the best candidate to handle an international crisis, and nine in 10 said they were somewhat worried or very worried about another terrorist attack in the United States.With near unanimity, Republican primary voters said they were concerned about the direction of the economy in the next few years, and they overwhelmingly backed Mr. Trump, who has run on his record as a businessman and billionaire. He was also chosen by a more than two to one ratio over any other candidate as best able to handle the economy.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s wide support, there were some cracks that might give him problems in the coming weeks.Asked to select the candidate quality that mattered most to them, Republican voters said they wanted a candidate who shared their values. Those voters supported Ted Cruz and John Kasich over Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump won the voters who said they were looking for someone who can bring about change and those looking for someone who tells it as it is.The exit polls were conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points for Republican and Democratic primary voters.Megan Thee-Brenan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sad Demise of the Summer Job", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byEditorialIn the 1990s, the federal summer jobs program provided work experience for more than half a million low-income young people around the country. The opportunities began to evaporate after 1998, when Congress de-emphasized the summer program to adopt what it viewed as a broader approach to helping young people. In most areas, enrollment in the summer programs dropped by 50 to 90 percent.Congress found a partial solution to chronic unemployment in the Recovery Act of 2009, which included a subsidy program that created more than 260,000 temporary jobs for young people and adults, many of whom were hired permanently once the subsidy ended. Unfortunately, Republicans blocked the extension of this valuable program.Republicans in Congress who are inclined to fight this spending on ideological grounds should consider the desperation that young unemployed people are facing in this country and the civic costs of standing idly by and doing nothing to help them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poll Watch: After Iowa, Terrain Looks More Challenging for Ted Cruz", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Ted Cruz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success in the Iowa caucuses on Monday was a victory for the Republican base, if not for the party establishment. Looking ahead to New Hampshire, the terrain will be quite different.He also won a plurality of the white evangelical vote, with 33 percent to Donald J. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 21 percent, after receiving crucial endorsements in the state from the religious leader Bob Vander Plaats and from Representative Steve King.Mr. Cruz even eked out a slight advantage over Mr. Trump among voters without college degrees. Less-educated voters have been a major source of Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support.But if the Iowa caucuses cater to the Republican Party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conservative base, New Hampshire is typically a state where broadly palatable, general-election-friendly candidates can stake their hopes. (Govs. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Chris Christie of New Jersey, relative moderates who each won less than 2 percent of the vote at Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caucuses, have invested heavily in New Hampshire while virtually ignoring Iowa.)The strong third-place finish on Monday of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida could position him as the candidate who threads the needle between the Republican base and the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business elite.Mr. Rubio earned 23 percent of the vote at last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s caucuses, more than any major pre-election poll had indicated. And the demographic groups that supported him most strongly tend to be of core importance to the Republican electorate in New Hampshire.Mr. Rubio also beat Mr. Cruz by nearly three to one among self-described moderates and liberals in Iowa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though Mr. Trump carried this group, with 34 percent. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump each earned 22 percent among those who described themselves as independents, more than any other candidates. The Republican primary in New Hampshire is open to undeclared voters; in 2012, moderates and liberals cast three of every 10 ballots. (By contrast, 85 percent of the Iowa caucusgoers this year were conservatives.)Those with family incomes of more than $100,000 a year accounted for roughly four in 10 voters at the 2012 New Hampshire primary, suggesting an opportunity for Mr. Rubio. He is increasingly positioning himself as the candidate to unite the party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealthier, executive sector with its populist, conservative base.What is perhaps most notable, Mr. Rubio won a whopping 43 percent support among Iowa caucusgoers most interested in finding a candidate who can win the general election. In 2012, those voters made up 45 percent of New Hampshire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary voters, compared with less than one in three Iowa caucusgoers that year. (This time round, they accounted for just 21 percent of Republican caucus attendees.)The caucuses on Monday were marked by overwhelming turnout on both the Republican and the Democratic sides. More than 186,000 Iowans attended the Republican caucuses, the highest on record. Over 170,000 Democrats caucused, too, exceeding most projections.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Increasingly Muffled Press", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Chinese media have never had much freedom to pursue muckraking stories, or even to dutifully report the facts. Now, President Xi Jinping is going to extraordinary lengths to rein the press in even further.Mr. Xi recently visited the three main newsrooms in the country to convey in unmistakable terms that journalists are expected to behave like apparatchiks. That message, which predictably received fawning coverage, came a few days after the government announced it would further restrict foreign media, too.Under rules Beijing says it will start enforcing next month, foreign companies will be barred from publishing online content \u2014 including text, videos, maps and games \u2014 in China without prior approval from the government. The regulations, which could affect major American companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, are intended to \u201cpromote core socialist values.\u201dThose stifling steps will add to the information barriers Chinese people already face. Major sites, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, which hundreds of millions of people around the globe use, are already blocked in China. The Chinese government began blocking access to the English and Chinese websites of The New York Times in 2012, in retaliation for an article that exposed the hidden wealth of relatives of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister.Mr. Xi may feel pressure to restrict the worldview of his citizens at a time when the Chinese economy is under strain. An article on Monday in the country\u2019s official English-language newspaper, China Daily, said news organizations were \u201cessential to political stability.\u201d\u201cIt is necessary for the media to restore people\u2019s trust in the party, especially as the economy has entered a new normal and suggestions that it is declining and dragging down the global economy have emerged,\u201d the article said.It is during trying times, of course, that societies benefit most from a press that is free to scrutinize questionable policies and expose ineffective leaders.Mr. Xi\u2019s new guidance is likely to make the official press even more docile than it traditionally has been. But the approach will be self-defeating for the government in the long run. In an increasingly interconnected world, it is harder to control the flow of information across borders and within countries. New mechanisms of Internet censorship are typically met with creative tools to bypass them. And each new effort to keep Chinese people ignorant about their government and the outside world will make them only more determined to learn.Advertisement"}

That is really not my scene,\u201d Sara Maino, senior editor at Italian Vogue and scion of one of the most powerful families in Italian fashion, said on the eve of fashion week. Her aunt (and boss) is Franca Sozzani, the longtime editor in chief at Italian Vogue, and her mother is Carla Sozzani, founder of the Milan super-boutique 10 Corso Como.\u201cI spend most of my time off the grid during show season, in dingy studios, classrooms \u2014 even people\u2019s living rooms,\u201d Ms. Maino continued. \u201cMany of the designers I am looking for don\u2019t have the money to come to me. So instead, I go to them. I like it that way.\u201dFor ambitious would-be designers with fashion dreams, Ms. Maino, 42, has become a high-profile guiding light. As the head of talent at Italian Vogue, she oversees its search for new faces, its competitions and initiatives, and is one of the most well-known, respected and nomadic talent spotters in the business.While she dislikes the term \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s more like I highlight them in a critical moment\u201d \u2014 her hand has helped the likes of the clothing designers Jonathan Anderson and Stella Jean; Sophia Webster, who creates footwear; and Sara Battaglia, who designs handbags, on their path to recognition and acclaim. \u201cWhat makes Sara such a force is that she is genuinely looking for designers who can revolutionize the market,\u201d Franca Sozzani said from the front row of the Gucci show on Wednesday. \u201cThis business is getting tougher and tougher, so those creating more of the same will just die; they will disappear,\u201d she continued. \u201cThrough our Vogue Talents program, Sara has pushed and encouraged new talent to break the mold, but goes a step further by helping them find the mentoring, funding and media spotlight necessary to have staying power, too.\u201dFederico Marchetti, chief executive of the Yoox Net-a-Porter Group, said Ms. Maino \u201cis a highly talented scout. With Franca Sozzani and the rest of the Vogue team, we have all worked side-by-side to scout young talents and showcased them on yoox.com for years, giving them a global stage for e-tail.\u201dNot that Ms. Maino planned her life this way. She said she had never been wedded to working in fashion; a stint helping her mother ended before she was out of her teens. In 1994 she joined Vogue for a six-year internship, then became a stylist, and since 2009 has also held her scouting role, which is where she found her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy working with one\u2019s parents,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople thought it was an obvious next step, but at the time it wasn\u2019t for me. I just needed to earn money and figure out what I wanted to do with my life.\u201dMs. Maino not only has a different surname from her fashion-famous relatives (thanks to her father, Donato Maino, another executive at 10 Corso Como) but a different signature look: A cloud of wavy black hair and minimalist all-black tailoring. \u201cAs you can see, I am hardly a slave to trends,\u201d she said.\u201cBut I liked the idea of scouting for the new and unseen, and found myself incorporating into my shoots pieces that had been overlooked by others, that made people ask more about who had made them, at a time when the Italian scene was totally dominated by big-name brands and their aesthetics,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a tragic period for independent designers in Italy. There were simply no systems in place to help them grow.\u201dHer aunt had also recognized the importance of identifying and supporting the next generation. So, in 2009, the idea of Vogue Talents was born. Today, Ms. Maino and her team of four are responsible for two Vogue Talents issues each year, uncovering the best women\u2019s wear, men\u2019s wear, accessories and fashion photography talents worldwide and then offering them connections to education, networking and investment opportunities. She also heads the Next Talents cocktail reception hosted by Vogue and Yoox during Milan Fashion Week.\u201cItaly has come on leaps and bounds in the last six years and the improvement in the attitudes of the old establishment have been incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cThat said, we are at risk of a glut of competitions; those alone are not enough when it comes to sustainable solutions.\u201d Ms. Maino bristles at the use of \u201cyoung\u201d when referring to the designers she finds. \u201cPlenty of them are 40, and to suggest that is young is ridiculous,\u201d she said. She added that she preferred \u201cindependent\u201d but would grudgingly settle for \u201cemerging.\u201d \u201cYou know that saying, better late than never? Well, we are extremely late and there is a long way to go,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are catching up with elsewhere \u2014 although it is important that I\u2019m elsewhere, too.\u201dRecently returned from Saudi Arabia, Ms. Maino estimated that she now spent about two-thirds of her time traveling. And for all their differences, she is noticing that many designers share consistent patterns regardless of where they are in the world.\u201cVery few of them have aspirations to be the next Burberry or Dolce & Gabbana, or to work behind the scenes for those billion-dollar businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cMost are determined to build distinctive brands of their own around their own individual voices. And with the might of social media behind them as a publicity engine, some have been able to generate remarkable followings for their work.\u201dBut with Italy\u2019s stagnating economy and a slowdown in major luxury markets further afield, plus structural upheavals happening in the fashion world\u2019s traditional business models, Ms. Maino cautioned that the present uncertainty doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for those gearing up for the future.\u201cWho is to say what will happen? But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a lot of the big and more established brands revert to looking after their own as they adjust to the on-demand era,\u201d she said, rising to leave for a series of appointments with students working in warehouses in London\u2019s East End. \u201cThose waiting for their big chance need help more than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense.

Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we\u2019re simply going to become a party that preys on people\u2019s angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it\u2019s been in its story history.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Welcome to Texas.(APPLAUSE)Here, Texas provided my family with hope.

Is it?TRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they\u2019ve been debating this every debate that we\u2019ve had.As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking, and you wouldn\u2019t have asked that as the first question if it weren\u2019t for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn\u2019t even be a big subject.But, we either have a country, or we don\u2019t have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back \u2014 some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that\u2019s very fair, and very fine.They\u2019re going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they\u2019re going to come back through a process.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, what\u2019s wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, \u201cthe good ones\u201d come back to the United States?CRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country \u2014 our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what\u2019s happened there \u2014 it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they\u2019re spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That\u2019s who we need to be fighting for.Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that\u2019s why I will do the same thing as president.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, I\u2019m very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama\u2019s. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.Are those claims correct?RUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I\u2019ve been abundantly clear on this. When I\u2019m president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, that\u2019s not just the physical border with Mexico, it\u2019s Visa overstays. That\u2019s 45 percent of the problem right there.RUBIO: It also has to do \u2014 that\u2019s why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, we\u2019re not doing anything else. And then we\u2019ll see what the American people are willing to support.And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he\u2019s now taking are new to him.In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you\u2019ve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.My mom and dad \u2014 my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it\u2019s an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that\u2019s the way I define it, is you\u2019re going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.As far as the people that I\u2019ve hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It\u2019s the up season. People didn\u2019t want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn\u2019t get.Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn\u2019t get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.RUBIO: That \u2014 my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That\u2019s what I criticize Mitt Romney \u2014 I mean, ran...RUBIO: No, he...TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That\u2019s an election that should have been won.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term \u201cself-deportation.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s on the record and people can look it up right now online.But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it\u2019s really important, this point. I think it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if you\u2019re going to claim that you\u2019re the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you\u2019re only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland...TRUMP: No, no, I\u2019m the only one on the stage that\u2019s hired people. You haven\u2019t hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And by the way, I\u2019ve hired \u2014 and by the way, I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You\u2019ve hired nobody.RUBIO: Yes, you\u2019ve hired a thousand from another country...TRUMP: You\u2019ve had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don\u2019t tell me about that.RUBIO: Let me just say \u2014 let me finish the statement. This is important.TRUMP: You haven\u2019t hired one person, you liar.RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...TRUMP: That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s wrong. Totally wrong.RUBIO: That\u2019s a fact. People can look it up. I\u2019m sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. \u201cTrump Polish workers,\u201d you\u2019ll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That happened.TRUMP: I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Let me talk. I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: But I\u2019ve hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That\u2019s existing law.But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the \u201cgang of eight\u201d amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the \u201cgang of eight,\u201d one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you\u2019re funding open border politicians, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I can only say this, and I\u2019ve said it loud and clear and I\u2019ve said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now \u2014 your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they\u2019re packed with you.I\u2019ve had an amazing relationship with politicians \u2014 with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he\u2019s a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You don\u2019t have one Republican \u2014 you don\u2019t have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don\u2019t have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don\u2019t have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he\u2019s elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he\u2019s right. He has supported \u2014 he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn\u2019t be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let\u2019s actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn\u2019t like it.And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that\u2019s not a good attribute for a president.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Here\u2019s a man \u2014 Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn\u2019t even put that he\u2019s borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didn\u2019t talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he\u2019s going to protect the people from the big bad banks.Give me a break.BLITZER: All right. We\u2019re going to move on to Governor Kasich.Governor Kasich...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. He\u2019s been waiting patiently.Governor Kasich, the idea \u2014 you\u2019ve said this, and I want to quote you now: \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it.\u201d Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it\u2019s not feasible to stop them?KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem \u2014 a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it\u2019s done, you don\u2019t have a right to come in. If you come in, we don\u2019t want any excuse. You\u2019re going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it\u2019s practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans \u2014 the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, I\u2019d make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I\u2019d give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to tear families apart. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to ride around in people\u2019s neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don\u2019t think \u2014 first of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical and I don\u2019t think it reflects America.You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn\u2019t get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, let\u2019s be practical. Let\u2019s start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, you\u2019ve been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don\u2019t think Mr. Trump\u2019s plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I\u2019ve already described \u2014 you know, how we can secure the border.We need to secure all the borders, because it\u2019s not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.But in terms of the people who are here already, after we \u2014 after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don\u2019t have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that\u2019s the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.And we have other ways of \u2014 of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don\u2019t feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.TRUMP: (inaudible).BLITZER: It\u2019s about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You\u2019ve said the Mexican government will pay for it.TRUMP: Correct.BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox \u2014 he said today, and I\u2019m quoting him \u2014 he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for that,\u201d quote, \u201ceffing wall.\u201d(LAUGHTER)So if you don\u2019t get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.(APPLAUSE)It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that \u2014 I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn\u2019t include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.We\u2019re going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it\u2019ll end up costing $200 billion.(APPLAUSE)But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 \u2014 you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago \u2014 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it\u2019s a real wall. This is a wall that\u2019s a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you\u2019re looking at. This is a wall that\u2019s going to work.Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...(BELL RINGS)... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It\u2019s a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: If the \u2014 if the Mexicans don\u2019t pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?TRUMP: Well, you know, I don\u2019t mind trade wars when we\u2019re losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We\u2019re losing so much. (APPLAUSE)We\u2019re losing so much with Mexico and China \u2014 with China, we\u2019re losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, \u201cdon\u2019t we want to trade?\u201d I don\u2019t mind trading, but I don\u2019t want to lose $500 billion. I don\u2019t want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They\u2019re building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say I\u2019m not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They\u2019re taking our businesses. I don\u2019t mind.BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he\u2019ll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.RUBIO: But it \u2014 no, it\u2019s not a sound bite. It\u2019s a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. You\u2019ll see it.The second thing, about the trade war \u2014 I don\u2019t understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you\u2019re gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.TRUMP: All right, you know what?RUBIO: Why don\u2019t you make them in America?TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency \u2014 they devalue their currencies...RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.TRUMP: ... that makes it \u2014 well, you don\u2019t know a thing about business. You lose on everything...RUBIO: Well, make them in America. TRUMP: Let me just tell you \u2014 they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.RUBIO: Well then, make them in America.TRUMP: That makes it \u2014 well, you don\u2019t know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.RUBIO: Well, make them in America.TRUMP: Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...RUBIO: And so you make them in China and in Russia.TRUMP: But you wouldn\u2019t know anything about it because you\u2019re a lousy businessman.RUBIO: Well, I don\u2019t know anything about bankrupting four companies. You\u2019ve bankrupted..TRUMP: No, I \u2014 and you know why? You know why?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: I don\u2019t know anything about...TRUMP: You know why?RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that was a fake university.BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: First of all...BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: ... first of all, that\u2019s called a...RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...BLITZER: Hold on. One at a time, Mr. Trump.RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and they\u2019re suing now \u2014 $36,000 to go to a university...TRUMP: And by the way \u2014 and by the way...RUBIO: ... that\u2019s a fake school.TRUMP: ... and by the way...RUBIO: And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...TRUMP: ... I\u2019ve won most of the lawsuits.RUBIO: That\u2019s what they got for $36,000.BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job, but I\u2019ve won most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.TRUMP: Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?BLITZER: You\u2019re allowed \u2014 you\u2019ve been responding.TRUMP: OK. Well let \u2014 no, I haven\u2019t. I really haven\u2019t.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: He\u2019s talked through the whole thing.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Here\u2019s a guy \u2014 here\u2019s a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who\u2019s probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we\u2019re going to have as president.RUBIO: Here\u2019s a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn\u2019t inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?TRUMP: No, no, no.RUBIO: Selling watches in (inaudible)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...RUBIO: That\u2019s where he would be. TRUMP: That is so wrong. We\u2019ll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.RUBIO: Oh, OK. One million.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...RUBIO: Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...RUBIO: Oh, he doesn\u2019t make that money.TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama\u2019s executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.RUBIO: Correct.ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I\u2019m going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to cancel it immediately.So Senator Rubio, what changed?RUBIO: It didn\u2019t change.ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?RUBIO: No, it\u2019s the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will \u2014 we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not compassionate to the plight of a 2 \u2014 someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn\u2019t have the power to do that.(APPLAUSE)And he himself admitted that.ARRASAS: Senator, Senator...RUBIO: I\u2019m sorry, but let me finish my...ARRASAS: ... but you went \u2014 you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.RUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can\u2019t solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie?RUBIO: Because it is not true that I\u2019m not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don\u2019t even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take \u2014 as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there\u2019s a statute of limitation on lies.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you\u2019re right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. CRUZ: You know, we\u2019ve both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, it\u2019ll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn\u2019t plan to end it at all.You know, I\u2019m reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.Marco\u2019s position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.RUBIO: That\u2019s not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I don\u2019t agree with the mandate and the program that\u2019s in place, but I think it\u2019s unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we\u2019re just going to yank it away from them.And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is \u2014 at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.(APPLAUSE)And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?CRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you\u2019re liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.You know, we\u2019ve got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father\u2019s story.Telling my Dad\u2019s story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.RUBIO: I\u2019m sorry I was mentioned...ARRASAS: ... Governor Kasich.RUBIO: Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement.ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the...RUBIO: ... OK. I was mentioned \u2014 just because of the hispanic \u2014 and I\u2019ll be brief.A couple points, number one, I do think it\u2019s amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.Yes, it\u2019s an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I\u2019m going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That\u2019s what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos. Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I\u2019m going to quote it, \u201cif hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn\u2019t want them in the United States they won\u2019t pay attention to our next sentence.\u201dSo, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?KASICH: Well, I\u2019m not going to talk about that. I mean, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don\u2019t like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother\u2019s thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I\u2019m going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven\u2019t changed anything with it.And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.But here\u2019s the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.It\u2019s what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me. And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.It\u2019s time to solve problems.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?CARSON: I didn\u2019t hear the first part of the question?ARRASAS: The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.And one of them was that they shouldn\u2019t feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.CARSON: OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.And the reason that I don\u2019t fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are \u2014 that give liberty and justice to all people.And that\u2019s the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think that\u2019s the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don\u2019t pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race. You keep saying that Hispanics love you.TRUMP: True.(LAUGHTER)ARRASAS: And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.TRUMP: True.ARRASAS: But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you. They don\u2019t like you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you an unelectable...TRUMP: No.ARRASAS: ... candidate in a general election?TRUMP: First of all, I don\u2019t believe anything Telemundo says.ARRASAS: You used to say that you love...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They\u2019re incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.They get it. They\u2019re incredible people. They\u2019re incredible workers. They get it. And I\u2019ve won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn\u2019t maybe win the Telemundo poll.But one thing I\u2019m also going to do, I\u2019m going to be getting \u2014 bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you\u2019re seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.TRUMP: We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one \u2014 the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.TRUMP: New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past. But it is not just a Telemundo poll. We have...TRUMP: I love them. I love them.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: All right. Well, it\u2019s not the only poll.TRUMP: They\u2019re fine. Do you know what? They\u2019re fine.ARRASAS: Just last night \u2014 let me \u2014 let me finish, please.Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you. And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 \u2014 let me finish please \u2014 of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.TRUMP: Why did they take the poll? Why did they...(CROSSTALK)ARRASAS: I am making reference \u2014 I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.TRUMP: I\u2019m just telling you, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision. It was settled. We\u2019re good friends now. It was all settled up.(LAUGHTER)Very happy, very happy. Very good people.I\u2019m just telling you \u2014 I\u2019m just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I\u2019m telling you also, I\u2019m bringing people, Democrats over and I\u2019m bringing independents over, and we\u2019re building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.Hugh?HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.To me, it\u2019s the most important issue. I\u2019ll start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?CRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it \u2014 Justice Scalia\u2019s passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this \u2014 this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I\u2019m certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.I\u2019ve spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they\u2019re asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies \u2014 all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it\u2019s repealed, it was a five-four decision, they\u2019re going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?TRUMP: Yes, I would. And I\u2019ve been there. And I\u2019ve been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it\u2019s not anybody\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not Ted\u2019s fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way \u2014 no way that he should have approved Obamacare.Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don\u2019t want.HEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz\u2019s criticism?CRUZ: Well, listen \u2014 Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, it\u2019s true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And I\u2019ll tell you, Hugh...(APPLAUSE)... you know, it\u2019s interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who \u2014 who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...(BELL RINGS)... and cut a deal.HEWITT: Mr. Trump...CRUZ: So that means on Supreme Court...HEWITT: ... can I...CRUZ: ... he\u2019s going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won\u2019t cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Can I trust you on religious liberty?TRUMP: Well, let \u2014 let me \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted \u2014 and I respected it, but he gets nowhere \u2014 stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that\u2019s going to make deals.It\u2019s wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted\u2019s been very critical \u2014 I have a sister who\u2019s a brilliant...HEWITT: Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?TRUMP: ... excuse me. She\u2019s a brilliant judge. He\u2019s been criticizing \u2014 he\u2019s been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?HEWITT: Let me \u2014 Senator.CRUZ: Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can\u2019t have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You\u2019ve got to be willing to cut a deal.And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald \u2014 Donald Trump.Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.(BELL RINGS)You know what, Donald...(CROSSTALK)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.CRUZ: ... I don\u2019t want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot \u2014 give me a break.HEWITT: Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?RUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here \u2014 the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.Justice Scalia \u2014 in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document \u2014 it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia \u2014 plus there may be at least two other vacancies.So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.Now, if he\u2019s changed, we\u2019re always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don\u2019t have a record there to look at and say, \u201cI feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he\u2019s going to be firmly on our side on these issues.\u201dIn fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he\u2019s not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.HEWITT: Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Well, let \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative \u2014 more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I\u2019m pro-life. I\u2019m totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women \u2014 cervical cancer, breast cancer \u2014 are helped by Planned Parenthood.So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn\u2019t fund it.I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don\u2019t know what percentage it is. They say it\u2019s 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I\u2019m pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty. You\u2019ve been a little bit less emphatic. You\u2019ve said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people? KASICH: Well, you know, , of course. I mean, if \u2014 look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don\u2019t favor it. I\u2019ve always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I\u2019ve moved on. And what I\u2019ve said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?If you\u2019re in the business of selling things, if you\u2019re not going to sell to somebody you don\u2019t agree with, OK, today I\u2019m not going to sell to somebody who\u2019s gay, and tomorrow maybe I won\u2019t sell to somebody who\u2019s divorced.I mean, if you\u2019re in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That\u2019s my view. And if you don\u2019t agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, I\u2019ve appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.And you know what they are? They\u2019re conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don\u2019t make the law. They interpret the law. That\u2019s all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.But let\u2019s just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.HEWITT: Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear?(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Are the positions you\u2019ve heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That\u2019s unfair.And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That\u2019s why we have divided government. And we\u2019re going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person\u2019s life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let\u2019s talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.BASH: Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you\u2019re worried he won\u2019t?RUBIO: The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don\u2019t believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here\u2019s what we need to replace it with.We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.And if you don\u2019t have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn\u2019t just bad for health care, it\u2019s bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people\u2019s hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond?TRUMP: I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I\u2019m referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.I think we need it. I think it\u2019s a modern age. And I think we have to have it.(APPLAUSE)BASH: OK, so let\u2019s talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong?TRUMP: I think they\u2019re wrong 100 percent. What we need \u2014 look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. TRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got \u2014 I\u2019m not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they\u2019re part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.And, actually, the Governor too, let\u2019s just talk about these too, OK?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Because I don\u2019t think the Governor had too much to do with this.But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there\u2019s great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there\u2019s serious, serious competition.BASH But, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... And, you\u2019re going to see \u2014 excuse me. You\u2019re going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they\u2019re making a fortune.(APPLAUSE)BASH: But, just to be specific here, what you\u2019re saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...TRUMP: That\u2019s going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren\u2019t going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say \u2014 they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they\u2019re friends of mine. The top guys, they\u2019re friends of mine. I shouldn\u2019t tell you guys, you\u2019ll say it\u2019s terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They\u2019re friends of mine, there\u2019s some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He\u2019s not laughing so much anymore.Hi.(APPLAUSE)Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we\u2019ll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.RUBIO: Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...BASH: ... Go ahead.RUBIO: You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don\u2019t follow this stuff very closely, but here\u2019s what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. They\u2019re suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.Here\u2019s what you didn\u2019t hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps...TRUMP: ... And, you don\u2019t know what it means...RUBIO: ... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?TRUMP: You don\u2019t know.BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan...TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, I\u2019ll have you know...RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan... TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he\u2019s got is he really doesn\u2019t know about the lines. The biggest thing we\u2019ve got, and the reason we\u2019ve got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...TRUMP: ... You don\u2019t know much...RUBIO: ... So, you\u2019re only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan...TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...RUBIO: ... That\u2019s your only plan...TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done \u2014 not now...RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...TRUMP: ... Excuse me. Excuse me.RUBIO: ... His plan. That was the plan...TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you\u2019ll have many. They\u2019ll compete, and it\u2019ll be a beautiful thing.RUBIO: Alright...(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: So, that\u2019s the only part of the plan? Just the lines?BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: The nice part of the plan \u2014 you\u2019ll have many different plans. You\u2019ll have competition, you\u2019ll have so many different plans.RUBIO: Now he\u2019s repeating himself.TRUMP: No, no, no.(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible)RUBIO: (inaudible)(CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago... RUBIO: ... I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I\u2019ve never seen it in anybody...BASH: ... Let\u2019s stay focused on the subject...TRUMP: ... I thought he came out of the swimming pool...RUBIO: ... I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone\u2019s dumb, he\u2019s gonna make America great again...BASH: ... Senator Rubio...RUBIO: ... We\u2019re going to win, win win, he\u2019s winning in the polls...BASH: ... Senator Rubio, please.RUBIO: ... And the lines around the state.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: ... Every night.BASH: Senator Rubio.(CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell the truth, I tell the truth.BASH: Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you\u2019ve just posed to him...RUBIO: ... Yeah, he\u2019s going to give us his plan now, right? OK...BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more about your plan. I know you talked about...TRUMP: ... We\u2019re going to have many different plans because...BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...TRUMP: ... competition...RUBIO: ... He\u2019s done it again.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies. They\u2019re going to have many, many different plans. BASH: Is there anything else you would like to add to that...TRUMP: No, there\u2019s nothing to add.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: What is to add?BASH: Thank you. Thank you both.RUBIO: Alright.BASH: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said it is, quote, \u201cUn American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition.\u201dBASH: Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?KASICH: No, I wouldn\u2019t. And \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You don\u2019t want any American to lose their house, everything they\u2019ve saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what we\u2019ve heard here tonight. We\u2019re actually running significant health reform in my state.I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don\u2019t want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.And then we\u2019re driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it\u2019s easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.And I\u2019ll tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.BASH: Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate. In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?KASICH: Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tenable. And we don\u2019t need to do that. Again, I\u2019m telling you that we are going to \u2014 we have a proposal, a plan that we\u2019re enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you\u2019re providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint \u2014 some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they\u2019re going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can\u2019t afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We\u2019re actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go \u2014 this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what\u2019s going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.We don\u2019t want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. We\u2019re losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.BASH: Governor Kasich, thank you.KASICH: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?CARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad\u2019s $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody\u2019s going to hide his cigarettes because they\u2019re all interested in what\u2019s going on there.Also, the \u2014 your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, it\u2019s like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What\u2019s the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.CARSON: But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all \u2014 they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.BLITZER: Thank you.CARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don\u2019t get to talk that much. And, you know, let\u2019s...(APPLAUSE)... you can have the money that\u2019s left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that\u2019s probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.BLITZER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let\u2019s talk about the economy. Let\u2019s talk about...CRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?BLITZER: I want to move on, but there\u2019ll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...CRUZ: It\u2019s kind of an issue I have a long history with.BLITZER: I know you do. And \u2014 all right, go ahead.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.KASICH: How do you \u2014 how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You\u2019re very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.(APPLAUSE)On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, it\u2019s killed millions of jobs, and it\u2019s hurting people\u2019s health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.What he\u2019s said is government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you\u2019re a small business owner, Donald Trump\u2019s socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you\u2019re elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it\u2019s been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don\u2019t get that hip replacement, you don\u2019t get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.I\u2019ll tell you this. As president...BLITZER: Senator...CRUZ: ... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it\u2019s going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn\u2019t work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.CRUZ: Donald, true or false, you\u2019ve said the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care.TRUMP: That\u2019s false.CRUZ: You\u2019ve never said that?TRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...CRUZ: But you\u2019ve never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.TRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.CRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you have no heart.TRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I\u2019m president.CRUZ: Have you said you\u2019re a liberal on health care?TRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...CRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.TRUMP: If people \u2014 my plan is very simple. I will not \u2014 we\u2019re going to have private \u2014 we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I\u2019m president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...CRUZ: So does the government pay for everyone\u2019s health care?TRUMP: ... I\u2019m not fine with it. We are going to take those people...CRUZ: Yes or no. Just answer the question.TRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We\u2019re going to make great deals on it, but we\u2019re not going to let them die in the streets.CRUZ: Who pays for it?RUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?BLITZER: Gentleman, please.RUBIO: Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.BLITZER: Gentlemen please. I want to move on.RUBIO: This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...BLITZER: I want to talk about the economy.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentleman, gentleman. All of you have agreed \u2014 Senator Cruz...TRUMP: You know what? Call it what you want.CRUZ: It\u2019s a yes or no.TRUMP: Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.BLITZER: All of you have agreed \u2014 all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. We\u2019re talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn\u2019t saddled with even more debt? TRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We\u2019ll be dynamic again. If you look at what\u2019s going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.It\u2019s shutting off our economy. It\u2019s shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can\u2019t get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.BLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?TRUMP: We\u2019re going to make many cuts in business. We\u2019re getting rid of \u2014 we\u2019re going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education \u2014 Common Core is out. We\u2019re going local. Have to go local.(APPLAUSE)Environmental protection \u2014 we waste all of this money. We\u2019re going to bring that back to the states. And we\u2019re going to have other (inaudible) many things. (APPLAUSE)We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.BLITZER: Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump. If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that\u2019s about $68 billion. If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that\u2019s about $8 billion. That\u2019s about $76 billion for those two agencies.The current deficit this year is $544 billion. Where are you going to come up with the money?TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse.(APPLAUSE)You look at what\u2019s happening with Social Security, you look \u2014 look at what\u2019s happening with every agency \u2014 waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.BLITZER: Governor Kasich.(APPLAUSE)When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had. Can Mr. Trump\u2019s plan work?KASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I\u2019ve done it. I mean, I \u2014 we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington \u2014 every single one of them \u2014 and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you don\u2019t have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won\u2019t get there. You will never be able to do it.Now, I \u2014 I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts \u2014 the biggest of any governor in the country \u2014 and we have a fiscal plan.And it\u2019s not all \u2014 it\u2019s not always cutting. It\u2019s innovating \u2014 it\u2019s producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.And, look \u2014 I\u2019ve got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.I\u2019ve done it \u2014 I did it in Washington \u2014 four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened.(BELL RINGS)I\u2019ve done it in Ohio, we\u2019re growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that.(APPLAUSE)Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, governor.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of taxes...TRUMP: I just want to say \u2014 and I\u2019m a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.KASICH: OK, let me \u2014 let me \u2014 let me just talk about that, because I know that \u2014 that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we\u2019ve created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it\u2019s early-stage.See, what we\u2019ve done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that\u2019s jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.We \u2014 we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon \u2014 their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why it\u2019s happening?(BELL RINGS)Because we\u2019re balanced budgets, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re job-friendly, we don\u2019t raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I\u2019m quoting him now, \u201cthere is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them.\u201dRomney said either you\u2019re not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven\u2019t paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven\u2019t been giving the money to veterans or disabled people. Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?TRUMP: All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form \u2014 almost 100 pages. You don\u2019t learn anything about somebody\u2019s wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements. TRUMP: I filed \u2014 which shows that I\u2019m worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn\u2019t ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.So as far as that\u2019s concerned, I filed it. And that\u2019s where you find out what kind of a company. You don\u2019t learn anything from a tax return.I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn\u2019t file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I\u2019ve been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.Nobody gets audited \u2014 I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I\u2019m being audited now for two or three years, so I can\u2019t do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.BLITZER: Hugh, go ahead.HEWITT: Mr. Trump. You told me...TRUMP: Are you going to ask anybody else that question?CARSON: Yes, amen, amen.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Every single question comes to me?HEWITT: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know I\u2019m here for the ratings, but it\u2019s a little bit ridiculous.(LAUGHTER) HEWITT: Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.TRUMP: True.HEWITT: Are you going back on your commitment?TRUMP: No, I\u2019m not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That\u2019s the good news.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Let me just tell you, let me just \u2014 which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can\u2019t release it while I\u2019m under an audit. We\u2019re under a routine audit. I\u2019ve had it for years, I get audited.And obviously if I\u2019m being audited, I\u2019m not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.HEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns. Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released. And you said, coming out any day momentarily. When are we going to see your returns?RUBIO: Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And there\u2019s nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily I\u2019m not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It\u2019s a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I\u2019ve been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.And I think if we \u2014 the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is \u2014 the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.HEWITT: Thank you, Senator Rubio. But I am...(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: I\u2019m being fair to all of the candidates.Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away. Why haven\u2019t voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?CRUZ: So, I\u2019ve released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes \u2014 you know, Donald says he\u2019s being audited.Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...TRUMP: Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.CRUZ: ... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. They\u2019re going to pick apart his taxes. They\u2019re going to pick apart his business deals.And let\u2019s take, for example, one of Hillary\u2019s great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.CRUZ: The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, \u201cbut gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding.\u201dHe can\u2019t prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can\u2019t risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I\u2019m a businessman. I have, over the years.And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he\u2019s doing well in the polls. Well, I\u2019m beating him in virtually every poll. I\u2019m tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn\u2019t be. But I think I\u2019ll do very well.(APPLAUSE)But a poll just came out \u2014 a Bloomberg poll \u2014 where I am beating him so badly that it\u2019s, like, embarrassing even for me to say I\u2019m beating him that badly.(APPLAUSE)And \u2014 and here\u2019s the thing \u2014 it was sort of funny \u2014 65 percent of the people don\u2019t like you \u2014 I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent...(BELL RINGS)... on another one. That means \u2014 and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly \u2014 that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, \u201cI can\u2019t lose South Carolina.\u201d I beat him in a landslide.Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls. One other thing \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t even started at her. I only had one little interchange...(APPLAUSE)... I only had one little interchange, and that was...(BELL RINGS)... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen.CRUZ: Hold on. He \u2014 he attacked me, Wolf. I get a response.BLITZER: I was about to say \u2014 Senator Cruz, respond.CRUZ: Thank you. Thank \u2014 thank \u2014 thank you very much.You know, it\u2019s interesting \u2014 Donald went \u2014 went on \u2014 on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn\u2019t respond to any of the substance. He has yet to say \u2014 he can release past year\u2019s tax returns. He can do it tomorrow.He doesn\u2019t want to do it, because presumably there\u2019s something in there...TRUMP: Nothing.CRUZ: ... that is bad. If there\u2019s nothing, release them tomorrow.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: They\u2019re already prepared. The only reason he\u2019s not releasing them...TRUMP: You \u2014 you don\u2019t...CRUZ: ... is because he\u2019s afraid that he will get hit.TRUMP: I\u2019m not afraid (inaudible).CRUZ: You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. It\u2019s a fraud case. His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...(BELL RINGS)... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud. You don\u2019t think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?BLITZER: All right (ph)...CRUZ: If \u2014 we\u2019ve got to win this election, and we can\u2019t do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can\u2019t take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.BLITZER: Mr. Trump. Mr, \u2014 hold on. Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... first of all, he\u2019s talking about the polls. I\u2019m beating him awfully badly in the polls.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: But you\u2019re not beating Hillary. You\u2019re not beating Hillary.TRUMP: Well, then, if I can\u2019t \u2014 if \u2014 hey, if I can\u2019t beat her, you\u2019re really going to get killed, aren\u2019t you?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: So \u2014 so let me ask you this, because you\u2019re really getting beaten badly. I know you\u2019re embarrassed \u2014 I know you\u2019re embarrassed, but keep fighting \u2014 keep swinging, man (ph). Swing for the fences.Let me just tell you \u2014 let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a \u2014 it\u2019s a civil case. It\u2019s a case where people want to try and get \u2014 it\u2019s a case that is nonsense.It\u2019s something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don\u2019t want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed \u2014 most \u2014 many \u2014 many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.As \u2014 and believe me, I\u2019ll win that case. That\u2019s an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I\u2019m being audited. It\u2019s a very routine audit, and it\u2019s very unfair, because I\u2019ve been audited for, I think, over 12 years.Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I\u2019m being audited \u2014 which is a very large company.(BELL RINGS)BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: I\u2019m being audited 12 years in a row, at least.Now, until that audit\u2019s done, and I don\u2019t think anybody would blame me, I\u2019m not giving it...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ... the years you\u2019re not being audited? Will you release those years?BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.TRUMP: (inaudible) audited for those years.CRUZ: Which years? Which years are you being audited?BLITZER: Gentlemen...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: ... we actually have rules \u2014 we\u2019re trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed. We\u2019re going to take a quick break. We have a lot more \u2014 many more critically important issues to discuss.Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security. And Mr. Trump, I\u2019ll begin with you.TRUMP: Shocking.(LAUGHTER)BLITZER: You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians \u2014 I\u2019m quoting you now: \u201cLet me be sort of a neutral guy. I don\u2019t want to say whose fault it is, I don\u2019t think it helps.\u201dTRUMP: Right.BLITZER: Here\u2019s the question. How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East?TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think they do under President Obama because I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I\u2019ve received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.As president, however, there\u2019s nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It\u2019s probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn\u2019t help if I start saying, \u201cI am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.And I can\u2019t do that as well \u2014 as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I\u2019m taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.BLITZER: Senator Cruz?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald\u2019s word, between Israel and the Palestinians.Let me be clear. If I\u2019m president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.(APPLAUSE)And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent. When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.Just today, Iran announced they\u2019re going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald\u2019s answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this \u2014 if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I can only say \u2014 look, I can only say I\u2019ve been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I\u2019ve received many, many awards from Israel, as I\u2019ve said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I\u2019m going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.BLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.KASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I\u2019ve been a supporter of Israel \u2014 a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn\u2019t give as much money as Donald gave, but I\u2019ve been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one \u2014 are moving because they\u2019re not sure what we will do.It\u2019s a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.When we stand firm and we let the world know who we\u2019re with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: We\u2019re going to get to North Korea in a moment. But Senator Rubio, what\u2019s wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?RUBIO: Because \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if Donald realizes this. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not his intent perhaps. But the position you\u2019ve taken is an anti-Israel position. And here\u2019s why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here\u2019s what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here\u2019s what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going to sit here and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not on either side.\u201d I will be on a side. I will be on Israel\u2019s side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I\u2019m a negotiator. I\u2019ve done very well over the years through negotiation. It\u2019s very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I\u2019ll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s not going down \u2014 excuse me...RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?RUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.TRUMP: OK, no, no, no \u2014 a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you\u2019re dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?TRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it\u2019s not a real estate deal...TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...BLITZER: ... Senator.TRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.BLITZER: Let\u2019s move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.Let\u2019s be clear. Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?KASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That\u2019s what it means. Even though there\u2019s so much chaos in North Korea right now, there\u2019s a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.But, look, here\u2019s what I think we ought to do \u2014 like, immediately. And, we\u2019ve been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don\u2019t know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they\u2019re not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don\u2019t have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we\u2019re now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.But, when I say regime change, I don\u2019t have to talk exactly what that means. Look, I\u2019ve been involved in national security for a long time. You don\u2019t have to spell everything out, but what I\u2019m telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we\u2019re doing is beginning to work against them.They are the key to being able to settle this situation.BLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...KASICH: ... I\u2019m very well aware of that.BLITZER: A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?KASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I\u2019ll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we\u2019re going to face this sooner or later.But, in the meantime, I\u2019m also aware of the fact that there\u2019s 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don\u2019t just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we\u2019ve got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: One thing I\u2019d like to add to what the Governor\u2019s saying, I think that we are now in a position \u2014 are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it\u2019s going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.You order televisions, you order almost anything, you\u2019re getting it from these countries. Whether it\u2019s a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it\u2019s an air conditioning unit. They\u2019re coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they\u2019re making less, but they\u2019re making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day.(BELL RINGING)We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...BLITZER: Dr. Carson.KASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we\u2019re all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We\u2019re all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.(BELL RINGING)We can\u2019t have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...BLITZER: ... Thank you...KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don\u2019t get time. I\u2019m going to whine because I didn\u2019t get asked about taxes, I didn\u2019t get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you\u2019re going to be fair to everybody, you didn\u2019t ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.Now...BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the whole year. And they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the next year and the next year. They didn\u2019t find anything and they won\u2019t find anything because I\u2019m a very honest person.But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.(APPLAUSE)And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn\u2019t find a single one who didn\u2019t think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it\u2019s like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. We\u2019re going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?TRUMP: I really don\u2019t because it not working and the countries aren\u2019t agreeing to it and the rebels aren\u2019t agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It\u2019s a meaningless ceasefire.I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of \u2014 with a total cessation. But it\u2019s not working, as you know very well. It\u2019s not working. If \u2014 we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.HEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.CRUZ: Well look. We\u2019re certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there\u2019s reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama\u2019s weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as we\u2019re headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry \u2014 Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we\u2019re not in a strong position to win the general election.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.TRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...CRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.TRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that\u2019s concerned. You know it and so do I.CRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.TRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. TRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, he\u2019s saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.If these politicians went to the beach and didn\u2019t do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we\u2019d be \u2014 at least they killed terrorists, all right?And I\u2019m not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it\u2019s a total mess.We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn\u2019t topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?And I argued if it takes a long time, you\u2019re going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s where the term \u201clead from behind\u201d came. And that\u2019s the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn\u2019t appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.I couldn\u2019t imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we\u2019re asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he\u2019s saying these guys need to do more.South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And here\u2019s why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.They can do that very quickly. And that\u2019s what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can\u2019t walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.HEWITT: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...RUBIO: How much?TRUMP: A lot. I\u2019ll negotiate a lot more money than you\u2019ll ever get.As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it\u2019s a disaster for Israel. I\u2019m no fan of John Kerry.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.Senator Cruz.You can see and hear the exact words from Donald\u2019s mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry\u2019s foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That\u2019s why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.And I\u2019ll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?If you care about Israel, you don\u2019t write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: There\u2019s a critical point that needs to be made here.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has a right to respond.TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you\u2019re politicians, all talk, no action.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I\u2019ve been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.CRUZ: Then name one specific thing you\u2019ve done.TRUMP: What I\u2019ve seen up here \u2014 I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...RUBIO: This guy always goes for...TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He can\u2019t do it...RUBIO: This is so typical.TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he can\u2019t do it because he doesn\u2019t know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen.Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please? (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)KASICH: There\u2019s something \u2014 I want to \u2014 I want to point out something here today that is \u2014 it\u2019s so critically important \u2014 about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they\u2019re sitting in the catbird seat.We should have been helping them. I\u2019m thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.Now, let\u2019s talk about Libya. Libya didn\u2019t go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.And let me just say to you \u2014 we have ISIS beginning get \u2014 get a foothold in Libya. We\u2019re gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. They\u2019re on the coast, which \u2014 mostly, it\u2019s desert, but it\u2019s a problem.Then we have ISIS in \u2014 in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq. Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit \u2014 one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...BLITZER: All right...KASICH: ... and we\u2019re going to have to work our way out of it, including...BLITZER: Let\u2019s continue.KASICH: ... the need to arm the Ukrainians. They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...BLITZER: Let us continue.KASICH: ... and assert ourselves as America.BLITZER: Let\u2019s continue the questioning on ISIS. Maria.CRUZ: Hold on, Wolf. You said I got a response.BLITZER: You\u2019ll have a chance. Maria will pick up...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Hold on. He called me a liar. You\u2019re saying I can\u2019t respond to being called a liar?(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Go ahead and respond.CRUZ: You know, what we\u2019re seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington \u2014 the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.And so that\u2019s Donald\u2019s pattern over and over again. He said, for example, seven months ago \u2014 this is Donald speaking, quote \u2014 \u201cI, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment.\u201dThere\u2019s a reason Harry Reid thinks he\u2019s the best Republican up here. There\u2019s a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...(BELL RINGS)... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable. And every time anyone points at Donald\u2019s actual record...BLITZER: Thank you.CRUZ: ... what he said on national television, Donald yells \u201cliar.\u201d Let me tell you something \u2014 falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.CRUZ: ... and it\u2019s something Donald does daily.BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I watched \u2014 I watched...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race \u2014 he has left Iowa and he\u2019s out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful.And got a lot of votes because of that \u2014 a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it.I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, \u201cVoter Violation,\u201d and then it graded you...(BELL RINGS)... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in politics.(BELL RINGS)To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.BLITZER: Senator Cruz...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know politicians \u2014 I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it\u2019s not good.CRUZ: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you\u2019ve been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way...TRUMP: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... the reason is \u2014 you\u2019re welcome to have the check back.TRUMP: I funded this guy. I gave him a check.CRUZ: Yeah, you gave me $5,000.TRUMP: I gave him a check. He never funded me.CRUZ: And \u2014 and by the way, let\u2019s be clear.(APPLAUSE)Donald claims \u2014 Donald claims to care about...TRUMP: You know why? I didn\u2019t want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They\u2019re very confusing.TRUMP: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re doing a great job. I have his book.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Thank you \u2014 thank you for the book. Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.TRUMP: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.(APPLAUSE)Thank \u2014 thank you for the book. I really appreciate (ph).CRUZ: Donald \u2014 Donald, relax.TRUMP: Go ahead. I\u2019m relaxed. You\u2019re the basket case.(CROSSTALK)Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald...TRUMP: Go ahead. Don\u2019t get nervous.CRUZ: (inaudible)...TRUMP: Go ahead.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: I promise you, Donald, there\u2019s nothing about you...TRUMP: I\u2019ve seen you.CRUZ: ... that makes anyone nervous.TRUMP: You\u2019re losing so badly you \u2014 I want to...CRUZ: You know, people are actually watching this at home.TRUMP: ... I \u2014 you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen.CRUZ: Wolf, I\u2019m going to ask my time not be deducted when he\u2019s yelling at me.BLITZER: You\u2019ve gotta stop this.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: The latest debate \u2014 gentlemen, please.CRUZ: Hold on, I\u2019m going to get my answer. He doesn\u2019t get to yell the whole time. BLITZER: I want to move \u2014 I want to move on. These are the rules.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time. Am I allowed to...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Wolf, do I not get a response? Do I not get a response without being interrupted?BLITZER: You\u2019ll get \u2014 you\u2019ll get plenty of response, so stand by.CARSON: My name was mentioned.BLITZER: I want to talk \u2014 I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government \u2014 how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.BLITZER: There\u2019s a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government. The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers. And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge\u2019s order.Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.BASH: Senator Rubio, you say it\u2019s complicated, and that, quote, \u201cApple isn\u2019t necessarily wrong to refuse the court order.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t investigators have everything at their disposal?RUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing \u2014 the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago \u2014 the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, \u201cWe\u2019re being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.\u201d That is not accurate.The only thing they\u2019re being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that\u2019s in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.And I think they should comply with that. If that\u2019s all they\u2019re asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.BASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.RUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.BASH: But just to be clear \u2014 just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?RUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?BASH: Correct.RUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didn\u2019t even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer\u2019s employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all they\u2019re asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn\u2019t want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?CRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. He\u2019s now agreeing with me. And so I\u2019m glad.What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone\u2019s cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn\u2019t have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?CARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.(APPLAUSE)You know, we have the \u2014 we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And that\u2019s why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.So absolutely, I would \u2014 I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don\u2019t comply with that, you\u2019re encouraging chaos in our system.BASH: Mr. Trump...(APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where\u2019s the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don\u2019t litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you\u2019re the president? You lock the door and you say you\u2019re not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.And I\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time. Because as an executive, you\u2019ve got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.ARRASAS: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Thank you.ARRARAS: Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat. You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn\u2019t? Isn\u2019t that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?TRUMP: First of all, you\u2019re talking about a border that\u2019s many, many times longer. You\u2019re talking about a massive border.We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts \u2014 you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn\u2019t think this beautiful place \u2014 it\u2019s beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it\u2019s such a shame to see it.They\u2019re pouring in from the Southern border, so I\u2019m talking about great security. I\u2019m talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I\u2019ll build it on time, on budget. It\u2019ll be a very high wall, a great wall. It\u2019s going to be built, it\u2019s going to be built. It\u2019s going to be paid for by Canada, by the way \u2014 maybe I\u2019ll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.The problem with Canada, you\u2019re talking about a massively long piece. You\u2019re talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we \u2014 it is not our biggest problem. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it\u2019s the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRARAS: I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto Rico\u2019s in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it\u2019s debt of $72 billion dollars. Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that \u2014 the tools to restructure the debt. That is the same debt the other 50 states have.You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection. You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it\u2019s last resort. That that\u2019s where they are now. How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?RUBIO: Sure, because bankruptcy doesn\u2019t work unless you change the way you\u2019re operating, or you\u2019re going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it\u2019s economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.They\u2019re coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it\u2019s too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.This year alone, with all the problems they\u2019re having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they\u2019ve made to future generations to make payments.So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they\u2019re asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you\u2019re going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.They\u2019re United States citizens, they\u2019re obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...BLITZER: ... Senator, thank you very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston. It\u2019s time now for closing statements. All of you will have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, we\u2019ll start with you.CARSON: Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And I\u2019m asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when?(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I\u2019ve done it in Washington, I\u2019ve done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we won\u2019t have to spend time figuring what we\u2019re going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Well, thank you for having us tonight. You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it\u2019s narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.RUBIO: The time for games is over.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.If I\u2019m elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. I will rip to shreds the Iranian \u2014 catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They\u2019re all talk, they\u2019re no action, nothing gets done. I\u2019ve watched it for years. Take a look at what\u2019s happening to our country.All of the things that I\u2019ve been talking about, whether it\u2019s trade, whether it\u2019s building up our depleted military, whether it\u2019s taking care of our vets, whether it\u2019s getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo. We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.Super Tuesday is only five days away.Right now Anderson Cooper picks up our special coverage \u2014 Anderson.COOPER: Wolf, thanks very much.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Sends Sweeping Trade Enforcement Bill to Obama", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate gave overwhelming final approval Thursday to the most comprehensive overhaul of customs law in decades, giving presidents new tools to combat unfair trade, yet falling short of bipartisan demands for penalties against other nations that manipulate their currencies.Senators voted 75 to 20 for the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, a blend of bills the House and Senate passed separately nearly a year ago. The bipartisan compromise was reached by negotiators in December, with White House support, and was quickly approved by the House. Senate action stalled partly because of an unrelated dispute over taxing Internet sales.The White House, in a statement, hailed the bill\u2019s passage as \u201can important milestone in our overall trade agenda,\u201d and said President Obama would sign it into law \u201cto help strengthen enforcement of the rules and level the playing field for American workers and businesses.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that is responsible for trade issues, called the package \u201ca major step forward in advancing a robust agenda for international trade that better reflects the realities of the 21st-century global economy.\u201dThe trade enforcement package took shape last year as a way to persuade trade skeptics in Congress to support a separate measure renewing presidents\u2019 bolstered authority to make trade deals. The idea was to assure legislators that the federal government would have enhanced powers to act against trade violations once Mr. Obama completed negotiations on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership accord.Congress did narrowly approve so-called trade-promotion authority for Mr. Obama and his successor, but the enforcement package is not expected to similarly improve Mr. Obama\u2019s low odds of winning congressional approval this year of the Pacific agreement, which was concluded in October.In the main, the trade measure defines a new process for the Customs and Border Protection service to act quickly against foreign businesses that evade anti-dumping laws and American duties on imports, or that traffic in counterfeit goods. It also addresses a loophole that allows some imports made with forced or child labor to get through customs, and includes new protections for businesses\u2019 intellectual property rights.Among the strongest supporters were the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation; both served notice to lawmakers that this would be among the \u201ckey votes\u201d when they assess whom to support at election time.But labor unions, led by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., were adamantly opposed. Labor had supported last year\u2019s Senate version of the trade bill, which mandated import duties against countries found to manipulate their currencies to make their exports cheaper to American consumers.That penalty was dropped, however, from the final bill, and House Republicans won other concessions that infuriated unions. The new language, proposed by Mr. Hatch and two Democrats \u2013 Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware \u2013 calls for the president to seek \u201cenhanced bilateral engagement\u201d with suspected manipulators, and to keep violators out of trade pacts with the United States.Critics dismissed the language as toothless. China and Japan are considered the worst offenders at manipulating currency.Most of the 20 senators who opposed the trade bill were Democrats, though more than half of Democrats \u2013 led by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee \u2013 strongly backed the final compromise.Unions, joined by senators from both parties, also objected to a provision unrelated to trade. It would prohibit state and local governments from taxing Internet access. That, the critics said, would close off a revenue source to those governments as they seek funds for public services.But Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and others got a promise from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to allow a vote this year on a bill allowing states to tax sales of retailers that sell only online.

Mrs. Clinton still enjoys a substantial advantage over Mr. Sanders among African-Americans in polls, but her campaign is plainly concerned about his making inroads with such voters. Her campaign has conducted focus groups of African-American voters, an aide said, which revealed that many of them associate attacks on the health law as no different from attacks on Mr. Obama himself.Mr. Sanders voted for the legislation, but has called for going further and enacting universal, government-run health care for all Americans.\u201cClearly, after Iowa and New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign is getting very nervous and is becoming increasingly negative and desperate,\u201d said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders. \u201cThe simple truth is that there are very few in Congress who have a stronger civil rights record than Senator Sanders.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategy appears to be to wage a multipronged set of attacks on Mr. Sanders as the battle moves to South Carolina and the rest of the South.Provoking old memories of politicians bearing false hope, she suggested that Mr. Sanders was setting voters up for a letdown with his ambitious proposals. \u201cI want you to understand: I will not promise you something that I cannot deliver,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not make promises I know I cannot keep.

Donald J. Trump did well among first-time caucusgoers and those who want the next president to be from outside the political establishment. Senator Marco Rubio found support among voters who said the economy was the most important issue and those who thought it was most important to have a candidate who could win in November.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton prevailed among women, older voters, political moderates and caucusgoers who prioritized having a candidate who can win in November.Senator Bernie Sanders won the overwhelming support of younger voters, first-time caucusgoers and those who said what mattered most was having a candidate who is honest and trustworthy.Those were among the more striking findings from polls of voters entering the caucuses across Iowa on Monday.After months of campaigning, fierce debates and a blizzard of television commercials, the polls, conducted by Edison Research, showed how voters split among the presidential hopefuls when it finally came time to make a decision.On the Republican side, 4 in 10 caucusgoers described themselves as very conservative, and they supported Mr. Cruz over Mr. Trump by a more than two-to-one ratio. Nearly two-thirds described themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians, and they favored Mr. Cruz as well.Surveys of Republican voters entering the caucuses in locations throughout Iowa on Monday evening.A plurality of Republican caucus voters, about 4 in 10, said a candidate sharing their values was the quality that mattered most in deciding whom to support. Of those voters, the breakdown was stark: 38 percent sided with Mr. Cruz, 21 percent supported Mr. Rubio and only 5 percent went with Mr. Trump.Alternatively, for the 14 percent of voters who said it mattered to have a candidate who \u201ctells it like it is,\u201d two-thirds of them sided with Mr. Trump.A billionaire real estate mogul, Mr. Trump satisfied the thirst of many voters for an outsider candidate. About half of voters said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment, and of those voters, nearly half supported Mr. Trump.Just over 1 in 10 voters named immigration as their most important issue, but Mr. Trump did well with those voters.Mr. Rubio saw strength among college graduates, who favored him over the other candidates. About 1 in 5 voters said a candidate\u2019s ability to win in November was the quality that mattered most, and they backed Mr. Rubio, who has emphasized his electability in November.More than one-third of Republican caucusgoers said they decided whom to support more than a month ago, and they heavily backed Mr. Trump. The same number made up their minds in the last few days, and they broke for Mr. Rubio.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton, who served as secretary of state in President Obama\u2019s administration, has presented herself as the best person to build on his agenda. The majority of Democratic caucus voters said the next president should generally continue President Obama\u2019s policies, rather than change to more or less liberal policies.Those voters who want to continue Mr. Obama\u2019s policies favor Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders by a large margin.Mr. Sanders, for his part, received strong support from first-time caucusgoers, who accounted for more than 4 in 10 voters.But first-time caucus voters made up a smaller share of the Democratic electorate than they did in 2008, when Mr. Obama, then a senator from Illinois, claimed victory, and Mrs. Clinton finished third. That year, 57 percent of Democratic caucusgoers were first-timers.Mr. Sanders was backed by very liberal voters, and he was also widely supported by younger voters. But voters age 65 and older accounted for nearly 3 in 10 Democratic caucusgoers on Monday, up from 22 percent in 2008.Democratic caucusgoers split on the issue they think is the most important facing the country. Three in 10 said health care, while one-third said the economy. Both of these groups went for Mrs. Clinton. Just over one in four voters viewed income inequality as the most important issue facing the country. They went strongly for Mr. Sanders, whose campaign has revolved in large part around that issue.Nearly 3 in 10 voters said the quality that mattered most to them was having a candidate with the right experience, and they favored Mrs. Clinton by an enormous margin: Nearly 9 in 10 sided with her.Two in 10 voters said it was most important that the candidate can win in November, and more than three-quarters sided with Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders fared best on honesty and trustworthiness. For voters to whom that mattered more than other qualities, Mr. Sanders won the support of more than 8 in 10, while Mrs. Clinton was backed by only 1 in 10.And for voters who said that caring about people like them was the quality that mattered most, about three-quarters sided with Mr. Sanders.Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Airlines to Offer Cheaper Flights, but Are They Worth the Savings?", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayRock-bottom fares once unique to low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier may, in the coming months, be offered by all three of the nation\u2019s legacy airlines, American, United and Delta.Great news for you and your wallet, right? The answer isn\u2019t so clear-cut.Delta was the first to take the plunge, introducing \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares on routes where it wanted to compete with discount carriers. Basic economy tickets do not include advance seat assignments. They cannot be changed or refunded (after a one-day grace period). And there are no free upgrades for anyone \u2014 even travelers with elite status, or travelers willing to pay to upgrade to business class or simply a preferred seat in coach.Think you know all the tricks for getting the lowest airfare and the most out of your miles programs? Test your knowledge, based on Stephanie Rosenbloom\u2019s weekly Getaway column.Another member pointed out that many business travelers work for companies whose policies require them to book the cheapest fare, which would mean they would have to fly with no perks and less flexibility. \u201cA lot of business travelers are going to be hurt by this,\u201d the user said. (Other members hypothesized that they would be able to avoid the fares because their company policy is to take the \u201clowest logical fare\u201d \u2014 and that such stripped-down fares are not logical for business travel.)For the most cost-conscious travelers, no-frills fares allow them to afford certain trips that they might not otherwise have been able to take. And, of course, no-frills fares are good for the airlines. \u201cThe more we segment our fares,\u201d Jim Compton, vice chairman and chief revenue officer for United Airlines, told investors during the most recent earnings call, \u201cthe better opportunity we will have to minimize revenue dilution.\u201dIt\u2019s too early to know how these no-frills fares will affect different types of travelers (I\u2019ll revisit that later this year). But the big domestic airlines are in the habit of copying one another, which suggests that Delta\u2019s basic economy fares are the best indicator of what\u2019s to come.\u201cWe realize that Basic Economy fares aren\u2019t for everyone,\u201d Delta explains on its news site, \u201cincluding families traveling with children.\u201dThat\u2019s in part because the fares don\u2019t allow travelers to choose a seat in advance, so a mother could end up sitting in a different row than her children. (The airline makes it clear on its website what basic economy does and does not include.)For travelers who frequently need to change their tickets, such fares are problematic because voluntary changes are not allowed.For elites, the restrictions already implemented by Delta on such seats seems to send a message: We value your loyalty\u2014 sometimes.For the occasional leisure traveler, how helpful the new fares will be remains to be seen. But let\u2019s say that at some point you spot one of these rock-bottom fares on a big domestic carrier and it\u2019s on par with a fare from, say, Spirit. Which carrier do you choose?\u201cFrankly, I\u2019d rather pay the extra few bucks and be assured of a seat assignment I liked,\u201d he wrote.If looking at the fare rules and flight times doesn\u2019t bring you any closer to a decision, and all things are still equal, consider the planes and the perks. Spirit, for example, has seats that don\u2019t recline. There\u2019s no Wi-Fi. Or video. A Delta basic economy fare is on a plane with seats that recline. Wi-Fi is available. You get in-flight entertainment. And a snack. So in that case, if the fares are about the same and you\u2019re not trying to accrue miles, Delta would be a smart choice because you would have a more comfortable flight.There is also the bigger picture to consider. Will economy seats with no benefits become the industry norm? Delta is already expanding its basic economy fares to routes where it does not compete with Spirit or other low-cost carriers. Will such fares further dilute frequent-flier programs by barring elites from upgrades? Will the big domestic airlines squeeze their smaller competitors, endangering their health and, in turn, healthy competition? We\u2019ll learn more before the year is out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Super Bowl Ad That Set Off Economic Alarm Bells", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byLoan on a PhoneTo people with fresh memories of the housing collapse, the most disturbing advertisement during the Super Bowl on Sunday wasn\u2019t the one featuring a creepy \u201cPuppyMonkeyBaby\u201d climbing all over a Mountain Dew drinker. Rather, it was the one for the new Quicken Loans \u201cRocket Mortgage,\u201d which aims to make it easier to get a mortgage using a mobile device.The ad raises profound, and problematic, questions of what the United States\u2019 growth strategy should look like, even if the intent was only to get people to use a mortgage app. In short: We now know how flawed the mid-2000s growth strategy, built on soaring consumer debt, really was. But we haven\u2019t found any great ideas for how to replace it.The Quicken Loans ad argued that more people getting mortgages more easily \u2014 with the push of a button on a phone while sitting at a show, for example \u2014 would set off a chain reaction leading to purchases of furniture and household goods and then more jobs for people who make those goods. A \u201ctidal wave of ownership floods the country with new homeowners who now must own other things,\u201d the narrator said. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t that the power of America itself?\u201dQuicken Loans\u2019s defense of the commercial is strongest on this point: Its product is about making the process of applying for a loan easier, not about lowering the standards for who can get a loan and on what terms. \u201cIt\u2019s a far different world today than in 2006 or 2007,\u201d said Jay Farner, president of Quicken Loans, in an interview Monday.The wave of foreclosures starting in 2007 that dragged the economy into recession and triggered a global financial crisis was driven in large part by a collapse in underwriting standards. Lenders offered mortgages to people with wildly inadequate incomes or down payments or documentation. Lending standards are much tighter now, and the new mobile app does nothing to change that.\u201cFor folks that were well qualified but weren\u2019t moving forward with a purchase or a refinance, we asked why,\u201d Mr. Farner said. \u201cThe ad that was created speaks to the information we received from them.\u201dThe company\u2019s solution \u2014 especially as it is portrayed in the commercial \u2014 does have problems. The commercial portrays taking out a home loan using the app as being almost a casual thing to do.Reducing paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles to a mortgage are desirable in isolation; the homebuying process is laden with hidden fees and conflicts of interest that can add thousands of dollars to the price of a home purchase.But the Quicken Loans ad goes a step further, with the narrator asking what would happen if the Internet \u201cdid for mortgages what the Internet did for buying music, plane tickets and shoes,\u201d then showing a woman getting a home mortgage with the press of a button on her phone.If taken too literally, this could get people in trouble. A home mortgage is the biggest financial obligation most people will take on. If you buy the wrong music, plane ticket or shoes, it\u2019s probably not a crippling financial burden, where the wrong mortgage can be.So to the degree Quicken Loans is getting rid of some unnecessary paperwork in the mortgage process, it\u2019s useful innovation. To the degree that it is enabling people to enter a major financial obligation without thinking it through properly, it could be dangerous. It\u2019s a subtle distinction, but an important one, and the ad isn\u2019t terribly careful about making clear the product is about the former, not the latter.Then there\u2019s the broader theory of the economy embedded in the Quicken Loans ad: that easier-to-obtain mortgage loans will spur new spending, which in turn will spur more people to get houses and so on in a virtuous circle.As an economic strategy, it should sound familiar. It is what the United States experienced from the 1980s through 2007, and arguably throughout the entire post-War period. And it\u2019s a real thing!The homeownership rate has plummeted since hitting a high in 2004, and if it rose, there would surely be knock-on effects for sales of other goods, such as the sectional couches with hand-lathed wooden legs portrayed in the Quicken Loans ad.The problem is, this strategy worked best \u2014 and the homeownershp rate reached its highest point \u2014 when it was all fueled by a boom in consumer indebtedness that left millions of people financially vulnerable when the economy went south in 2008.It\u2019s possible for an economy to be driven by a rise in homeownership and consumer spending without a debt run-up. That\u2019s more or less what happened from the end of World War II until 1980 or so. Household formation \u2014 the process by which people set up their homes, often as they become young adults and move away from home \u2014 really has been depressed since the housing bust. The economy would benefit if that reverses.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to say that done the right way, homebuying can be beneficial,\u201d Mr. Farner said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to tell people they should go run up debt, but good responsible homeowners do make investments in furniture, and that creates jobs and opportunity for all.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with any of that. Responsible use of debt can be an important way for people to build a stable future. But given how badly it ended last time, anyone who lived through the housing bust can be forgiven for being worried when an advertisement for a mortgage app puts borrowed money at the center of an economic strategy and says that\u2019s \u201cthe power of America itself.\u201dAdvertisement"}

More than a few of them are in New York for the first time.One of the winning designers, Anton Belinskiy, from Kiev, Ukraine, launched his line in 2009 and was a semifinalist for the LVMH Prize in 2015. The collection he\u2019s showing is called \u201cUtopia\u201d and includes playful, surreal pieces like an oversized, canary-yellow parka with a mini-parka-shaped hood. \u201cThink about what happened to the Ukraine this year,\u201d Quay says. \u201cThere were tanks and war, but the most positive fashion vibe is coming out of Russia and the Ukraine.\u201dQuay says that what made these designers stand out was the quality of their execution \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s as good as anything you see at Barneys\u201d \u2014 and a perspective that is entirely their own. \u201cAll of these designers have a brand vision and brand culture that\u2019s theirs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s innovative and positive and very forward-thinking and not at all reflective of what you see on a mainstream runway. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re looking to a mainstream runway for a direction or inspiration, they\u2019re getting it from their own life and their own culture.\u201dVfiles has been working to support that culture since it launched in 2012. Now a multi-dimensional platform that includes a retail space, showroom and digital community, it has also served as an incubator for emerging talent. Virgil Abloh\u2019s first brand, Pyrex, was carried by Vfiles; now he\u2019s mentoring the next generation of young designers. \u201cI look at it as a social responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to fashion school \u2014 I design from a cultural point of view, and I don\u2019t really credit people who don\u2019t relate to where they came from.

Gets Ready to Unlock the Cable Box", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialEvery year, American cable-TV subscribers spend $231 on average to rent cable boxes that they should be able to buy outright, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars over several years. Consumers could soon have that option under an excellent proposal by the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.Mr. Wheeler wants the cable businesses like Comcast and Time Warner Cable and technology companies like Google and Amazon to jointly develop technical standards for cable devices. That would allow consumers to watch cable television on any device that meets those standards. Some manufacturers could build televisions that already incorporate a cable box. Or companies like Apple could refine software that will let people watch all cable TV on their phones and computers. Much of the technology needed to do this exists, and companies like Comcast and HBO are already using it to make some TV shows and movies available online.Regardless of what device people use, it would have to comply with the privacy and copyright protections that apply currently to cable boxes. This approach should make it easier for consumers to choose how they watch television, provided that the telecom and technology companies, which have had a testy relationship, can work together.Not surprisingly, the telecommunications industry is opposing Mr. Wheeler, arguing that his proposal amounts to needless government meddling that will stifle innovation. These are self-serving arguments by an industry that is, understandably, afraid of losing billions in revenue. It is important to remember that Mr. Wheeler\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t require consumers to make any changes. Anybody who is happy renting a cable box, can keep doing so.If the industry had its way, we would still be renting phones from the old Ma Bell. Allowing consumers to buy their own phones was one of the first steps the F.C.C. took in promoting new telecommunications technologies. Requiring cable-TV systems to make room for competing devices should similarly lead to a boom in new types of services and technologies.A new proposal from the F.C.C. would make easier for consumers to choose how they watch television.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Online Tools Offer Path to Lower Drug Prices", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byAmericans have come to rely on their smartphones to help them do seemingly everything, like hailing a taxi and comparing prices of dog food.But when it comes to buying prescription drugs, consumers still find the process maddeningly antiquated.Now, a few entrepreneurs say they are aiming to fundamentally change the way people buy drugs, bringing the industry into the digital age by disclosing the lowest prices for generic prescriptions to allow comparison-shopping.Most major pharmacies do not list the price of the drugs they sell. And even if they do, prices for the same drug can vary strikingly and cost far more than the rate that most insurers pay. Consumers often don\u2019t know how much they will owe until the pharmacist tallies the purchase at the cash register.\u201cThis is the first time the consumer knows what the price of the item is before they get to the register,\u201d said Geoffrey Chaiken, one of Blink Health\u2019s founders. \u201cWe cracked the code.\u201dGoodRx and Blink Health often quote prices for generic drugs that are far lower than the prices that pharmacies typically charge customers paying out of pocket instead of through insurance. Instead, the sites and their apps are offering customers prices that are closer to the rate that is typically available \u2014 or even visible \u2014 only to insurers.Ten of the country\u2019s 15 most commonly prescribed drugs, for example, cost less than $10 on Blink Health, including generic versions of drugs like Lipitor, which manages cholesterol, and the diabetes drug metformin.The sites cannot help much with brand-name drugs, which are made by a single manufacturer and carry prices that can be as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars. The purchases also often do not count toward a consumer\u2019s insurance deductible, which could be a problem for seriously ill patients with high medical costs.Several health care experts and consumer advocates said the prescription drug market desperately needed more transparency, which they hoped would lead to lower costs. While more Americans are gaining coverage through the new health insurance law, a number of plans are demanding that consumers pay for more of their own drug costs, either through higher co-payments or deductibles, which can add up to thousands of dollars a year.In addition, many uninsured consumers do not know that the price pharmacies charge them is far higher than the rate that insurers pay the pharmacies for the same drug, health care experts said. And even insured customers are not always getting the best deal. Many people have insurance plans that require them to pay a flat rate of $10 or higher for generic drugs, even though the rate the insurers pay the pharmacy is often less.\u201cPeople should be rioting,\u201d Mr. Chaiken said, \u201cbut it\u2019s just that health care is too complicated.\u201dHe said 10,000 consumers had used the service since the site opened five weeks ago, even though the company has barely promoted itself. He said he hoped to have millions of customers by the end of the year, which he said would further lower prices using economies of scale.GoodRx and Blink Health get their prices by using the networks of pharmacy-benefit managers, which manage drug plans for insurers and large employers. GoodRx works with several benefit managers, while Blink Health has entered into an agreement with MedImpact. Blink Health also relies on MedImpact\u2019s network of more than 60,000 pharmacies.Express Scripts, the nation\u2019s largest drug-benefits manager that also owns one of the biggest pharmacies, acknowledged that some consumers could save money by buying low-cost generics through sites like GoodRx or Blink Health. But Express Scripts said a typical member would save more money by going through insurance. Express Scripts also said that it monitored patients\u2019 prescriptions to ensure that they were not taking drugs that could lead to dangerous interactions.\u201cNo single retail pharmacy or doctor has the same line of sight to the patient\u2019s entire medication history,\u201d Express Scripts said in a statement.Still, Blink Health said many of its customers saved hundreds of dollars a year, pointing to Wendy Comerford, a business owner in Florida, and others.

{"Headline": "Next Supreme Court Justice Will Be Crucial to Climate Change", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneThe United States sure knows how to throw cold water on international harmony.Just two months have passed since the world\u2019s top diplomats cobbled together the best plan we\u2019ve ever had to start curbing emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Yet already the Supreme Court of the United States said no, delaying much of the Obama administration\u2019s strategy to deliver America\u2019s contribution to the collective effort.And yet the Supreme Court\u2019s temporary stay of the administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2014 the last decision of global consequence of the right-leaning court on which Justice Antonin Scalia had sat since the Reagan administration \u2014 underscores just how far the United States remains from its climate goals.Consider the administration\u2019s own assessments. Even as the American delegation in Paris offered to cut emissions to 26 to 28 percent below their 2005 levels by 2025, the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy was offering a different outlook.Its reference case, based on federal policies on the books at the end of 2014, forecast that emissions of carbon dioxide from energy use (the United States\u2019 main source of greenhouse gases) would not decline but remain flat through 2025 and beyond.Answers to questions about the court\u2019s decision to temporarily block the Obama administration\u2019s effort to regulate emissions from coal-fired power plants.What\u2019s more, the carbon storage of American forests, which offset as much as 13 percent of the nation\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2013, could start declining as early as 2020.Still, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last week to delay the plan \u2014 until the United States Court of Appeals in Washington decides on the merits of a challenge by 27 mostly Republican-governed states \u2014 underscores just how politically vulnerable the United States\u2019 promises truly are.Because for all the administration\u2019s claims that it can deliver on its commitments regardless, the fact remains that even under the most optimistic outlook \u2014 if the Supreme Court\u2019s stay were to melt away and the Power Plan were to work impeccably \u2014 current policies do not get us there.Using different assumptions \u2014 say, if the economy grew faster or energy technology didn\u2019t progress as fast \u2014 it would remain even further behind. Assuming all the administration\u2019s current and proposed policies were carried out, the analysis suggests that by 2025 American greenhouse gas emissions would be, at best, 23 percent lower than in 2005. In the worst case they would be only 10 percent lower.That suggests we should hurry. \u201cWhile the U.S. still has nearly a decade to put additional policy in place,\u201d the report notes, \u201cit will need to do so relatively quickly for the impact to be felt by the time the 2025 pledge comes due.\u201dThe pledges offered in Paris are not a magic number. They are important nonetheless. Stiff cuts by the United States, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter, after China, were crucial to holding the international coalition together. These cuts are supposed to be just the beginning of a process of increasingly stringent emissions limits.How will the United States get there, then? The Rhodium Group\u2019s analysis proposes stricter limits for transportation and for electric power generation, which would remain the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country over the next decade even if the Clean Power Plan were put in place.One idea would be further tightening the fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. The report suggests looking at emissions by the industrial sector \u2014 the third-largest emitter \u2014 which under current policies are expected to increase by 18 percent by 2025. Land use policies to enhance the forest carbon sink and tighter rules to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas could also help.But these proposals just underscore how the American problem is first and foremost political. It is critical, the report concludes, \u201cthat policy makers now engage in a broad exploration and frank discussion of what additional steps can help deliver on America\u2019s climate goals.\u201d It will be difficult to hold this discussion when Congress is run by a party that rejects climate science.We have known about these obstacles for some time. The Obama administration\u2019s plan to repurpose the Clean Air Act rather than propose new legislation to combat climate change acknowledged that the courts offered a better shot than Congress.And in that regard, the news is not entirely bad. If the Senate were to confirm whomever President Obama nominates to succeed Justice Scalia, one of the most conservative justices on the bench, the Supreme Court would probably become more sensitive to the imperative to combat climate change. That\u2019s not just good news for the Clean Power Plan. It could open the door to more aggressive policies.\u201cE.P.A. and the states could use the provision to establish an economywide, market-based approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cSuch a program could provide one of the most effective and efficient means to address climate change pollution in the United States.\u201dLast week, this kind of thinking would have been unlikely to survive a spin through the Supreme Court. But perhaps it could survive a different one \u2014 maybe one that placed more weight on international harmony.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "With Shares Plunging, Deutsche Bank Sets Out to Prove It Can Be Fixed", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byAfter John Cryan took the helm of Deutsche Bank in July, he set out to quickly clean up the mess left by his predecessors. The bank has taken earnings-crushing charges, slashed costs and pulled out of countries that it has been in for decades.Mr. Cryan, a cerebral British banker, is even getting down into the minutia. He is personally helping to decide which complex derivatives trades to close as he tries to free up scarce financial resources for better investments.But in recent weeks, the markets have wondered whether Deutsche waited too long to mend itself.Shares in the bank, Germany\u2019s largest, have plunged nearly 40 percent so far this year. The market now effectively values Deutsche at a third of its liquidation value, an astonishing discount that suggests investors do not believe that Mr. Cryan will be able to squeeze solid earnings out of the bank\u2019s businesses. Investors in credit markets have even begun to bet that some of Deutsche Bank\u2019s bonds will not be repaid in full.The disfavor in the markets may pass, especially if central banks around the world signal that they are willing to do more to support economic growth and the global financial system. Mr. Cryan and his new management team may also soon be able to show that they are making progress with their turnaround plan, perhaps by settling some of the many lawsuits that Deutsche Bank faces.Deutsche Bank is also not as fragile as the banks that crashed or required bailouts in 2008 \u2014 a message Mr. Cryan was eager to get out this week. \u201cClients may ask you about how the marketwide volatility is impacting Deutsche Bank,\u201d Mr. Cryan said on Tuesday in a memo to employees. \u201cYou can tell them that Deutsche Bank remains absolutely rock-solid, given our strong capital and risk position.\u201dStill, Deutsche Bank is trying to fix itself at what looks like an increasingly inauspicious time.Doubts are swirling over many of Europe\u2019s large banks, which took longer than their United States peers to bolster their balance sheets after the financial crisis. European banks with large trading operations, like Credit Suisse and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, have also come into investors\u2019 cross hairs this week. The sharp declines in the shares of European banks are an indication that the region is still grappling with the threat that large banks can pose to the wider economy when they run into trouble.Regarded in Germany as a national asset and a symbol of economic might, Deutsche Bank sits at the center of the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d debate. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, even spoke out in support of the bank, saying on Tuesday, \u201cNo, I have no concerns about Deutsche Bank.\u201dWhen he became co-chief executive, Mr. Cryan seemed well qualified for the tasks ahead. (Mr. Cryan will drop the \u201cco-\u201d from his title in May when the other co-chief, J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, is set to retire.) He had, after all, been involved in a far-reaching overhaul at UBS, a Swiss bank that got into deep trouble during the financial crisis. Mr. Cryan even seemed to relish the challenge.\u201cSometimes I go home in the evening and I say to my wife, \u2018I wish some people would actually think I had some talent for running a company and not just cleaning it up,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Cryan said, at a news conference in Frankfurt last month. \u201cIt should be fun running a company like this.\u201dBut Mr. Cryan finds himself battling on three fronts. The bank has to simultaneously shore up its balance sheet, produce dependable profits and satisfy the demands of frustrated regulators, particularly those in the United States.Deutsche Bank has less capital, the financial foundation of a bank, than many of its peers, which can mean investors view it more warily when markets tumble. Deutsche Bank\u2019s leverage ratio, a regulatory metric that measures capital as a percentage of assets, was 3.5 percent at the end of 2015, well below the 6.5 percent that JPMorgan Chase reports.Deutsche Bank can raise its capital levels by off-loading subpar loans and trades or selling new shares. But both remedies are hard to pull off when there is bone-shaking turbulence in global markets.\u201cDeutsche is fixable,\u201d said James Chappell, a senior financials analyst at Berenberg in London. \u201cConsidering the current state of credit markets, it\u2019s much harder to achieve \u2014 and that\u2019s the key question really.\u201dBut even with higher capital, Deutsche Bank has to show where its profits are going to come from in the future.Some of the European banks that have slashed the size of their trading operations have been able to fall back on other businesses that have performed relatively well. Credit Suisse and UBS, for instance, have large wealth management divisions that can produce stable profits. Analysts say that Deutsche Bank lacks a large alternative source of profit that could take up much of the slack if Mr. Cryan took an ax to the trading operations, which accounted for nearly a third of the bank\u2019s revenue last year.While Deutsche Bank has 1,800 branches in Germany, the retail network has never been very profitable and lost 675 million euros in the last quarter of 2015. In Germany, private banks have trouble competing profitably with savings banks, which are typically controlled by local governments content with meager earnings.Much of Deutsche Bank\u2019s fate depends on how it fares in the United States, where regulators have long been dissatisfied with the bank\u2019s operations.One United States Deutsche unit, a trust bank, last year failed a regulatory stress test carried out by the Federal Reserve. The failure was expected, and another overseas bank also fell short.An even bigger test looms. In 2018, all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s United States operations, including its big investment bank, are to start undergoing regular Fed stress tests.The bank is now preparing to put its American operations into one holding company that will be subjected to the test. Deutsche Bank has been hiring heavily to get ready for the stress tests, said Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman.Then there are Deutsche Bank\u2019s legal costs, which have concerned investors for many months and have served to remind the public of the bank\u2019s missteps.In some litigation, Deutsche Bank is accused of acts that took place several years ago, including selling shoddy mortgages before the financial crisis. But other investigations are focused on more recent activities, including one that looks at stock trades that took place in Moscow and London.Deutsche Bank has settled a handful of lawsuits, like one in the United States last year that accused the bank of violating sanctions, and it has set aside over $6 billion for future legal payouts. In his memo on Tuesday, Mr. Cryan sought to underscore his role in clearing the litigation cloud hovering over Deutsche Bank.\u201cI am personally investing time to resolve successfully and speedily open regulatory and legal cases,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want to remove the uncertainty among staff and in the market that these cases cause. A small group of senior people, led by me, will focus on this.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Overdraft Practices Continue to Gut Bank Accounts and Haunt Customers", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byAngelina Lemus was puzzled. She had no idea why every month as much as $96 was disappearing from her Citibank checking account.Months later, Ms. Lemus finally figured out the mystery \u2014 or at least part of it. Citibank was taking out the money to pay a loan, with an interest rate of 18 percent, that was devised to cover the shortfall every time Ms. Lemus overdrew her checking account.The problem was that Ms. Lemus, a home health care worker from Queens, said she never signed up for the line of credit and was unaware that she was borrowing from it every time her account dipped below zero.In all, Ms. Lemus had amassed $3,400 in debt \u2014 a tangle of interest, principal and other fees that have damaged her credit.Ms. Lemus is one of millions of Americans tripped up by overdraft practices, a murky corner of consumer banking that, despite a lot of hand-wringing in Washington, costly litigation and customer rancor, remains largely untouched by financial regulation.In a push for transparency since the 2008 financial crisis, regulators require banks to clearly disclose and explain the terms of just about every financial product, including credit cards and mortgages. But overdraft practices still come with hidden costs and confusing terms, bank customers, lawyers and consumer advocates say.Citibank declined to comment on Ms. Lemus\u2019s situation. In a statement on its practices, a bank spokesman said, \u201cCustomers who choose overdraft lines of credit must enroll, and any line of credit balance appears on every monthly statement.\u201d Over all, the spokesman said, \u201cCitibank customers pay in fees a small fraction of what customers of other big banks pay.\u201dTypically, banks charge customers $35 every time they spend more than the balance in their checking account. Those fees add up, haunting borrowers and cannibalizing already low bank balances. One mistake can push checking accounts into the red, generating multiple fees in a single day.But other, sometimes harmful practices are proliferating, too, like lines of credit that banks pitch as an alternative way to cover shortfalls in checking accounts but that can end up ensnaring customers like Ms. Lemus in a cycle of debt.\u201cIt is such an insidious thing,\u201d said Susan Shin, legal director of the New Economy Project, which works with community groups in New York.The lawsuits resulted in the banks paying more than $1.1 billion in settlements. Among them was TD Bank, which agreed to pay $62 million.Today, TD Bank is still reordering transactions and informs customers about the practice in the fine print of its checking account agreements.\u201cTheir position is \u2018If we disclose it, we can get away with whatever the hell we want,\u2019 \u201d said Mark Mangan, a TD Bank customer from Bloomfield, N.J., who has been hit with as much as $140 in overdraft fees in a single day.When asked about its reordering of customer transactions, TD Bank said in statement that it planned to end the practice as soon as April.\u201cWe know our customers have come to expect a certain level of convenience and an unparalleled experience from us, and meeting that expectation drives this decision,\u2019\u2019 said Judith Schmidt, a TD Bank spokeswoman. She declined to comment on Mr. Mangan\u2019s experience.Such small fees can amount to big profits for the banks. More than 11 percent of TD Bank\u2019s total operating income came from overdraft fees and other consumer service fees during the first nine months of last year. That is roughly five times the industry average, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data compiled by SNL Financial, a research firm.The TD Bank spokeswoman said its overdraft fees accounted for a proportionally larger share of its operation than at other banks because TD was focused primarily on consumer banking, while many other financial companies have a wider range of businesses, like investment banking.The total number of overdraft fees has declined since the financial crisis, but their persistence reflects a reality of the banking industry: Regulations have crimped profits from once-profitable activities like lending.It turns out that overdraft fees are the banks\u2019 version of cigarette smoking, a habit that is tough to break.The nation\u2019s big consumer banks collected about $11 billion in overdraft fees last year, which accounted for 8 percent of their profits, according to a report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Regulations, passed in 2010, require banks to give customers a choice of whether to incur overdraft fees or have a transaction declined.But many customers end up confused by how overdrafts work. In their marketing materials, for example, banks present the choice of whether to sign up for overdraft as an offer of \u201coverdraft protection\u201d \u2014 a feature many customers thought would automatically deny transactions and shield them from incurring the fees at all. In reality, it is a service authorizing the banks to charge the overdraft fees. Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, brands its product OOPS, or \u201cOptional Overdraft Protection Service.\u201d\u201cThere was a push to frame \u2018opt-in\u2019 as a positive thing and sometimes gloss over the details,\u201d said Samantha Kinney, who used to work at a retail bank and is now a financial counselor at Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners in New York.Mr. Mangan, who works as a technology consultant, says he is the first to acknowledge that when he bounces a check, he should pay a penalty. But, one day last May, he noticed that TD Bank Group had charged him a $35 overdraft fee even though his account still had money in it.That afternoon, Mr. Mangan withdrew $20 in cash at a TD Bank A.T.M., leaving only a few dollars in his account. That night, TD Bank processed a $125 check that he had written days earlier. As a result, the bank charged him two fees: one for the bounced check and another for the $20 A.T.M. withdrawal.\u201cI had that money in my account. I have the slip to prove it,\u201d Mr. Mangan said.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is hashing out rules that could limit reordering, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Outlines of the rules are expected this year.Still, the regulation is not a panacea, consumer advocates say. It will not address the lines of credit, which are considered loans. The credit lines are supposed to be less expensive than traditional overdrafts, and if customers pay off the loans quickly, the charges amount to only a few dollars.But the costs can add up. KeyBank\u2019s credit line, for example, carries a 15 percent interest rate, a $10 fee for every time customers overdraw their account, a $30 annual fee and $25 late fees.The real problems arise, though, when customers have no idea that they signed up for the loans. It is an easy mistake to make, bank customers say, since the credit lines are often tucked into checking account agreements and do not require a separate signature to be approved.Citigroup\u2019s line of credit is called \u201cChecking Plus,\u201d which to Ms. Lemus, who speaks primarily Spanish, did not appear to be anything like a loan. When she first noticed the $96 withdrawals, Ms. Lemus was alarmed.But what she learned was even more distressing: Every time she overdrew her checking account, Citigroup was lending her money at 18.25 percent to cover the shortfalls. There were other unusual features and charges associated with the loan. Citigroup extended the loan in $100 increments, even if she was short by only $35.And in one month, Citigroup withdrew the loan payment two days after the due date the bank itself had set. For this, Citigroup collected an additional $25 for the late payment.\u201cI felt so humiliated,\u201d Ms. Lemus said.If she made just the minimum payment, it would take Ms. Lemus 13 years to pay off her credit line. The bank has been trying to collect the debt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Housing, Private Donors", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byBig CityAfter the discussion, a political strategist who was in the audience suggested that any fund for public housing omit the phrase itself, because \u201cpeople hate public housing.\u201dThere are certainly precedents for private donations to public entities: The private, nonprofit Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980, when the city\u2019s maintenance budget fell woefully short, and now supplies some 75 percent of the park\u2019s annual budget. In more recent years, charter schools have turned to philanthropists to raise money for rent and teachers. Still, the Fund for Public Housing represents an unusual grasp for private donations from a troubled city agency, the largest housing authority in the country.Ms. Olatoye and Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen had been talking about a charitable fund devoted to public housing for years, well before they held their current positions. One obstacle is that only a relatively small fraction of philanthropic dollars each year goes to poverty-related causes to begin with. Beyond that, in the absence of a personal connection to a particular mission, or the aura of social prestige, donors are often prompted to give when there is an emotional narrative to which they can respond, and drab, monolithic buildings don\u2019t easily move people.The initial goal, Ms. Olatoye says, is to tap, as a university would, into an alumni base. That base includes Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs; Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks; the former schools chancellor Joel I. Klein; the rap artist Jay Z; and the retired basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, all of whom grew up in New York City public housing.Still, there are obvious appeals to be made. \u201cWe want New Yorkers who grew up in public housing or who value New York as a diverse place \u2014 and that diversity is largely because of Nycha \u2014 to step up,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said. \u201cThe sell isn\u2019t about fixing up our buildings; it\u2019s about the fact that one in 12 New Yorkers lives in Nycha housing.\u201dWhile the need for plumbing repairs in the Farragut Houses may not stir charitable impulses, the fact that the average household income of residents in New York City public housing is $23,000 a year, or that 40 percent of adults in the projects without disabilities are unemployed, could. The fund will be used, Ms. Kirmani-Frye said, to improve the lives of residents by updating buildings in chronic disrepair, advancing job and career opportunities and connecting housing developments, which can often be isolated either geographically or psychologically from the rest of the city. One hope, she said, is to bridge the informal economies that arise in public housing \u2014 a mother selling layer cakes she bakes in her apartment, for instance \u2014 to larger commercial enterprises outside the system.The stark examples of inequality that have arisen in the city in recent years as a result of gentrification present themselves, ironically enough, as opportunity. That there are now wealthy neighborhoods abutting public housing complexes in Chelsea, for instance, or in Dumbo in Brooklyn means that well-off people at the very least now have a more intimate view of the projects. Gary Hattem, the president of the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, who made the first donation to the Fund for Public Housing, lives in brownstone Brooklyn two blocks from public housing in Fort Greene.\u201cPublic housing isn\u2019t an obvious recipient of philanthropy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you think about what makes New York City work, public housing is just so essential to the success of families and neighborhoods, and that has too long been unrecognized.\u201dPhilanthropy often works bests when it appeals to human vanity. Is it possible that buildings might be renamed to honor the most magnanimous donors? \u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said.Email: bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jets Will No Longer Get a Free Ride on Carbon Emissions", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byEditorialThis is a welcome development, even if it has left many environmental groups disappointed. They have argued, not unreasonably, that the agency set the bar far too low. Existing planes wouldn\u2019t have to improve their efficiency, and aircraft under development would need do no more than meet the emissions goals set by manufacturers. Automakers in the United States, by contrast, must nearly double their fuel economy by 2025.For now, however, what is important is that an industry that accounts for almost 2 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 about the same as Germany \u2014 and that is projected to double the number of passengers and flights by 2030 will finally join other major sources of greenhouse gas pollution that are subject to international emissions controls.The history of pollution controls has shown that the first step, however modest, is often the most important in raising confidence and creating momentum toward greater change. In this case, the timing is important, since the clock is running out on the Obama administration.The United States accounts for half of all carbon dioxide emissions from planes, and limiting aviation emissions has been high on President Obama\u2019s environmental agenda. But the international agreement took more than six years to negotiate, and it still needs approval from the group\u2019s larger council and then its full assembly, followed by laws or regulations in each of the 36 member states. Mr. Obama has the authority to set the standards. That is about all he can hope to achieve on this front in his remaining months, and if it happens, it will be no mean feat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consensus on Need to Revise Tax Code, but Partisan Split on Specifics", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by2016 TaxesWashington is gripped by partisan divisions, but there is overwhelming agreement on at least one important issue: The United States is long overdue for the sort of sweeping, once-in-a-generation tax overhaul that last occurred in 1986.There is also broad, bipartisan consensus that it\u2019s unlikely to happen in 2016 \u2014 largely because of the near paralysis in policy making that typically accompanies a presidential campaign season.But after the enactment in December of a big, complicated tax law that gave permanence to a litany of previously temporary tax breaks for individuals and businesses, many of the smaller, recurring disagreements that bedevil policy makers have been swept aside, and the stage seems set for a big overhaul, whenever the time is ripe.Much, of course, will hinge on the outcome of the presidential race, but even this year, some important policy changes may emerge, particularly in the area of international business taxes. There is rising consternation among Democrats and Republicans alike over corporate inversions, in which some major companies have managed to shift their tax headquarters outside the United States and reduce their tax liabilities. And there is also general agreement that the United States is losing the global competition to create a business-friendly tax environment.Another important factor pushing tax policy to the top of the agenda was the ascendance of Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, to speaker of the House in October. Before then, Mr. Ryan had been chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, which he had long called his dream job, and he has also been the author of his party\u2019s boldest tax overhaul proposals.Mr. Ryan has often said that individuals and corporations should pay no higher than 25 percent, compared with the current 39.6 percent top bracket for individuals and 35 percent top rate for corporations.With deductions, credits and loopholes, few corporations or sophisticated taxpayers actually pay that high a percentage, but all the major Republican presidential candidates share Mr. Ryan\u2019s view that taxes must be cut. Mr. Ryan\u2019s past budget proposals have called for eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest as well as eliminating the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.In general, Mr. Ryan has attacked the tax code as too complicated and he has called for ending or sharply reducing an array of popular tax breaks, like the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health plans, and the mortgage interest deduction. In their place, Mr. Ryan has called for across-the-board rate reductions, and potentially the imposition of a consumption tax.Many Democrats fiercely disagree with any plan that would reduce taxes for the wealthiest, but even Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in recent weeks has taken aim at the tax code as being unduly complex and filled with inefficient exceptions, exclusions and other loopholes.\u201cThere is no question, everyone recognizes this tax code has outlived its usefulness and now is a drag on our economy,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, who took over as chairman of Ways and Means in November.President Obama has weighed in with his own jabs at the tax system, often denouncing the ability of wealthy individuals to pay less than most Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address.In a visit to Detroit last month, Mr. Obama also chided Republicans. \u201cThey\u2019ve somehow still convinced themselves that cutting taxes for folks at the very top is to help you succeed. I think there\u2019s a better plan.\u201d Despite the persistent disagreements and continuing vitriol, Democrats and Republicans found common ground in adopting December\u2019s big year-end tax law.That law gave greater certainty to breaks for businesses for research and development and for capital expenditures, deductions for individuals of state and local sales taxes, and a small but symbolic tax credit for teachers who spend their own money on supplies.The bill also made permanent (a status that, of course, could be changed by a future Congress) several provisions important to lower-income families: the earned-income tax credit; the child tax credit; and the American Opportunity tax credit, which provides up to $2,500 for higher-education expenses.Republicans and Democrats alike said the clarity afforded by the new legislation would help set the parameters of the sweeping changes that many expect will seek to \u201cbroaden the base and lower the rates\u201d: That is to say, it will end many tax exemptions and exclusions and use the increased revenue to lower what are known as marginal tax brackets. (Those define what you will pay for all net taxable income beyond certain thresholds.)In the process, policy makers hope to give the United States a cleaner, easier-to-understand tax code. Yet some of the current exemptions are hugely popular, like the deduction for home mortgage interest or for state and local taxes. Everyone wants a simple tax code, but few people want to eliminate provisions that benefit them. That helps explain why it is so difficult to make big changes.Mr. Ryan, in his first major policy speech after becoming speaker, talked about rewriting the tax code, which has been a personal passion throughout his years in office. \u201cYou know what the first item on that agenda is? It\u2019s creating jobs and raising wages,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in the speech at the Library of Congress in December. \u201cWe know what\u2019s standing in our way. Instead of a tax code that all of us can live by, we have a tax code that none of us can understand.\u201dAfter noting that Canada has lower business tax rates, Mr. Ryan continued: \u201cThe only way to fix our tax code is to simplify, simplify, simplify. Close all those loopholes and use that money to cut tax rates for everybody. Take the seven tax rates we have now and collapse them into two or three.\u201dThe speaker is not the only one railing against the tax code. Consider the man Mr. Ryan challenged on the ballot in 2012: Vice President Biden.\u201cGuys, when Reagan was president there was $600 billion in tax expenditures,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a speech last month to House Democrats, referring to the same provisions that Mr. Ryan called \u201cloopholes.\u201d Whatever you call them, many are hugely popular and various interest groups will invariably fight to preserve them. For that reason, big tax overhaul plans often call for a phase-in process so that any shift is not excessively abrupt.\u201cThere are now $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cFind me a responsible economist that can justify more than $500 billion to $600 billion of those tax expenditures having any socially redeeming value whatsoever.\u201dMr. Biden then decided to take aim at just one tax break, known as \u201cstepped-up basis,\u201d in which the capital gains liability is reduced on inherited assets. As Mr. Biden explained, stepped-up basis reduces capital gains taxes on inherited assets when they are sold. So if a stock was purchased at $10 a share, and later bequeathed at $50 a share, the $40 a share in gain is effectively tax-free. Capital gains tax would be due only on any amount greater than $50.Mr. Biden said stepped-up basis costs $14 billion a year \u201cto benefit two-tenths of 1 percent of the population that is already very wealthy, does not need it, does not indicate they will invest it in any way that will improve the economy differently.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd for that we can send every kid to community college for free and cut the deficit at the same time\u201d by an additional $8 billion.Despite some points of agreement, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Biden do not agree on the best ways to revise the tax code, and much will depend on who wins the presidency.The major Republican contenders also disagree on many of the ways they would change the code, with some favoring fewer brackets and lower rates, and others favoring the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax.Donald J. Trump\u2019s plan would reduce revenues by $9.5 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank, while Senator Ted Cruz of Texas would cut $8.6 trillion and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida would trim $6.8 trillion. In each case, the cuts would largely benefit the wealthy, and would sharply raise the deficit unless they spurred remarkable economic growth. Critics say the proposals are not realistic.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton has proposed a 4 percent surcharge on the wealthiest Americans, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has called for tax increases on virtually everyone, but particularly on the wealthiest.While the larger debate may have to wait until after the November election, many lawmakers see an urgent need to enact policies that will end new incentives for companies to relocate jobs or offices overseas, or even to reincorporate entirely through tax inversions in which an American company is acquired by a foreign company, and the headquarters is shifted to a lower-tax jurisdiction overseas.Many policy makers are also deeply concerned about the estimated $2 trillion in corporate earnings that American companies have stockpiled offshore and refuse to repatriate because they would then owe taxes on that money.There are acute worries on Capitol Hill and throughout Washington that American companies will end up paying far more taxes to foreign countries \u2014 especially in Europe \u2014 as a result of an effort by the world\u2019s major developed economies to streamline tax policies and prevent increasingly mobile companies from exploiting differences in the laws.In a report last year, a bipartisan working group of the Senate Finance Committee warned that inaction could be costly for the United States and for American companies.\u201cIf policy makers fail to implement new rules in a timely fashion to combat overseas action,\u201d the group wrote, \u201cunilateral actions around the globe will undoubtedly result in far more taxes paid into foreign coffers by U.S. multinational companies, with a corresponding revenue and job loss here in the United States.\u201dMr. Ryan and Mr. Brady are hoping to take action on that front this year. Still, it could be difficult to reach a consensus.\u201cEssentially people are using the need to do international tax as a reason not to act on inversions,\u201d Mr. Levin said in an interview. \u201cWe should put a stop to the takeovers.\u201dHe said he believed Republicans were more interested in allowing American companies to repatriate profits now held overseas by offering some sort of tax holiday.\u201cThey are talking about ways to repatriate,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThere\u2019s serious disagreement under what circumstances and also what the rate would be. We went through it once before. It was a fiasco. They said the money would be used for job creation, and none of it was.\u201dIn short, something needs to be done. but there is no agreement on exactly what. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who spent a decade as the top Republican on the Finance Committee, put it this way: \u201cYou are not going to get Congress to move unless there is more of a consensus on it.\u201d A new president may have to lead the way, he said.Of course, Mr. Grassley said, there will always be opponents to reform. \u201cAccountants don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to become productive members of our society.\u201d In the meantime, there is plenty of work for accountants and lawyers.Welcome to tax season.Advertisement"}

Into the 1990s, it housed props from police shows like \u201cHill Street Blues.\u201dThe building\u2019s newly installed glass doors were recently opened to prospective tenants. Docler Media, based in Luxembourg, installed its technology and film production division in the 33,173-square-foot building, which has concrete floors and 30-foot bow-truss ceilings, subway tile showers, a kitchen that seems out of a Nancy Meyers movie, yoga studio and full bar.\u201cThat\u2019s still all very important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you can say there\u2019s on-site laundry, a cool kitchen area, there\u2019s a little dog park \u2014 that helps landlords land and attract more tenants, especially in the tech sector.\u201dIn Los Angeles, that kind of space has been specifically positioned for more creative firms, rather than those in fields like insurance, law and finance, according to John D. Zanetos, senior vice president for brokerage services at the commercial real estate services firm CBRE in Los Angeles. But that is changing.\u201cWhether you\u2019re an entertainment firm or a law firm, what we hear consistently is that companies are trying to enhance collaboration and deliver a workplace that will enhance that,\u201d Mr. Zanetos said.\u201cThe audience for this type of space isn\u2019t the normal cast of characters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s growing.\u201dPetra Durnin, CBRE\u2019s director of research and analysis for Southern California, estimated the Los Angeles County office space market at 200 million square feet. Technology and creative tenants lease 38 percent, roughly 76 million square feet, she said.\u201cGoing forward, another 30 million square feet of tenants will be expiring and then renewing,\u201d Ms. Durnin said, speaking of the next five years. \u201cFrom that pool we\u2019re looking at everybody turning to some kind of creative space. Eventually all office-using tenants will be in some sort of creative.\u201dThe city has a number of office buildings dating back to the early 1900s with the requisite exposed brick and wood-beamed ceilings. There is also a vast amount of industrial space built from the early 1900s to the 1980s, a vestige of a once-robust manufacturing economy.\u201cL.A. has this unique combination of historic office buildings and industrial product that\u2019s no longer useful in the way it was originally intended,\u201d Mr. Zanetos said.Cory Bird, a co-producer on the television shows \u201cBates Motel,\u201d \u201cThe Strain\u201d and \u201cColony\u201d at Carlton Cuse Productions, often searches for spaces like these. The company produces television shows with sometimes unpredictable schedules and changing needs. This means maintaining multiple offices.\u201cIn our \u2018Bates Motel\u2019 building, everyone\u2019s under one roof and there\u2019s a real community environment,\u201d Mr. Bird said.That building in Sherman Oaks comes closest to fulfilling the needs of a production: a suitable writers\u2019 room, space for casting and the capacity to handle the terabytes of digital information used in postproduction. Yet Mr. Bird still faces challenges.\u201cIf we come in with postproduction, a lot of times we\u2019ll have to overhaul the entire Internet setup,\u201d he said, speaking of not-quite-enough web power. He looks forward to an influx of available space tailored to what he will need.\u201cIf you asked us a year ago when we started Cross Campus, we would have said that\u2019s going to work for offices of up to about 10 people,\u201d Mr. Olshansky said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re starting to see is most of the demand coming from 20-, 40-person offices. That same value proposition still exists.\u201dHe added, \u201cTenants aren\u2019t just limited to creative companies. We\u2019ve got financial companies, law firms, branding, design, advertising. It\u2019s a really wide cross section.\u201dThe Masonic Temple\u2019s 37-foot ceilings, stadium staircase seating and 24-hour concierge illustrate the kind of adaptive reuse these spaces employ.CBRE\u2019s workplace division was a consultant on CBRE\u2019s downtown and Masonic Temple offices.\u201cThat group started off as 12 people; now there are over 50,\u201d said Lewis C. Horne, who heads the firm\u2019s Los Angeles/Orange County region. \u201cWe would not go to meet with a tenant without bringing our workplace strategy professionals.\u201d\u201cIt used to be a broker would go out and find space because it was in the right location,\u201d Mr. Horne said.\u201cPeople would move in, put perimeter offices around the edge of the space,\u201d he added. \u201cThe core would be support, and away you\u2019d go. That\u2019s just not what we\u2019re doing anymore. Now there\u2019s wellness components, this concierge idea, natural light. The line between your home and your office really blurs.\u201dLos Angeles comprises many smaller regions that Mr. Zanetos says have reached a \u201ccritical mass.\u201d On the west side, Playa Vista has attracted tech, entertainment and design companies. Burbank, to the north, is home to two major studios \u2014 Warner Bros. and Disney \u2014 and the companies that do business with them. Both areas have a high concentration of tenants desiring different spaces.\u201cThere\u2019s an effort to bring down real estate costs,\u201d said Eric Sussman, senior lecturer of accounting at the University of California, Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management.\u201cCosts of doing business here are quite high. This can reduce the amount of square footage per employee,\u201d he said.\u201cYou had this move to very traditional space in the \u201980s, \u201990s, 2000s,\u201d Mr. Sussman said. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re getting this other stream where everything\u2019s open and you\u2019re sitting in people\u2019s laps. The dogs are roaming the concrete floors.\u201dAnd tenants are willing to pay.When the developer Rising Realty acquired the PacMutual complex in 2012 for $60 million, rent went for $2 a square foot, according to CBRE. Rising transformed the traditional office space and then sold it to Callahan Capital Properties and Ivanhoe Cambridge.\u201cWhen a developer goes in and buys a historic office building, those buildings need love. They need money,\u201d said Mr. Zanetos of CBRE. \u201cElevators need to be modernized; HVAC and electrical need updates. Data is critical. Nobody can function without high-speed Internet.\u201dPacMutual just achieved rent of $4 a square foot.Similarly, in the Arts District, industrial rents go for 65 cents a square foot per month triple net, meaning the tenant is responsible for taxes, insurance and maintenance. A lease was just recorded in a converted 1920s industrial building at $3 a square foot triple net.\u201cIn L.A., these buildings that were once looked at as obsolete are now being rediscovered,\u201d Mr. Zanetos said.Mr. Kim of Miren observed, \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 \u2014 if you build it they will come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Find Cheap Flights, the Day (Kind of) Matters", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayIs there a best day to get the lowest price on a flight?Many travelers think the magic day is Tuesday, long lauded by travel deal sites and various publications, including this one, for its fare sales. Other travelers may have heard pundits declare Wednesday the ideal day. In December, Expedia and the Airlines Reporting Corporation, which processes ticket transactions for airlines and travel agencies, announced that weekends are the new best time.But is there really a preferred day to buy?There are too many variables at play for there to be a universally ideal day to buy an airline ticket. Price depends on a variety of factors, including the route; the level of competition on the route; surrounding holidays and events (like a convention or the Super Bowl); and the days of the week you plan to fly. During a single week in March, for example, a recent search for a round-trip flight between New York and Miami turned up ticket prices as low as $174 and as high as $314. Besides, nowadays we have fare calendars at our fingertips and websites such as Kayak and Travelzoo that alert us to low fares and sales \u2014 and those sales don\u2019t always take place on the same day of the week.Mr. Hobica pointed out, for instance, that on a recent Thursday, Virgin Atlantic lowered nonstop winter flights to Heathrow Airport in London from John F. Kennedy International Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport to about $504 round-trip. Economy fares had been running $900, Mr. Hobica said, then $800, then they went back up, and after that they dipped to around $680.Airlines (and the above example is but one of many) are perpetually tweaking prices, making predictions difficult. Expedia said as much in its report. Even though its latest research asserts that weekends have the best fares, consumers who spot a good deal on Thursday shouldn\u2019t wait until Saturday to buy it with the hope that the price will tumble even further. \u201cIf you find a fare that looks like a good deal, grab it,\u201d the report said, \u201cregardless of the day of week.\u201dIn addition to recommending the best times of the week to book, Expedia and other sites such as FareCompare publish suggestions about how far in advance of a trip to book to score the lowest fare. For instance, Expedia reported in December that the optimal time to buy an economy ticket for travel in North America is 57 days in advance, resulting in a potential savings of about 10 percent versus the average fare. Recommended lead times for travel to international destinations, including Europe and Asia-Pacific, were even longer.Think you know all the tricks for getting the lowest airfare and the most out of your miles programs? Test your knowledge, based on Stephanie Rosenbloom\u2019s weekly Getaway column.Travelers shouldn\u2019t think of predictions as rules, though. There are flights to Asia, for example, that are $500 cheaper when booked at the last minute as opposed to months in advance, Mr. Hobica said.And talking about the \u201caverage fare\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily helpful because that doesn\u2019t take into account the quality of a flight. Is it nonstop or does it have a 34-minute connection in a busy, sprawling airport like Atlanta? Is it an 18-hour layover in Dallas that will require you to spend an additional $300 in hotel bills and meals? Are you flying in an aisle seat in a Dreamliner or in the middle seat in a MD-80? And if that cheap ticket you found is on a discount airline like Spirit or Frontier, chances are you\u2019ll have to budget another $30 to $100 to check a bag. In other words, you probably don\u2019t want the average fare.If you want to sit next to your companion, be a safe distance from the bathroom, put your bag in an overhead compartment instead of the belly of the plane, and have enough time to make a connection, what you really want are good fares that may not be the absolute cheapest, but give you the experience you want.So how do you find these fares?Almost every major airline (Delta, United, JetBlue) has a good flexible date search option on its website that you can use to see which travel dates will get you the lowest prices, along with the time and comforts you need.To keep abreast of private sales and low fares (as well as hotel deals), you can search or sign up for alerts on Airfarewatchdog.com. Email alerts include low fares for a particular route that interests you, or all of the affordable round-trip flights departing from your local airport.Because prices are constantly fluctuating, keep checking airline websites and Google Flights to see the latest fares. The ticket price you see before lunch may be different a couple of hours later.Advertisement"}

He won 17 percent of the primary\u2019s undeclared voters \u2014 more than any candidate other than Donald J. Trump, who won 36 percent.Mr. Kasich cast himself as a \u201chappy warrior\u201d with an optimistic message: As the son of a mail carrier, who understands the concerns of middle-class Americans, he argues he is well prepared to fix the nation\u2019s economy.In an interview, Mr. Weaver volunteered that South Carolina, which holds the next Republican primary on Feb. 20, is not a \u201cmust-win\u201d for Mr. Kasich.The moderate messages on health care and immigration, among other issues, that helped Mr. Kasich draw support from centrist Republican and independent voters in New Hampshire is likely to alienate some of South Carolina\u2019s more conservative base.Still, Mr. Weaver argued that Mr. Kasich\u2019s campaign would gain a burst of momentum that would sustain him until the Michigan primary, on March 8, which he called a \u201cmust-win\u201d and the \u201cgateway to the Midwest.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re organized in Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, the Plains states, the Rocky Mountain states,\u201d Mr. Weaver said.He said that Mr. Kasich\u2019s team was adding staff members and had strong fund-raising numbers in January, although he declined to say what those figures were. \u201cWe have a national campaign, but we were toiling in obscurity,\u201d he said.But Mr. Kasich\u2019s rivals were less convinced. \u201cJohn Kasich has no chance to do well in the South Carolina primary,\u201d said Tim Miller, a spokesman for Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign.And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that while Mr. Kasich was a \u201cfine man,\u201d the Ohio governor would have a difficult time in that state.\u201cHe talks about closing military bases, and most people in South Carolina, we have a lot of military infrastructure and we need to draw up our military,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who is supporting Mr. Bush.Henry Barbour, a veteran Republican strategist based in Mississippi, commended Mr. Kasich\u2019s second-place finish but noted that he had benefited from what Mr. Barbour called \u201ca refreshing contrast with the rest of the field with his positive message to their food fight.\u201d\u201cOh, and by the way,\u201d Mr. Barbour added, \u201che should buy Chris Christie a steak dinner for his hand in changing the entire momentum of the race in New Hampshire just three days before the primary.\u201dGiovanni Russonello contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Budget Tantrum", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byEditorialBy law, dating back to 1921, the president of the United States must submit an annual budget request to Congress. On Tuesday, President Obama submitted his eighth and final budget. And like all presidential budgets, it is a statement of values and priorities, a blueprint for turning ideas into policies, a map of where the president wants to lead the country.This week, even before the president\u2019s budget was released, the Republican chairmen of the budget committees announced they would not even hold hearings with the White House budget director to discuss the proposal.Their decision is more than a break with tradition. It is a new low in Republican efforts to show disdain for Mr. Obama, which disrespects the presidency and, in the process, suffocates debate and impairs governing.Mr. Obama\u2019s budget proposes to spend $4 trillion in the 2017 fiscal year (slightly more than for 2016). That total would cover recurring expenses, including Medicare and Social Security, as well as new initiatives to fight terrorism, poverty and climate change, while fostering health, education and environmental protection. If Republicans find those efforts objectionable \u2014 as their refusal to even discuss them indicates \u2014 they owe it to their constituents and other Americans to say why.Would they prefer to renege on Social Security benefits? Do they think $11 billion to fight ISIS, as the budget proposes, is too much? Is $4.3 billion to deter Russian aggression against NATO allies a bad idea? Does $19 billion for cybersecurity to protect government records, critical infrastructure and user privacy seem frivolous? And is $1.2 billion to help states pay for safe drinking water or $292 million to send more preschoolers to Head Start really unaffordable?Republicans have objected that the president\u2019s budget does not do enough to tackle the nation\u2019s borrowing. But according to the White House\u2019s estimate, the proposal would reduce deficits by $2.9 trillion over the next 10 years. That would be sufficient to hold deficits below 3 percent of the economy, a level that is widely considered manageable and even desirable, because a wealthy and growing nation can afford to borrow for projects that would be financially burdensome if paid for all at once.If Republicans have a plan to pay for the necessary work of government while eliminating deficits entirely, they should present it.The problem is that Republicans do not have viable alternatives. The budget proposes a $10-a-barrel tax on crude oil to help pay for $320 billion in new spending over 10 years on clean-energy transportation projects. Congressional Republicans, unable to break free of their no-new-taxes-ever stance, have derided the oil tax. But what is their plan to pay for projects to modernize transportation and promote green technology in the absence of a new tax?The budget would also raise $272 billion over the next decade by closing tax loopholes that let high-income owners of limited-liability companies and other so-called pass-through businesses avoid investment taxes that apply to all other investors. Most of the money would be used to strengthen Medicare\u2019s finances. What is the Republican plan to strengthen Medicare?The president\u2019s budget request is a detailed and worthy entry in the contest of ideas. Its aim is to move the nation forward. If Republicans had compelling ideas and a similar commitment to progress, they would engage with the proposals in the budget. But they don\u2019t. So they won\u2019t.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Eyeing South Carolina, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Vie for Crucial Voters", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byScrambling for the support of black voters as a crucial primary in South Carolina nears, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont made appeals on Tuesday to corral their backing. Mrs. Clinton used an address in Harlem to propose $125 billion in new spending to reinvigorate poor and minority communities, and Mr. Sanders barnstormed the South, pledging to combat institutional racism and reform police departments nationwide.With Mr. Sanders trying to cut into his rival\u2019s long-held advantages among black voters, Mrs. Clinton, her voice growing hoarse, warned her audience, in a reference to Mr. Sanders: \u201cYou know, you can\u2019t just show up at election time and say the right things and think that\u2019s enough. We can\u2019t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.\u201dThe black vote is likely to make up roughly half the Democratic electorate in the party\u2019s Feb. 27 primary in South Carolina, and the two candidates highlighted similar themes in their appeals: the disproportionate economic barriers that young black men, in particular, face and the need to overhaul a criminal justice system that incarcerates young black men at high rates and to work with police forces to prevent officers from shooting black men or singling out African-Americans for arrest.Mr. Sanders, speaking to students at a town-hall-style meeting at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, said he was tired of seeing \u201cvideos of unarmed people being killed by police officers.\u201d\u201cWhat is going on now,\u201d he continued, \u201cespecially with regard to African-Americans, this is not new. It has been going on decade after decade after decade. The only difference is the cellphone video. That\u2019s the only difference because what was going on in the past was never recorded, and the police officer\u2019s testimony was accepted as truth. This video, this cellphone makes all the difference in the world.\u201dMr. Sanders made his remarks as he temporarily shifted his campaign\u2019s focus from Nevada, which holds its caucuses Saturday, to South Carolina, where Democrats vote the next weekend, kicking off a round of contests in the South that can essentially decide the race if one candidate is able to roll up a string of victories there in the delegate-rich states that hold contests March 1.Mr. Clinton spoke in Harlem, at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a week after Mr. Sanders visited the neighborhood, fresh from his commanding victory in the New Hampshire primary, meeting with the Rev. Al Sharpton at Sylvia\u2019s restaurant, a Harlem fixture. As if to counter that visit, Mrs. Clinton surrounded herself with members of the black political elite: Representative Charles B. Rangel; Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City, appearing with her husband, Mayor Bill de Blasio; and former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. Mr. Sharpton and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York also attended.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s plan, details of which had already been released, includes a $20 billion program to create jobs for young disadvantaged people; funding for local programs that would end what she called the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d; a $5 billion investment to fund re-entry programs that would help formerly incarcerated people to become productive members of society; and $25 billion to aid entrepreneurs in underserved communities.A campaign aide said the plan would be paid for by a \u201crisk fee\u201d imposed on Wall Street banks and other changes in the tax code.Without mentioning Mr. Sanders by name, Mrs. Clinton implied that his central message of taking on Wall Street and economic inequality did little to address problems such as gun violence, joblessness and clashes with the police that disproportionately affect black communities.\u201cThese are not only problems of economic inequality,\u201d Mrs. Clinton continued. \u201cThese are problems of racial inequity, and we\u2019ve got to say that loudly and clearly.\u201dIt was not the first time Mrs. Clinton delivered a high-profile address on racial issues: She devoted the first major speech of her presidential campaign last spring to calling for an overhaul of a broken criminal justice system and vowing to \u201cend the era of mass incarceration,\u201d a pledge she reiterated Tuesday.Before the speech, Mrs. Clinton met with civil rights leaders in New York, including the lawyer Benjamin L. Crump, who represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown and who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders was flanked in his appearance at the University of South Carolina by State Representative Justin T. Bamberg, the lawyer for the family of Walter L.

He also expressed disappointment in the way some police forces systematically discriminated against blacks.\u201cWe have got to achieve the day when young black males and women can walk the streets without worrying about being harassed by a police officer,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI have talked to African-American Ph.D.s who get nervous when they have to travel or drive across the country. That should not be happening in the year 2016.\u201dEarlier in the day, at Allen University, Mr. Sanders highlighted that a high percentage of black children lived in poverty (he said 35 percent) and that an even higher percentage of young black people, 51 percent, were unemployed.While delivering parts of his standard stump speech, Mr. Sanders also stressed that the \u201crigged economy\u201d was leading him to focus on the plight of blacks and propose changes to improve their conditions.\u201cWhen we talk about inequality, it goes without saying that the African-American community is suffering even more,\u201d Mr. Sanders told the crowd of 400 mostly black people. \u201cAnd when we talk about what is going on in this country, and the fact that virtually the entire nation suffered terribly as a result of the greed and reckless and illegal behavior of Wall Street, which drove this economy into a terrible recession, the African-American community suffered more and has recovered in a much less significant way.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

He gave them to the Syrians for free.\u201d\u201cThey have become a nuisance,\u201d Mr. Moghrebi said.In Ramtha, the bulging population has set off a competition between locals and the refugees for resources, including housing, water, schools and work. When the border crossing was closed, Mr. Moghrebi was forced to shut down his decades-old money exchange business. Instead, he has to rely on the income of his 29-year-old son, the only one of his 10 children who still has a job, he said. Jordan would be better off if the refugees stayed in camps, he added.The anger has left many Syrians further marginalized in the already isolating struggle to survive. Mohamed, a 13-year-old Syrian with an irrepressible smile who now lives in the northern Jordanian town of Irbid, said he did not socialize with the other children on his street and had made only one real friend: another Syrian teenager who worked with him at a cleaning fluids factory, making the equivalent of $7 a day.In his spare time, he said, he watched videos of the Syrian war.There have been flashes of popular anger as the economy worsens, including a recent protest by tomato farmers who destroyed surplus crops they could not sell for several reasons, including the closed borders. Some Jordanian political figures, echoing the discourse of anti-immigrant movements in the West, have tried to link the refugees to rising crime, terrorism or a threat to national identity. But others have blamed the government for mismanaging the crisis and revived longstanding complaints about corruption.\u201cHow can we be a contributor to regional stability if we are let down by the international community?\u201d Abdullah asked.The appeal, with its vague threat, had the intended effect: More than $10 billion was raised at the London conference, exceeding estimates. The largess was partly driven by the growing alarm in Europe over the number of refugees there and the desire to keep them in border countries.But despite the ambitious proposals, the international aid is still widely regarded in Jordan as a short-term fix to a much deeper economic problem, as well as an attempt by Western nations to buy Jordan\u2019s continued forbearance in order to ensure the refugees never reach their own shores.Forced from their homes by war and economic deprivation, 67,000 migrants made the perilous journey to Europe last month.The government promises to somehow lure new investment, but local and foreign funding are increasingly scarce because of regional turmoil, said Samer Tawil, a former economy minister.\u201cWe have five \u2018free economic zones,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not creating jobs. There is hardly an investor there. There are no shipping lines from here to the rest of the world. The Syrian border is closed. The Iraqi border is closed.\u201d\u201cHow can we find jobs for Syrians, unless we want to open our labor market and treat them as nationals?\u201d Mr. Tawil asked. \u201cIn that case, people will fire Jordanians to hire a cheaper Syrian.\u201d\u201cThey will settle here and become nationalized,\u201d he said, cautioning that such a move would further dilute the privileges of East Bank Jordanians.Such warnings have put growing pressure on the government, and possibly put the refugees at greater risk, aid workers say.The Jordanian frontier has also been all but sealed, resulting in \u201cat least three major buildups of asylum seekers along the inhospitable informal northeastern borders, the latest with a reported 16,000 refugees,\u201d the group said.\u201cThere is no question that Jordan has been shouldering this problem on their own for all these years, and it is straining the resources of the country,\u201d said Karl Schembri, a spokesman for the group based in Amman, the Jordanian capital. \u201cNo country in the world was ever prepared for these influxes of refugees.\u201dBut the Syrians were faced with \u201can impossible situation,\u201d Mr. Schembri said. Nearly half of the refugees the group has interviewed want to leave Jordan. But the odds of reaching Europe are long, and they are loath to return to the stampeding violence at home.Mohamed Masalmeh, 70, a Syrian who has been waiting out the war with his family in Ramtha for four years, is barely scraping by, and hardly, it seems, straining the resources of the state. He supports himself, his wife and three granddaughters with the help of United Nations assistance that only just covers the rent.\u201cWe thought it would be six months, a year,\u201d he said. His granddaughters, whose father was killed in the war, barely know anything about Syria.He does not intend on staying, as some Jordanians fear. \u201cIf there is any peace, we\u2019ll go back,\u201d he said.Ranya Kadri contributed reporting from Amman.Advertisement"}

The city, rather than the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is state-run, would also operate the line. Likewise, a proposed development that would make Governors Island a year-round hub for attracting new businesses would focus on the 150 acres that are under city control.\u201cDifferent as our lives are, we are bound together by an invisible thread. We are united by the profound and powerful fact that we are all New Yorkers.\u201dIf there was a dominant theme, it was that the city draws its strength from its polyglot nature, the diversity of its enclaves and neighborhoods.It was not the sort of overarching message that supports a single policy proposal, but rather a thread the mayor wove through a litany of initiatives, from doing more to clean up graffiti to making rooftop repairs in public housing complexes to using countdown clocks to track the progress of buses through the streets.\u201cFor the first time, as a city, we are fighting to shatter that stigma and deal with the public health crisis of mental health.\u201dThe mayor mentioned mental health or mental illness roughly a dozen times. The issue is expected to be a major priority for him this year, and his wife, Chirlane McCray, will continue to be a driving force in the related initiatives.Mr. de Blasio said the program his wife is to lead would include establishing a hotline for people in crisis, and offering mental health first-aid training for New Yorkers so they are able to identify and respond to signs of mental illness and substance abuse. The mayor blew a kiss to Ms. McCray when he introduced her.\u201cEverything we\u2019re doing to make this a fairer city, a city of opportunity, rests on the work we do to keep people safe.\u201dThe address included several minutes of praise for the work of uniformed members of the city\u2019s police, fire and correction departments, on and off the job. Members of the audience rose in applause as the mayor introduced Police Officer Kenneth Healey, who survived being struck in the head by a hatchet-wielding attacker in 2014.The praise seemed meant to underscore how far Mr. de Blasio has gone to try to repair his relations with the Police Department, which became badly strained after two officers were shot and killed in the line of duty in December 2014.Even as the mayor spoke, two officers were shot in the South Bronx; both were expected to survive. After the speech was over, Mr. de Blasio was told of the shooting, left the stage and went immediately to the hospital where they had been taken. Once there, he addressed reporters while standing alongside Patrick J. Lynch, the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association president who had been a vocal antagonist of the mayor\u2019s last year.\u201cWe call these speeches the State of the City. To me, that really means the State of Our People. Because it\u2019s the 8.5 million of us, living in neighborhoods across the five boroughs, that make this the greatest city in the world.\u201dThroughout the speech, the mayor played municipal booster. Two times he called New York the \u201cgreatest city in the world\u201d; he did not use the phrase at all in his two previous State of the City addresses.The sentiment appeared to be in keeping with the absence of sweeping new initiatives and highlighted a message \u2014 one that is likely to be repeated frequently in the second half of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s term as the 2017 election approaches \u2014 that life in New York has improved on his watch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders\u2019s Tax Plan Would Test an Economic Hypothesis", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byTax PolicyIn the Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders is calling for a political revolution, saying his movement can sweep in policy changes that would seem impossible in traditional American politics.One of the ideas Mr. Sanders has advanced is more revolutionary than it looks at first glance: much higher taxes on the highest earners, so high they would reach or even pass the point after which higher tax rates mean less revenue instead of more.Mr. Sanders has proposed a headline top tax rate of 52 percent, applying only to incomes over $10 million. But that\u2019s just the federal income tax. When you combine it with other taxes that apply to income, like existing payroll taxes and new ones Mr. Sanders would impose to pay for Social Security, single-payer health care and family leave, and then add those on top of taxes levied by state governments, it would add up to a combined tax rate of over 73 percent on the highest incomes, more than 20 points higher than today. That\u2019s in the average state \u2014 maximum rates in high-tax jurisdictions like California and New York City would be even higher.Mr. Saez, who is perhaps best known by the public for his work with Thomas Piketty on rising income inequality, said a key effect of such a large tax increase would be to push down the pretax incomes of the ultrarich.\u201cMy feel is that the reasoning behind Sanders\u2019s tax plan is not so much tax revenue generation from top earners but rather make top tax rates so high so as to discourage \u2018greed,\u2019 defined broadly as extracting income at the expense of the rest of the economy as opposed to real productive behavior,\u201d Mr. Saez wrote in an email. \u201cI think pretax top incomes would finally start to decline.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s 73 percent rate would apply only to ordinary income and only to people making over $10 million a year, which is not very many people. But even for what you might call garden-variety rich people, Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan would push rates near the revenue maximizing level: His plan would result in an all-in tax rate of just over 65 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million.Many supporters of Mr. Sanders would probably find this to be a desirable outcome, but there is a problem \u2014 Mr. Sanders is counting on those high incomes to generate the high tax receipts needed to fund his single-payer health plan.\u201cWe do not assume taxpayers change their behavior,\u201d said Warren Gunnels, the policy director for the senator\u2019s campaign. He said the tax rates under the plan were not chosen with an eye toward the Diamond-Saez hypothesis, but rather to generate sufficient revenue to pay for the senator\u2019s policy proposals. He said the plan assumes that new, higher rates would be applied to the existing income base, without taxpayers reporting lower incomes.Much higher tax rates on the highest earners can generate revenue to pay for new programs, and they can encourage a more equal distribution of pretax income. But these two objectives are in tension with each other \u2014 the more Mr. Saez is right that high rates will discourage ultrahigh incomes, the less revenue Mr. Sanders will get from his new taxes on ultrahigh earners.Michael Strain, a labor economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, noted that most existing research on revenue-maximizing tax rates looks at the years immediately after a tax change, and therefore could miss long-run effects on taxpayer behavior. What if a high tax rate not only encourages people to work less, but also discourages them from going into certain high-paying fields in the first place? A result could be that revenues would first go up, and then down as new workers enter the work force and fewer specialize in fields that make ultrahigh incomes possible.\u201cThere are no truly convincing estimates of the long-run elasticity,\u201d they wrote in that paper. Still, they settled on one that became the basis of the 73 percent estimate, and they offered a good reason not to worry too much about the uncertainty: You could move the estimate quite a bit in either direction and still find that the maximizing rate would be much higher than the then-existing top rate, which was just 42.5 percent before tax increases on high earners that took effect in 2013.But there are two reasons to worry about revenues in the context of Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan. The first is that 73 percent is a lot more than 42.5 percent, and so Mr. Sanders cannot rely on a wide cushion around the estimate of the revenue-maximizing tax rate to be assured that he is below it.The other is that the relationship between tax rates and revenue collected is a curve. As you climb to the top of the curve, revenues keep going up, but they rise more and more slowly. When you are very near the revenue-maximizing rate, every dollar of new revenue generated through higher tax rates is offset by almost one dollar of lost revenue because of lower reported incomes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Have Fallen Faster and Further Than Broader Market", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the United States economy muddled along over the last few years, investors paid handsome sums to get in on high-flying technology companies that were among the few pockets of steady growth. Now comes the payback.As the stock market continues its 2016 slide, technology stocks are falling even further, victims of their own success as well as fears about the global economy and a slowdown in business spending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9.4 percent this year. The index\u2019s technology components are down about 12 percent, and the closely watched so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are down even further, falling 17 percent on average this year after an 83 percent rise in 2015.\u201cThey go faster on the way up, they go faster on the way down. That\u2019s about as simple as I can make it,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners.Shares of Twitter, the popular social media service, for example, are down about 40 percent so far this year. And some analysts worry it could tumble even more after the company announces quarterly results Wednesday afternoon.The overall market has been hit by a slowdown in China and a collapse in the price of oil prices and other commodities.Many technology companies continue to produce strong profits, and for the most part they have strong balance sheets with lots of cash to fund future growth. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for example, added close to $10 billion to its $73 billion cash reserve over the last year.But since these companies\u2019 shares are priced high relative to their profits \u2014 that is, because investors are willing to pay more now in hopes of getting in on future growth \u2014 they become more vulnerable when there is a broader market downturn.\u201cThe market is doing a general sell-off, everybody is looking at things,\u201d said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund. \u201cTech stocks are pretty expensive, so they are more prone to correction.\u201dTake, for instance, the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon and Facebook. P/E, as stock analysts call it, is a measurement of a company\u2019s stock price divided by earnings a share. For Amazon, that number is 388. Facebook? It\u2019s 78. But for the whole S.&P. 500, it is a more modest 17.Wage growth has been slow for years, but consumers always seemed to have enough for a new iPhone or to try out new gadgets like a FitBit, all while shifting more of their spending to online outlets like Amazon and Netflix. Businesses embraced cloud computing and bought ever more ads on Google and Facebook.No doubt, technology stocks were to some extent being lifted by the same low interest rates that had propelled the broader stock market, but they also had good stories to tell their investors, as well as the numbers to back it up.Now some investors are wondering how long they can keep it up in the face of slower growth. The economy ended last year on a whimper, expanding less than 1 percent for a number of reasons including weaker trade and falling business investment.Worried about a broader slowdown, investors have become quick to punish any company that looks as if its upward trajectory is flattening out, particularly if that company looks susceptible to the decline in businesses spending.That thinking helps explain big drops for LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, and Tableau Software, a maker of business software. Both companies have lost more than half their market value after weaker-than-expected revenue forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, the cloud software company, have been caught in the undertow and are down close to 30 percent this year.\u201cPeople are starting to anticipate a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and a slowdown in related technology spending,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.Still, with consumer spending and job growth remaining healthy, the market continues to give special consideration to consumer-focused companies that are making their numbers.Netflix also disappointed Wall Street with American subscriber growth that was lower than investors had hoped. The stock is down about 25 percent this year.What is not yet clear is how the decline in public company shares will affect the herd of tech \u201cunicorns,\u201d or private companies worth more than $1 billion, like the ride-hailing service Uber. Whatever the result, it is unlikely to be good.\u201cThat whole thing that you\u2019re going to hide out from the volatility in the public market \u2014 this is where they are going to find out that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, a technology investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America\u2019s Stacked Deck", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byIt\u2019s a little bizarre this political season to see wealthy candidates in both parties denouncing our political system for representing mostly the interests of, well, wealthy people.One glimpse of the structural unfairness in America is this: A dumb rich kid is now more likely to graduate from college than a smart poor kid, according to Robert Putnam of Harvard University.It seems to me to make more sense to target solutions than scapegoats, but sense is often in short supply in politics. After a characteristically brilliant speech by Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic nominee for president in 1952 and 1956, a supporter is said to have bellowed, \u201cEvery thinking American will vote for you!\u201dLegend has it that Stevenson shouted back: \u201cThat\u2019s not enough. I need a majority!\u201dIn the solutions domain, a starting point should be to reduce the influence of money in politics.The rise of inequality has complex roots, and some aren\u2019t easily solved. For example, the empowerment of women, coupled with the tendency of people to marry those like themselves, means that high-earning men increasingly pair with high-earning women to form super-high-earning families.Likewise, many Americans are wealthy in part because they worked hard, saved constantly and invested brilliantly. That\u2019s to be celebrated, but all this plays out on a tilted field that also affects outcomes, and social values.In this election season, many Americans feel that they are living that rigged Monopoly game.Likewise, the great philosopher John Rawls developed a thought experiment to judge the fairness of a society: Imagine that you will be placed in a society but don\u2019t know your station there. You\u2019re unsure if you\u2019ll be rich or poor, smart or dumb, black or white, male or female. In that case, many of us might choose Sweden as well, rather than risk ending up in the wrong ZIP code in the United States today.So American voters are right to feel angry. Yet the challenge is not just to diagnose the problem but also to prescribe the right fixes and achieve them in this political environment.So may the insurrection gain ground but be channeled not by punishing scapegoats, but by pursuing reforms that make the system work better for ordinary Americans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Girds for What It Loves Most: A Battle Royal Over Supreme Court Pick", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byOn WashingtonNobody wanted to say so publicly out of respect for the justice, but several Washington players noted privately that it felt good to suddenly be relevant again. Congress will now have something more stimulating to look forward to than a numbing floor fight over an appropriations bill.The unexpected vacancy had another small consequence \u2014 it immediately made the Supreme Court a dominant issue in the presidential campaign. The court, usually cast in the role of deciding issues that elections cannot, now may be the issue that decides the election.\u201cI think it is widely understood that Supreme Court nominations are a pretty big deal, and they have become an increasingly big deal in presidential campaigns,\u201d said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. \u201cIt will become an even bigger feature because of this.\u201dIf Mr. Lee and his Senate Republican colleagues stick to their politically risky pledge to deny Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee so much as a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, it means the next president will be guaranteed a pick who will decide the ideological tilt of the court immediately upon taking office.Republicans and Democrats are arguing over whether President Obama, whose term expires in 342 days, should try to fill Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat.If that doesn\u2019t make the court a driving force in the presidential and Senate campaigns to those on both the left and the right, nothing will. Few things excite Washington more than a titanic Supreme Court confirmation fight \u2014 unless it is a titanic fight over whether to have the confirmation fight.Activists on both sides always encourage voters to consider the makeup of the court when casting their presidential votes. But the Supreme Court remains a mysterious secret society to many Americans, and fundamental issues like the economy and national security are more likely to be on their minds when they mark their ballots.Amplifying the immediate intrigue around the court was its remarkable decision last week to block new Obama administration emissions rules without any explanation and before a lower court had even weighed in. The choice to derail a key element of Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change agenda, in what was viewed by some as a dismissive manner, reignited the debate over whether the court was just another eager combatant in the capital\u2019s vicious partisan warfare.Beyond that, critics saw the action as premature meddling not just in an important regulatory dispute but in the very fate of the planet by undermining the new climate change accord reached in Paris.\u201cIt is the environmental version of Bush v. Gore without even a pretense to the country of transparency and accountability,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who has argued four cases before the court and was stunned by the action. He was comparing it, of course, to the decision in 2000 on the presidential recount that was seen as a highly partisan ruling by the supposedly impartial court.And consider this: If the court had been confronted with making that decision just a few days later after the death of Justice Scalia, it would have probably resulted in a 4-to-4 tie and the regulations would not have been blocked.There are plenty of plot twists ahead, beginning with whom Mr. Obama selects and how that choice signals his strategy for maneuvering the Senate into action. Is it a nominee like Sri Srinivasan, the appeals court judge who cleared the Senate with a 97-to-0 vote, making it hard for Republicans to convincingly argue that they do not view him as qualified? Is it a woman or a minority, someone whom many Republicans might feel uncomfortable ignoring flat-out?Some Democrats are encouraging the White House to circumvent Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, and reach out directly to Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who used to have the job. The White House needs to remind those two old Senate bulls, the Democrats say, that as legislators they have responsibilities beyond adhering to Mr. McConnell\u2019s plan to unilaterally deny the president a court pick.Mr. McConnell is famously disciplined and inscrutable and will no doubt stick unwaveringly to his pledge to block the nominee \u2014 unless he finds it is not in his interest to do so. Remember that last year he slow-walked the nomination of Attorney General Loretta Lynch only to eventually put it out on the floor and vote for her himself without informing colleagues ahead of time that he intended to do so.One Republican raised another possibility: The Republicans will stall Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee in the Senate and await the results of the election. If they fare poorly in November, they will then rush Mr. Obama\u2019s choice through in a lame-duck session rather than allow a Democratic president \u2014 whoever he or she is \u2014 to name a more objectionable choice.No matter how it plays out, Washington for the moment has what it loves most \u2014 a supercharged showdown. And something important to fight over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Free Electricity Helped Dig $9 Billion Hole in Puerto Rico", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byAGUADILLA, P.R. \u2014 To understand how Puerto Rico\u2019s power authority has piled up $9 billion in debt, one need only visit this bustling city on the northwest coast.Twenty years ago, it was just another town with dwindling finances. Then, it went on a development spree, thanks to a generous \u2014some might say ill-considered \u2014 gift from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.Today, Aguadilla has 19 city-owned restaurants and a city-owned hotel, a water park billed as biggest in the Caribbean, a minor-league baseball stadium bathed in floodlights and a waterfront studded with dancing fountains and glimmering streetlights.Most striking is the ice-skating rink. Unusual in a region where the temperature rarely drops below 70 degrees, the rink is complete with a disco ball and laser lights.Signs warn skaters not to wear shorts.\u201cImagine how much it costs to have an ice-skating rink in the tropics,\u201d said Sergio Marxuach, policy director at the Center for a New Economy, a nonpartisan research group in San Juan.And that is the catch. What most likely would be the biggest recurring expense for these attractions \u2014 electricity \u2014 costs Aguadilla nothing. It has been provided free for years by the power authority, known as Prepa.In fact, the power authority has been giving free power to all 78 of Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities, to many of its government-owned enterprises, even to some for-profit businesses \u2014 although not to its citizens. It has done so for decades, even as it has sunk deeper and deeper in debt, borrowing billions just to stay afloat.Now, however, the island\u2019s government is running out of cash, facing a total debt of $72 billion and already defaulting on some bonds \u2014 and an effort is underway to limit the free electricity, which is estimated to cost the power authority hundreds of millions of dollars.But like many financial arrangements on the island, the free electricity is so tightly woven into the fabric of society that unwinding it would have vast ramifications and, some say, only worsen the plight of the people who live here.\u201cIf the towns don\u2019t get free energy, they\u2019re going to have to pay for it by increasing their property taxes or something, so the people will end up paying,\u201d said Eduardo Bhatia, the president of the Puerto Rico Senate. Residents of the island are already upset about a recent sales tax increase to 11 percent, from 7 percent, and a property tax increase now would cause an outcry. The last assessment was in 1958.\u201cThis is the great mystery that we have to unravel in the coming months,\u201d Mr. Bhatia said in an interview.Meanwhile, though, the free electricity offers a window into the workings of the island\u2019s sole power provider and demonstrates how complex the solutions to the larger debt troubles are likely to be.\u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of a lot of things here in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Miguel Soto-Class, the president of the Center for a New Economy, which has been urging changes at Prepa for the last 10 years. \u201cEvery time we start to get into this, they always come back and say: \u2018Well, there\u2019s nothing we can do. We\u2019ve got to keep the lights on.\u2019 \u201dCarlos M\u00e9ndez Mart\u00ednez, the mayor of Aguadilla, said the city-owned attractions had turned Aguadilla\u2019s onetime deficit into a surplus and generated profits he uses to pay down debt, improve low-income housing and offer free wheelchairs and delivered meals to shut-ins. The profits have also allowed him to keep a 17-year-old promise not to raise taxes. Last year, he even paid a \u201cdividend\u201d to every man, woman and child in the city \u2014 a free ticket to the water park, which otherwise costs residents $20.These achievements have inspired voters to elect Mr. M\u00e9ndez four times. Aguadilla has no term limits, and he expects to win again this year. \u201cI can be mayor until the day I die,\u201d he said in a recent interview. Mr. M\u00e9ndez said it was fair to use the power authority\u2019s free electricity for municipal development, because Prepa paid no property taxes or licensing fees for its many facilities in Aguadilla. But anticipating limits on his free power now that the authority is struggling for solvency, he recently put a solar power system on the roof of the skating rink that he hopes will eventually get it off the grid. Aguadilla may be the most visible example, but other municipalities use Prepa\u2019s free electricity to power air-conditioned restaurants and hotels, lighting systems for minor-league baseball games at night, lighting and sound systems for festivals, and other enterprises. Until now, the power authority\u2019s terms gave cities no incentive to conserve. The more free power they used, the more they could receive.\u201cWe have heard of many private entities that for years have run a private business in a building owned by a municipality, and they never paid for power,\u201d said Agustin F. Carb\u00f3 Lugo, president of the Puerto Rico Energy Commission. The commission, established in 2014, is the power authority\u2019s first independent regulator; previously the public-owned monopoly regulated itself.The private companies had paid local property taxes, but publicly owned Prepa did not. Free electricity was intended to make up for the lost tax revenue. The value of the free power was supposed to match the forgone taxes, and if cities took more, they were supposed to pay for it. But the rates are driven by oil prices, which since the 1970s have lost any connection they might have had to property values, and the power authority simply stopped trying to collect what cities owed. In 2014 a consulting firm found the cities had received $420 million worth of free electricity that they should have paid for. Nor was it just towns and cities. The consulting firm FTI Capital Advisors found that 288 governmental bodies on the island were delinquent in their power payments by $300 million. Among them were public schools, hospitals, low-income housing projects, a commuter train, the island\u2019s water and sewerage system, and its highway authority, which operates traffic signals, toll plazas and highway lighting.If the power authority were to demand immediate payment from them, it could set off a domino effect of defaults and insolvencies.In 2012, for example, Puerto Rico\u2019s port authority fell $60 million behind on its electric bills, and the utility threatened to cut off power to the island\u2019s main commercial airport, in San Juan. That would have forced the airport to close, a catastrophe for an island economy that caters to tourists.To avert a crisis, the government sold the airport to a private investment group from Mexico, and used the proceeds to make a dent in the overdue $60 million. But before long, what was left of the port authority, nine seaports and 11 small airports, started falling behind on electric bills again.The power authority is working out a payment plan for them.Other delinquencies have been tougher to resolve. When the power authority threatened to turn off the power in the commuter rail system\u2019s administrative offices, rail officials scoffed, saying the authority had no legal standing to enforce its claims.\u201cNobody\u2019s happy,\u201d Senator Bhatia said in a recent interview in San Juan. \u201cNobody\u2019s in a good position, and that\u2019s why we have to keep working together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Big Problem With High Health Care Deductibles", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewPeople tend to hate these features, but they were not devised to be cruel. Rather, they were fashioned with economic theory in mind.Those choices, over time, could reduce the amount of health care that is used and the price of services: If patients do not care about price, then they will not have any incentive to look for a bargain, and health care providers will not have an incentive to offer one.More recent research supports this idea. Employers who asked workers to pay a higher share of their bills have also seen overall spending decline. A particularly good case can be made that cost-sharing has helped steer patients away from brand-name drugs and toward identical generics, when they are available.Mr. Chandra said he was no longer convinced that deductibles turned patients into good consumers. \u201cThe best case was the theoretical case,\u201d he said. \u201cI was all for high-deductible plans before I wrote my paper.\u201dDr. Peter B. Bach, an oncologist and the director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said he had seen patients discontinue lifesaving treatments when the year ran out, because they could not afford another big deductible. He argued that the problem with deductibles was that few people really can control whether or when they will be struck by an illness that requires expensive treatment. \u201cThere\u2019s essentially nothing they can do to prevent the likelihood they\u2019ll have high-cost health events,\u201d he said.But, even if deductibles have their downsides, it seems clear they have helped make insurance more affordable. Without them, far fewer Americans would be able to pay for health insurance at all.Some health economists say the solution to the problem may be smarter but more complicated forms of health insurance that provide patients with important care free, but charge them for treatments with fewer proven benefits. Mr. Chernew, for one, argues that ordinary deductibles are too \u201cblunt\u201d an instrument, but smarter insurance plans could harness economic incentives to reduce wasteful health spending without discouraging needed care. If such plans held down costs as well as deductibles, they could keep insurance affordable without as many risks. The theory behind such plans is compelling, but given how bad people are at shopping for health care, more empirical evidence is needed to know how well it works in practice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bernie Sanders and the Danish Example", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byLettersWhy many millennials are attracted to Bernie Sanders and European social democracy.David Brooks is aghast at Bernie Sanders\u2019s rise. Mr. Brooks fears that young Americans are forsaking the virtues of economic dynamism in their desire for greater economic security. He suggests that this is not the American way. But he doesn\u2019t grapple with why so many Americans have soured on our economic order.Too many American cities \u2014 indeed whole regions \u2014 have been devastated by mass job losses. More thriving metropolitan areas are increasingly unaffordable places to live. Real suffering accompanies our galloping inequality: Note the shocking uptick in drug- and despair-induced mortality among middle-age white Americans.Mr. Brooks wants to protect the conditions that nurture \u201cdisruptive dynamos\u201d like Walmart and Google. But as globalization and new technologies disrupt our economy, we need government to ensure that the gains aren\u2019t all going straight to the top, with American workers left behind paying the price.One need not be a Sanders-style democratic socialist to be nostalgic for the higher top marginal tax rates, more modest college costs and the broader union membership not of Denmark but of Eisenhower-era America. DANIEL TREIMANBrooklynThe writer is a student at New York University School of Law.To the Editor: David Brooks wonders why millennials are tired of American capitalism and finds it amazing that they want to \u201cmimic a continent that has been sluggish for decades\u201d and \u201cwant a country that would be a lot less vibrant.\u201dPerhaps they know that Denmark has consistently been among the countries with the highest scores on national happiness; it has the lowest corruption grade in the world, free vocational and university education, low unemployment and universal health care. Its companies actually pay taxes, and young people have no educational debt and find employment after school.How amazing that Mr. Brooks thinks that we are a vibrant, future-looking country when we cannot solve even the most basic problems. ALAN KRAUSNew Paltz, N.Y.To the Editor: It is clear to me that fear, anger and anxiety are causing so many young adults to long for Northern European stability. The simple truth is that salaries have not kept pace with the cost of living, and many young adults see their parents and others struggling.How is it that so many people work full time (both adults in a family!) and still qualify for food stamps or Medicaid? How ridiculous is it to think about saving for retirement when one can barely put food on the table?These young adults see no future for themselves. Of course they are longing for stability. It guarantees a roof over their heads, food on the table, and education in case economic conditions become more favorable.Perhaps if enough power and money were threatened to be taken from the 1 percent by democratic socialists, they might become frightened enough to actually trickle down some well-paying jobs. ADRIENNE L. RAINER FRIEDESEast Hampton, N.Y.To the Editor: Is it really amazing that so many young people \u201cwant to mimic a continent that has been sluggish for decades\u201d and \u201cwant a country that would be a lot less vibrant\u201d? David Brooks should climb out of the bubble.Most young people I know are hindered from enjoying American vibrancy because they\u2019re a bit busy with their $9-an-hour jobs, trying to pay off their $50,000 student loan debt while hoping that they don\u2019t get sick or injured because they have no health insurance.Future American vibrancy depends on eager and educated economic participants; we cannot create them when we cling to an outdated social model that builds barriers to success.LISA CALEFPortland, Ore.To the Editor: David Brooks\u2019s column evokes the most fundamental question facing us in the election: What is the purpose of government? He lists the ways in which Senator Bernie Sanders proposes to push American economics and politics in the direction of European \u201csocial democracy\u201d and sees disadvantages to the United States in every one. He is surprised that \u201cso many look to the future and want a country that would be a lot less vibrant.\u201dIs \u201cvibrancy\u201d the overriding goal of government, regardless of the social milieu that it fosters? Are we to measure the success of our administration by the number of multibillionaires it produces, the vast size of our armed forces or the number of Nobel Prize winners, when the great majority lack access to quality education, guaranteed medical care, unchallenged voting rights and a fair, nonpolitical legal system; when scientific findings vital to mankind\u2019s future are ignored and the country\u2019s infrastructure at every level is in decay?Vibrancy is fine if your family can see you through Harvard or Stanford or, these days, even a state college. Otherwise, you are most likely to be a bystander to that exhilarating vibrancy.RAYMOND B. CLAYTONStanford, Calif.To the Editor: David Brooks\u2019s column struck me as particularly tone-deaf to the realities of being a young person in America today. If he had considered that even the most well-educated millennials have come of age by entering a dismal job market of stagnating real wages with an average of more than $30,000 in student loans,then maybe Mr. Brooks wouldn\u2019t find it so \u201camazing\u201d that we young Americans look with envy to a continent of free college and a strong safety net. JACKIE GONZALESAlbanyTo the Editor: David Brooks\u2019s column is based on the faulty premise that American innovation is driven principally by the desire to make money, and that without free-rein capitalism, there would be no motivation to invent the next iPod.I believe that most Americans are driven to innovate by the restless, imaginative energy that is part of our country\u2019s daring fabric, and that Thomas Edison or Bill Gates would have invented what they did even if the United States had a high tax rate, free medical care, clean, cheap transportation and minimal poverty.I cannot imagine Alexander Graham Bell saying to his assistant: \u201cWatson, don\u2019t come in here.

{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.TODD: Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.MADDOW: We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.TODD: And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.MADDOW: And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions \u2014 show us the differences between them. That\u2019s the whole reason that we\u2019re here tonight.We\u2019re not here for talking points. We\u2019re to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that, let\u2019s get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we\u2019ll be addressing tonight.The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.MADDOW: And with that, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we\u2019re going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Rachel, thank you very much.Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they\u2019re giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. They\u2019re worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. That\u2019s what American democracy is about.TODD: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind. CLINTON: Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But there\u2019s also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where people\u2019s wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.I\u2019m fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I\u2019m not making promises that I cannot keep.TODD: All right.Let\u2019s get started.Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.\u201d So please tell us why you think if he\u2019s elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. I\u2019ve been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we\u2019re now on the path to achieving it. I don\u2019t want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.I want to build on the progress we\u2019ve made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I don\u2019t want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college, but I don\u2019t believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump\u2019s kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. It\u2019s not just enough about what we\u2019re against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just don\u2019t add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. That\u2019s why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Let\u2019s go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. That\u2019s what I intend to do.TODD: Thank you, Secretary.Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven\u2019t gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president you\u2019ll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?SANDERS: Well, I haven\u2019t quite run for president before.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Let\u2019s deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes there\u2019s a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether it\u2019s the U.K., whether it\u2019s France, whether it\u2019s Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can\u2019t do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can\u2019t stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? It\u2019s an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Street\u2019s time to help the middle class.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just follow up on that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Let\u2019s make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me...TODD: Go.SANDERS: ... this is a good discussion here.TODD: Yes, go ahead.SANDERS: And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we\u2019re waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here \u2014 I helped write that bill \u2014 but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, thank you both. Rachel. MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you\u2019re too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party\u2019s standard bearer.Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?CLINTON: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But I\u2019ve heard Senator Sanders comments, and it\u2019s really caused me to wonder who\u2019s left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if we\u2019re going to get into labels, I don\u2019t think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.(APPLAUSE)I don\u2019t think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I don\u2019t think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy\u2019s immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we\u2019ve done and what we will do. That\u2019s why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. That\u2019s what I\u2019m offering and that\u2019s what I will do as president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?SANDERS: No, not at all. Here\u2019s the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people\u2019s needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution \u2014 contributors. SANDERS: Now all of the ideas that I\u2019m talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.MADDOW: Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)TODD: I\u2019d like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can\u2019t be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can\u2019t be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?SANDERS: Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I\u2019m a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.That\u2019s where this came from. It wasn\u2019t me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you can\u2019t be a moderate, you can\u2019t a progressive.In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The world\u2019s financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. That\u2019s the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.CLINTON: Well, Chuck...TODD: ... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...CLINTON: ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I\u2019m a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn\u2019t change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children\u2019s Defense Fund.It certainly didn\u2019t stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare \u2014 I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren\u2019t successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children\u2019s health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.So, again...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... I think it\u2019s important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, that\u2019s what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let\u2019s not be \u2014 in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I\u2019ve always stood.It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don\u2019t know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And, that\u2019s what we ought to be celebrating. Let\u2019s talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: (inaudible) 30 seconds, and then we\u2019ll move.SANDERS: That\u2019s right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let\u2019s talk about...CLINTON: ... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...SANDERS: ... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who\u2019s not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?SANDERS: Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn\u2019t accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: It is true, it\u2019s not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.But on the other hand, I have \u2014 when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I\u2019m very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn\u2019t exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I\u2019m very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think it\u2019s because they\u2019ve worked with me, they\u2019ve seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And that\u2019s exactly what I will do.We\u2019ll get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, we\u2019re going to make progress together when I\u2019m president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. She\u2019s implying that that says something about the people who know you best.SANDERS: Well, I don\u2019t see it quite like that.MADDOW: How do you see it?SANDERS: I am \u2014 will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. That\u2019s a fact. I don\u2019t deny it.But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.MADDOW: Secretary.CLINTON: Well, look, I\u2019ve got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And I\u2019ve got to tell you that it is... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is really quite amusing to me.People support me because they know me. They know my life\u2019s work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I am not going to make promises I can\u2019t keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.CLINTON: A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.I\u2019m not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don\u2019t want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you\u2019ll have 30 seconds to respond to that.SANDERS: What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one\u2019s life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.CLINTON: Yeah, but I \u2014 I think it\u2019s fair to really ask what\u2019s behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. I\u2019ve tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to \u2014 you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really don\u2019t think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If you\u2019ve got something to say, say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.SANDERS: What...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I\u2019m very proud of that.SANDERS: ... you know...CLINTON: So I think it\u2019s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...SANDERS: (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... in recent weeks, and let\u2019s talk...(BOOING)... let\u2019s talk about about the issues. Let\u2019s talk about the issues that divide us.SANDERS: Let\u2019s talk about \u2014 OK, let\u2019s talk...CLINTON: And let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s...SANDERS: ... let us talk about issues.CLINTON: ... we both agree with campaign finance reform.SANDERS: Let\u2019s talk about issues.CLINTON: I \u2014 I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.SANDERS: Let\u2019s...CLINTON: I want to reverse Citizens United.SANDERS: ... let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s talk about issues.CLINTON: And so \u2014 let\u2019s talk about issues.SANDERS: Let\u2019s talk \u2014 let\u2019s talk about issues, all right? Let\u2019s talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided \u2014 spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.(LAUGHTER)Let\u2019s ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there\u2019s nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Let\u2019s talk about climate change.Do you think there\u2019s a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am not \u2014 I like...(APPLAUSE)... there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.CLINTON: Well, you know, Senator, I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: ... Secretary, we\u2019re gonna...CLINTON: ... I don\u2019t think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.And I\u2019m proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance. CLINTON: Today, you\u2019ve got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. I\u2019m going to stop this game.But while we\u2019re talking about votes, you\u2019re the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and I\u2019m certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What we\u2019ve got to do as Democrats \u2014 what we\u2019ve got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.That\u2019s what this election should be about.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thirty seconds.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan \u2014 about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is \u2014 was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.TODD: Thank you both.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we\u2019ve touched a nerve. We\u2019re going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this. Stay with us.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, welcome back. Let\u2019s get right to it.Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is \u2014 it is in place to run for president. Why aren\u2019t you walking the walk on that?Why aren\u2019t you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?SANDERS: Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t work.Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the secretary would agree \u2014 is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.TODD: Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got \u2014 and all this when it is \u2014 you know, that\u2019s the system? I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing \u2014 public financing system...SANDERS: But if the...TODD: ... and being able to set \u2014 being able to set an example.SANDERS: \u2014 but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So what\u2019s the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don\u2019t represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn\u2019t want it.So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think that\u2019s pretty good.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...CLINTON: On the issue of Wall Street.MADDOW: ... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that\u2019s what they offered.Have you been too dismissive of voters\u2019 concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?CLINTON: Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did \u2014 when I left the secretary of State\u2019s office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying you\u2019re going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.So I do want people to know that, and I think it\u2019s important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street. What about her defense of her record? SANDERS: Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And that\u2019s why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And it\u2019s been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.I have great respect for Senator Sanders\u2019s commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact, I don\u2019t believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And I\u2019ve said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.So let\u2019s not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I would say that \u2014 that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it\u2019s Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were \u2014 significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Look we have a law \u2014 look, you know, I \u2014 I appreciate the senator\u2019s advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he\u2019s a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it. And from what you say, I know you will as well.But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me \u2014 the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys \u2014 is because I\u2019ve got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.You know, we can\u2019t just fight the last war. We\u2019ve got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: ... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.SANDERS: Well, we\u2019ve had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And here\u2019s where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.SANDERS: That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they\u2019re ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. That\u2019s it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.TODD: Thank you both. Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s addressed to you, and it\u2019s about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs. This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.\u201cI am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money,\u201d and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, \u201cDon\u2019t you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?\u201dBut, let\u2019s make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure, would you release all of them?CLINTON: I will look into it. I don\u2019t know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and \u2014 we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people\u2019s health. Now, if all we\u2019re going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we\u2019re missing the big oil companies. We\u2019re missing other big energy companies. We\u2019re missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.TODD: Senator, you sound like you want to respond. Go ahead.SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. That\u2019s a fact.And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. It\u2019s fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don\u2019t start breaking them up, we\u2019re going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...CLINTON: ... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen. I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think it\u2019s a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they\u2019ve beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I\u2019ve been in the arena with them time and time again.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart. But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you\u2019ve approached them in this campaign?SANDERS: Of course I can work with them, but let\u2019s be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they\u2019re paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.We\u2019re going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that\u2019s what I will do.I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you.And with that, we\u2019re going to take a break.TODD: We\u2019ll be right back. And we\u2019re going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back \u2014 welcome back to the Democratic candidates\u2019 debate. We\u2019re going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.And Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re going to start with you. There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS. It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America\u2019s military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that\u2019s fighting ISIS right now?CLINTON: Well, I think what the president understands, and what he\u2019s trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.I agree with the president. I\u2019ve said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq \u2014 that is off the table.But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they\u2019re doing the fighting. We\u2019re doing the support and enabling.And I also think we\u2019ve got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep \u2014 try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. MADDOW: To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you\u2019re describing requires considerably more of Americans \u2014 an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?CLINTON: No. I mean, of course that\u2019s a theoretical question, and we don\u2019t know what it would be for, and we don\u2019t know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think we\u2019re making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and that\u2019s exactly what the president is doing.MADDOW: Thank you, Madam Secretary.TODD: Go ahead, Senator Sanders \u2014 30 seconds, your response.SANDERS: OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.TODD: All right. Senator, I want to stay, though...CLINTON: If I could \u2014 if I could...TODD: Go ahead. 30 seconds.CLINTON: ... respectfully add \u2014 look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now...(APPLAUSE)... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.TODD: Let me \u2014 let \u2014 we\u2019re gonna \u2014 we\u2019re staying \u2014 we\u2019re staying basically on this topic. Obviously you\u2019ve been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?SANDERS: Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen.I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen \u2014 and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head. SANDERS: And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers \u2014 U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re taking on those terrible Americans.\u201dThe combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.TODD: Can you address a question on Afghanistan?(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: How long are these troops going to be there? If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think they\u2019re going to be there?SANDERS: Well, you can\u2019t simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.Hopefully, and you know, one can\u2019t predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.TODD: Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan? We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.CLINTON: Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top \u2014 his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because it\u2019s not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.So, we\u2019ve got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.TODD: You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are. You haven\u2019t given a major foreign policy speech. And it doesn\u2019t sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you\u2019re asked about it, and you say you\u2019re going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet. Why?SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn\u2019t get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders\u2019s views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can\u2019t stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.CLINTON: So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.TODD: All right, Senator, 30 seconds.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience \u2014 hat is not arguable \u2014 in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn\u2019t.In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other. That\u2019s no great secret. But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.CLINTON: Well, let me just add that, you know, I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019m very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.Because I know from my own experience that you\u2019ve got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I\u2019ll get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.SANDERS: Well...MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, at the \u2014 at the last Democratic debate in Charleston \u2014 I want to get specific here \u2014 Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Your campaign has criticized him for saying that. Now that he\u2019s standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn\u2019t try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.I\u2019m very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. I\u2019m prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesn\u2019t think we should. I certainly don\u2019t think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.SANDERS: Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.And you\u2019re right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. They\u2019re Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.So please don\u2019t suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don\u2019t. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary \u2014 and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know \u2014 let me correct the record.(CROSSTALK)TODD: 30 seconds, madam secretary.CLINTON: As I \u2014 as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And you\u2019re right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.SANDERS: OK.CLINTON: Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants. Of course you\u2019ve got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don\u2019t just rush in, open the door, and say, \u201cHere I am. Let\u2019s talk and make a deal.\u201dThat\u2019s not the way it works.SANDERS: I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But, of course it doesn\u2019t do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...CLINTON: ... Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. That\u2019s exactly the right...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... And, that\u2019s what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.TODD: Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, you\u2019ve got to prioritize potential threats to the United States. Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia. How would you rank them in order of their threat to America\u2019s security right now...SANDERS: ... ISIS...TODD: ... Starting with the biggest threat.SANDERS: ISIS, you forgot one...TODD: ... I didn\u2019t say that...SANDERS: ... No, no...TODD: ... No...SANDERS: ... ISIS would be ...TODD: ... We already had that. I\u2019m talking about these three countries. How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.SANDERS: Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And, who had nuclear weapons.And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.TODD: Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat. Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that. Do you agree with his decisions...The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.SANDERS: ... No, I don\u2019t. I worry very, very much about an isolated country. That\u2019s what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively.TODD: Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. He\u2019s basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.CLINTON: I haven\u2019t talked to Secretary Carter, but here\u2019s what I would think he\u2019s planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that\u2019s an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they\u2019re working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia\u2019s putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I\u2019m glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. We\u2019ve got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they\u2019re actually contributing more to their own defense.TODD: Thank you both, Rachel?MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home. There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A. It\u2019s a newly popular idea in conservative politics.How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? What\u2019s your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I\u2019m absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what\u2019s wrong with the V.A.There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.But you\u2019re absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. They\u2019ve actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.I will fight that as hard as I can. I think there\u2019s where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let\u2019s fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you\u2019ve worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight, the way she\u2019s talking about this issue?SANDERS: Let me agree. You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired \u2014 I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs. And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. That\u2019s what I did.And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn\u2019t get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.The last point that I\u2019d make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. We\u2019ve got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re going to take another break. We\u2019ll be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: And we are back. We\u2019re gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses \u2014 narrowest of margins. Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, \u201cwhat happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit.\u201dSenator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa? And do you \u2014 or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?SANDERS: Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let\u2019s not blow this out of proportion. This is not a \u2014 this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.I think where we now stand \u2014 correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates. We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.(LAUGHTER)You know, so this is not \u2014 this is not the biggest deal in the world. We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.What the Des Moines Register said \u2014 you know, there were coin \u2014 I think there were half a dozen coin flips \u2014 a fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day, no matter how it\u2019s recounted, it will break roughly even.And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See, and I don\u2019t have to say it, because they voted already.(LAUGHTER)And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven\u2019t voted, but...(APPLAUSE)... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.TODD: Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if that\u2019s what the party wants to do? You good with that?CLINTON: Whatever they decide to do, that\u2019s fine.TODD: That\u2019s fair enough. OK.CLINTON: All right.TODD: Good, we move on. We\u2019re happy with that. We have more questions.MADDOW: Senator \u2014 Senator Sanders, in 1964...SANDERS: Oh (inaudible).(LAUGHTER)See, when you are old, then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got?MADDOW: In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement. He was, however, far to the right of most of that party. In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party\u2019s mainstream.Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election. Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election. And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now. We know that. But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you\u2019re running right now to try to get the nomination?SANDERS: Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw \u2014 there may have been a new one \u2014 last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But here\u2019s why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors\u2019 chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House. With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?CLINTON: I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.(APPLAUSE)And I say that with great \u2014 with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and we\u2019ll work together.But what I\u2019m concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. I\u2019ve been vetted. There\u2019s hardly anything you don\u2019t know about me. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think I\u2019m the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, it\u2019s not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m prepared to...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: We\u2019ll stay on this issue. We\u2019ll stay on this topic.TODD: Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders\u2019 ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they\u2019re worried about the emails issue, not because they don\u2019t believe your explanation, but because it\u2019s a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.They see your numbers right now and they think it\u2019s the email issue as to why you\u2019re not polling very well. So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn\u2019t going to blow up your candidacy if you\u2019re the nominee?CLINTON: Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didn\u2019t get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice\u2019s aide they\u2019ve been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know it\u2019s an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open \u2014 there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material. Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?CLINTON: I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if there\u2019s going to be a security review about me, there\u2019s going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we\u2019ve got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.Honest to goodness, this is \u2014 this just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of what\u2019s really going on here, and I hope that will happen.TODD: Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn\u2019t give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible).SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE)TODD: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m trying to \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a family hour still right now. After 11:00, I\u2019ll say it the other way. And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she\u2019s getting slapped with the email controversy.Are you \u2014 how are you feeling about these darn emails now?SANDERS: I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. There\u2019s a process under way. I will not politicize it.TODD: OK. Senator Sanders, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And by the way \u2014 and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn\u2019t know that there\u2019s not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign. You apologized for that when the incident was made public.Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece. Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?SANDERS: Not losing control of our campaign. You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.MADDOW: Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.SANDERS: But that was only for \u2014 that was not to be on television. That\u2019s an important point. That was just something \u2014 as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue? CLINTON: No.MADDOW: And with that, we will (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates\u2019 debate.Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer. It\u2019s a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide. Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?CLINTON: Yes, I do. And \u2014 you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton\u2019s support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...SANDERS: ... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are \u2014 all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes. It\u2019s hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. That\u2019s number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there. But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don\u2019t believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So, when somebody commits...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key. They\u2019re never going to get out. But, I just don\u2019t\u2019 want to see government be part of killing. That\u2019s all. (APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan. On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it. You have both been outspoken on that.The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it. There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today. Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today. If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayor\u2019s invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child\u2019s life. I know from the work that I\u2019ve done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan won\u2019t do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing? President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?SANDERS: Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.SANDERS: You know, I don\u2019t go around asking for governor\u2019s resignations every day. In fact, I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... was so outrageous.What we are talking about are children being poisoned. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. We don\u2019t know, no one knows for sure because they haven\u2019t done the appropriate studies, but there\u2019s no question that kids\u2019 intellectual development may have been impacted. We don\u2019t know how many thousands.The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.And of course the federal government says, you\u2019re not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Flint, Michigan, is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.MADDOW: Senator, thank you.TODD: Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade. In the \u201990s you supported NAFTA. But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008. As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then \u2014 which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.If elected, should Democrats expect that once you\u2019re in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?CLINTON: You know, Chuck, I\u2019ve only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. That\u2019s the way the global economy works.But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So it\u2019s not just what\u2019s in the trade agreement that I\u2019m interested in.I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.TODD: Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you\u2019ve been in Congress.SANDERS: Absolutely right.TODD: But if you do that as president...(APPLAUSE)TODD: If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?SANDERS: Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.I was not only in opposition to NAFTA \u2014 and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood \u2014 I don\u2019t think this is really rocket science.We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didn\u2019t believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it\u2019s to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.I don\u2019t want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I don\u2019t want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.SANDERS: So, do I believe in trade? Of course, I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, \u201cHey, you don\u2019t want to take a cut in pay? We\u2019re going to China.\u201dWorkers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Thank you both.We\u2019re going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we\u2019ll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing. We\u2019ll be right back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Welcome back here in the final minutes.MADDOW: The home stretch.TODD: The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question. Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half. You\u2019re going to have to make choices. And there\u2019s a lot of heavy lifts. And he made choices. He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform. Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn\u2019t.TODD: So there are three big lifts that you\u2019ve talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change. What do you do first? Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.CLINTON: Well, I \u2014 I don\u2019t accept that premise, Chuck. I think that we\u2019ve got so much business we have to do. We\u2019ve talked a lot tonight about what we\u2019re against \u2014 we\u2019re against income inequality. We\u2019re against the abuses of powerful interests. We\u2019re against a lot of things.I\u2019m for a lot of things. I don\u2019t want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening. And I believe, if I\u2019m so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.(APPLAUSE)I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.(APPLAUSE)Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we\u2019re not creating and growing small businesses. I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces \u2014 because that\u2019s the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure \u2014 we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.TODD: All right, but Senator Sanders...(APPLAUSE)... you\u2019ve still got to do something first. As you know, history said \u2014 shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.SANDERS: No, let...TODD: Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.SANDERS: ... I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that.(APPLAUSE)But you miss \u2014 when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important. And that is you\u2019re not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.(APPLAUSE)So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine, if I\u2019m elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.(APPLAUSE)Second point \u2014 second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country \u2014 largely African-American and Latino \u2014 the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.No, you just can\u2019t negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, \u201cMitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.\u201dAnd as president, that\u2019s what I will work hard on.(APPLAUSE)TODD: OK. Thank you.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government \u2014 which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president. The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops \u2014 is \u2014 is there a department of government that you would get rid of? Or is there a whole new one that you would create?CLINTON: The answer to both of those is no. I\u2019m interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn\u2019t work, and be absolutely clear we\u2019re getting rid of what doesn\u2019t work.I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better \u2014 better than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what it\u2019s going to take to make our government work more efficiently.And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it\u2019s not appropriate to say \u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of this, get rid of that\u201d until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do. CLINTON: But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it\u2019s the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get done, here\u2019s why I need your help, here\u2019s why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn\u2019t something you care about, but I\u2019m telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows \u2014MADDOW: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: \u2014 it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that you\u2019ve got people with you every step of the way. That\u2019s what I want to do.MADDOW: Thank you very much. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019ve made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see \u2014CLINTON: I never said that.TODD: But do you see \u2014 do you see a vice president?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Look \u2014TODD: Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m certainly going to unite the party, but I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If I\u2019m so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Senator, would you consider the secretary?SANDERS: I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldn\u2019t be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it\u2019s mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.(CROSSTALK)TODD: Secretary Clinton, closing statements. You are first.CLINTON: Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I\u2019m asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.You know, we didn\u2019t get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities. Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders\u2019 supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we\u2019ve got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I \u2014 my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didn\u2019t have any money, couldn\u2019t speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money. But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people, that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.I\u2019m running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Well, there you have it. I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just don\u2019t have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I don\u2019t think so.Our debate coverage \u2014 (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.MADDOW: We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire. You guys get to vote in just five days. I can\u2019t wait to see how it turns out. Don\u2019t screw up.TODD: We\u2019ll see you in a few minutes. Thank you.MADDOW: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Plans Visit to Cuba, as Talks on Expanding Trade Begin", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will travel to Cuba within weeks, a senior administration official said on Wednesday, making a historic visit as part of an effort to end more than a half-century of estrangement and forge normalized relations with a Cold War adversary.The administration will announce the trip \u2014 the first by a sitting president in 88 years, when Calvin Coolidge visited \u2014 on Thursday as top Commerce, Treasury and State Department officials are meeting privately with their Cuban counterparts in Washington for talks aimed at expanding business ties between the two nations.Opening the discussions on Wednesday, Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, called on the government of Cuba to open its economy to American business and investment, saying the Cubans must do more to help facilitate commerce after the thaw between the two nations.Ms. Pritzker said her department had acted aggressively since Mr. Obama\u2019s December 2014 announcement to pave the way for American companies to do business in Cuba, granting 490 authorizations amounting to $4.3 billion last year alone \u2014 a roughly 30 percent increase over the previous year.\u201cBut we need help from the Cuban side,\u201d Ms. Pritzker said. \u201cThe U.S. companies that are attempting to do business in your country continue to face challenges.\u201dShe added: \u201cWithout specific changes on your side that allow the private sector to engage, our changes will not unlock the opportunities for the Cuban people that both of us want to see.\u201dTha talks, which began in a wood-paneled library at the Commerce Department within view of the White House, represent the latest effort by the Obama administration to push forward with the policy shift the president set in motion just over a year ago. But the process is vastly complicated by the American statutory trade and commercial embargo that has been in place for decades and that only Congress can lift.While the Commerce and Treasury Departments have moved several times to loosen restrictions on travel and trade, Rodrigo Malmierca, the foreign trade and investment minister of Cuba, said the onus was on the United States to remove the embargo, and on Mr. Obama to essentially defang the laws that compose it in the meantime.\u201cThese measures have been positive and are in the right direction, but still they are not sufficient in terms of the lifting of the main obstacle that we still confront that is the blockade,\u201d Mr. Malmierca, who was seated opposite Ms. Pritzker as the talks began, said in Spanish through a translator. \u201cWe are aware of the fact that the blockade can only be fully lifted with the actions in Congress,\u201d he added, but, \u201cwe know that the executive has prerogatives which can be used in terms of the dismantling, trying to void the blockade.\u201dAmerican carriers can begin applying to the Department of Transportation to offer the service \u2014 up to 20 scheduled flights a day to Havana and 10 to each of nine other international airports in Cuba. The pact aims to substantially increase travel between the two countries, which are currently served by only about a dozen charter flights a day.But even as Mr. Obama makes progress in his drive to forge closer commercial ties with Cuba, the process is hamstrung by sanctions that have left American businesses wondering what they are permitted to do. Mr. Malmierca said on Tuesday that he had heard from many American companies that want to establish businesses in Cuba but are ensnared in regulatory limbo, awaiting special licenses from the United States government.\u201cThe problem that we face today is that many companies want to do business, but we need to create the conditions for them to access the Cuban market,\u201d Mr. Malmierca said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.He repeatedly said that Cuba welcomed American investment and would not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against United States companies. \u201cLifting the blockade is essential to advancing this,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, Mr. Malmierca called on Mr. Obama to do more unilaterally, including allowing the dollar to be used in transactions with Cuba. On Tuesday, he said the president should lift the ban against imports of top Cuban products like rum and cigars and end the prohibition against direct investment in Cuba.Critics argue that with each move to foster better relations and American investment, the president is rewarding a dictatorial government that infringes on human rights and squelches democratic discourse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigeria\u2019s Booming Film Industry Redefines African Life", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byThis was the seventh \u2014 and last \u2014 day of shooting in a village near here for \u201cBeyond the Dance,\u201d Mr. Ugezu\u2019s story of an African prince\u2019s choice of a bride, and the production had been conducted at a breakneck pace.\u201cIn Nollywood, you don\u2019t waste time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the technical depth that has made our films so popular. It\u2019s because of the story. We tell African stories.\u201d\u201cThe Nigerian movies are very, very popular in Tanzania, and, culturally, they\u2019ve affected a lot of people,\u201d said Songa wa Songa, a Tanzanian journalist. \u201cA lot of people now speak with a Nigerian accent here very well thanks to Nollywood. Nigerians have succeeded through Nollywood to export who they are, their culture, their lifestyle, everything.\u201dNollywood generates about 2,500 movies a year, making it the second-biggest producer after Bollywood in India, and its films have displaced American, Indian and Chinese ones on the televisions that are ubiquitous in bars, hair salons, airport lounges and homes across Africa.The industry employs a million people \u2014 second only to farming \u2014 in Nigeria, pumping $600 million annually into the national economy, according to a 2014 report by the United States International Trade Commission. In 2002, it made 400 movies and $45 million.Nollywood resonates across Africa with its stories of a precolonial past and of a present caught between village life and urban modernity. The movies explore the tensions between the individual and extended families, between the draw of urban life and the pull of the village, between Christianity and traditional beliefs. For countless people, in a place long shaped by outsiders, Nollywood is redefining the African experience.\u201cI doubt that a white person, a European or American, can appreciate Nollywood movies the way an African can,\u201d said Katsuva Ngoloma, a linguist at the University of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo who has written about Nollywood\u2019s significance. \u201cBut Africans \u2014 the rich, the poor, everyone \u2014 will see themselves in those movies in one way or another.\u201dIn Yeoville, a neighborhood in Johannesburg that is a melting pot for migrants, a seamstress from Ghana took orders one recent morning for the latest fashions seen in Nollywood movies. Hairstylists from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, working in salons or on the street, offered hair weaves following the styles favored by Nollywood actresses.\u201cNigerian movies express how we live as Africans, what we experience in our everyday lives, things like witchcraft, things like fighting between mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws,\u201d said Patience Moyo, 34, a Zimbabwean hair-braider. \u201cWhen you watch the movies, you feel it is really happening. One way or another, it will touch your life somewhere.\u201dThe name stuck \u2014 and spread. But success hasn\u2019t robbed Nollywood of its freewheeling ways: During my recent visit to a Nigerian village where a half-dozen movies were being shot, a producer came over and, on the spot, offered me the role of an evil white man who brings a vampire to Nigeria.Back in 2002, the movies were simply known as Nigeria\u2019s home videos. They were popularized at first through video cassettes traded across Africa, but now Nollywood is available on satellite and cable television channels, as well as on streaming services like iRokoTV. In 2012, in response to swelling popularity in Francophone Africa, a satellite channel called Nollywood TV began offering round-the-clock movies dubbed into French. Most Nollywood movies are in English, though some are in one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic languages.Until Nollywood\u2019s ascendance, movies made in Francophone Africa \u2014 with grants from the French government \u2014 dominated filmmaking on the continent. But these movies catered to the sensibilities of Western critics and viewers, and won few fans in Africa, leaving no cultural footprint.In Nollywood, though, movies are still financed by private investors expecting a profit.\u201cYou want to do a movie? You have the script? You look immediately for the money and you shoot,\u201d said Mahmood Ali-Balogun, a leading Nigerian filmmaker. \u201cWhen you get a grant from France or the E.U., they can dictate to you where to put your camera, the fine-tuning of your script. It\u2019s not a good model for us in Africa.\u201dMr. Ali-Balogun was speaking from his office in Surulere, Lagos, the birthplace of Nollywood. Film production has since moved to other cities, especially Asaba, an otherwise sleepy state capital in southeastern Nigeria. On any given day, a dozen crews can be found here \u2014 \u201cepic\u201d films with ancient story lines like \u201cBeyond the Dance\u201d are in the works in nearby villages, while \u201cglamour\u201d movies about modern life make the city itself their sets.Most films have budgets of about $25,000 and are shot in a week.Once completed in Asaba, the movies find their way to every corner of Africa, released in the original English, dubbed into French or African languages, and sometimes readapted, repackaged and often pirated for local audiences. Many movies are also propelled by a symbiotic relationship with Nigeria\u2019s Pentecostal Christianity, which pastors have exported throughout Africa.In the Democratic Republic of Congo, pastors who visited Nigeria years ago returned with videocassettes and showed the films in church to teach Christian lessons and attract new members, said Katrien Pype, a Belgian anthropologist at the University of Leuven who has written about the phenomenon.Today in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, Nollywood permeates mainstream culture. Local women copy the fashion, makeup and hairstyles of the actresses; local musicians grumble at the popularity of Nigerian imports, like Don Jazzy and the P-Square twins.Nollywood has also created a model for movie production in other African nations, said Matthias Krings, a German expert on African popular culture at Johannes Gutenberg University.In Kitwe, Zambia, local filmmakers were recently making their latest movie in true Nollywood style: a family melodrama shot over 10 days, in a private home, on a $7,000 budget. Burned onto DVD, the movie will be sold in Zambia and neighboring countries.Acknowledging the influence of Nigerian cinema, the movie\u2019s producer, Morgan Mbulo, 36, said, \u201cWe can tell our own stories now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Is Calm, Cool and Effective", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisFacing off against Senator Bernie Sanders on Thursday night, Hillary Clinton did not comport herself like someone who had just suffered a landslide loss in New Hampshire. She did not raise her voice or express anger. She did not demonize Mr. Sanders or suggest he would be a dangerous choice for Democrats. She remained calm as he pungently sought to highlight their differences.Instead, she behaved like someone heading into Nevada and South Carolina with every reason to be confident and little to fear but her own missteps.A week after loudly confronting Mr. Sanders in a debate for perpetrating what she called a \u201cvery artful smear\u201d against her, Mrs. Clinton took a far more strategic approach. She sought to portray her political approach as different from that of Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, but her tone was firm but not panicked. For much of the night, a viewer could have been forgiven for thinking that it was Mr. Sanders who was grappling with the way forward after being handed a 22-point loss two nights earlier \u2014 and Mrs. Clinton who was riding high.A generation gap is emerging over the importance of electing a woman to the White House. We invite you to share your opinion. The Times may follow up with you.He was often the aggressor, criticizing Mrs. Clinton over trade, immigration, Social Security, her views on regime change, and even her ties to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.Perhaps anticipating that Mrs. Clinton would focus her campaign on energizing women and minorities, Mr. Sanders, who has emphasized what he calls the \u201crigged economy,\u201d came well prepared to discuss issues important to those constituencies.Her new goal, it seemed clear from her opening and closing statements, was to reframe Mr. Sanders, and do it in a tight and uncomfortable box: as a candidate fixated on one issue, economic inequality, who has little to say about other important issues. But when the debate turned to precisely those issues, and Mr. Sanders discussed his voting record on abortion rights and railed against \u201ca broken criminal justice system,\u201d Mrs. Clinton indirectly challenged him, highlighting her leadership on women\u2019s issues and her backing from major abortion rights groups.She did not even raise the issue of guns, on which Mr. Sanders is most vulnerable to attack from Mrs. Clinton on his left, until the debate\u2019s 65th minute.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.The harshest critiques she had for Mr. Sanders were delivered coolly. She portrayed him as neither forthright nor realistic about how much his ideals would cost, and as an interloper in the Democratic Party who did not deserve to carry on the unfinished agenda of President Obama.And she suggested that as often as he may point to his superior judgment in opposing the authorization of the use of force in Iraq in 2002, he was unprepared to deal with the wider global challenges the next president will face. \u201cI do not believe that a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016,\u201d she said succinctly.Instead of dismissing Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan for free college tuition as wrongheaded, she argued that it was unworkable.\u201cSenator Sanders\u2019s plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free,\u201d she said, invoking Wisconsin\u2019s conservative governor, who slashed $250 million from the University of Wisconsin system last year. \u201cI am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.\u201dIt was a striking recalibration, and made for a far different presence compared with the combative posture Mrs. Clinton struck at last week\u2019s debate and in the closing days in New Hampshire. And it may ultimately prove more effective.\u201cHillary Clinton took an entirely different tone tonight, and it played well,\u201d said Mr. Obama\u2019s former strategist, David Axelrod. \u201cGone were the harsh attacks and strident tone of last week and in their place was a measured, respectful approach toward Sanders, even in the scrums.\u201dIn a debate that dealt extensively with matters relating to race and gender \u2014 the very issues that Mrs. Clinton has indicated she would focus on as the campaign turns from Iowa and New Hampshire to the more diverse Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 she only glancingly critiqued Mr. Sanders.It was not until her closing statement that she said indirectly what her campaign had hinted was coming against Mr. Sanders. \u201cI am not a single-issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country,\u201d she said, citing the importance of addressing racism, sexism and gay rights.The most aggressive Mrs. Clinton got with Mr. Sanders was not over the issues she hopes will bolster her with such core Democratic constituencies as blacks, Hispanics, women, and gay men and lesbians. It was when she brought up the president whom these voters have twice played a crucial role in electing to the White House.Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Sanders had called President Obama \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdisappointing,\u201d and even argued that he deserved a primary challenger in 2012. \u201cThose kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling,\u201d she said.Ms. Albright said that there was \u201ca special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other,\u201d a line Mrs. Clinton was called upon to address from the debate stage.\u201cI\u2019m not asking people to support me because I\u2019m a woman,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019m asking people to support me because I think I\u2019m the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander in chief.\u201dvideovideoAdvertisement"}

In South Carolina, the Republican voters were overwhelmingly conservative \u2014 marking more than a 10-point increase from the last two primaries in the state. Seven in 10 Nevada Democratic caucusgoers described themselves as liberal \u2014 a 25-point jump from the last caucuses there in 2008.Mr. Trump\u2019s winning coalition included Republican primary voters who said they preferred a candidate who tells it as it is, those who described themselves as angry with the federal government and those who support a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. His supporters said that they were most worried about the economy and that they most wanted an outsider candidate who could bring about change.A striking three-quarters of primary voters supported Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States \u2014 about 10 points higher than Republican primary voters in New Hampshire.Surveys of Republican voters exiting voting locations throughout South Carolina on Saturday.Unlike in New Hampshire and Iowa, where domestic issues were most important to voters, terrorism was the top concern of voters in South Carolina. While Mr. Trump held voters\u2019 trust in handling the economy by a ratio of more than 2 to 1, he and Mr. Cruz were nearly equally viewed as the best equipped to handle an international crisis. Despite Mr. Cruz\u2019s experience as a former Supreme Court clerk to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, he and Mr. Trump were tied in voters\u2019 minds as the best candidate to handle nominations to the nation\u2019s highest court.Mr. Cruz was backed by the very conservative, and by those who prefer a candidate who shares their religious beliefs and their values, yet he lost among white evangelicals to Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio split the support of those who decided on a candidate in the last week.Mr. Rubio enjoyed support from the most educated voters, those who valued experience in politics and those who prioritized electability in November. He also drew support from those who would allow illegal immigrants to apply for legal status and those who opposed banning Muslims. The endorsement of Mr. Rubio earlier in the week by Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina had little effect on voters \u2014 only about one-quarter said it was important.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.On the Democratic side, the entrance poll in Nevada showed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strongest support came from her coalition of women, older voters, blacks, college graduates, political moderates, union households and those who have voted in previous caucuses. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strong showing among black voters (she was backed by three-quarters of African-Americans), bodes well as she heads to South Carolina, where blacks made up 55 percent of the 2008 Democratic primary electorate.Mrs. Clinton also won the support of caucusgoers who favored experience or the ability to win in November. She also performed best among those who preferred a continuation of President Obama\u2019s policies and those who rated the economy or health care as the most important issue facing the country.Mr. Sanders drew his support from men, Hispanics, liberals, first-time caucusgoers and young people. While his support among young voters continued to be strong in Nevada, only a little over one-third of participants in the caucuses were under the age of 45.Those who most valued honesty and trustworthiness, as well as those preferring a candidate who cares about people like them, sided with Mr. Sanders. He beat Mrs. Clinton by 2 to 1 among those who valued income inequality above all other issues.Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Union Divided by Multiple Crises", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byInside EuropeBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union needs an ambitious grand bargain at its next summit meeting to rescue itself from an accumulation of crises that threaten to blow apart its model of integration.Like children at a birthday party, each leader has to get a going-home present. And as with many children\u2019s parties, there may be a tantrum along the way.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is at risk at home from a backlash against a mass influx of Syrian refugees. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain is trying to win a referendum on staying in the European Union and cannot help her because of public hostility to immigration. Nor can President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who is struggling for re-election in a country transfixed by the threat from Islamist militants.Berlin, the Union\u2019s pivotal power, sees controlling migration as the central priority as it tries to cope with one million asylum seekers who have arrived in the last year.Ideally, the leaders need to forge a deal on Feb. 18 and 19 that encompasses effective action to strengthen Europe\u2019s external borders and share the refugee burden, and a mutually acceptable solution to Britain\u2019s demands to change its membership terms.A comprehensive package would also need to address Italy\u2019s political and economic frustrations with the Union, Greece\u2019s quest for substantial debt relief and Poland\u2019s wish to see NATO strengthen its military presence in Eastern Europe to deter Russia.\u201cThese deals are only possible when countries are in a state of symmetrical despair,\u201d said Laszlo Andor, a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles and a former European Commission member from Hungary.A package deal might yield a more integrated \u201ccore Europe,\u201d adding a European Union border police and coast guard and a common asylum policy, and a looser union for countries like Britain that opt to stay outside the 19-nation common-currency eurozone.A deal with London seems within reach, one that would formally exempt Britain from the European goal of \u201cever closer union,\u201d shield its financial sector from being regulated abusively by the eurozone, and let it withhold some benefits from new migrant workers if its social welfare system were under strain.The Union would cease to be a \u201ctwo-speed Europe,\u201d with all 28 members converging at different paces toward the same goal, and become a permanent two-tier or multitier construction, possibly with an outer circle of associates such as Turkey and Ukraine.While European leaders\u2019 despair may not be symmetrical, the refugee crisis is concentrating minds on a threat that could break the Union, fan populism and alienate British voters.Donald Tusk, the European Council president, has warned that the Union has only six to eight weeks left to save the Schengen zone of passport-free travel. That raises the urgency of a deal with Greece and Italy, the main arrival points for migrants from Turkey and North Africa. Horse-trading to suit multiple national interests is a classic technique for advancing European integration and could break logjams in what Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, calls a \u201cpolycrisis.\u201dRome is blocking a Union aid package for Turkey to help curb the influx of migrants into Europe; Athens is accused of failing to guard its borders or to register and retain asylum seekers on its soil; and Warsaw is under scrutiny in Brussels over laws shackling the judiciary and media. Each of those countries has hinted that it is willing to help others if its own interests are taken into account.Ms. Merkel is keen to help Mr. Cameron win his planned referendum on whether Britain should stay in the Union, but she is fighting for her own political skin in the refugee crisis.Berlin feels it has received little solidarity from its Union partners, while elsewhere there is a sense that reluctance to share the refugee burden is partly payback for perceived German bullying during the eurozone crisis.Germany and its allies are more inclined to use sticks than carrots with Greece. The European Commission last week gave Athens three months to fix \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in its management of the bloc\u2019s external frontiers or face suspension from the Schengen area. That deadline expires just as Greek debt talks are due to start.Domestic headwinds may make it harder for Ms. Merkel to use her dwindling political capital to offer concessions to Greece on rescheduling its debt to eurozone countries.Many in Berlin and Brussels doubt that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece can tighten border controls or keep tens of thousands of migrants penned up in his country until they can be relocated to reluctant Union states.Yet the chancellor has voiced understanding of Greece\u2019s plight as a frontline state and says she wants a \u201cEuropean solution\u201d to the refugee crisis. No one wants another \u201cGrexit\u201d crisis this year on top of the Union\u2019s other woes.If Greek compliance is uncertain, Turkey\u2019s cooperation in preventing migrants leaving its shores for Europe in return for 3 billion euros, or $3.25 billion, in aid is subject to deep skepticism.The Italians want more Union cash to cope with migrants landing on their shores and more fiscal leeway from Europe\u2019s budget supervisors to stimulate their sluggish economy.Poland is the biggest supplier of migrant labor to Britain. Its foreign minister has hinted that it could acquiesce in London\u2019s needs to curb in-work benefits for new arrivals if Mr. Cameron sends troops to provide a long-term NATO presence on its soil.The makings of trade-offs are easy to see, but in the fraught state of relations among Union leaders, it is a tall order.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Going to Cuba; First Visit by U.S. President in 88 Years", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s decision to travel to Cuba next month and meet with President Ra\u00fal Castro reflects his determination to do as much as possible before he leaves office to pry open the historic and ideological barricades that have separated the United States from its neighbor since the Cold War.It also represents something of a familiar gamble for Mr. Obama, who in becoming the first sitting American president to visit Cuba in 88 years will be testing his conviction that aggressive engagement, rather than harsh isolation, is the best way to prod an adversary to change.In announcing the trip on Thursday, Mr. Obama was betting on the power of his office and the force of his personal diplomacy to persuade Mr. Castro to do more to open his mostly state-run economy and respect human rights. The Cuban leader has been unwilling to take those steps since the two presidents announced in December 2014 that they would move toward normalized relations after a half-century of hostility. If Mr. Obama is wrong, the visit could instead highlight the deep differences that persist between the two nations.While the administration has rushed over the past year to loosen restrictions on travel and commerce and remove Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, the White House conceded on Thursday that Cuba had done comparatively little to change its behavior despite the new spirit of openness.\u201cWe believe the best way to try to push this forward is for the president to go,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser and the White House\u2019s point man on Cuba, arguing that Cuba had been in many ways unprepared to engage with the United States.\u201cThe way to carry this policy forward is to keep leaning forward,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a quid pro quo, but we would like the trip to show concrete progress in normalization, so it\u2019s an opportunity to demonstrate results.\u201dMr. Obama, who will be accompanied by his wife, Michelle, plans to meet with political dissidents in addition to Mr. Castro. But he does not intend to see Fidel Castro, the architect of the 1959 revolution that led to the rupture with the United States.The trip, planned for March 21-22, drew denunciations from critics in both parties of Mr. Obama\u2019s Cuba policy, many of them Cuban-Americans who have long opposed any engagement with the Castro government.\u201cTo this day, we have not seen one substantial step toward transparent democratic elections, improved human rights, freedom of assembly, or the ability to form independent political parties and trade unions in Cuba,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey. \u201cDespite the lack of reciprocity from a despotic and reinvigorated Castro regime, our president is rewarding this oppressive regime with a visit.\u201dSenator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican presidential candidate, released a letter to Mr. Obama urging him to reconsider the trip.\u201cHaving an American president go to Cuba simply for the sake of going there, without the United States getting anything in return, is both counterproductive and damaging to our national security interests,\u201d Mr. Rubio wrote. \u201cYou will send the message to the oppressed Cuban people that you stand with their oppressors.\u201dBut the planned visit was met with jubilation from lawmakers who have begun pressing to repeal the embargo against Cuba.Mr. Obama has used his executive power to forge closer ties with Cuba in the face of continued resistance in Congress to lifting the embargo. The two governments opened their long-shuttered embassies in Washington and Havana last summer, and the Commerce and Treasury Departments have issued several rounds of regulatory changes that essentially poke holes in what Cubans derisively refer to as the \u201cblockade.\u201dAmerican officials traveled to Havana on Tuesday to sign a pact that will for the first time in decades allow scheduled commercial flights between the United States and Cuba. And Cuban officials are in Washington this week for a round of talks aimed at expanding business ties.The presidential trip had been under discussion for months, and Mr. Obama had made little secret of his eagerness to visit Cuba. But officials had said they wanted to see concrete progress toward normalization before promising that the president would make the journey.On Thursday, Mr. Rhodes said Mr. Obama had ultimately concluded that it was better to make the trip early in the year, when he still had the time to make progress toward normalization before his term ends.\u201cGiven the choice between going in December, when, frankly, it would just kind of be a vacation down to Cuba, or going now and trying to get some business done, we believe that the time is right to go and lean in and try to get as much done on this trip as we can,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. The president, for one, is excited. \u201cIt will be fun,\u201d he told reporters in a brief exchange at the White House on Thursday.Mr. Obama will be the first president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge went in 1928. The president also plans to use the trip to highlight his efforts to foster closer ties with the rest of Latin America. After Cuba, he will travel to Argentina to visit Mauricio Macri, the new president, who has said he wants to improve relations with the United States after an era of strain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Policy Shifts on Refugees Lead to Clashes Between Migrants and Police", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byThe policy shift, unveiled this weekend after Austria, Croatia and Serbia announced that they would restrict migrant entries, means that newly arriving Afghans, who make up a third of asylum seekers in Europe, can now pass no farther north than Greece. Thousands more who are migrating north are stuck in countries where borders have been temporarily closed.\u201cThe Balkan route was a humanitarian corridor; it could close after consultations and not by turning one country against the other,\u201d the Greek migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, told the Greek channel Skai TV. \u201cWe are faced with an action that has elements of a coup.\u201dSome officials in Germany, the most popular destination for migrants, and in other countries are also starting to argue that because European nations have troops in Afghanistan to help quell the conflict, Afghan citizens should no longer be eligible for asylum in Europe in the same way that Syrians or Iraqis are.Austria faced renewed criticism from European Union authorities on Tuesday for unilaterally imposing a cap on asylum applications and entries, after its decision to place a daily limit of 3,200 entries and 80 asylum applications spurred a cascade of tightened borders that rippled south to Macedonia.\u201cWe are concerned by the fact that some member states are acting outside of the agreed framework,\u201d said Natasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, adding that the commission was investigating the legality of Austria\u2019s decision.Asked about complaints by Greece that Austria\u2019s decision would lead to a backup of refugees in southern Europe, Ms. Bertaud said the commission was trying to develop a response.\u201cObviously with the tightening of controls along the Western Balkans route, the commission\u2019s concern is now to prevent any humanitarian crisis from occurring,\u201d she said.Also Tuesday, Belgium said it would impose police checks on its southern border to prevent the possible influx of thousands of migrants as a French court considers whether to tear down much of a notorious migrant camp in the northern city of Calais. The Belgian interior minister, Jan Jambon, said the move was needed \u201cto prevent the erection of tent encampments in our country similar to those in Calais.\u201dAbout 10,000 migrants have massed in and around Idomeni since the weekend, when the Macedonian police, buttressed by reinforcements from Austria, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia, blocked Afghans and all other migrants from countries other than Syria and Iraq from entering.Macedonia took steps after Croatia determined that hundreds of Afghan migrants crossing its border had not come to Europe to escape conflict and sent them back to Serbia, Nikola Poposki, Macedonia\u2019s foreign minister, said in a telephone interview. Serbia in turn sent hundreds of Afghans back to Macedonia, where around 800 Afghan citizens are now stuck at the border, he added.Scores of buses from the Piraeus port, near Athens, which were carrying more migrants who days earlier had made a perilous crossing from Turkey, were stuck at several gas stations on a highway running to the northern border.On Tuesday, a Greek government official with knowledge of the operation said the police were boarding buses at the gas stations and separating out Syrians and Iraqis. The police removed Afghan citizens and placed them on buses to return to one of several migrant detention centers in Athens, which are already saturated, including a new half-built center outside the capital.The backup of migrants was increasing the strain on Greece, which has become a focal point in the crisis. European Union officials have demanded that Athens take steps to tighten screening and slow the flow of refugees, many of whom are hoping to reach Germany, or risk suspension from the Schengen zone.Only in the past two weeks has Greece opened several so-called hot spot facilities on the islands where migrants are most likely to arrive. But Athens has faced a sharp outcry from locals on some of those islands, such as Kos and Leros, who say they fear that the new centers, which are used to register and hold migrants until their applications are sorted out, will turn into permanent holding camps.Greece is the most popular entry point into Europe for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. More than 56,000 migrants arrived in Greece by sea in January alone, 10 times the number in the same period last year. In the first three weeks of this year, at least 113 people died trying to make the sea crossing to Europe, the International Organization for Migration said, compared with 94 a year earlier.Underlining the risks of the influx for Greece, the president of the European Parliament warned this week that the country risked becoming a \u201cparking lot\u201d for migrants unless the European Union moved to put in effect a plan to resettle thousands of migrants stuck there and in Italy.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day that Afghan migrants clashed with the Greek police. It was Tuesday, not Monday.Reporting was contributed by James Kanter from Brussels, Dimitris Bounias from Athens, and Dan Bilefsky from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economists Sharply Split Over Trade Deal Effects", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers and presidential candidates are having their say about the 12-nation Pacific Rim trade accord that is President Obama\u2019s top economic priority in his final year in office. But lately the liveliest debate over the deal is among blue-ribbon economists.Supporting the authors at the National Press Club was Jared Bernstein, who was the top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term.Each side in the economists\u2019 debate has criticized the economic model that the other used to reach its results, while opponents and supporters of the trade accord have quickly seized upon whichever analysis buttressed their own views.Michael B. Froman, Mr. Obama\u2019s trade representative, plans to join other trade ministers in Auckland, New Zealand, on Thursday for the formal signing of the trade deal, which they finished in October after years of negotiations.The future of the deal, however, depends on the approval of a sharply divided Congress. The administration is believed to lack enough support for passage, though votes are not expected until after the November election. Some other nations are delaying their own ratification processes pending American action.Election-year pressures are not helping the president\u2019s cause, as leading candidates in both parties are opposing the trade agreement.Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic contender, has criticized the final agreement after praising it while it was being negotiated. She continues to be assailed by her main rival for the nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for her early support.Against this backdrop, the economists from prestigious universities and research institutions have been providing their takes and debating their differences just as intensely, though with more scholarly reserve.The analysis from the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts was titled \u201cTrading Down: Unemployment, Inequality and Other Risks of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement,\u201d and was written by the economists Jeronim Capaldo and Alex Izurieta, with Jomo Kwame Sundaram, a former United Nations economic development official.The authors wrote that they used \u201ca more realistic model\u201d for their analysis, and that previous reports that projected economic benefits from the trade accord were \u201cbased on unrealistic assumptions such as full employment\u201d and unchanging income distribution.The Tufts report projected that incomes in the United States would decline by a half-percentage point compared with the change expected without the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Peterson Institute\u2019s report, by economists from Brandeis and Johns Hopkins universities, projected that incomes would rise by half a percentage point.The Tufts paper also projected that the overall economies of the United States and Japan would contract slightly. Employment in the United States would decline by 448,000 jobs; total job losses in the dozen nations would be 771,000 \u2014 a small share of the nations\u2019 total work forces, yet hardly a selling point for leaders seeking to ratify the trade agreement.The Obama administration has acknowledged that some jobs would be lost, especially in manufacturing and in industries that employ workers with lower skills, but it has said that those losses would be offset by new jobs created in export-reliant industries that pay more on average. The Peterson Institute report offered evidence for that argument, while concluding that there would be no net change in overall employment in the United States.The other parties to the pact are Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Brunei.\u201cEconomic gains would be negligible for other participating countries \u2014 less than one percent over 10 years for developed countries, and less than three percent for developing countries,\u201d the Tufts report said.It also had bad news for countries, including China, that are not parties to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose participants account for nearly 40 percent of the world economy.\u201cWe project negative effects on growth and employment in non-T.P.P. countries,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis increases the risk of global instability and a race to the bottom, in which labor incomes will be under increasing pressure.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When the industry is energy and the pollutant, methane, is invisible to the naked eye, it seems to take an awful lot.Will the natural gas gusher that blossomed for nearly 100 days over the hills outside Los Angeles before it was stanched on Feb. 11 make a difference? We\u2019ll see.The nationwide issue is\u00c2\u00a0the vulnerability to leaks \u2014 both subtle and, occasionally, dramatic \u2014 of vast amounts of aging, poorly monitored and inadequately inspected gas and oil infrastructure.A January story by Nichola Groom of Reuters laid out the scope of the infrastructure problem, from California across the nation:The leaking well\u00e2\u0080\u0099s owner, Southern California Gas Co., warned state utility regulators in 2014 of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmajor failures\u00e2\u0080\u009d without a rate hike to pay for comprehensive inspections of 229 storage wells.Twenty-six of its wells were \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh risk\u00e2\u0080\u009d and should be abandoned \u2013 even though they complied with state regulations, the utility wrote in a rate filing.The previous year, Pacific Gas & Electric pointed to an absence of safety standards for storage wells as reason to launch its own monitoring program that went beyond state rules, according to an internal document obtained by Reuters.The industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rising concern underscores the scant oversight of 400 underground natural gas storage facilities in 30 U.S. states. Most storage fields are regulated by states, but national industry groups have pushed for federal oversight \u2013 unusual in an industry better known for fighting regulation.In his remarks at a news conference in the San Fernando Valley on Tuesday, Moniz focused primarily on the local issue and the more than 400 gas storage facilities like the one that leaked.

We have a lot of very old infrastructure in energy, and we have to address the 21st\u00c2\u00a0century and do so in a way that makes for a better infrastructure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a smarter one, a more resilient one\u2026.Frankly, gas storage facilities need a fresh look in terms of some of the regulatory requirements \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that was clearly brought home here. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being done, and so the ideas are emerging. A need for stronger monitoring here and elsewhere emerged.My question is, who is the \u201cwe\u201d? Who has to push?Or it can dally and wait for more infrared imagery like this:FollowAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deal on Aviation Emissions Sets Can\u2019t-Miss Goals", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byItinerariesIf the global goals laid out at the recent Paris climate conference are to be met, curbing aviation emissions is critical. But don\u2019t expect last week\u2019s agreement to set the first standards for airplanes to make a big dent. In fact, it will do little to reduce the rise in emissions from airlines, the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gases responsible for climate change.The rub is that the long-awaited standard is lower than what the industry is on track to achieve anyway in the next decade.As it stands, the most advanced jets being built by Boeing and Airbus (such as the twin-aisle B787s and A350s, or the newest versions of the narrow-body B737s and A320s) already meet or exceed this new efficiency goal.About two decades after aviation started talking about limiting carbon emissions, and after six years of negotiations, the result is lower than \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201dAll this matters given the size of aviation and the industry\u2019s growth, with airlines projected to add 50,000 new large planes to meet rising demand for air travel around the world by the middle of the century.While carbon-intensive industries like automobiles or power plants are being forced into significant emissions cuts over the next decades, the aviation deal appears to give air travel a pass.There\u2019s a fair bit of secrecy surrounding the civil aviation group\u2019s process, and the Montreal-based organization won\u2019t disclose details about the new standards until a formal vote scheduled in the fall. This kind of secrecy as well as the reliance on standards crafted by the industry means questions and finger-pointing.\u201cEverything this week has been political,\u201d said Bill Hemmings, the director of aviation and shipping at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental group, speaking last week about the negotiations. \u201cIt has been horse-trading of a massive nature, done in secret, all behind completely closed doors.\u201dThe White House, which is eager to emphasize American leadership in fighting climate change, has put a positive spin on the deal.Even those with the most to lose \u2014 the manufacturers and airlines \u2014 heaped praise on the agreement, which they said comes in addition to voluntary measures they have taken to increase fuel efficiency.Airplane makers point out that they hardly need incentives to develop more efficient planes and not gas-guzzlers. Airlines have been pressing for planes that deliver savings on fuel \u2014 and therefore on emissions \u2014 for years.Julie Felgar, a senior Boeing manager dealing with environmental issues, said Boeing had made a 70 percent reduction in fuel use since the dawn of the jet age, as well as a 90 percent reduction in noise. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t see that technology curve slowing down,\u201d she said.Both Boeing and Airbus, for example, have developed new versions of their best-selling single-aisle planes with the latest generation of efficient jet engines, which they say are 20 to 25 percent more efficient than earlier generations.Both are also betting on a new generation of airplanes with lighter airframes that can also improve fuel economy \u2014 and emissions \u2014 by about 20 percent. Boeing has more than 1,100 787 Dreamliners on order and already delivered about 370 aircraft around the world. Airbus has so far delivered 15 of the more than 770 A350s it has on order.But there is also some skepticism that airplane makers can keep churning out new and revolutionary designs. Because they were stung by the high cost and technical problems encountered while developing the 787, the opposite may be true.Boeing\u2019s chairman said two years ago that the company would seek to avoid more \u201cmoon shots\u201d \u2014 by which he meant leapfrogging technologies \u2014 and would focus instead on producing planes more efficiently and more cheaply.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine and the West Need Each Other", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorKiev, Ukraine \u2014 After centuries of nearly continuous foreign control, we Ukrainians achieved our independence from the Soviet Union 25 years ago, in 1991. In 2005, after a fraudulent election brought Viktor Yanukovych into power, our Orange Revolution helped defeat him. And this month, we mark two years since Maidan \u2014 the Revolution of Dignity \u2014 when we overthrew kleptocratic rule by Mr. Yanukovych a second time. For Ukrainians, it seems the new Ukraine is never here; it\u2019s always coming.But momentum may be shifting. Again and again, our country has expressed its desire to integrate more fully with the European Union; now, for the first time, the European Union \u2014 roiled by nationalism and a refugee crisis \u2014 may need us as much as we need it. We are a rare breed these days, a people in support of the European Union and its shared identity, rather than in contempt of it.Nevertheless, achieving the new Ukraine won\u2019t be easy. Russia has annexed Crimea and occupied part of eastern Ukraine, leaving a so-called frozen conflict that could reheat at Russia\u2019s bidding. Even in the face of that, some of our politicians are better at arguing and lining their own pockets than at governing. And despite our serial changes in leadership, we don\u2019t have enough practice at mutual trust to work together at building a democracy.Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, respects international rules \u2014 and borders \u2014 only when they align with his interests. We have no illusions that he will change.Of course, Ukrainians must prove we are ready for the challenge.In the past, we haven\u2019t done so. In 2005, people fell back into apathy soon after the Orange Revolution had rid us of Mr. Yanukovych. When the next regime proved to be also corrupt and inept, people simply became passive and uninterested.But the movement named after Maidan, the square in Kiev where protesters clamoring for change refused to be dispersed two years ago, marked a turning point. In contrast to 2005, civil society groups survived Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s second ouster. Now there is an energy in our country we haven\u2019t felt before \u2014 a desire and increasing capacity to defend our basic values and interests.We know we must first build a functional democracy. The government has already made progress, but our civil society is demanding more decisive steps. Active networks of civic-minded citizens play an increasing role in planning and advocacy for vitally important reforms in public administration, the judiciary, decentralization, public procurement, investment and more.Democracy also means a governmental monopoly over all armed units. While self-organized voluntary battalions, some with far-right sympathies, played a vital role in halting the advances of Russia and its separatist allies in the crisis two years ago, a primary condition of effective statehood is assuring the complete submission of such groups to central control, and the government has made essential progress in this area.We also need to provide political freedoms, despite the continuing proxy war in the east. In the parts of eastern Ukraine now controlled by separatists, we must guarantee full access for officials monitoring the cease-fire; demilitarize the area; obtain the withdrawal of Russian-armed militants and weapons; ensure the safety of people of all views; and restore normal political and civic life, including unrestricted activity by Ukrainian political parties and civic groups. Only then should we move ahead to the most essential step, elections \u2014 free and fair contests that meet international standards. Above all, we must root out corruption everywhere. A new National Anti-Corruption Bureau is up and running, but another agency intended to prevent corruption and conflicts of interest among officials is not fully staffed.In short, if we want to be part of the European Union, we must adhere to its ideals. But we also need to add value.Fortunately, we have value to add. Across the globe, the space for democracy and rule of law is shrinking. Europe has offered one of the most efficient governance models in history, especially for eliminating legacies of hostility, building sustainable peace, and creating a productive economy alongside an inclusive social system. But that model is being tested severely by the rise of virulent nationalists, who are fueled in part by the fear of terrorism and resentment of migrants. We are an antidote. Europe needs our dynamism just as soon as we can deliver it.The new Ukraine is a metaphor, but it brings new passion for freedom to the whole region. If we get a little better every year \u2014 even slowly \u2014 we will move ahead. And perhaps others will follow our lead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Are White Death Rates Rising?", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBoth studies attributed the higher death rates to increases in poisonings and chronic liver disease, which mainly reflect drug overdoses and alcohol abuse, and to suicides. In contrast, death rates fell overall for blacks and Hispanics.How is your life going? For most of us, the answer to that question means comparing our lives to the lives our parents were able to lead. As children and adolescents, we closely observed our parents. They were our first reference group.And here is one solution to the death-rate conundrum: It\u2019s likely that many non-college-educated whites are comparing themselves to a generation that had more opportunities than they have, whereas many blacks and Hispanics are comparing themselves to a generation that had fewer opportunities.When whites without college degrees look back, they can often remember fathers who were sustained by the booming industrial economy of postwar America. Since then, however, the industrial job market has slowed significantly. The hourly wages of male high school graduates declined by 14 percent from 1973 to 2012, according to analysis of data from the Economic Policy Institute. Although high school educated white women haven\u2019t experienced the same major reversal of the job market, they may look at their husbands \u2014 or, if they are single, to the men they choose not to marry \u2014 and reason that life was better when they were growing up.African-Americans, however, didn\u2019t get a fair share of the blue-collar prosperity of the postwar period. They may look back to a time when discrimination deprived their parents of equal opportunities. Many Hispanics may look back to the lower standard of living their parents experienced in their countries of origin. Whites are likely to compare themselves to a reference group that leads them to feel worse off. Blacks and Hispanics compare themselves to reference groups that may make them feel better off.The sociologist Timothy Nelson and I observed this phenomenon in interviews with high-school-educated young adult men in 2012 and 2013. A 35-year-old white man who did construction jobs said, \u201cIt\u2019s much harder for me as a grown man than it was for my father.\u201d He remembered his father saying that back when he was 35, \u201c\u2018I had a house and I had five kids or four kids.\u2019 You know, \u2018Look where I was at.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, Dad, things have changed.\u2019\u201dAfrican-American men were more upbeat. One said: \u201cI think there are better opportunities now because first of all, the economy\u2019s changing. The color barrier is not as harsh as it was back then.\u201dIn addition, national surveys show striking racial and ethnic differences in satisfaction with one\u2019s social standing relative to one\u2019s parents. The General Social Survey conducted by the research organization NORC at the University of Chicago has asked Americans in its biennial surveys to compare their standard of living to that of their parents. In 2014, according to my analysis, among 25- to 54-year-olds without college degrees, blacks and Hispanics were much more positive than whites: 67 percent of African-Americans and 68 percent of Hispanics responded \u201cmuch better\u201d or \u201csomewhat better,\u201d compared with 47 percent of whites.Those figures represent a reversal from 2000, when whites were more positive than blacks, 64 percent to 60 percent. (Hispanics were the most positive in nearly all years.)But we size ourselves up based on more than just our parents. White workers historically have compared themselves against black workers, taking some comfort in seeing a group that was doing worse than them. Now, however, the decline of racial restrictions in the labor market and the spread of affirmative action have changed that. Non-college-graduate whites in the General Social Survey are more likely to agree that \u201cconditions for black people have improved\u201d than are comparable blacks themselves, 68 percent to 53 percent.Reference group theory explains why people who have more may feel that they have less. What matters is to whom you are comparing yourself. It\u2019s not that white workers are doing worse than African-Americans or Hispanics.Andrew J. Cherlin is a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University and the author of \u201cLabor\u2019s Love Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Working-Class Family in America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Negative 0.5% Interest Rate: Why People Are Paying to Save", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byBelow ZeroWhen you lend somebody money, they usually have to pay you for the privilege.That has been a bedrock assumption across centuries of financial history. But it is an assumption that is increasingly being tossed aside by some of the world\u2019s central banks and bond markets.A decade ago, negative interest rates were a theoretical curiosity that economists would discuss almost as a parlor game. Two years ago, it began showing up as an unconventional step that a few small countries considered. Now, it is the stated policy of some of the most powerful global central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.On Thursday, Sweden\u2019s central bank lowered its bank lending rate to a negative 0.5 percent from a negative 0.35 percent, and said it could cut further still; European bank stocks were hammered partly because investors feared what negative rates could do to bank profits. The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, acknowledged in congressional testimony Wednesday and Thursday that the American central bank was taking a look at the strategy, though she emphasized no such move was envisioned.But as negative rates \u2014 in which depositors pay to hold money in bank accounts \u2014 become a more common fixture, there are many unknowns about what these policies mean for finance, for the economy and even for the definition of money.These are some of the key questions, and, where we have them, the answers.So how do negative interest rates work?It depends. In the cases of interest rate targets set by central banks like the E.C.B. and Swedish Riksbank, they set a negative target rate for banks, and banks in turn pass it along to their customers. The E.C.B., for example, currently has a negative 0.3 percent rate, meaning that when banks deposit money at the central bank overnight, they pay for the privilege.Banks have different ways of passing the negative rates on to depositors, often framed as fees for keeping money in an account, which is basically negative interest rates by another name.Bond markets reflect these negative rates, too, including for longer-term government debt. For example, if you bought a two-year Swiss government bond on Thursday, you would have needed to pay a price that resulted in a yield of negative 1.12 percent. Even 10-year Swiss bonds have a negative rate, a sign markets expect below-zero rates to persist in Switzerland for many years to come.But don\u2019t people just withdraw cash rather than pay to deposit it at their bank or buy a government bond that will give them back less than they paid?You\u2019d think, right? This was exactly why economists had long thought that negative interest rates were impossible. It helps explain why central banks first turned to other tools, including quantitative easing, when they saw a need to ease monetary policy despite interest rates that were already near zero.But it looks as if the convenience of keeping money in a bank account is worth a small negative interest rate or fees for most consumers and businesses, at least at the only slightly negative rates currently in place. Storing and providing security for cash may be more expensive than a small bank charge.When initial experiments in Switzerland and Sweden didn\u2019t result in mass withdrawals from the banking system, larger central banks in need of easier money moved gingerly in the same direction. They\u2019ll stop when either their economies start to grow or they see more concrete evidence that negative rates are doing more harm than good.How is this supposed to help the economy?Pretty much the same way it always is supposed to help the economy when a central bank cuts rates. Lower rates encourage business investment and consumer spending; increase the value of the stock market and other risky assets; lower the value of a country\u2019s currency, making exporters more competitive; and create expectations of higher future inflation, which can induce people to spend now.We have decades of experience with central banks trying to manage the economy by, for example, cutting bank rates to 2 percent from 3 percent when there is an economic downturn. The shift to negative rate policies is, hypothetically at least, the same, but with a starting point of rates already around zero.So does it work?It\u2019s hard to say with any certainty yet. At a minimum, it seems to have an effect of lowering the value of a currency, which makes export industries very happy. It\u2019s less clear whether it can help create sustained economic growth, particularly when the hard-to-calculate downsides are factored in.What are those downsides?The global financial system is built on an assumption of above-zero interest rates. Going below zero could cause damage to the very architecture by which money and credit zoom through the economy, and in turn inhibit growth.Banks could cease to be viable businesses, eliminating a key way that money is channeled from savers to productive investments. Money market mutual funds, widely used in the United States, could well cease to exist. Insurance companies and pension funds could face their own major strains.Is the Federal Reserve going to do this in the United States?Janet Yellen doesn\u2019t think so. But in two days of congressional testimony this week, she also didn\u2019t rule it out.For one thing, the United States economy, and particularly its labor market, looks to be in stronger shape than that of many others around the world. So the Fed expects to be in interest-rate raising mode this year (though exactly how fast is very much in question). But even if the economy does take a turn for the worse, there\u2019s no certainty that negative rates are the path the Fed would take.She also said that \u201cit isn\u2019t just a question of legal authority.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also a question of could the plumbing of the payment system in the United States handle it?\u201d she said. \u201cIs our institutional structure of our money markets compatible with it? We\u2019ve not determined that.\u201dMs. Yellen noted that the rates on Treasury bills could go negative even in the absence of a policy shift by the Fed, as has happened a few times in the past.So what are some of the weird things that could happen in a world in which negative rates become routine?The policies in Europe and Japan are still relatively new and involve rates only slightly below zero. But if the policies become long-lasting, or negative rates go much lower, there are a lot of mind-bending ways it could affect routine transactions.For example, would people start prepaying years\u2019 worth of cable bills to avoid having money tied up in a money-losing bank account? How about property taxes? Would companies and governments put in place new policies prohibiting people from paying their bills too early?Or consider this: Many commercial transactions now take place with some short-term credit attached \u2014 for example, a company that gets a 60-day grace period to pay bills from its suppliers. Would that flip, and suddenly suppliers would prohibit upfront payment and insist that their customers wait 60 days to pay?Might new businesses sprout up that allow people to securely store thousands of dollars in bundles of $100 bills, or could people buy physical objects as stores of value that the banks can\u2019t charge a negative interest rate on?videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bahamas Mega-Resort Stands Empty, Casualty of Dispute With Chinese Partners", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetNASSAU, the Bahamas \u2014 Trei Bethel had been looking for work in the Bahamas for about a year when he finally got a break: a coveted spot in a program that trained young Bahamians to work at Baha Mar, a $3.5 billion mega-resort nearing completion on Nassau\u2019s white-sand Cable Beach.There, he said, he learned about fine wine and the choreography of five-star service. He saw the resort as a place of opportunity and stability in a difficult economy.\u201cThey really put so much effort into the growth and development of us as young people,\u201d said Mr. Bethel, now 20, who became a concierge at one of the resort\u2019s four hotels.But in October, Mr. Bethel lost his job along with 2,000 others, the casualties of a dispute between the resort\u2019s developer and his Chinese partners that led to bankruptcy court. The falling-out has left Baha Mar at a standstill, fenced off at the end of a road that bears its name, more than a year after its original opening date.Baha Mar\u2019s uncertain future points to the challenges China faces as it finances and builds large-scale construction projects overseas amid language and cultural barriers, lack of regulation and allegations of graft.\u201cThe more problems there are and, in a way, the more media attention these problems attract, they erode positive attitudes towards Chinese presence in the region,\u201d said Ariel C. Armony, director of the University Center for International Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, who has researched the perception of Chinese investment in the Americas.After losing its American backer during the financial crisis, Baha Mar was revived in 2009 by China Construction America, a Jersey City-based subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned construction company, the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. The company facilitated a $2.5 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, a state-owned lender with which it has close ties, and invested $150 million for its own equity stake. In exchange, China Construction America would serve as the resort\u2019s contractor, using Chinese workers.The rest of the financing came from Sarkis Izmirlian, the Swiss-born developer who conceived Baha Mar and invested $850 million.Since his project filed for bankruptcy last summer, there has been finger-pointing from all sides. But there is broad agreement on two points: Baha Mar is spectacular, and there is plenty of blame to go around for its failure to open.Critics say the resort was overly ambitious from the start and should have been built in phases. It combines four luxury hotels, the largest casino in the Caribbean region, a championship golf course, a 200,000-square-foot convention center and what is billed as the world\u2019s largest collection of Bahamian art. The hotel chains Hyatt, Rosewood and SLS had signed on as partners.The Bahamas welcomed the investment, even moving the prime minister\u2019s residence to provide a prime location for the resort.But Baha Mar executives say that problems became evident when China Construction America, or C.C.A., missed several construction deadlines, including a second attempted opening in March for which the hotels had already started taking reservations. The company then walked away from the job, officials say, leaving the resort staffed to run hotels that weren\u2019t finished.In a statement in July, it called the developer\u2019s accusations \u201cmisleading and dishonest,\u201d saying Baha Mar\u2019s \u201cfailure to secure adequate financing and its mismanagement\u201d led to construction delays. The company did not respond to requests for further comment.The Export-Import Bank of China did not respond to a list of faxed questions.Unable to maintain the upkeep of a dormant mega-resort, Mr. Izmirlian filed bankruptcy paperwork for the project in Delaware in June. He declined to be interviewed for this article.The United States case was dismissed in September because the Bahamian government refused to recognize it. The top court in the Bahamas, which has no bankruptcy law of its own, appointed provisional liquidators. After months of fruitless negotiations, the Export-Import Bank of China put the resort into receivership in November.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Since then the resort has received a $50 million loan from another Chinese state-owned company, the China Harbor Engineering Company, to help maintain the resort. Prime Minister Perry Christie of the Bahamas has said there are several potential buyers from China.For C.C.A., which celebrated its 30th anniversary last fall, Baha Mar was an opportunity to show what it could do as it tries to expand into Latin America and the Caribbean.In court filings, Baha Mar officials say C.C.A. failed to maintain adequate staffing, provide proper schedules or follow through on a promise to bring in partners with the experience needed to build such a complex project.\u201cChina State Construction never allocated the resources that were necessary to meet the deadlines of this project,\u201d Stephen Wrinkle, former president of the Bahamian Contractors\u2019 Association, said in a phone interview, using the name of C.C.A.\u2019s parent company. \u201cFrom Day 1 they never put the manpower, they never put the management, they never put the materials on site to finish on time.\u201dIn court filings, C.C.A. countered that the developer had mismanaged the project, requesting multiple design changes that created cost overruns.As evidence of poor construction quality, Baha Mar officials have cited an email from a Chinese subcontractor that appeared to have been accidentally shared with them. In it, he admonished two of his staff for using cheap material.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you two! You can\u2019t fake things in such an obvious way!\u201d he wrote in Chinese, according to court records. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourselves in trouble! If you want to do this, you must be careful!\u201dIn an affidavit, the subcontractor said that the English translation of his email did not convey his intent and that \u201cthere is a conflict between American and Chinese culture and expressions.\u201dChina\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.As the project went on, more subcontractors from the Bahamas, the United States and elsewhere were brought in to speed the process, said Dionisio D\u2019Aguilar, who was a director at Baha Mar until the entire board resigned in November, including Mr. Izmirlian. The bankruptcy plan Baha Mar submitted called for C.C.A. to be removed from the project entirely.\u201cI have to believe that in the end the goings-on at Baha Mar have embarrassed them,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Aguilar said of C.C.A.The delays are an economic blow to the Bahamas, which expected the resort to generate a payroll equivalent to 12 percent of its gross domestic product. Bahamians who had returned home to join Baha Mar after working or studying overseas are now leaving again.Locals had started or expanded small businesses in anticipation of the resort\u2019s opening, \u201cand those people are also left hung out to dry,\u201d Mr. Wrinkle said. Bahamian contractors are owed an estimated $74 million by the resort.Standard & Poor\u2019s cited the Baha Mar impasse in its August decision to lower the Bahamas\u2019 credit rating to one level above junk status, warning that further downgrades were possible depending on \u201cthe handling of the Baha Mar project.\u201d And in December, the International Monetary Fund lowered the country\u2019s growth forecast for 2016.Even if work at Baha Mar resumes, it could be another year or more before it opens. Rosewood has moved to terminate its license agreement with Baha Mar; SLS did not respond to requests for comment. Hyatt said it remained committed to the project.Mr. Bethel, the concierge, is holding out hope that he can return to Baha Mar once it opens and put what he learned into practice.\u201cI have unfinished business there in terms of my career and where I want to get in life,\u201d he said.Jennifer Jett reported from Nassau and Hong Kong.

Excluding one-time items, Coke\u2019s earnings were 38 cents a share, a penny more than analysts had predicted.\u201cOur fourth-quarter performance was a testament to the action we took as the company continued to deliver solid pricing and unit case volume growth,\u201d Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, said in a news release.Like many other companies that report their earnings in dollars, Coca-Cola said foreign currency translation had sliced 10 percentage points off its per-share earnings in the fourth quarter.Weakness internationally, where economies in several of Coke\u2019s major markets are slowing, crimped the company\u2019s performance and offset volume growth of 3 percent in North America.In 2015, Coca-Cola\u2019s sales fell to $44.3 billion, down 4 percent, compared with $46 billion a year earlier. Profit for the year rose to $7.4 billion, a 3 percent gain over $7.1 billion in 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Demographics in Cambodia Shift, Youth Seek Political Change", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byMs. Thy Sovantha put out a call on YouTube and rallied hundreds of her supporters to meet him at the airport.But at the last minute, he canceled his flight and fled to France.\u201cI was very angry,\u201d Ms. Thy Sovantha said. \u201cThe reason we supported him is that we want change. If he does not come back like this, we think, how can we change the leader? How can we win?\u201dThe question is a riddle in Cambodia, which has been stuck in roughly the same political cycle for decades.Mr. Sam Rainsy is now as well known for fleeing the country in the face of legal threats as he is for his reform-minded agenda. His retreat to France was his third in a decade.For many Cambodians, the 2013 election was the biggest opportunity yet to break out of that rut. Youth like Ms. Thy Sovantha were a central part of that hope, as a demographic shift gave them a larger say than ever before.Politically, they are restless, having outgrown the authoritarian style and patronage system of Mr. Hun Sen.But having come so close to ousting him and failed, many are disillusioned. And now some are starting to give up on Mr. Sam Rainsy as well.\u201cI feel disappointed and hopeless,\u201d said Ms. Thy Sovantha, now 20.His decision not to return to Cambodia, analysts say, was a lost opportunity, if not a surprise.But even his supporters were disappointed.Ou Ritthy, 28, the founder of a youth political discussion group, said he and his peers were exasperated with the cat-and-mouse game of Cambodian politics.\u201cHun Sen, many things he has been doing are for power, for party interests, and Sam Rainsy also does the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s old-style politics in a new society.\u201dMr. Ou Ritthy credits the sharp rise in Internet penetration and smartphone use for changing the dynamic here.\u201cYouth have two things,\u201d he said. \u201cInformation \u2014 they got informed from social media \u2014 and smartphones. They are more independent in terms of information. They are not told what to do by their parents like in the past.\u201dAfter two opposition lawmakers were dragged from their cars and severely beaten in October, Facebook sleuths managed to identify several attackers as members of government security forces.Both parties are keenly aware of the demographic shift and are trying to chase the changing electorate.According to a study by the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller, he already ranks second among world leaders for engagement with Facebook followers.He is increasingly conducting government business on Facebook. He has made several policy changes based on complaints posted to his personal page, and last week, he announced the creation of dozens of \u201cFacebook working groups\u201d to gather information about citizens\u2019 concerns.Sun Heng, a 22-year-old university student, said he and most of his friends followed both leaders on Facebook but were still skeptical about the sexagenarians\u2019 embrace of social media.\u201cFor me, I find it very pretentious: Sometimes it is so obvious that they are acting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it can also be a good sign, showing that they care what people think now.\u201d\u201cThis is for me the fourth time that I am forced into exile,\u201d he said by Skype from his home in Paris. \u201cBut eventually, each time, the situation changes, and I always manage to be back in time.\u201dThe question for Cambodia is whether his followers will still be waiting. Ms. Thy Sovantha seems to have moved on.She has told her followers, who now number 1.2 million, of her disillusionment with Mr. Sam Rainsy. Her Facebook posts focus increasingly on education and environmental issues rather than party politics, and she is channeling her energy into starting a center for homeless youth.But she may not have entirely given up on the system. On her Facebook profile, she describes herself as \u201cpolitician.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the building shown in Phnom Penh.

Mylan also fended off its own unsolicited approach by Teva last year.Among the motivations for the deal was Mylan\u2019s desire to provide greater exposure to over-the-counter products, which represent 40 percent of Meda\u2019s product sales, and entry into emerging markets. Meda focuses largely on respiratory, dermatology and pain products. By acquiring Meda, Mylan is bringing together more than 2,000 products, including consolidating the EpiPen Auto-Injector for allergic reactions in Europe.Mylan said the acquisition was immediately accretive to its earnings, increasing to 35 cents to 40 cents a share in 2017. The transaction also could create about $350 million in annual pretax synergies by the fourth year after the deal, the companies said.As part of integrating the two companies, Mylan and Meda said there would most likely be some \u201cchanges to the organization, operations and employees of the combined group,\u201d adding that no decisions had been made to this effect. Meda has about 4,500 employees, while Mylan has 35,000.Meda\u2019s two largest shareholders, Stena and Fidim, representing 30 percent of the company\u2019s shares outstanding, have already accepted the offer.The economy, rampant consolidation among drug makers,and the need to compete in the health care sector led those investors to believe that Meda would be better off combining with another company than existing on a standalone basis, Ms. Bresch of Mylan said in a phone interview Wednesday.Conditioned on approval by regulators, the companies expect to close the deal by the third quarter of 2016.Centerview Partners provided financial advice to Mylan for the transaction, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore served as legal adviser. Vinge provided legal advice in Sweden and NautaDutilh was the legal adviser in the Netherlands. Rothschild served as the sole adviser to Meda.Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs are providing financing to Mylan for the cash portion of the deal.Advertisement"}

Two candidates from opposite political parties.\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I like a little from each person,\u201d said Ms. Little, waiting to see Mr. Bush speak at Franklin Pierce University here last week. A bit later, ducking out early from the event, she whispered with a smile, \u201cI like him even better now.\u201dMs. Little belongs to a highly coveted and unpredictable species \u2014 the undeclared New Hampshire primary voter \u2014 that makes up about 40 percent of the primary electorate, and that has the potential to propel one candidate to victory or tip another to defeat.Interviews with more than a dozen undeclared New Hampshire voters revealed an electorate here still grappling with wildly different choices in an extraordinarily diverse field.New Hampshire makes it especially easy for undeclared voters, who are also known as independents, by letting them choose either ballot in a primary.\u201cThe independents have the capability of reshaping the race on either side if they do all go in one direction or the other by significant margins,\u201d said Steve Koczela, the president of MassINC Polling Group, which conducted the WBUR poll. \u201cNew Hampshire independents really are the real deal. There\u2019s a real slice of them who aren\u2019t going to do the same thing each time, and are really up for grabs by candidates in either party.\u201dThis year, undeclared voters are finding their decision especially daunting.More than $30 million has been spent on negative advertising targeting Republicans in New Hampshire this cycle.Still, Ms. Wilson added, \u201cit\u2019s only the primary.\u201dSome independents said they might vote for one party in the primary, and the other in the general election. After all, these people are often less ideological and more personality-driven than typical primary base voters.\u201cMany voters in New Hampshire who don\u2019t consider themselves serious partisans will show up because they feel a personal connection to a candidate, regardless of whether they fit a certain orthodoxy,\u201d said David Wasserman, the House editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.Then there is strategy to consider, with some undecided voters debating not just which candidates they like best, but also which primary would allow their votes to have a greater impact. The Democratic primary has been fairly static, with Mr. Sanders holding a sizable lead over Mrs. Clinton. But the Republican race feels up for grabs.\u201cI can\u2019t have as much effect on the Democratic ballot, but I might be able to bring Trump and Cruz down,\u201d she said.Gale Taylor, 61, of Brookline, said she had seen almost every candidate at least three times. She was leaning toward voting in the Democratic primary, but was deciding between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders on the Democratic side, and Mr. Bush and Mr. Kasich on the Republican side.Because she is something of an intrepid political traveler, her friends often seek her advice. \u201cA lot of people are saying, \u2018Well, if I really want a Democrat to win, don\u2019t you think I should vote for Trump?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I say: \u2018No, no. I totally disagree with that strategy.\u2019\u201dHer other tip: \u201cI always tell everybody to stay away from Cruz,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cRight from the start, I did not like that man.\u201dSome voters here who belong to a party envy their undeclared neighbors. Marjorie Wolfson, 60, a mother of four in Durham, is a registered Democrat, but would change her registration if she could to vote for Mr. Kasich.\u201cHe\u2019s mild-mannered, he doesn\u2019t scream, he doesn\u2019t yell,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could have changed for this purpose, to give the guy a shot.\u201d Instead, she said, she is displaying a Kasich yard sign to send a message: \u201cEven a Democrat will support this guy.\u201dNonetheless, most independent voters here said their decision was not driven by strategy. The WBUR poll found that, when prompted, 82 percent of undeclared voters strongly agreed that they wanted the candidate who most aligned with them on the issues, and 76 percent strongly agreed that they wanted the \u201cbest candidate, regardless of which party primary they are in.\u201dLast week, Rick Farr, 61, of Weare, newly retired and sporting a Hemingway-esque white beard, showed up at an event for Mr. Christie, consulting a small index card he keeps in his pocket.A week in February 1992 revived Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and made the state hallowed ground for the Clintons.On the left of the card, in neat black letters, Mr. Farr had listed the issues he cares most about \u2014 immigration, climate change, income inequality, term limits. On the right side, he had written the qualities he would like the next president to have \u2014 like \u201ccivility\u201d and \u201cproblem solver.\u201dHe said he was deciding among the two Democratic candidates, as well as three Republican governors: Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich.Reached by phone Sunday, he said he had finally arrived at a decision. He likes the Republican governors, but worries that none of them can win their party\u2019s nomination. And he likes Mr. Sanders\u2019s promises, but does not know that he could deliver.So, on Tuesday, after careful deliberation, Mr. Farr plans to take a Democratic ballot and vote for Mrs. Clinton, who he said had \u201cproven leadership experiences, gets things done and builds consensus and compromise.\u201dShe is not necessarily his dream candidate, but he sounded satisfied with his choice. \u201cNo one is going to agree with me 100 percent of the time,\u201d he had said earlier, \u201cexcept for one person: me.\u201dJess Bidgood contributed reporting from Durham, N.H.; Nick Corasaniti from Salem, N.H.; and Alex Thompson from Portsmouth, N.H.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m John Dickerson. This holiday weekend, as America honors our first president, we\u2019re about to hear from six men who hope to be the 45th. The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate, one week before this state holds the first-in-the-South primary.George Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light. We hope to shed some light on the candidates\u2019 positions tonight to help voters make up their minds.So gentlemen, please join us on stage.(APPLAUSE)With us tonight \u2014 with us tonight are retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.(APPLAUSE)Businessman Donald Trump of New York.(APPLAUSE)Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.(APPLAUSE)Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida.(APPLAUSE)And Governor John Kasich of Ohio.(APPLAUSE)Now, as most of you have heard by now, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79. He was the longest-serving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986. Justice Scalia was the court\u2019s leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar. Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia. Thank you.We will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Before we get started, candidates, here are the rules. When we ask you a question, you will have one minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up. If you\u2019re attacked by another candidate, you get 30 seconds to respond.And here\u2019s how we keep time. After we ask a question, you\u2019ll get a green light.

Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag \u201c#GOPDebate.\u201dSo, let\u2019s begin.First, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. You\u2019ve said that the president shouldn\u2019t nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia. If you were president and had a chance, with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn\u2019t it be an abdication, to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?TRUMP: Well, I can say this. If the president, and if I were president now, I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. I\u2019m sure that, frankly, I\u2019m absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able \u2014 Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.In times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor \u2014 we have some fantastic people. But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism. It\u2019s a tremendous blow, frankly, to our country.DICKERSON: So, just to be clear on this, Mr. Trump, you\u2019re O.K. with the president nominating somebody ...TRUMP: ... I think he\u2019s going to do it whether or I\u2019m O.K. with it or not. I think it\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell and everybody else to stop it. It\u2019s called delay, delay, delay.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, I want to get your thoughts on this. Justice Scalia was a real believer, obviously, in the strict word of the Constitution. Now, Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be, quote, \u201cshameful abdication of one of the Senate\u2019s most essential constitutional responsibilities.\u201dWhere do you come down on this?KASICH: Well, John, first of all, if I were president, we wouldn\u2019t have the divisions in the country we have today. I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, it\u2019s amazing \u2014 it\u2019s not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father didn\u2019t wake up. His wife, sad, but I just wish we hadn\u2019t run so fast into politics.Here\u2019s my concern about this. The country is so divided right now, and now we\u2019re going to see another partisan fight take place. I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody. If you were to nominate somebody, let\u2019s have him pick somebody that\u2019s going to have unanimous approval, and such widespread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, and I would like the president just to, for once here, put the country first. We\u2019re going to have an election for president very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.And so I believe the president should not move forward, and I think that we ought to let the next president of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... States of America.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson. Dr. Carson, you, like others, put out a statement after the death was announced, and you said the president should delay.You\u2019ve written a book on the Constitution recently. What does the Constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation?CARSON: Well, the current Constitution actually doesn\u2019t address that particular situation, but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court, obviously, is a very important part of our governmental system. And when our Constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.Obviously, that has changed, and it\u2019s something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point. But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country. I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks. And that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame. And we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.But, right now, we\u2019re not going to get healing with President Obama. That\u2019s very United Nations clear. So, I...(BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time.DICKERSON: Senator Rubio, you\u2019re a...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Rubio, you\u2019re a lawyer. Quickly, can you address the issue of whether the Constitution tells us who has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices?And then, also, the Senate Republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for Senate \u2014 excuse me, for Supreme Court nominations. You seemed open to that. What\u2019s your feeling on that now?RUBIO: Well, let me first talk about Justice Scalia. His loss is tremendous, and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family. He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic.You talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution, who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment, but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.Justice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic. His dissent, for example, on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work. And, of course, his dissent on Obergefell as well.No. 2, I do not believe the president should appoint someone. And it\u2019s not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.And it remind us of this, how important this election is. Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court, and it will begin by filling this vacancy that\u2019s there now.And we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document. It is to be interpreted as originally meant.DICKERSON: Quickly, though, on this question...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Very quickly, Senator, on this specific question, though. You were once in favor of dropping the threshold...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: That\u2019s not accurate.DICKERSON: ... majority \u2014 you were never in favor of that?RUBIO: No, I\u2019ve never \u2014 there has been, for example, today, according to the changes Harry Reid made, appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority, but not Supreme Court justices.And I think today you see the wisdom of why we don\u2019t want that to change. Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate, Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice, like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already.DICKERSON: O.K. Thank you, Senator.Governor Bush, I would like to ask you, conservatives for a long time have felt like that their Republican presidents have picked justices that didn\u2019t turn out to be real conservatives.BUSH: Right.DICKERSON: Bernie Sanders has said he would have a litmus test. He would make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn Citizens United. If they can have a litmus test for a nominee, what about you? Would you have a litmus test for a nominee? And what would it be?BUSH: Not on specific issues, not at all. I think the next president \u2014 if I\u2019m president, I will appoint people \u2014 I\u2019ll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary.The problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didn\u2019t have a record. And the problem is that sometimes we\u2019re surprised.The simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record, similar to Justice Scalia, that is a lover of liberty, that believes in limited government, that consistently applied that kind of philosophy, that didn\u2019t try to legislator from the bench, that was respectful of the Constitution.And then fight and fight, and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.Of course, the president, by the way, has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices. I\u2019m an Article II guy in the Constitution. We\u2019re running for the president of the United States. We want a strong executive for sure. But in return for that, there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate.DICKERSON: Right, so, Senator Cruz, the Constitution...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: So, Senator Cruz, the Constitution says the president \u201cshall appoint with advice and consent from the Senate,\u201d just to clear that up. So he has the constitutional power. But you don\u2019t think he should.Where do you set that date if you\u2019re president? Does it begin in election year, in December, November, September? And once you set the date, when you\u2019re president, will you abide by that date?CRUZ: Well, we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. And let me say, Justice Scalia...DICKERSON: Just can I \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, were any appointed in an election year, or is that just there were 80 years...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Eighty years of not confirming. For example, L.B.J. nominated Abe Fortas. Fortas did not get confirmed. He was defeated.DICKERSON: But Kennedy was confirmed in \u201988.CRUZ: No, Kennedy was confirmed in \u201987...DICKERSON: He was appointed in \u201987.CRUZ: He was appointed in...DICKERSON: ... confirmed in \u201988. That\u2019s the question, is it appointing or confirming, what\u2019s the difference?CRUZ: In this case it\u2019s both. But if I could answer the question...DICKERSON: Sorry, I just want to get the facts straight for the audience. But I apologize.(BOOING)(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: Justice Scalia was a legal giant. He was somebody that I knew for 20 years. He was a brilliant man. He was faithful to the Constitution. He changed the arc of American legal history. And I\u2019ll tell you, his passing tonight, our prayers are with his family, with his wife, Maureen, who he adored, his nine children, his 36 grandkids. But it underscores the stakes of this election. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia\u2019s seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans \u2014 and the stakes of this election, for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee.\u201dAnd then for the state of South Carolina, one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background, the principle, the character, the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court? That will be what I will do if I\u2019m elected president.DICKERSON: All right.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Senator Cruz. All right, we\u2019re going to move on to national security here, and we are going to \u2014 I want to read a quote from Secretary Robert Gates, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served for eight year \u2014 under eight presidents.And this is what he said about Republican candidates, quote, \u201cPart of the concern that I have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works.\u201dSo, in that spirit, we\u2019re going to work tonight to be more specific.Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. You have said as president, you\u2019ll get up to speed very quickly. You\u2019ll know more quickly as president than any of the experts.So, you\u2019ve been elected president. It\u2019s your first day in the Situation Room. What three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world?TRUMP: What we want to do, when we want to do it, and how hard do we want to hit? Because we are going to have to hit very, very hard to knock out ISIS.We\u2019re going to also have to learn who our allies are. We have allies, so-called allies, we\u2019re spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people \u2014 we have no idea who they are in Syria. Do we want to stay that route, or do we want to go and make something with Russia?I hate to say Iran, but with Russia, because we \u2014 and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life. It\u2019s a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal. But very important...(APPLAUSE)Not only a disgrace, it\u2019s a disgrace and an embarrassment. But very important, who are we fighting with? Who are we fighting for? What are we doing? We have to rebuild our country. But we have to \u2014 I\u2019m the only one on this stage that said: \u201cDo not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq.\u201d Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn\u2019t a politician, fortunately.But I said it, and I said it loud and clear, \u201cYou\u2019ll destabilize the Middle East.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what happened.I also said, by the way, four years ago, three years ago, attack the oil, take the wealth away, attack the oil and keep the oil. They didn\u2019t listen. They just started that a few months ago.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Rubio \u2014 just 30 seconds on this question, Senator Rubio. Are those the questions you would ask?RUBIO: No. I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of. No. 1 is, what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States.No. 2 is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni-Shia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East, also the growing threat of ISIS.And the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.DICKERSON: Let me ask you a follow-up, a full, proper question, then.(APPLAUSE)Violent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries. Some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability. And so, that\u2019s just the crises overseas. Barack Obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office. We face international health crises, from Ebola to Zika.So, there is a lot of opportunity for crisis, as you have talked about. What would you point to in your past to show voters that you\u2019ve been in a crisis and that you\u2019ve been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when you\u2019re president?RUBIO: Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago. One of the hardest decisions you\u2019ll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.So, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members. And it was hard because you looked at the pictures. I saw the same images people saw. I\u2019m the father of children. I saw the images of these little children \u2014 been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders, and we were angry. Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.And then I looked at Barack Obama\u2019s plan. Barack Obama\u2019s plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse. It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.So it was a difficult decision to make, and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it, and I voted against Barack Obama\u2019s plan to use force, and it was the right decision.DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I want to ask you a question...(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, you said you\u2019ve had more 2 a.m. \u2014 2 a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage. But when those 2 a.m. phone calls came, you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did, all of that learning. So if you were to be president, though, you wouldn\u2019t have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the 2 a.m. phone call comes. So isn\u2019t that a liability?CARSON: No, it isn\u2019t. First of all, let me go back to your first question for me. It wasn\u2019t phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees. Of course that\u2019s the president. So I know that there are some left-wing media who would try to make hay on that.Secondly, thank you for including me in the debate. Two questions already. This is great. Now, as far...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)As far as those 2 a.m. phone calls are concerned, judgment is what is required. And the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very, very difficult and very unique. One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before. So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before. That\u2019s where judgment comes in.And that, I think, is a situation that we\u2019re in right now, a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation, and it comes in very handy in those situations.DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, Russia is being credited...(APPLAUSE)Russia is being credited with bombing U.S.-backed rebels on behalf of Assad in Aleppo and Syria. They\u2019ve also moved into the Crimea, eastern Ukraine. You\u2019ve said you want to punch them in the nose. What does that mean? What are you going to do?KASICH: First of all \u2014 yes. First of all, look, we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect. We don\u2019t have to declare an enemy, rattle a sword or threaten, but we need to make it clear what we expect. No. 1 is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom. They deserve it. There will be no ifs, ands or buts about it.Secondly, an attack on NATO, trumped up on any excuse of Russian-speaking people, either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden, is going to be an attack on us. And look, I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.The Egyptians, the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Gulf states, they all know they\u2019re at risk. We need to look into Europe, we look at France, we look at Germany and the migrants. We look at Belgium, we look at Britain. Everybody now is being threatened by radical Islam. We have an opportunity to lead.You know, the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership. Sometimes they may \u2014 they may make a remark here or there that we don\u2019t like, but frankly, the world needs us. And we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people, those who respect civilization, the rights of women, the rights to protest, to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best we\u2019ve ever seen.DICKERSON: Governor...(APPLAUSE)Governor Bush.BUSH: Yes.DICKERSON: You said defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad. But wouldn\u2019t that also put us into conflict with Russia, a country that supports Assad? So doesn\u2019t that mean, effectively, Assad\u2019s there to stay?BUSH: No, it doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s the problem. The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS. It\u2019s a complete, unmitigated disaster. And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren\u2019t a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.This is the problem. Donald Trump brought up the fact that he would \u2014 he\u2019d want to accommodate Russia. Russia is not taking out ISIS. They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re attacking our \u2014 our \u2014 our team, the team that we\u2019ve been training and the team that we\u2019ve been supporting. It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Russia could be a positive partner in this. They are on the run. They are making \u2014 every time we step back, they\u2019re on the run. The question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do \u2014 what three things would you do.I would restore the military, the sequester needs to be reversed. I would have a strategy to destroy ISIS, and I would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to Iran\u2019s ambitions, and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for Iran to do what it\u2019s doing, which is to move towards a nuclear weapon.Those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... in 2017.DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, you were mentioned here. You did say that you could get along very well with Vladimir Putin. You did at one point say let Russia take care of ISIS...TRUMP: ... (INAUDIBLE) called me a genius, I like him so far, I have to tell you. Let me just tell you this.Jeb is so wrong. Jeb is absolutely self \u2014 just so you understand, you know what that is? That\u2019s Jeb\u2019s special interest and lobbyist talking.Look, let me just tell you something, Jeb \u2014 Jeb is so wrong. You got to fight ISIS first. You fight ISIS first. Right now you have Russia, you have Iran, you have them with Assad, and you have them with Syria. You have to knock out ISIS. They\u2019re chopping off heads. These are animals. You have to knock \u2019em out. You have to knock them off strong. You decide what to do after, you can\u2019t fight two wars at one time.If you listen to him, and you listen to some of the folks that I\u2019ve been listening to, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we haven\u2019t won anything. We\u2019ve spent $5 trillion dollars in the Middle East with thinking like that. We\u2019ve spent $5...(BELL RINGING)TRUMP: Lindsey Graham, who backs him, had zero on his polls. Let me just say something \u2014 we\u2019ve spent \u2014 we\u2019ve spent.I only tell the truth, lobbyists.We\u2019ve spent $5 trillion dollars all over the \u2014 we have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. You listen to that, you\u2019re going to be there for another 15...DICKERSON: ... All right...TRUMP: ... You\u2019ll end up with World War III...DICKERSON: ... All right, Governor Bush, please respond.BUSH: The very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be an ally of the United States. The whole world knows this. It\u2019s a simple, basic fact.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: They\u2019re not taking out \u2014 they\u2019re not even attempting to take out ISIS. They\u2019re attacking the troops that we\u2019re supporting. We need to create a coalition, Sunni-led coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy ISIS and bring about stability. And you can\u2019t do that with Assad in power. He has...TRUMP: ... We\u2019re supporting troops...BUSH: ... Let me finish...TRUMP: ... that we don\u2019t even know who they are.DICKERSON: ... O.K., settle...BUSH: ... This is ridiculous...TRUMP: ... We\u2019re supporting troops that we don\u2019t even know who they are...DICKERSON: ... All right, Mr. Trump, all right...TRUMP: We have no idea who they are.DICKERSON: Gentleman, I think we\u2019re going to leave that there. I\u2019ve got a question for Senator...BUSH: ... This is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows.TRUMP: ... Oh, yeah, yeah...BUSH: ... This is a guy who thinks that Hillary Clinton is a great negotiator in Iran...TRUMP: ... Let 44 million in New Hampshire, it was practically (INAUDIBLE)...BUSH: ... This is a man who insults his way to the nomination...TRUMP: ... 44 million \u2014 give me a break.(CROSSTALK)DICKERSON: ... All right, all right, gentlemen, gentlemen, let\u2019s leave it there so I can ask a question of Senator Cruz, who\u2019s also running for president.(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Cruz, you talked about the first Gulf War as being a kind of model for your focused and determined effort to go after ISIS. But there were 700,000 ground troops as a part of that, and you don\u2019t have a ground component to your plan. Why?CRUZ: Well, we need to focus on what the objective is, you know? Your question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room. I think it is a problem if the president, commander in chief, we\u2019ve elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on Day 1.If you look at the threats facing this country, the single gravest threat, national security threat, is the threat of a nuclear Iran. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve pledged on Day 1 to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal, and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Khamenei does not understand the nature of Khamenei.When it comes to ISIS, we\u2019ve got to have a focused objective. One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy, and, sadly, too many establishment Republicans in Washington, is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country. They focus on nation building, they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy, and it ends up undermining our national security.Now, with regard to ISIS, we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war. They\u2019ve declared a jihad on us.Now, what do we need...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... to carry that out. We need overwhelming air power, we need to arm the Kurds, who can be our boots on the ground, and if ground troops are necessary, then we should employ them, but it shouldn\u2019t be politicians demonstrating political toughness. It should be military expert judgment carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Very quickly, 30-second follow-up. You\u2019ve said that, essentially, the Kurds would be the American ground forces in there. The criticism that experts have on that is that the Kurds only can work within their territory.If they take larger amounts of territory, you have an ethnic war with the Arabs. So the Kurds can\u2019t really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs.CRUZ: We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria. They are fighting ISIS right now. They are winning victories right now. ISIS is using American military equipment they\u2019ve seized in Iraq. And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the pesh merga, the fighting forces who have been longtime allies.We ought to be arming them and letting them fight. Now, if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power, if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS, we should use them, but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.The first Persian Gulf War, we launched 1,100 air attacks a day. Today, we\u2019re launching between 15 and 30. We\u2019re not using the tools we have, and it\u2019s because the commander in chief is not focused on defeating the enemy.DICKERSON: All right. Mr. Trump...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: ... On Monday, George W. Bush will campaign in South Carolina for his brother. As you\u2019ve said tonight, and you\u2019ve often said, the Iraq war and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment.In 2008, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer, talking about President George W. Bush\u2019s conduct of the war, you said you were surprised that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t try to impeach him.You said, quote: \u201cWhich, personally, I think would have been a wonderful thing.\u201d When you were asked what you meant by that and you said: \u201cFor the war, for the war, he lied, he got us into the war with lies.\u201d Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached?TRUMP: First of all, I have to say, as a businessman, I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world.(BOOING)TRUMP: I know so many of the people in the audience. And by the way, I\u2019m a self-funder. I don\u2019t have \u2014 I have my wife and I have my son. That\u2019s all I have. I don\u2019t have this.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: So let me just tell you, I get along with everybody, which is my obligation to my company, to myself, et cetera.Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake. All right? Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took \u2014 it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced for president, it took him five days.He went back, it was a mistake, it wasn\u2019t a mistake. It took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we don\u2019t even have it. Iran has taken over Iraq, with the second-largest oil reserves in the world.Obviously, it was a mistake.DICKERSON: So...TRUMP: George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.DICKERSON: But so I\u2019m going to \u2014 so you still think he should be impeached?BUSH: I think it\u2019s my turn, isn\u2019t it?TRUMP: You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.(BOOING)DICKERSON: All right. O.K. All right.Governor Bush \u2014 when a member on the stage\u2019s brother gets attacked...BUSH: I\u2019ve got about five or six...DICKERSON: ... the brother gets to respond.BUSH: Do I get to do it five or six times or just once, responding to that?TRUMP: I\u2019m being nice.BUSH: So here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: And, frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. It\u2019s blood sport for him. He enjoys it. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s happy about it. But I am sick and tired...TRUMP: He spent $22 million in...(CROSSTALK)BUSH: I am sick and tired of him going after my family. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I\u2019m proud of what he did.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: And he has had the gall to go after my brother.TRUMP: The World Trade Center came down during your brother\u2019s reign, remember that.(BOOING)BUSH: He has had the gall to go after my mother.Hold on. Let me finish. He has had the gall to go after my mother.TRUMP: That\u2019s not keeping us safe.BUSH: Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago, looked up, and I saw my mom. My mom is the strongest woman I know.TRUMP: She should be running.BUSH: This is not about my family or his family. This is about the South Carolina families that need someone to be a commander in chief that can lead. I\u2019m that person.DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, would you weigh in on...(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor Kasich, please weigh in.KASICH: I\u2019ve got to tell you, this is just crazy, huh?(LAUGHTER)KASICH: This is just nuts, O.K.? Jeez, oh, man. I\u2019m sorry, John.DICKERSON: Why is it nuts? Talk about it. Give us your sense of...KASICH: Oh, well, listen, I think being in Iraq, look, we thought there were weapons of mass destruction. Colin Powell, who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time, said there were weapons there.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: But, but, the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war. The Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, never gotten along. In fact, that country was drawn \u2014 the borders of that country were drawn after World War I by Westerners that didn\u2019t understand what was happening there. The tragedy of it is that we\u2019re still embroiled. And, frankly, if there weren\u2019t weapons of mass destruction, we should never have gone. I don\u2019t believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars. Civil wars are not in our direct interest, and if you \u2014 and look, I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.The fact is, is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest. We should not be policemen of the world, but when we go, we mean business. We\u2019ll do our job. We\u2019ll tell our soldiers, our people in the service, take care of your job and then come home once we\u2019ve accomplished our goals.That\u2019s what we need to do.DICKERSON: Thirty seconds, Senator Rubio.RUBIO: I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore.(APPLAUSE)And you can \u2014 I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things, but he kept us safe. And not only did he keep us safe, but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldn\u2019t do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.And again, he kept us safe, and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center \u2014 the World \u2014 excuse me. I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe, Marco. That is not safe.RUBIO: The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn\u2019t kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And George Bush \u2014 by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didn\u2019t listen to the advice of his C.I.A.DICKERSON: All right, Dr. Carson, we have a cleansing...BUSH: Can I just...DICKERSON: We have a cleansing...BUSH: I\u2019m not going to invite Donald Trump to the rally in Charleston on Monday afternoon when my brother is coming to speak.TRUMP: I don\u2019t want to go.(LAUGHTER)BUSH: I\u2019m rescinding the invitation. I thought you might want to come, but I guess not.DICKERSON: All right. Well, Dr. Carson, I have got a question now for you.A moment of pause here. You have said, Dr. Carson, that \u2014 referring to yourself, that people bought into the idea that, quote, \u201cA nice person can\u2019t be tough on terrorists.\u201dYou have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military, which could lead to more civilian casualties.So, explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just address the Iraq question.You know, I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq, primarily because I have studied, you know, the Middle East, recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years. And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, you\u2019re going to have chaos.Now, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation.(APPLAUSE)Now, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldn\u2019t bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.You know, that\u2019s just asinine thinking. And the fact of the matter is...(APPLAUSE)You know, we \u2014 obviously, you\u2019re not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage. You have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not.DICKERSON: All right, thank you, Dr. Carson.We\u2019re going to have to take a commercial break here. Thank you to all the candidates. We\u2019ll be right back with CBS News\u2019s 2016 debate in Greenville, South Carolina.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: We\u2019re back with the Republicans who could be president. The topic now is money and how the candidates would spend it. We\u2019ll turn the questioning over to Kimberley Strassel of The Wall Street Journal and Major Garrett of CBS News. Kim?STRASSEL: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Yes.STRASSEL: You have made a lot of promises and you have also \u2014 you\u2019re the only candidate who has said he would not touch entitlements. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional $12 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 7.7 percent to 9 percent annually to pay for them. Are you proposing more than you can actually deliver, at least not without big deficits?TRUMP: First of all, the \u2014 when you say I\u2019m the only candidate, if you listen to the Democrats, they want to do many things to Social Security, and I want to do them on its own merit. You listen to them, what they want to do to Social Security, none of these folks are getting elected, O.K., whether they can do it or not. I\u2019m going to save Social Security. I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China. I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where they\u2019re all \u2014 every country throughout the world \u2014 now Vietnam, that\u2019s the new one.They are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. They are taking our base. And you and I have had this discussion. We\u2019re going to make our economy strong again. I\u2019m lowering taxes. We have $2.5 trillion offshore. We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what they\u2019re doing or saying, as they\u2019ve proven very well.We\u2019re going to bring that money back. You take a look at what happened just this week. China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange, China, a Chinese company. Carrier is moving to Mexico, air conditioning company. Not only the ones I talk about all the time, Nabisco and Ford and \u2014 they\u2019re all moving out.We have an economy that last quarter, G.D.P. didn\u2019t grow. It was flat. We have to make our economy grow again. We\u2019re dying. This country is dying. And our workers are losing their jobs, and you\u2019re going...STRASSEL: But in terms of...TRUMP: I\u2019m the only one who is going to save Social Security, believe me.STRASSEL: O.K. But how would you actually do that? Can I ask you? Because right now, Social Security and Medicare...TRUMP: Because you have tremendous waste. I\u2019ll tell you...STRASSEL: They take up two-thirds of the federal budget, and they\u2019re growing.TRUMP: You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. That we\u2019re taking care of. That we\u2019re taking care of. It\u2019s tremendous. We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old. Now, you know they don\u2019t exist. They don\u2019t exist. There\u2019s tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we\u2019re going to get it. But we\u2019re not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they\u2019re supposed to get less. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back. We\u2019re going to make our economy great again.GARRETT: Senator Cruz.(APPLAUSE)John mentioned this is about dollars and incentives. We also want to talk about economic growth engagements. You have proposed a consumption tax, you called it the \u201cback tax.\u201d Some analysts compare it more to an attributed \u201cvalue-added tax.\u201dFrom the perspective from economic growth in building wages, how does that work, and how would you address those longstanding conservative concerns that something approaching the \u201cvalue-added tax\u201d would be used to constantly increase those rates to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation, not of growth?CRUZ: Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands \u2014 everyone understands that how \u2014 that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy, and we\u2019ve got to bring jobs back. We\u2019ve got to get people back to work. We\u2019ve got to get wages going up again. We\u2019ve got to get people moving from part-time work to full-time work.We all agree on that, but it\u2019s not going to be solved with magic pixie dust. It\u2019s just going to be solved by declaring into the air, \u201cLet there be jobs.\u201d We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.Now, where do you get economic growth? If you look at cause and effect over our nation\u2019s history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small-business owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth. You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.My tax plan \u2014 typical family of four, first $36,000 you earn, you pay nothing in taxes \u2014 no income taxes, no payroll taxes, no nothing. Above 10 percent, everyone pays the same simple, flat 10 percent income rate. It\u2019s flat and fair. You can fill out your taxes on a postcard, and we abolish the I.R.S. If you want to see the postcard, I\u2019ve got it on my website.GARRETT: Now, the question \u2014 conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time, but especially on this consumption value-added tax system. In Europe, where it exists, it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending, and that\u2019s why conservatives have long resisted it. Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen?CRUZ: Now, Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax. The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.One of the things that\u2019s critical is we\u2019re doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes, which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans, and with abolishing the death tax, which is cruel and unfair. And you asked about economic growth \u2014 the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone\u2019s income by double digits.That\u2019s how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it, but implementing policies that work.STRASSEL: O.K., I have a question, a related tax question.Senator Rubio, you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates, 35 percent. Some economists say, \u201cIt would limit its potential to boost economic growth.\u201d You do that so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.Normally, it\u2019s liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy. Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side\u2019s approach?RUBIO: Well, because I\u2019m influencing social policy \u2014 this is their money. This is the money of parents. You don\u2019t earn the tax credit unless you\u2019re working. That\u2019s your money, it doesn\u2019t belong to government.Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. If a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write off their taxes. But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children, they don\u2019t? This makes no sense.Parenting is the most important job any of us will ever have. Family formation is the most important thing in society. So what my tax plan does, is it does create, especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit. So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government\u2019s money, to invest in their children to go to school, to go to a private school, to buy a new backpack.Let me tell you, if you\u2019re a parent that\u2019s struggling, then you know that $50 a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids. I\u2019m going to have a tax plan that is pro-family, because the family is the most important institution in society. You cannot have a strong country without strong families.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: Governor Kasich, this on is on size of government. In 2013, you pushed through a Medicaid reform in your state over the rejections of many of the Republicans in your state. Total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected, including yourself. How can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs?KASICH: Yeah. Well, first of all, those numbers, incorrect. We are \u2014 our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates, and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent.And Kimberley, let me tell you, when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they don\u2019t live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.When we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons, and we save $22,500 a year.Guess what else? They get their lives back. And the working poor, they\u2019re now getting health care. And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer.So, what I would tell you is, we\u2019ve gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We\u2019ve cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion. We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since I\u2019ve been governor.Our credit is strong. Our pensions are strong. And frankly, we leave no one behind. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We want everyone to rise, and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.And that is exactly the program we\u2019re driving in Ohio. And, boy, people ought to look at Ohio, because it has got a good formula.(APPLAUSE)GARRETT: Governor Bush, a question for you \u2014 but if you want to jump in, please.BUSH: I\u2019d like \u2014 can I \u2014 can I...GARRETT: Jump in, and then I\u2019ve got a question for you.BUSH: Look, I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health. I think that\u2019s a high priority all across this country, but expanding Obamacare is what we\u2019re talking about, and Obamacare\u2019s expansion, even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it, is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different.(APPLAUSE)When I was \u2014 as a private citizen, Florida was confronted with the choice. The governor was supportive of doing what John did. So was the Florida Senate. A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.I did, and it wasn\u2019t expanded there, just as it wasn\u2019t expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley.(CROSSTALK)GARRETT: Real quickly, jump in, because I have got a question for Governor Bush, but jump in.KASICH: Yeah, let me say a couple of things.First of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand \u2014 his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine. O.K.? It\u2019s just a fact.Now, with Obamacare, I\u2019ve not only sued the administration, I did not set up an exchange. And he knows that I\u2019m not for Obamacare, never have been. But here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about Medicaid.You know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job? President Ronald Reagan.Now, the fact of the matter is, we expanded to get people on their feet, and once they\u2019re on their feet, we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation.GARRETT: Understood, Governor Kasich.KASICH: That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in our state.BUSH: South Carolina \u2014 South Carolinians need to know this, because the Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank him right at the bottom.GARRETT: Yeah, Governor Bush, fine.BUSH: And Governor Haley is ranked at the top.(CROSSTALK)GARRETT: Let me get in a question from...BUSH: No. He mentioned my name.GARRETT: I understand, I understand.BUSH: Let me finish, though. No, no, no \u2014 hey, wait, wait, wait. Just hold, Major, hold, Major. Hold on, Major.(CROSSTALK)BUSH: South Carolinians want to make that, they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win.KASICH: Let me \u2014 let\u2019s tell you...GARRETT: I have a question on economic growth, Governor Bush.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Major \u2014 Major, we can\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019ve got to \u2014 look, I have got to correct the record. And the fact of the matter is, we went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. Our credit is rock solid.And I don\u2019t know...GARRETT: A (INAUDIBLE), Governor.KASICH: Look, the bottom line is the people of this \u2014 of this country and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I don\u2019t want to get into all this fighting tonight, because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning.GARRETT: I know, understood. Governor Bush.KASICH: And I\u2019m going to stay positive about what I want to do from the...(APPLAUSE)GARRETT: Governor Bush, from the perspective, economic growth \u2014 viewed from this perspective of economic growth, you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers.The Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative tax group you\u2019re probably aware of, has said no Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains. And many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy, but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency?The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.BUSH: Of course not. It won\u2019t have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income. In fact, it\u2019s not just hedge fund people, but people that are doing \u2014 they\u2019re in the business of investing other people\u2019s money, getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate.They should be paying ordinary income. That\u2019s their business. They\u2019re grateful to be able to make a lot of money, I\u2019m sure. And what we do is lower the rates. It\u2019s not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room. That\u2019s not a problem at all. What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C. That\u2019s what I did as governor of the state of Florida, $19 billion dollars of tax cuts, and it stimulated seven out of the eight years. Florida led the nation in job growth.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, before we go to break, could you give us your sense of this conversation about either Medicaid or economic growth through taxation?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just mention on the tax issue. Bencarson.com, go read about it, because my tax plan has been praised by Cato, by Wall Street Journal. Forbes said it is the best, the most pro-growth tax plan, and it\u2019s based on real fairness for everybody. Starts at the 150 percent poverty level, but even the people below that have to pay something, because everybody has to have skin in the game, and the millions of people can\u2019t, you know, talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game.And it deals with corporate tax rate, and makes it the same as everybody else...(BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... Everybody pays exactly the same.DICKERSON: Doctor...CARSON: ... And, as far as Medicare and Medicaid, my main goal is to get rid of Obamacare and put the care back in the hands of (INAUDIBLE)...GARRETT: ... Dr. Carson...DICKERSON: ... Dr. Carson, I\u2019m sorry, we have to go to a commercial. The free market wants what it wants.Back soon with the 2016 Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Welcome back. We\u2019ll begin the second half of the debate with one of the hottest issues in the Republican campaign, immigration. But before I turn it back to Major Garrett and Kim Strassel, I have one question for Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump, in the Republican National Committee\u2019s Spanish-language response to the State of the Union, Congressman Diaz-Balart said, quote, \u201cIt\u2019s essential that we find a legislative solution,\u201d talking about immigration, \u201cto offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows. What does that mean to you, \u201ca humane solution to those who live in the shadows\u201d?TRUMP: I want everybody taken care of, but we have to take care of our people in this country. We\u2019re not taking care of our people. We have no border. We have no control. People are flooding across. We can\u2019t have it. We either have a border, and I\u2019m very strongly \u2014 I\u2019m not proposing. I will build a wall. I will build a wall.Remember this, the wall will be paid for by Mexico. We are not being treated right.(APPLAUSE)We are not being treated properly. If we don\u2019t have borders, if we don\u2019t have strength, we don\u2019t have a country. People are flowing across. We have to take care of our people. Believe me.GARRETT: Senator Rubio...(APPLAUSE)For the purposes of the lines \u2014 lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform, define amnesty.RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that \u2014 I\u2019ve never supported that. I do not support that. I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws. What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is we\u2019re not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first, illegal immigration is brought under control.You go back to 1986, when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border. It didn\u2019t happen, and as a result, people have lost trust in the federal government. It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that it\u2019s working.They want to see the wall built. They want to see the additional border agents. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see an entry-exit tracking system. Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas. And only after all of that is in place, then we\u2019ll see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.I think the American people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit. But you can\u2019t do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz, you have promised to deport illegal aliens. You have also promised to reverse President Obama\u2019s executive action that gives temporary amnesty to illegals brought here by their parent as children. As president, you would have the names and addresses of the some 800,000 of those that have registered under that action. Now, you have said that in this country, we shouldn\u2019t go door to door, look for illegals, but in this case you would have a list. Would you use it?CRUZ: Well, you know, your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage. You know, in a Republican primary, everyone talks tough on immigration. Everyone is against illegal immigration in a Republican primary. But as voters, we\u2019ve been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don\u2019t walk the walk.There are sharp differences on amnesty. If you look at the folks on this stage, when Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan, I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: So would you \u2014 would you use the addresses?CRUZ: Now, that moment...STRASSEL: Would you pick them up?CRUZ: That moment was what Reagan would call \u201ca time for choosing.\u201d When it comes to deciding which side of the line you\u2019re on, the Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan...(BOOING)CRUZ: ... apparently supported by the donor class, which is why Washington supported it. The Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan passed the Senate, and it was on the verge of passing the House.House leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans. And the question for anyone on illegal immigration is, where were you in that fight? Where did you stand?You are right. There is a difference between Senator Rubio and me on this question.(CROSSTALK)STRASSEL: Senator Rubio, your reply.RUBIO: We\u2019re going to have to do this again, O.K.? When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz, at a committee hearing, very passionately said, I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows. And he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here.Not only that, he proposed doubling the number of green cards. He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers. Now his position is different. Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things.So he either wasn\u2019t telling the truth then or he isn\u2019t telling the truth now, but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true.(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Major, I get a response to that.GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz.STRASSEL: All right. Senator Cruz. Your response, Senator Cruz.CRUZ: You know, the lines are very, very clear. Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally. I oppose citizenship. Marco stood on the debate stage and said that.But I would note not only that \u2014 Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.I have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.(MIX OF APPLAUSE AND BOOING)CRUZ: And on the question...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t know how he knows what I said on Univision, because he doesn\u2019t speak Spanish. And second of all, the other point that I would make...CRUZ: (SPEAKING SPANISH).RUBIO: Look, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. He\u2019s lying about all sorts of things. And now he makes things up. The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it. And they see the truth behind all these issues.And here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country...CRUZ: That is simply...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ... and only now does he say...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: That is absolutely false. What he said is knowingly false. And I would note, if you want to assess \u2014 if you want to assess...RUBIO: Well, we\u2019ll put on our website, marcorubio.com. We\u2019re going to...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ... who is telling the truth...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: If you want to assess who is telling the truth...(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... then you should look to Jeff Sessions, who said, without Ted Cruz the Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill would have passed, and Ted was responsible. You should look to Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, that said...(CROSSTALK)GARRETT: Governor Bush, I want to bring this out to a little wider philosophical aspect, if you will.BUSH: Thank you.GARRETT: You have said illegal immigrants, quote, \u201cbroke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony,\u201d still quoting you, \u201cit\u2019s an act of love, it\u2019s an act of commitment to your family.\u201dMr. Trump has, as you are well aware, denounced that statement over and over. Do you still believe it? What does that mean to you? And how does that inform your approach to immigration reform?BUSH: Great question. I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie, and point out that the reason why I should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that didn\u2019t pass.(APPLAUSE)BUSH: This is \u2014 this is the problem. We need a leader to fix this problem. And I have a detailed plan to do just that, including controlling the border, dealing with the visa over-stayers, making sure that we have a path to legal status, not to citizenship, for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine, learn English, don\u2019t commit crimes, work and pay taxes.That is the better approach.GARRETT: Fundamentally, do you believe this rhetoric is insufficiently compassionate to this issue?BUSH: The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice. They want to come to provide for their families. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right.We should pick who comes to our country. We should control our border. Coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally. But the motivation, they\u2019re not all rapists, as you-know-who said. They\u2019re not that.These are people that are coming to provide for their families. And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they\u2019re struggling. It doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be controlling the border. That\u2019s exactly what we should be doing.GARRETT: Mr. Trump...TRUMP: Look...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... When I announced that I was running for president on June 16th, illegal immigration wasn\u2019t even a subject. If I didn\u2019t bring it up, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking. Now, I don\u2019t often agree with Marco, and I don\u2019t often agree with Ted, but I can in this case. The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush. They come out of an act of love, whether you like it or not. He is so weak on illegal immigration it\u2019s laughable, and everybody knows it.BUSH: ... So, you know...(BELL RINGING)BUSH: ... This is the standard operating procedure, to disparage me. That\u2019s fine...TRUMP: ... Spend a little more money on the commercials...BUSH: ... But, if you want to talk about weakness, you want to talk about weakness? It\u2019s weak to disparage women.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (INAUDIBLE). I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.BUSH: It\u2019s weak to denigrate the disabled. And,it\u2019s really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a...TRUMP: ... I never called him \u2014 I don\u2019t call him..BUSH: ... That is outrageous. The guy\u2019s an American hero.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: He also said about language...BUSH: ... The simple fact is I\u2019ve also laid out my plans on (INAUDIBLE) immigration...TRUMP: ... Language. Two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody, and that\u2019s fine. Nobody reports that. He gets up and says that, and then he tells me, oh, my language was a little bit rough...STRASSEL: ... O.K....TRUMP: ... My language. Give me a break...GARRETT: ... Governor Kasich, here in South Carolina earlier this week, you said the idea, the concept of deporting 11 million undocumented workers...BUSH: (INAUDIBLE) Just, for the record (INAUDIBLE) make sure my mother\u2019s listening, if she\u2019s watching the debate. I didn\u2019t say that I was going to moon somebody...TRUMP: ... You did say it, you did say it. Been reported in 10 different news...GARRETT: ... We will leave the moon metaphors to be adjudicated later, I assure you. Governor Kasich, you said earlier this week in South Carolina, the concept, the idea of deporting 11 million undocumented workers in this country is nuts. Why is it you are so opposed to that idea? Senator Cruz has said it\u2019s a simple application of existing law. The application of that is not inhumane, it is just. Why do you disagree?KASICH: Before I get to that, this is the ninth or 10th debate. What I\u2019ve been watching here, this back and forth, and these attacks, some of them are personal. I think we\u2019re fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don\u2019t stop this.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: I mean, the fact is \u2014 you know what? I would suggest, why don\u2019t we take off all the negative ads and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what we\u2019re for, and let\u2019s sell that, and the Republican Party will be stronger as a result...GARRETT: ... What are you for on immigration?KASICH: ... (OFF MIKE) (INAUDIBLE) First of all, I\u2019m for sealing the border, O.K.? And then I\u2019m for a guest worker program. People can come in, work and go back home. We haven\u2019t closed the border because special interests, I believe, blocked it. Then, we have 11 and a half million people here. If they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, make them pay a fine and some back taxes, and give them a path to legalization, never to citizenship.It is not going to happen that we\u2019re going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes.I\u2019ll tell you this. Within the first hundred days, I will send a plan like this to the Congress of the United States, and if I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll bet you dollar to doughnuts right now, it will pass.(BELL RINGING)That is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country, in my judgment, will support, and so will the bulk of the Congress of the United States.(APPLAUSE)STRASSEL: Moving subjects. Dr. Carson, this week Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $3.2 billion fine to state and federal authorities for contributing to the mortgage crisis. You have a lot of Democrats out saying that we should be jailing more executives, so two questions.Should financial executives be held legally responsible for financial crisis, and do you think fines like these are an effective way to deter companies from future behavior like that?CARSON: Well, first of all, please go to my website, bencarson.com, and read my immigration policy, O.K.? Because it actually makes sense.Now, the \u2014 as far as these fines are concerned, you know? Here\u2019s the big problem. We\u2019ve got all these government regulators, and all they\u2019re doing is running around looking for people to fine. And we\u2019ve got 645 different federal agencies and sub-agencies. Way, way too many, and they don\u2019t have anything else to do.I think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability, economic viability of our society. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some people out there who are doing bad things. But I\u2019m not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden. You know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know? $2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family, that happens to be the same level as the poverty level...(BELL RINGING)CARSON: ... for a family of four. If you want to get rid of poverty, get rid of all the regulations.DICKERSON: Senator Cruz, I have a question for you. Speaker Paul Ryan has made a big commitment to trying to lift the 50 million poor out of poverty. Arthur Brooks, who is the president of the American Enterprise Institute, says, quote, \u201cIf we are not warriors for the poor every day, free enterprise has no matter.\u201d How you have been, in your campaign, a warrior for the poor?CRUZ: I think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy had been the most vulnerable. It\u2019s been young people. It\u2019s been Hispanics. It\u2019s been African-Americans. It\u2019s been single moms. We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977.And the sad reality is big government, massive taxes, massive regulation, doesn\u2019t work. What we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth, let \u2014 small businesses are the heart of the economy. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses. If we want to lift people out of poverty \u2014 you know, I think of these issues from the perspective of my dad.My dad fled Cuba in 1957. He was just 18. He couldn\u2019t speak English. He had nothing. He had $100 in his underwear. And he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school. Today, my dad is a pastor. He travels the country preaching the gospel.Now, I think about all of these issues. How would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes? If we had Obamacare in place right now, the odds are very high my father would have been laid off, because it\u2019s teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off. If he didn\u2019t get laid off, the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28, 29 hours a week.We need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs, and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work.GARRETT: Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump.(APPLAUSE)I was with you in Pendleton, South Carolina, earlier this week at the Rodeo Arena. It was a bit chilly there. You promised the crowd, and they rose to their feet, that if Ford or a company like were to move a factory to Mexico, you would try to stop it or threaten them with a 35 percent tax or tariff on every car sold.TRUMP: Or a tax.GARRETT: Right. So my question is, based on your understanding of the presidency, where do you derive that power? Would you need the consent of Congress to go along? And do you see the presidency as a perch from which you can cajole and/or threaten private industry to do something you think is better for the U.S. economy?TRUMP: I would build consensus with Congress, and Congress would agree with me. I\u2019ll give you an example, because I don\u2019t like the idea of using executive orders like our president. It is a disaster what he\u2019s doing. I would build consensus, but consensus means you have to work hard. You have to cajole. You have to get them into the Oval Office and get them all together, and you have to make deals.Let me just tell you, I mentioned before, China \u2014 big Chinese company bought the Chicago Exchange. Kerry is moving \u2014 and if you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, O.K.?Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. I would go right now to Carrier and I would say I am going to work awfully hard. You\u2019re going to make air conditioners now in Mexico. You\u2019re going to get all of these 1,400 people that are being laid off \u2014 they\u2019re laid off. They were crying. They were \u2014 it was a very sad situation. You\u2019re going to go to Mexico. You\u2019re going to make air conditioners in Mexico, you\u2019re going to put them across our border with no tax.I\u2019m going to tell them right now, I am going to get consensus from Congress and we\u2019re going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States, because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: All right. Mr. Trump, thank you so much. We\u2019re going to take a break for a moment. We\u2019ll be back in a moment with the CBS News Republican debate.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: We\u2019re back now from Greenville, South Carolina, with the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.Mr. Trump, I have a question for you. Presidents have to, on the one hand, be firm, but also be flexible.You have been flexible and changed your opinion on a number of things, from abortion to Hillary Clinton. But you have said, rightly, that it\u2019s just like Ronald Reagan, who changed his mind on things.But at the same time, you\u2019re criticizing Senator Cruz for what you say is a change on immigration. He disputes that, of course.So, why is your change of opinion make you like Reagan, and when he changes his opinion, it\u2019s a huge character flaw?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: John, in life you have flexibility. You do have flexibility. When you\u2019re fighting wars, you\u2019re going one way, you have a plan. It\u2019s a beautiful plan. It can\u2019t lose. The enemy makes a change, and all of a sudden you have to change.You have to have flexibility. In Ronald Reagan, though, in terms of what we\u2019re talking about, was the great example. He was a somewhat liberal Democrat who became a somewhat, pretty strong conservative. He became \u2014 most importantly, he became a great president. He made many of the changes that I\u2019ve made \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve seen as I grew up, I\u2019ve seen, and as I get older and wiser, and I feel that I am a conservative.Now, I also feel I\u2019m a common-sense conservative, because some of the views I don\u2019t agree with. And I think a lot of people agree with me, obviously, based on what\u2019s happening.DICKERSON: Which conservative idea don\u2019t you agree with?TRUMP: Well, I think these people always hit me with eminent domain, and frankly, I\u2019m not in love with eminent domain. But eminent domain is something you need very strongly.When Jeb had said, \u201cYou used eminent domain privately for a parking lot.\u201d It wasn\u2019t for a parking lot. The state of New Jersey \u2014 too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you \u2014 the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people.I mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development. Now, just so you understand, I got hit very hard. It\u2019s private, it\u2019s private eminent domain. You understand that they took over a stadium in Texas, and they used private eminent domain, but he just found that out after he made the charge.DICKERSON: All right. Governor Bush, I think by \u201cthey,\u201d he is referring to your brother, these on the hook for your brother.TRUMP: Yeah. Well, Jeb wouldn\u2019t have known about it.BUSH: So, there \u2014 so, there is all sorts of intrigue about where I disagree with my brother, there would be one right there. You should not use eminent domain for private purposes.A baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: You shouldn\u2019t have used it then, Jeb.DICKERSON: But that was his brother.BUSH: It\u2019s very different. Transmission lines, pipe lines, bridges and highways. All of that is proper use of imminent domain. Not to take an elderly woman\u2019s home to build a parking lot so that high-rollers can come from New York City to build casinos in Atlantic City.STRASSEL: Senator Cruz, you were mentioned in the mix here, your response?CRUZ: You know, flexibility is a good thing, but it shouldn\u2019t \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t be flexible on core principles. I like Donald, he is an amazing entertainer, but his policies for most of his life...TRUMP: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.CRUZ: For most of his life, his policies have been very, very liberal. For most of his life, he has described himself as very pro- choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion. Right now, today, as a candidate, he supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. I disagree with him on that.That\u2019s a matter of principle, and I\u2019ll tell you...TRUMP: You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. You are single biggest liar. This guy\u2019s lied \u2014 let me just tell you, this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa, and he just continues. Today, we had robo-calls saying, \u201cDonald Trump is not going to run in South Carolina,\u201d where I\u2019m leading by a lot.I\u2019m not going to vote for Ted Cruz. This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson. This guy will say anything, nasty guy. Now I know why he doesn\u2019t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.CRUZ: Don, I need to go on...TRUMP: He\u2019s a nasty guy.CRUZ: I will say, it is fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called, \u201cpathological,\u201d and compared him to a child molester. Both of which were offensive and wrong.But let me say this \u2014 you notice Donald didn\u2019t disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. And Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record, he screams, \u201cLiar, liar, liar.\u201d You want to go...TRUMP: Where did I support it? Where did I...CRUZ: You want to go...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Again, where did I support it?CRUZ: If you want to watch the video, go to our website at Tedcruz.org.TRUMP: Hey Ted, where I support it?CRUZ: You can see it out of Donald\u2019s own mouth.TRUMP: Where did I support?CRUZ: You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood. You went on...TRUMP: That\u2019s a lot of lies.CRUZ: You said, \u201cPlanned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it.\u201dTRUMP: It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion.CRUZ: So I\u2019ll tell you what...TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women\u2019s health.CRUZ: You see, you and I...TRUMP: But not when it comes to abortion.CRUZ: Don, the reasoned principle matters. The reasoned principle matters, sadly was illustrated by the first questions today. The next president is going to appoint one, two, three, four Supreme Court justices.If Donald Trump is president, he will appoint liberals. If Donald Trump is president, your Second Amendment will gone...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Hold on...CRUZL You know how I know that?DICKERSON: Hold on, gentleman, I\u2019m going to turn this car around.TRUMP: Ted Cruz told your brother that he wanted John Roberts to be on the United States Supreme Court. They both pushed him, he twice approved Obamacare.DICKERSON: All right, gentlemen.BUSH: My name was mentioned twice.DICKERSON: Well, hold on. We\u2019re going to \u2014 gentlemen, we\u2019re in danger of driving this into the dirt.DICKERSON: Senator Rubio, I\u2019d like you to jump in here...BUSH: He called me a liar.DICKERSON: I understand, you\u2019re on deck, governor.BUSH: Also, he talked about one of my heroes, Ronald Reagan.Ronald Reagan was a liberal maybe in the 1950s. He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president, and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes. He was a conservative, and he didn\u2019t tear down people like Donald Trump is. He tore down the Berlin Wall.TRUMP: O.K., governor.BUSH: He was a great guy.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Cruz, 30 seconds on this one.CRUZ: I did not nominate John Roberts. I would not have nominated John Roberts.TRUMP: You pushed him. You pushed him.CRUZ: I supported...TRUMP: You worked with him and you pushed him. Why do you lie?CRUZ: You need to learn to not interrupt people.TRUMP: Why do you lie?CRUZ: Donald, adults learn...TRUMP: You pushed him.CRUZ: Adults learn not to interrupt people.TRUMP: Yeah, yeah, I know, you\u2019re an adult.CRUZ: I did not nominate him. I would not have nominated him. I would\u2019ve nominated my former boss Liberman, who was Justice Scalia\u2019s first law clerk. And you know how I know that Donald\u2019s Supreme Court justices will be liberals? Because his entire life, he support liberals from Jimmy Carter, to Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry.In 2004, he contributed to John Kerry. Nobody who cares about judges would contribute to John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid.DICKERSON: We\u2019re going to switch...CRUZ: That\u2019s what Donald Trump does.DICKERSON: We\u2019re going to switch here to Senator Marco Rubio.Senator Marco Rubio, please weigh in.RUBIO: On anything I want?DICKERSON: I thought you had a point?RUBIO: Well, let me talk about poverty.DICKERSON: I thought you had a point you wanted to make.RUBIO: I do.BUSH: That was me.RUBIO: I had something important.DICKERSON: You\u2019re on deck, sir.RUBIO: The issue of poverty is critical, because for me, poverty is the \u2014 is \u2014 is free enterprise not reaching people. Today, we have antipoverty programs that don\u2019t cure poverty. We don\u2019t cure poverty in America. Our antipoverty programs have become, in some instances, a way of life, a lifestyle.Now, we do need antipoverty programs, you can\u2019t have free enterprise programs without them, but not as a way of life. And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I don\u2019t \u2014 in 60 seconds, I can\u2019t describe it all, but it basically turns the program over to states. It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty, because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator, I wanted to ask you, just going back to immigration, in the last debate, you listed your series of accomplishments in the Senate. One thing you left off was \u2014 was immigration reform. Is it the case that in your list of accomplishments you can\u2019t mention that?RUBIO: Well, no. It\u2019s not the case. It didn\u2019t pass, and we haven\u2019t solved immigration in this country. It\u2019s still a problem. It is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago. And it has to be confronted and solved.But the only way forward on this issue \u2014 you asked a question about flexibility. Let me tell you about that. One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done, you must figure out the way to get it done. You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform. People do not trust the federal government.They want to see the law being enforced. They want to see illegal immigration come under control. They want to see that wall. They want to see E-Verify. They want to see all of these things working, and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise, you know, not criminals. But they\u2019re not going to do it until you first enforce the law.DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I have...(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, I have a question for you. Candidates are...CARSON: Before you ask the question, can I respond to the \u2014 you know, they mentioned my name a couple of times.DICKERSON: All right. You have 30 seconds, Doctor.CARSON: All right. Well, first of all, you know, so many people have said to me, \u201cYou need to scream and jump and down \u2014 jump up and down like everybody else.\u201d Is that really what you want? What we just saw? I don\u2019t think so.And you know, I \u2014 when I got into this race, I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington, D.C., and my first inclination was to run away, but I didn\u2019t do it because I\u2019m thinking about our children and the fact that we are the United States of America. And anybody up here is going to be much better than what\u2019s going to come on the other side. And what happened tonight with \u2014 with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election, and we cannot be tearing each other down.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I \u2014 let me ask you a different question. When you were \u2014 you were the first one, really, to talk about political correctness. Everybody now talks about it, but that was really what sparked your \u2014 your rise. Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make, just always selling happy, nice things. So in the \u2014 in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect, tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect?CARSON: Well, first of all, I\u2019m not a politician, so I\u2019m never going to become a politician. But here\u2019s what \u2014 here\u2019s what people need to know. People need to know that free college is not \u2014 it\u2019s a non-starter. You know, you have to look at our economic situation. We\u2019re on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, we\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s not just the $19 trillion, but it\u2019s also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.What we need to think about is, what does that do to the average person? When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the \u2014 the rates low, and who does does that affect? Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, that\u2019s gone. That part of the American dream is gone.All of these things are disappearing, and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich. They say those evil rich people, if we take their money we can solve the problem. It\u2019s not the evil rich people. It\u2019s the irresponsible, evil government.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve been described as the Democrats\u2019 favorite Republican. You talked about in New Hampshire, Democrats would come up to you and say, \u201cI hope you win.\u201d Why will that help you win a Republican nomination?KASICH: You know, John, I think all people are the same. Look, I did 106 town halls, and I\u2019ve been doing them left and right here in South Carolina. The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that we\u2019ve been able to do in Ohio. You need common-sense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.And when you have that formula, combined with work force that\u2019s trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs. I have done it twice, and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.John, the thing is, is I think that there are people now, these blue-collar Democrats \u2014 my dad was a blue-collar Democrat \u2014 the Democratic Party has left them. When they\u2019re arguing about being socialists, they\u2019ve left \u2014 they have lost those blue-collar Democrats.And you know what I think they get out of me \u2014 is my sense of what they get out of me, and it\u2019s embarrassment about campaigns, you brag about yourself.But I think I\u2019m a uniter, I think people sense it. I think they know I have the experience, and that I\u2019m a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise. And I\u2019ll tell you, I love these blue-collar Democrats, because they\u2019re going to vote for us come next fall, promise you that.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, let me ask you a question. Presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you you\u2019re wrong.You don\u2019t necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you\u2019re wrong a lot. Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said, \u201cDonald Trump, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d and you listened to them?TRUMP: Well, I would say my wife tells me I\u2019m wrong all the time. And I listen.(LAUGHTER)DICKERSON: About what?TRUMP: Oh, let me just say \u2014 look, I am very open \u2014 I hired top people. I\u2019ve had great success. I built a great, great company. I don\u2019t need to do this. I\u2019m self-funding. I\u2019m spending a lot of money. I\u2019ve spent \u2014 like in New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1.That\u2019s what the country needs, folks. I spent 3, he spends 42 of their money, of special interest money. And it\u2019s just \u2014 this is not going to make \u2014 excuse me. This is not going to make our country great again.This is not what we need in our country. We need people that know what the hell they\u2019re doing. And politicians, they\u2019re all talk, they\u2019re no action. And that\u2019s why people are supporting me.I do listen to people. I hire experts. I hire top, top people. And I do listen. And you know what? Sometimes they\u2019re wrong. You have to know what to do, when to do it. But sometimes they\u2019re wrong.DICKERSON: Let me \u2014 something, in talking to voters that they wish somebody would tell you to cut it out is the profanity. What\u2019s your reaction to that?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you \u2014 over the years, I\u2019ve made many speeches. People have asked me, big companies have asked me to make speeches, and friends of mine that run big companies on success.And occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something, I\u2019ll use a profanity. One of the profanities that I got credited with using, that I didn\u2019t use, was a very bad word, two weeks ago, that I never used.I said, \u201cYou.\u201d And everybody said \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t say anything wrong.\u201d But you bleeped it, so everyone thinks I said the \u2014 I didn\u2019t say anything. I never said the word.It is very unfair, that criticism. Now, I will say this, with all of that being said, I have said I will not do it at all, because if I say a word that\u2019s a little bit off color, a little bit, it ends up being a headline.I will not do it again. I was a very good student at a great school not using \u2014 by the way \u2014 not using profanity is very easy.DICKERSON: All right. O.K. Governor Bush, I\u2019d like to ask you...BUSH: Yeah, well, I have got to respond to this.DICKERSON: Well, can I \u2014 how about you respond, and then you can answer the question I\u2019m about to ask you.BUSH: Sounds like a good plan.DICKERSON: It\u2019ll be...BUSH: Or you could ask me two questions, so I could get two minutes instead of one.DICKERSON: If we adjudicate this, the night will be over.Governor, in 2012, you said that your father and Ronald Reagan would have a hard time in today\u2019s Republican Party, based on their records of trying to find accommodation and finding some degree of common ground.Do you still feel that way?BUSH: I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous, that\u2019s what I think. And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems, someone who doesn\u2019t cut and run; someone who could be a commander in chief to unite our country around common purposes; someone who doesn\u2019t disparage people.Someone that doesn\u2019t brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great, because he could use the legal system.Someone...TRUMP: That\u2019s not \u2014 let me respond. That\u2019s another lie. I never went bankrupt!(CROSSTALK)DICKERSON: Hold on, Mr. Trump.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: No, but it\u2019s another lie.DICKERSON: Hold on, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: No, but it\u2019s another lie. This guy doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. Just a lie.BUSH: We need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems.And right now, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington don\u2019t get it. People are struggling \u2014 63 percent of Americans can\u2019t make a $500 car payment. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. And we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy, reforming the things that are broken.And I\u2019m that person.DICKERSON: O.K., Mr. Trump, your response.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Let me just tell you. Jeb goes around saying, just like the biggest business leaders in this country, I\u2019ve used the laws of the land to chapter \u2014 I bought a company, I threw it immediately into a chapter, I made a great deal. I uses the laws to my benefit, because I run a company.BUSH: Yeah...TRUMP: Excuse me, Jeb!BUSH: Yeah.TRUMP: I never went bankrupt, never.Now \u2014 but you don\u2019t want to say that. Now, let me just say, I\u2019ve used it, just like the biggest leaders in the country. Let me tell you something \u2014 Florida. Florida, he put so much debt on Florida. You know, we keep saying he\u2019s a wonderful governor, wonderful governor. He put so much debt on Florida, and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office, Florida crashed.I happened to be there. It\u2019s my second home. Florida crashed. He didn\u2019t do a good job as governor.BUSH: Here we go.TRUMP: And you haven\u2019t \u2014 excuse me, you haven\u2019t heard that. You listen to the good record in Florida. You take a look at what happened, as soon as that year ended he got out, Florida crashed. Too much debt.He loaded it up with debt, and his spending went through the roof.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: By the way...DICKERSON: The bells are ringing, sir.TRUMP: ... he was not a good governor.BUSH: Here\u2019s the record. Here\u2019s the record. We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. When I left there was $9 billion of reserves, 35 percent of general revenue. No state came close to that.TRUMP: Take a look at your numbers.BUSH: When I \u2014 during my time, we were one of the two states to go to AAA bond rating. We didn\u2019t go bankrupt like Trump did and call it success when people are laid off, when vendors don\u2019t get paid. That\u2019s not success.What we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income. Personal income during my time went up by 4.4 percent.TRUMP: Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office.BUSH: The government grew by...TRUMP: Went right down because of what he did to it.BUSH: ... half of that.DICKERSON: All right. Thank you.Senator Rubio, I want to ask you a 30-second question, no president can...RUBIO: Thirty seconds.DICKERSON: No \u2014 well, I\u2019ll ask the question, you do what you want.RUBIO: I speak fast.(LAUGHTER)DICKERSON: No president can know everything, right? So a smart leader knows how to ask questions. So if you could talk to any previous president, what\u2019s the smart question you would ask about that job that you would want to know?RUBIO: Well, I think one of the presidents \u2014 well, the president I grew up under was Ronald Reagan. And Reagan had a vision for America\u2019s future. And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited, it\u2019s not unlike what the next president is going to inherit.This is the worst president we\u2019ve had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter. That\u2019s what Ronald Reagan inherited. And I think the question you would ask is, how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?How did you \u2014 what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time \u2014 you know, you look back at that time, the American military was in decline. Our standing in the world was in decline. We had hostages being held in Iran. Our economy was in bad shape.The American people were scared about the future. They were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit. And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism.And he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership. I wish Ronald Reagan was still around. This country needs someone just like that.And if our next president is even half the president Ronald Reagan was, America is going to be greater than it has ever been.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: All right. That\u2019s going to have to be it there, Senator Rubio. We have got to go to a break. We will be right back with the CBS News Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: Time now for closing statements. You will each have one minute, and we\u2019ll begin with Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, I want to thank the people of South Carolina. You\u2019ve been fantastic. And look, what I want you to know is I\u2019m going to send a lot of power, money and influence back to where we all live. But as I\u2019ve traveled around South Carolina, I\u2019ve noticed something. You know, it\u2019s that people have a sense that you\u2019re not going to wait on a president. You know, when I was a kid, we didn\u2019t wait on presidents to come to that little blue-collar town and fix things.You know, the Lord made all of us special. The Lord wants us to be connected. I believe we\u2019re part of a very big mosaic. And I\u2019ll send the power back. And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.But the spirit of the America rests in all of us. It\u2019s in our guts. It\u2019s taking care of our children. It\u2019s taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband. It\u2019s fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs. You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesn\u2019t come from the top down. The spirit of America rests in us. And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.Thank you all very much. And I hope I can have your vote in South Carolina.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Dr. Carson \u2014 Dr. Carson, you\u2019re next.CARSON: This is the first generation not expected to do better than their parents. Some people say it\u2019s the new normal, but there\u2019s nothing normal about it in an exceptional American. I, like you, am a member of we, the people, and we know that our country is heading off the cliff.Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality. We, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina. If all the people who say, \u201cI love Ben Carson and his policies, but he can\u2019t win,\u201d vote for me, not only can we win, but we can turn this thing around.You know, we have this manipulation by the political class and by the media telling us who we\u2019re supposed to pick and how we\u2019re supposed to live. We, the people, are the only people who will determine that. And if you elect me as your next president, I promise you that you will get somebody who is accountable to everybody and beholden to no one. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Governor \u2014 Governor Bush.BUSH: Thank you all very much. The next president is going to be confronted with an unforeseen challenge. That\u2019s almost certain. It could be a pandemic, a major natural disaster or an attack on our country. The question for South Carolinians and Americans is who do you want to have sitting behind the big desk in the Oval Office? Because that\u2019s the question. It\u2019s not the things we\u2019re talking about today. It\u2019s the great challenge that may happen. I believe I will have a steady hand as commander in chief and president of the United States. I will unite this country around common purposes because I did it as governor of the state of Florida.When I was governor, we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in 16 months. Our state was on its back. We recovered far faster than what people thought because we led.We want to challenge rather than cutting and running. That\u2019s what we need in Washington, D.C. We need someone with a servant\u2019s heart that has a backbone, that isn\u2019t going to focus on polls and focus groups. The focus will be on the American people to keep them safe and secure.I ask for your vote next Saturday.(APPLAUSE)GARRETT: Thank you, governor.STRASSEL: And now, Marco Rubio.RUBIO: Thank you, and thank you for watching tonight.This is a difficult time in our country. Our economy\u2019s flat, it\u2019s not creating the jobs it once did, and people struggle living paycheck to paycheck. Our culture\u2019s in trouble. Wrong is considered right and right is considered wrong.All the things that once held our families together are now under constant assault. And around the world, America\u2019s reputation is in decline. Our allies don\u2019t trust us, our adversaries don\u2019t fear us, Iran captures our sailors and parades them before the world on video.These are difficult times, but 2016 can be a turning point. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today to ask you for your vote. If you elect me president, we are going to re-embrace free enterprise so that everyone can go as far as their talent and their work will take them.We are going to be a country that says that \u201clife begins at conception and life is worthy of the protection of our laws.\u201d We\u2019re going to be a country that says \u201cthat marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d We are going to be a country that says, \u201cThe constitution and the rights that it talks about do not come from our president, they come from our creator.\u201d We are going to be loyal to our allies like Israel, not enemies like Iran. And we will rebuild the U.S. military so no one will there test it.Vote for me. I will unify this party. I will grow it. We will win this election, and we will make the 21st century a new American century.(APPLAUSE)DICKERSON: Senator Cruz? Senator Cruz, your closing statement?CRUZ: South Carolina, you have a critical choice to make. Our country literally hangs in the balance.Do you want another Washington deal maker who will do business as usual, cut deals with the Democrats, grow government, grow debt and give up our fundamental liberties? Or do you want a conservative, a proven conservative that will stand and fight with you each and every day?Listen, repealing Obamacare is not going to be easy. Passing a simple flat tax that abolishes the I.R.S. is not going to be easy, but if we stand with the American people, we can do it.And today, we saw just how great the stakes are. Two branches of government hang in the balance. Not just the presidency but the Supreme Court. If we get this wrong, if we nominate the wrong candidates, the Second Amendment, life, marriage, religious liberty \u2014 every one of those hangs in the balance.My little girls are here. I don\u2019t want to look my daughters in the eyes and say, \u201cWe lost their liberties.\u201d Who do you know will defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights? And as a commander in chief, who do you know will stand up to our enemies as the clam, steady, deliberate, strength to defeat our enemies, to secure our borders and to keep America safe.DICKERSON: Mr. Trump, your closing statements?TRUMP: Thank you.Politicians are all talk, no action. You\u2019ve seen where they\u2019ve take you to. We are 19 trillion dollars right now. It\u2019s going to be increased with that horrible budget from a month ago that was just approved by politicians.We need a change. We need a very big change. We\u2019re going to make our country great again.I say this every night, every day, every afternoon, and it\u2019s so true \u2014 we don\u2019t win anymore. We don\u2019t win with health care, we don\u2019t win with ISIS and the military, we don\u2019t take care of our vets, we don\u2019t care of our borders, we don\u2019t win. We are going to start winning again. We are not going to be controlled by people that are special interests and lobbyists that everybody here has contributed to. And you know what, they do exactly what those folks want them to do.We are going to make our country great, and we\u2019re going to do the right thing. I\u2019m working for you. I\u2019m not working for anybody else.Thank you very much.STRASSEL: We\u2019ll be back with a few final thoughts in a moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)DICKERSON: So that\u2019s nine Republican debates knocked down and at least three to go.ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "G-20, Rejecting Major Policy Shifts, Plays Up Basic Strengths", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Through the winter, world financial markets have tumbled and churned with a succession of worries. The Chinese economy seemed to be faltering. Commodity exporters like Russia and Brazil suffered sharp slowdowns. And with oil prices falling, banks that have lent heavily to energy companies could be hurt.On Saturday evening, finance ministers from 20 of the world\u2019s largest economies wrapped up a day and a half of meetings with a rough consensus: The markets worry too much.The ministers turned aside suggestions that they embark on any radical changes in policy, like realigning the exchange rates of major currencies. They endorsed instead a stepped-up combination of monetary policies, government spending and structural changes, altering the wording of Saturday night\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 from communiqu\u00e9s last year to put somewhat greater emphasis on these policies.The ministers tried hard to persuade investors around the world that they were missing basic strengths in the global economy.\u201cThe magnitude of the recent market volatility has not reflected the underlying fundamentals of the global economy,\u201d said Lou Jiwei, the finance minister of China, the country that holds the group\u2019s presidency this year.The agreement to share information came in addition to renewing a previous commitment by large economies not to devalue their currencies to obtain a competitive advantage for their exporters. Devaluations make exporters\u2019 goods less expensive in foreign markets.The information sharing agreement was prompted by actions in recent months by China and Japan. China unexpectedly made small devaluations in its currency in early August and in late December, both times leading to drops in world stock markets. Japan has embraced negative interest rates and pushed hard to expand its money supply, moves that have made it less attractive to hold yen.Masatsugu Asakawa, Japan\u2019s vice minister of finance for international affairs, said there had been strong agreement that countries should not devalue currencies to help the competitiveness of their exports. While expansionary monetary policies like Japan\u2019s may have spillover effects on currencies, they are not problematic as long as the policies are aimed mainly at supporting the domestic economy, not currency depreciation, he said.Many of the worries this winter have involved whether economic growth in China may be slowing more than official statistics indicate. Giving a possible glimpse into the Chinese government\u2019s priorities in the budget to be released next Saturday, Mr. Lou said China would pursue a long list of policies aimed at helping various sectors of the Chinese economy become more efficient.One policy already carried out, he said, had shortened the lengthy process for obtaining some kinds of government approvals for businesses to a few days. \u201cThrough deregulation, we can invigorate entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d he said.\u201cSome market participants wanted a big plan to boost the economy,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who is also the chairman of the European Union\u2019s council of 28 finance ministers. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel there is a need for a big plan. We\u2019re not in a crisis mode.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe Reach Agreement on Derivatives Regulation", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byAn agreement between American and European regulators over the $553 trillion derivatives market could bring relief to banks and large clearinghouses, which had faced the threat of higher costs and disrupted trading.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the European Commission agreed on a common set of requirements in regulating derivatives clearinghouses, an action that they say will ease capital constraints for banks that clear derivatives trades through the CME Group in Chicago, the Intercontinental Exchange in Atlanta and LCH Clearnet in London, among others.The agreement, announced on Wednesday but pending approval in the United States and in Europe, would end three years of heated debate on how best to establish common standards to ensure greater stability in the financial markets.Clearinghouses stand between banks and other buyers and sellers of futures, interest-rate swaps and other derivatives, which companies use to hedge the risks of fluctuations in currencies, interest rates and commodity prices. Clearinghouses try to reduce risk by requiring traders on both sides of a transaction to post collateral.Since the financial crisis in 2008, when derivatives helped fuel the turmoil, regulators have pushed for more interest-rate swaps and other derivatives to be cleared through the clearinghouses rather than through private arrangements between buyers and sellers.But European and United States regulators had been at loggerheads over recognizing each other\u2019s rules as equivalent. Without such a designation, European banks faced higher capital requirements to clear trades through American clearinghouses, potentially shutting down clearing of derivatives by European banks here.Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in a statement that the agreement was a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d in the effort to reform the global derivatives market after the crisis. \u201cFinding common ground with our European partners to establish a level playing field internationally will help support cross-border activity with the appropriate regulation and supervision,\u201d he said.Jonathan Hill, the European commissioner for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union, said, \u201cafter more than three years of discussion, we are now able to provide certainty for the marketplace.\u201dTerrence A. Duffy, the executive chairman and president of CME, told Congress last year that a lack of agreement would cause \u201cdisruptions to U.S. futures markets because, without equivalence, the cost of clearing futures on U.S. markets will increase significantly.\u201dCME is one of the world\u2019s largest options and futures exchanges, handling a record 3.5 billion contracts last year. Foreign banks use it to hedge their dollar interest rate exposure or to facilitate trades for clients in the United States.Higher capital requirements to clear there would have added to pressure on large European banks that are already being pinched with declining profitability.Two deadlines looming in Europe in June, one requiring certain derivatives trades to be cleared through a clearinghouse, raised the stakes for the two sides to reach an agreement.\u201cWithout the cross-border agreement, there would be either greater fragmentation of the market or higher costs,\u201d says Willa Cohen Bruckner, a partner at the law firm Alston & Bird.Intercontinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based owner of the New York Stock Exchange and seven derivatives clearinghouses globally, would also be affected. Jeffrey Sprecher, its chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that ICE would \u201cmeet the new equivalence requirements and continue to support our customers\u2019 risk management needs.\u201dThe futures industry trade association FIA said on Wednesday that it expected United States clearinghouses to be recognized under the equivalence rules by June 21, just in time to meet the European deadline for moving swaps-clearing to clearinghouses.The agreement does not include United States agricultural commodity derivatives, a nod to American farmers and ranchers and \u201cthe significant nexus of these U.S. contracts with the U.S. economy,\u201d the two sides said.Both sides agreed to shift requirements on the margin banks must post to clearinghouses, to be more closely aligned.European regulators will move to recognize United States clearinghouses as equivalent to their own regulated markets in a vote later this month, the FIA said.Andy Nybo, the global head of research and consulting at Tabb Group, said \u201cinternational regulatory harmonization is a positive for the financial markets.\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d he said, \u201cthat everyone plays by the same rules.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentine Offer Opens the Way for a Debt Settlement", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsReal money may finally be on the table in Argentina.President Mauricio Macri\u2019s government has asked owners of roughly $9 billion in defaulted bonds to accept a 25 percent discount. Two have agreed. The big holdout \u2014 Elliott Management \u2014 is still haggling, and the Argentine Congress and an American judge would have to bless any bargain. For the first time in ages, though, a functional economy and access to global markets seem in reach.The legal battle for payment has raged since Argentina\u2019s 2001 default on some $100 billion of debt. About 95 percent of creditors swapped their bonds in 2005 and 2010 for some 30 cents on the dollar or less. An Elliott affiliate refused, winning court orders saying the country cannot pay any other creditors before the hedge fund and other holdouts.The biggest for the president may be at home. His Peronist predecessor, the fiery leftist Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, refused to talk with the holdouts, belittling them as \u201cvultures.\u201d A left-leaning Congress will still need convincing. But recent defections of a dozen legislators away from Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s strand of Peronism may help Mr. Macri gain approval for the deal.That still leaves Thomas P. Griesa, the 85-year-old federal judge whose scathing decisions have effectively blocked Argentina from international capital markets and garnered support from the United States Supreme Court. His rulings favoring Elliott may give it powerful leverage to cut a better deal. Yet even Judge Griesa has long insisted on a settlement, and obstinance could sway the judge to modify his orders and force Elliott\u2019s hand.Elliott and the other holdouts have won every hand so far in this high-stakes game. It\u2019s time they cashed in their chips.Advertisement"}

He should urge Cubans of all ideologies to start debating their differences constructively, ending the repression of those who are critical of the regime.Mr. Obama should note that Cuba\u2019s leaders could be doing far more to revitalize the island\u2019s languishing economy, which would stem the flow of people seeking to leave for better futures elsewhere. And he should tell Cubans that they deserve better than leaders picked by the Communist Party who are unaccountable to their people.The relatively small faction in Congress that continues to favor a punitive policy toward Cuba has stubbornly stood in the way of efforts to repeal the embargo against the island. Those critics contend that Mr. Obama\u2019s visit to Cuba will be interpreted as a validation of a repressive regime. That is shortsighted.The United States has sought for decades to bring about regime change in Cuba through a series of failed strategies that included the use of force and subterfuge. Those policies failed and gave Cuban leaders a pretext to run the country like a police state.Mr. Obama and a growing number of American politicians have come to recognize that the United States is ill equipped to dictate how leaders of sovereign nations should govern, and is more effective when it leads by example and champions those who fight peacefully for dignity and self-determination.Mr. Obama\u2019s short trip is unlikely to spark overnight reforms in Cuba.

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Yet right around now, Mr. Astrada should be in Myanmar, about eight months since he left his home base in Barcelona, Spain, on Athena, his Royal Enfield motorcycle laden with clothes, supplies and camera gear. He has gone over the Pyrenees, into Turkey, up to Vladivostok, Russia, over to South Korea (by ferry) and, most recently, India (by plane).There have been mechanical failures, unexpected delays and bureaucratic nightmares, not to mention the Korean hotel vending machine he thought sold soda, but actually dispensed sex toys. Yet, during a phone interview last week, Mr. Astrada sounded upbeat about how his impulsive decision one day while covering Haiti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cholera outbreak in 2010 has gotten him halfway around the world, where he goes out taking pictures for himself, not some assignment editor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you have to think a lot about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said by phone from a small town in India near the Myanmar border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think too much, in the end you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never do it. I wanted to go around the world, and I thought I could do it by motorcycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo hear him tell it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with enough feeling to make deskbound editors long to toss off the shackles of meetings and budgets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his journey wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about taking time to think, but making time to experience. With almost 20 years as a photojournalist, Mr. Astrada has covered everything from Haiti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earthquake or conflict in Africa, to longer projects on violence against women or people living with multiple sclerosis. As a news photographer, he was used to rituals of blowing into town, covering the breaking story and leaving. While that may be good for news, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of grind that hardly leaves little time to get to know a place. This time, he wanted the freedom to explore and do street photography.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had lost sight of what I had before, to go out with my camera and make pictures of whatever caught my attention, without thinking of any specific reportage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking with news agencies, especially once the news is over, many times we forget there is daily life that continues in these places. In some ways this idea was to complete the other part of what you never get to cover when you do news.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFiguring out that he wanted to travel light and be as self-sufficient as possible, he settled on going by motorcycle, a Royal Enfield built in India, first learning how to ride one at a driving school in Spain. In keeping with his theme of self-sufficiency, he enrolled in a motorcycle repair class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he used to be an airplane mechanic, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handy with tools and motors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because he figured he might be in some remote places. That proved the case when a spring broke while he was on a deserted road to Uzbekistan.One truth at the root of The Journey is something essential: the lure of the road, the ability to stop and go as one pleases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of course, making accommodations for bureaucrats, the police and border crossings. Some places he wanted to see \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like Florence, for Michelangelo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s masterpieces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while others would have to wait; his Iranian visa came through too late, since he had to get to Vladivostok by October. If he found a place was to his liking, he might stay longer than planned, which is what happened in Tbilisi, Georgia.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plan is there is no plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI adapted as I went along. That is the beauty of going by motorcycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut another important aspect of his trek speaks to the universality of the human experience, for better or worse. Cellphones turn up in the unlikeliest places, he noted, as did traffic that could rival New York\u2019s.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I got to Ulan Bator, it was like being on Fifth Avenue in a traffic jam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the Mongolian capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have this idea in our heads \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the tourist idea \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that people continue to live as they did in a previous era, when in reality the world has evolved. The idea of this trip is to see how similar we are, as well as how we have differences. In truth, television and movies have influenced so much. In the end, all the globalization of technology and the economy means a lot of things are similar.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor now, Mr. Astrada is going to base himself in Southeast Asia for about a year, giving workshops and being able to take on assignments. After that, his plan is to go to North America and, he hopes, Latin America. And for all his traveling, he has come up with one project he feels he must do: a deep look at Argentina, the homeland in which he has not lived for some 19 years.But those plans can wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis trip has made me enjoy taking pictures more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like the excitement of being somewhere without the pressure to make pictures and being able to share life in a different way, to see what people do every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

For example, the bill opens with a mention of its intent to protect not just animals but also their habitats. And it states for the first time that the state has a responsibility to help maintain biodiversity. But where the existing law is vague about the legality of trading and breeding endangered species for food and medicine \u2014 a situation critics said opened too many loopholes for animal exploitation and abuse \u2014 the proposed revisions make explicit that endangered species are \u201cnatural resources\u201d that can be legally bred in captivity for commercial purposes. And it shifts the power for licensing these activities from the central government to provincial ones, which critics say are more likely to bend to local economic interests.Some of the proposed changes could overturn existing animal protections, conservationists say. Since 2010, zoos in all Chinese cities have been banned from staging animal performances. And while there are more bears being held captive for their bile, used in traditional medical potions, than in years past, public resistance has become more vocal. Trade in tiger bone and rhino horn was banned in 1993.The new law, if passed, could jeopardize these gains, conservationists and some legal experts say.\u201cA major step backward and a disaster for conservation,\u201d said An Xiang, the director of Dexiang Law Firm in Beijing, who has campaigned for animal welfare legislation. He said he viewed the medicine and food clause as a green light for activities like bear bile farming and eating tigers and pangolins.\u201cIf the current law is vague and stops shy of allowing the commercial use of animals,\u201d Mr. An said, \u201cthe new law is brazenly detailed about it, telling you how these animals may be used and where to go to get a permit.\u201dFive such meetings were held last year, Mr. Zhang said. \u201cEvery time, we were presented a draft containing inputs from the previous discussion. The officials were open-minded, and everybody got a fair hearing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then at the last meeting in September, we saw the reverse. The views of businesses were strengthened, while those of the conservationists were reduced.\u201dThe version posted on Jan. 1 largely reflects the situation in September, he said.Some, while critical of the new law, take a less dire view. Zhou Ke, a law professor at Renmin University in Beijing who provided the government with legal opinions during the drafting of the bill, said that the clause addressing animal parts used in food and medicine would not affect China\u2019s commitment to the protection of endangered species as required by its own regulations and international treaties like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. But he agreed that some of the wording in the draft \u201cmakes it sound like eating wild animals is now encouraged when it should be discouraged.\u201d\u201cThe law was not made just for animal protection groups,\u201d Mr. Yan was quoted as saying.Shifting licensing authority from the central government to provincial governments will allow regulators to focus on their main tasks, he added. \u201cWe will have more time to supervise and make rules,\u201d he told The Paper. \u201cIn the past, we spent most of our time issuing licenses.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Gives Glimpse of Its Solutions to Economic Problems", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Chinese economic policy makers tugged back the curtain a bit on Thursday on their plans to stabilize the country\u2019s economy and financial markets, even as shares plunged more than 6 percent late in the day.Speaking to leaders of the world\u2019s biggest banks and institutional investors at a financial conference here, officials described how they would use government deficit spending to spur growth. A senior Chinese central banker also pledged to preserve the value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, by firmly tying its value to a range of other currencies.Timothy Adams, the chief executive and president of the Institute of International Finance, said Chinese policy makers realized they had made a serious mistake by staying silent as slowing growth, stumbles in the stock market and a fluctuating currency undermined the world\u2019s perception of China\u2019s economic stability. Their silence has been widely construed as either a reluctance to acknowledge difficulties or a lack of solutions.\u201cEither they communicate with the markets in a timely and intelligent fashion, or the markets are going to write their own story line,\u201d said Mr. Adams, a former senior United States Treasury official.Finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world are flying into Shanghai for meetings this weekend. Global banking leaders are already here for the annual conference of the Institute of International Finance. So a large contingent of Chinese officials has come from Beijing to meet with them and discuss their policies.So far, the Chinese officials have acknowledged the challenges they face, but they contend that the world has overlooked the many policy options they can use to respond.The officials outlined how they hoped to shift the economy from its emphasis on manufacturing, exports and a sometimes manic pace of construction, toward services and consumer spending. And they described how they hoped to manage that transition without tripping up economic growth along the way.Zhu Guangyao, a vice minister of finance, said Thursday morning that Prime Minister Li Keqiang would unveil a government budget early next month that would include economic stimulus through an increase in deficit spending, which was only 2.3 percent of economic output last year. \u201cIn 2016, certainly we will have to increase that ratio,\u201d he said.Although China\u2019s corporations are heavily indebted, the Chinese central government is not.In a subsequent speech to international bank leaders, Yi Gang, the first deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, provided the strongest commitment to date not to devalue the renminbi. He described a complex strategy based on anchoring the value of the renminbi to three baskets of currencies. The baskets are essentially weighted averages of how much the renminbi is worth in terms of dollars, euros, yen and other currencies.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, is scheduled to speak Friday morning and then hold a rare news conference immediately afterward.He will have much to discuss: Money has been sluicing out of China this winter, as companies and individuals use their renminbi to buy dollars, fearing that the renminbi may decline further against the dollar. As officials spoke on Thursday, the Shanghai stock exchange on the other side of town was sliding steeply, ending with a loss of 6.4 percent \u2014 a particularly precipitous decline given that the market halts trading in any listing once it has fallen 10 percent.Share prices slid on Thursday, not in response to the reassurances of Chinese officials but rather to a spike in short-term interest rates in Chinese money markets.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Despite huge outflows in recent months, it was not immediately clear that trying to slow them was the sole cause of the rise in interest rates. The Chinese central bank injects huge sums of cash into the economy in late January and early February each year in anticipation of heavy consumer spending during Chinese New Year, then tries to drain some of that extra money in late February. It is a tricky task every year, and especially when financial confidence is weak.Even if Chinese officials do start unveiling further policy responses to economic weakness, it is unclear whether overseas investors will believe them. China has repeatedly promised measures to limit the rapid growth of corporate debt and to overhaul state-owned enterprises, notably at the Third Plenum, a policy-setting gathering in the autumn of 2013. But putting changes in effect has proved slow and difficult, as many could involve layoffs in single-company towns with few alternative employers, and could threaten the livelihoods of politically connected executives at troubled state-owned enterprises.The Chinese central bank has been trying to inject additional cash into the economy to offset outflows and prevent interest rates from rising. Qu Hongbin, the chief economist for greater China at HSBC, said that not all of the money leaving China was harmful, however. He estimated that three-fifths of it consisted of Chinese companies paying overseas debts, which would become more expensive in renminbi terms if the currency weakens further.Mr. Yi, the deputy governor, sought to reassure bankers that China\u2019s central bank would not tolerate another broad decline in the value of the renminbi. The bank devalued the renminbi 4 percent compared with the dollar last August, then pushed it down nearly 3 percent in late December and early January.Mr. Yi said that China is anchoring its currency to three weighted averages of currencies: one that it calculates itself, one from the Bank of International Settlements and one from the International Monetary Fund. Paul Gruenwald, a former I.M.F. official who is now the Singapore-based Asia economist for Standard & Poor\u2019s, said that because the dollar typically makes up a third of each of these baskets, the shift meant that the renminbi could conceivably vary three times as widely against the dollar.The renminbi gained against the broader baskets through much of last year, even as it weakened against the dollar. But this winter, the currency has also weakened against the averages, as it has followed the dollar down against the euro.By not specifying which of the baskets is most important, the People\u2019s Bank of China keeps greater flexibility, although at the cost of also allowing greater uncertainty in financial markets. China\u2019s own basket includes currencies that are somewhat important for its trade, like the Russian ruble and Malaysian ringgit. The I.M.F.\u2019s special drawing rights, another basket cited by Mr. Yi, only has the dollar, euro, yen, British pound and the renminbi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For a Natural, Swimming Isn\u2019t Always Easy", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byGAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2014 The calm, clear water beckoned Caeleb Dressel, who stripped to his swimsuit and jumped into an unoccupied lane for the 6-and-under boys\u2019 25-yard freestyle race. Upon reaching the other side of the pool, he climbed out of the water and cried: \u201cI won a medal! I won a medal!\u201dIn the stands, his mother, Christina, was mortified. Her son had not been entered in the race. He was at the River City recreational league meet in Jacksonville, Fla., to watch his brother, Tyler, who is five years older, compete for Chimney Lakes.\u201cI die laughing when I think about it now,\u201d Dressel\u2019s mother said, \u201cbut at the time I remember going, \u2018Oh, my God, my kid just jumped in the water.\u2019 I had no idea what possessed him to do it.\u201dDressel\u2019s leap into competitive swimming foreshadowed a career awash in medal-winning performances, most recently at the Southeastern Conference championships in Missouri, where he set American records in the 50- and 100-yard freestyles and the conference record in the 100-yard butterfly as his Florida team won the men\u2019s conference title. His days of being able to hop in a lane and race anonymously are long gone, and that looms as his greatest challenge as Dressel, 19, prepares for the N.C.A.A. Division I championships in Atlanta from March 23 to 26 and the Olympic trials in Omaha in late June and early July.Dressel, last year\u2019s N.C.A.A. champion in the 50-yard freestyle, will invite more scrutiny this week as he leaves the cocoon of college\u2019s 25-yard courses to compete against the likes of Nathan Adrian, the reigning Olympic champion in the 100-meter freestyle, at the Arena Pro Swim Series event in Orlando, Fla., in a 50-meter pool. Gregg Troy, the Florida coach, acknowledged that there was a risk in having Dressel race in long-course meters when his focus has been on short-course yards. It is akin to throwing a stock-car driver preparing for the Daytona 500 into a Formula One race.But with the United States Olympic selection meet on the horizon, Troy wants Dressel to gain experience racing against a quality long-course field. For all the fanfare created by his jaw-dropping times at the conference championships in the 50 freestyle (18.23 seconds) and 100 freestyle (41.07), Dressel is a relative neophyte on the world-class stage. His greatest exposure to global competition was the 2013 junior world championships.Shortly after returning from that meet, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Dressel abruptly quit the sport because he felt burdened by expectations. In an interview before a recent practice, Dressel likened his relationship with the water to a marriage, filled with highs and lows but rooted in an abiding love. This tangle of emotions was encapsulated at one of his first swim lessons after that impromptu race from his youth. The instructor, Sean Scott, demonstrated how to do the butterfly. It is one of the harder strokes for beginners to grasp because of the timing of the double-arm pull and the kick.Dressel, the third of four children, found his rhythm after only a couple of attempts. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized he has a gift,\u201d said his mother, who was watching from the pool deck. The lesson is Dressel\u2019s first memory of swimming. \u201cI cried,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to learn the butterfly because it\u2019s hard. I got it right away, but I didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201dLike the hull of a ship, Dressel\u2019s body seems built to float. He is 6 feet 2 inches, with big hands and feet, and he naturally rides high in the water, which means he does not have to expend energy to maintain an ideal body position. He also has an intuitive feel for the water. Jason Calanog, who coached Dressel with the Bolles Sharks in Jacksonville, Fla., encouraged his swimmers to keep workout logbooks. Dressel\u2019s entries, Calanog said, contained detailed descriptions of how his body felt interacting with the water. It was not unusual, Calanog added, for Dressel to hop out of the pool in the middle of a workout and write notes in his logbook or, later, on his cellphone while a thought was fresh in his mind.\u201cHis entries were definitely at a higher level than I\u2019ve ever seen by a swimmer,\u201d said Calanog, now an assistant men\u2019s coach at Texas A&M. \u201cHe\u2019d write pages and pages about how every muscle felt and what he wanted his stroke to feel like.\u201dDressel was the youngest male competitor at the 2012 Olympic trials at 15, finishing tied for 145th in the 50-meter freestyle and tied for 152nd in the 100 freestyle, and as an age-group swimmer, he rewrote the record books, breaking a few marks held by the 18-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps. Dressel\u2019s age-group career culminated with milestone records in the 17-18 boys\u2019 category when he became the youngest swimmer in United States history to break 50 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle and the youngest to break 19 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle.And then, early in his senior year of high school, shortly after orally committing to Florida, Dressel left the sport. For six months, he did not get into the pool. It was actually the second time he had taken time off. When he was 6, he and his two older siblings took a hiatus after Dressel\u2019s father, Michael, was found to have Stage 4 sarcoma.\u201cThe doctors said it was terminal,\u201d Dressel\u2019s mother said, \u201cand I said, \u2018We\u2019re concentrating on Dad while he is going through this.\u2019\u00a0\u201dDressel\u2019s father, a veterinarian, made a full recovery. Years later, Dressel was not sure if his swimming career would ever be resuscitated.\u201cI had no idea if I was going to come back or not,\u201d said Dressel, whose joy had been wrung dry. \u201cAs a 17-year-old kid, people put you on this podium, and it seems like you\u2019re just a source of entertainment for people. I felt like I was swimming for other people and they\u2019d never be satisfied.\u201dThe \u201cother people\u201d to whom Dressel referred were not his parents, whose support has been steadfast. When he broached the subject of quitting, he said, his parents told him they would love him whatever he decided to do. His mother recalled a conversation she had had with the three-time Olympic breaststroker Brendan Hansen that proved instructive. She said he told her, \u201cThe best thing you can do for your kids is put away your stopwatch and let it be their sport, not yours.\u201dThe \u201cother people\u201d were not Dressel\u2019s college coaches, either. \u201cThey were all very patient with me,\u201d Dressel said, adding, \u201cIt was very calming.\u201dThe \u201cother people\u201d are strangers on the Internet. Dressel\u2019s ascent has coincided with the rise of social media, where every person with access to Twitter has the equivalent of a megaphone. That sharing economy did not exist when Ryan Lochte, the former Gator to whom Dressel is often compared because of his versatility and his success, was Dressel\u2019s age. Lochte completed his collegiate career in 2005, the year before Twitter was created.Troy, the Florida coach, said of Dressel: \u201cHe was almost out of the sport because he was such a good swimmer in high school and so many people were on him on social media about how good he was going to be, he got to the point where he thought he had to be something special all the time. So our challenge at the moment is to protect him from that happening again.\u201dDressel is not worried. Swimming has become insular for him.\u201cIt\u2019s just me and the water,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll share the water with my teammates.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fining Bankers, Not Shareholders, for Banks\u2019 Misconduct", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byFair GameHo-hum, another week, another multimillion-dollar settlement between regulators and a behemoth bank acting badly.As has become all too common in these cases, not one individual was identified as being responsible for the activities. Once again, shareholders are shouldering the costs of unethical behavior they had nothing to do with.It could not be clearer: Years of tighter rules from legislators and bank regulators have done nothing to fix the toxic, me-first cultures that afflict big financial firms.\u201cNearly a decade after the financial crisis, some firms continue to experience systemic breakdowns manifested through significant violations due to poor cultures of compliance,\u201d said Richard Ketchum, Finra\u2019s chairman. \u201cFirms with a strong ethical culture and senior leaders who set the right tone, lead by example and impose consequences on anyone who violates the firm\u2019s cultural norms are essential to restoring investor confidence and trust in the securities industry.\u201dBut changing behavior \u2014 as opposed, say, to imposing higher capital requirements \u2014 is a complex task. And regulators must do more than talk about what banks have to do to address their deficiencies.\u201cIf behavior doesn\u2019t change, banks will not be trusted and they won\u2019t be efficient in their financing of the real economy,\u201d he said. \u201cA functioning banking system must be based on trust.\u201dMr. Dombret is a regulator who knows banking from the inside, having held executive positions at J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.Most companies have codes of ethics, Mr. Dombret said, but they often exist only on paper.Regulators could help encourage a more ethical approach by routinely monitoring how a bank cooperates with its overseers, Mr. Dombret said.\u201cHow often is the bank the whistle-blower?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot only to get a lesser penalty but also to show that it won\u2019t accept that kind of behavior. We are seeing more of that.\u201dRegulators may have other tools to curb dubious activities, he said. One idea is to increase the capital requirements of banks that are found to have violated rules and laws repeatedly. That not only enhances the safety of its operations but also imposes a real cost on future profits.\u201cIf there was a series of misconduct, would that require increasing capital or asking for more equity?\u201d Mr. Dombret asked. \u201cWe have to think through how you would penalize misconduct.\u201dThe professors call this covenant banking. And it looks a lot like the kind of personal liability that was a fact of life among the top Wall Street firms when they were private partnerships.With their own money at risk, partners of Salomon Brothers, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs were much more careful about their business dealings. When these firms became public companies funded more by outsiders\u2019 money, that self-discipline diminished.Their plan contains a crucial element, requiring the best-paid bankers in the company to be liable for a fine whether or not they were directly involved in the activities that generated it. Such a no-fault program, the professors argued, would motivate bankers not only to curb their own problematic tendencies but to be on the alert for colleagues\u2019 misbehavior as well.This would help instill a culture, the law professors wrote, \u201cthat discourages bad behavior and its underlying ethos, the competitive pursuit of narrow material gain.\u201dPutting such a covenant in place would also help eliminate the problem of banking regulators who become captured by the institutions they are supposed to police. \u201cThose in the best position to choose conduct that is appropriate may not be regulators but, rather, bankers with a stake in the bank,\u201d the professors wrote.A regulator could give a company the choice of a far lower fine if it were to be paid by managers, not shareholders. A company choosing to pay the higher fine and billing it to the shareholders would have some explaining to do, Mr. Painter said.While the idea of a covenant is centered on banking, it could easily expand to other businesses. But the focus on finance is justified, Ms. Hill said.\u201cWe don\u2019t take the position that this should only be about banks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut banks can do huge damage, and we have seen this ethos in the industry that cries out for responsibility.\u201dTighter regulations and billions in fines levied on financial firms have had little impact on banking culture, as the Barclays and Credit Suisse cases make clear. It\u2019s high time to up the ante.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueNew research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.Supported byWhen Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics. A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. But it didn\u2019t turn out that way. \u2018\u2018There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t like that for me.\u2019\u2019Instead, Rozovsky\u2019s study group was a source of stress. \u2018\u2018I always felt like I had to prove myself,\u2019\u2019 she said. The team\u2019s dynamics could put her on edge. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another\u2019s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. \u2018\u2018People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.\u2019\u2019So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together teams for \u2018\u2018case competitions,\u2019\u2019 contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasn\u2019t all that different from what Rozovsky did with her study group: conducting lots of research and financial analyses, writing reports and giving presentations. The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences: Army officer, researcher at a think tank, director of a health-education nonprofit organization and consultant to a refugee program. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, \u2018\u2018we had lots of crazy ideas,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said.One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale\u2019s campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but \u2018\u2018we all felt like we could say anything to each other,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.\u2019\u2019 Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a micro\u00adgym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. They won the competition. (The micro\u00adgym \u2014 with two stationary bicycles and three treadmills \u2014 still exists.)Rozovsky\u2019s study group dissolved in her second semester (it was up to the students whether they wanted to continue). Her case team, however, stuck together for the two years she was at Yale.It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the team\u2019s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.\u2018\u2018I couldn\u2019t figure out why things had turned out so different,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018It didn\u2019t seem like it had to happen that way.\u2019\u2019Five years ago, Google \u2014 one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity \u2014 became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees\u2019 lives. Google\u2019s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).The company\u2019s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like \u2018\u2018It\u2019s better to put introverts together,\u2019\u2019 said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google\u2019s People Analytics division, or \u2018\u2018Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.\u2019\u2019 But, Dubey went on, \u2018\u2018it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.\u2019\u2019In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative \u2014 code-named Project Aristotle \u2014 to study hundreds of Google\u2019s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. Dubey, a leader of the project, gathered some of the company\u2019s best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers. He also needed researchers. Rozovsky, by then, had decided that what she wanted to do with her life was study people\u2019s habits and tendencies. After graduating from Yale, she was hired by Google and was soon assigned to Project Aristotle.No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns \u2014 or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. \u2018\u2018We looked at 180 teams from all over the company,\u2019\u2019 Dubey said. \u2018\u2018We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The \u2018who\u2019 part of the equation didn\u2019t seem to matter.\u2019\u2019Some groups that were ranked among Google\u2019s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. \u2018\u2018At Google, we\u2019re good at finding patterns,\u2019\u2019 Dubey said. \u2018\u2018There weren\u2019t strong patterns here.\u2019\u2019As they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as \u2018\u2018group norms.\u2019\u2019 Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals \u2014 they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently \u2014 but when they gather, the group\u2019s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.Project Aristotle\u2019s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an \u2018\u2018unwritten rule\u2019\u2019 or when they explained certain things as part of the \u2018\u2018team\u2019s culture.\u2019\u2019 Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group\u2019s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google\u2019s teams. But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Google\u2019s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates? Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? The data didn\u2019t offer clear verdicts. In fact, the data sometimes pointed in opposite directions. The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them. Which norms, Rozovsky and her colleagues wondered, were the ones that successful teams shared?Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.Team B is different. It\u2019s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one another\u2019s thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn\u2019t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.Which group would you rather join?To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses; others kept describing the same ideas in different words. Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the group\u2019s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. Some groups easily divvied up the buying; others couldn\u2019t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group\u2019s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. \u2018\u2018Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,\u2019\u2019 said Anita Woolley, the study\u2019s lead author. \u2018\u2018Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone\u2019s relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.\u2019\u2019As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as \u2018\u2018equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.\u2019\u2019 On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. \u2018\u2018As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,\u2019\u2019 Woolley said. \u2018\u2018But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.\u2019\u2019Second, the good teams all had high \u2018\u2018average social sensitivity\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people\u2019s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling \u2014 an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley\u2019s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group\u2019s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There\u2019s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there\u2019s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another\u2019s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.When Rozovsky and her Google colleagues encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. One engineer, for instance, had told researchers that his team leader was \u2018\u2018direct and straightforward, which creates a safe space for you to take risks.\u2019\u2019 That team, researchers estimated, was among Google\u2019s accomplished groups. By contrast, another engineer had told the researchers that his \u2018\u2018team leader has poor emotional control.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u2018\u2018He panics over small issues and keeps trying to grab control. I would hate to be driving with him being in the passenger seat, because he would keep trying to grab the steering wheel and crash the car.\u2019\u2019 That team, researchers presumed, did not perform well.Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. \u2018\u2018And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group.\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky\u2019s study group at Yale was draining because the norms \u2014 the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique \u2014 put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team \u2014 enthusiasm for one another\u2019s ideas, joking around and having fun \u2014 allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well \u2014 like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google\u2019s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.\u2018\u2018We had to get people to establish psychologically safe environments,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. But it wasn\u2019t clear how to do that. \u2018\u2018People here are really busy,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018We needed clear guidelines.\u2019\u2019However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement. You can tell people to take turns during a conversation and to listen to one another more. You can instruct employees to be sensitive to how their colleagues feel and to notice when someone seems upset. But the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.Rozovsky and her colleagues had figured out which norms were most critical. Now they had to find a way to make communication and empathy \u2014 the building blocks of forging real connections \u2014 into an algorithm they could easily scale.After Rozovsky gave one presentation, a trim, athletic man named Matt Sakaguchi approached the Project Aristotle researchers. Sakaguchi had an unusual background for a Google employee. Twenty years earlier, he was a member of a SWAT team in Walnut Creek, Calif., but left to become an electronics salesman and eventually landed at Google as a midlevel manager, where he has overseen teams of engineers who respond when the company\u2019s websites or servers go down.\u2018\u2018I might be the luckiest individual on earth,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi told me. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not really an engineer. I didn\u2019t study computers in college. Everyone who works for me is much smarter than I am.\u2019\u2019 But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result, Sakaguchi has thrived at Google. He and his wife, a teacher, have a home in San Francisco and a weekend house in the Sonoma Valley wine country. \u2018\u2018Most days, I feel like I\u2019ve won the lottery,\u2019\u2019 he said.Sakaguchi was particularly interested in Project Aristotle because the team he previously oversaw at Google hadn\u2019t jelled particularly well. \u2018\u2018There was one senior engineer who would just talk and talk, and everyone was scared to disagree with him,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi said. \u2018\u2018The hardest part was that everyone liked this guy outside the group setting, but whenever they got together as a team, something happened that made the culture go wrong.\u2019\u2019Sakaguchi had recently become the manager of a new team, and he wanted to make sure things went better this time. So he asked researchers at Project Aristotle if they could help. They provided him with a survey to gauge the group\u2019s norms.When Sakaguchi asked his new team to participate, he was greeted with skepticism. \u2018\u2018It seemed like a total waste of time,\u2019\u2019 said Sean Laurent, an engineer. \u2018\u2018But Matt was our new boss, and he was really into this questionnaire, and so we said, Sure, we\u2019ll do it, whatever.\u2019\u2019The team completed the survey, and a few weeks later, Sakaguchi received the results. He was surprised by what they revealed. He thought of the team as a strong unit. But the results indicated there were weaknesses: When asked to rate whether the role of the team was clearly understood and whether their work had impact, members of the team gave middling to poor scores. These responses troubled Sakaguchi, because he hadn\u2019t picked up on this discontent. He wanted everyone to feel fulfilled by their work. He asked the team to gather, off site, to discuss the survey\u2019s results. He began by asking everyone to share something personal about themselves. He went first.\u2018\u2018I think one of the things most people don\u2019t know about me,\u2019\u2019 he told the group, \u2018\u2018is that I have Stage 4 cancer.\u2019\u2019 In 2001, he said, a doctor discovered a tumor in his kidney. By the time the cancer was detected, it had spread to his spine. For nearly half a decade, it had grown slowly as he underwent treatment while working at Google. Recently, however, doctors had found a new, worrisome spot on a scan of his liver. That was far more serious, he explained.No one knew what to say. The team had been working with Sakaguchi for 10 months. They all liked him, just as they all liked one another. No one suspected that he was dealing with anything like this.\u2018\u2018To have Matt stand there and tell us that he\u2019s sick and he\u2019s not going to get better and, you know, what that means,\u2019\u2019 Laurent said. \u2018\u2018It was a really hard, really special moment.\u2019\u2019After Sakaguchi spoke, another teammate stood and described some health issues of her own. Then another discussed a difficult breakup. Eventually, the team shifted its focus to the survey. They found it easier to speak honestly about the things that had been bothering them, their small frictions and everyday annoyances. They agreed to adopt some new norms: From now on, Sakaguchi would make an extra effort to let the team members know how their work fit into Google\u2019s larger mission; they agreed to try harder to notice when someone on the team was feeling excluded or down.There was nothing in the survey that instructed Sakaguchi to share his illness with the group. There was nothing in Project Aristotle\u2019s research that said that getting people to open up about their struggles was critical to discussing a group\u2019s norms. But to Sakaguchi, it made sense that psychological safety and emotional conversations were related. The behaviors that create psychological safety \u2014 conversational turn-taking and empathy \u2014 are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.\u2018\u2018I think, until the off-site, I had separated things in my head into work life and life life,\u2019\u2019 Laurent told me. \u2018\u2018But the thing is, my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends I know through work. If I can\u2019t be open and honest at work, then I\u2019m not really living, am I?\u2019\u2019What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a \u2018\u2018work face\u2019\u2019 when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel \u2018\u2018psychologically safe,\u2019\u2019 we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can\u2019t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.Which isn\u2019t to say that a team needs an ailing manager to come together. Any group can become Team B. Sakaguchi\u2019s experiences underscore a core lesson of Google\u2019s research into teamwork: By adopting the data-driven approach of Silicon Valley, Project Aristotle has encouraged emotional conversations and discussions of norms among people who might otherwise be uncomfortable talking about how they feel. \u2018\u2018Googlers love data,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi told me. But it\u2019s not only Google that loves numbers, or Silicon Valley that shies away from emotional conversations. Most work\u00adplaces do. \u2018\u2018By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it makes them easier to talk about,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number.\u2019\u2019Sakaguchi knows that the spread of his cancer means he may not have much time left. His wife has asked him why he doesn\u2019t quit Google. At some point, he probably will. But right now, helping his team succeed \u2018\u2018is the most meaningful work I\u2019ve ever done,\u2019\u2019 he told me. He encourages the group to think about the way work and life mesh. Part of that, he says, is recognizing how fulfilling work can be. Project Aristotle \u2018\u2018proves how much a great team matters,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Why would I walk away from that? Why wouldn\u2019t I spend time with people who care about me?\u2019\u2019The paradox, of course, is that Google\u2019s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.The fact that these insights aren\u2019t wholly original doesn\u2019t mean Google\u2019s contributions aren\u2019t valuable. In fact, in some ways, the \u2018\u2018employee performance optimization\u2019\u2019 movement has given us a method for talking about our insecurities, fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb. Google, in other words, in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.\u2018\u2018Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.\u2019\u2019Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it\u2019s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences \u2014 like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel \u2014 that can\u2019t really be optimized. Rozovsky herself was reminded of this midway through her work with the Project Aristotle team. \u2018\u2018We were in a meeting where I made a mistake,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. She sent out a note afterward explaining how she was going to remedy the problem. \u2018\u2018I got an email back from a team member that said, \u2018Ouch,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 she recalled. \u2018\u2018It was like a punch to the gut. I was already upset about making this mistake, and this note totally played on my insecurities.\u2019\u2019If this had happened earlier in Rozovsky\u2019s life \u2014 if it had occurred while she was at Yale, for instance, in her study group \u2014 she probably wouldn\u2019t have known how to deal with those feelings. The email wasn\u2019t a big enough affront to justify a response. But all the same, it really bothered her. It was something she felt she needed to address.And thanks to Project Aristotle, she now had a vocabulary for explaining to herself what she was feeling and why it was important. She had graphs and charts telling her that she shouldn\u2019t just let it go. And so she typed a quick response: \u2018\u2018Nothing like a good \u2018Ouch!\u2019 to destroy psych safety in the morning.\u2019\u2019 Her teammate replied: \u2018\u2018Just testing your resilience.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018That could have been the wrong thing to say to someone else, but he knew it was exactly what I needed to hear,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said. \u2018\u2018With one 30-second interaction, we defused the tension.\u2019\u2019 She wanted to be listened to. She wanted her teammate to be sensitive to what she was feeling. \u2018\u2018And I had research telling me that it was O.K. to follow my gut,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018So that\u2019s what I did. The data helped me feel safe enough to do what I thought was right.\u2019\u2019Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times and the paper\u2019s senior editor of live journalism.

{"Headline": "Palau vs. the Poachers", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "FeatureThe island nation has mounted an aggressive response to illegal fishing in their waters. How they protect themselves may help the rest of the world save all of the oceans.Supported byCaught fishing in a marine sanctuary, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 was fleeing to Indonesian waters, beyond Palau\u2019s jurisdiction. Once across the boundary, the crew could easily unload its catch at a local wharf and disappear among the thousands of small Filipino or Indonesian islands of the western Pacific. Determined not to let that happen, the Remeliik\u2019s skipper, running on Bergman\u2019s coordinates, was pushing 15 knots \u2014 a pace that worried its engineer. But the police were desperate to keep up. In the previous six months, they had spotted but failed to capture nearly a dozen other pirate fishing ships. If the Remeliik\u2019s officers miscalculated their heading by even a small fraction of a degree, they would miss their target.Bergman had been tracking the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 for weeks, and emailed an alert about possible illegal fishing two days earlier. Before moving to West Virginia to work for SkyTruth, he spent three years working as a marine ob\u00adserver on Alaskan fishing boats, logging the details of the daily catch, as required by federal and state fishery authorities. At SkyTruth, Bergman did his surveillance work from a far greater remove, monitoring ships by satellite. For months, he had been studying a satellite feed from above Palau. He knew its squiggles and slashes by memory. A passenger boat out of Pitcairn Island appeared every few weeks; a United States Navy ship from Diego Garcia conducted regular maneuvers; a Chinese research vessel was doing a survey of some sort in a grid pattern; a Taiwanese ship that never seemed to fish made repeated trips out to meet other long-line fishing vessels. The Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 stood out, however. Switching among registries of fishing permits, regional tuna licenses and blacklisted vessels, he could tell it had no license to fish in Palau\u2019s waters, even though its zigzag trajectory indicated it was doing just that.In response to Bergman\u2019s alert, an international team gathered into the cramped, second-floor police command center on Koror, Palau\u2019s most populous island. There were three local police officers, an adviser from the Pew Charitable Trusts and two Australian Navy officers, on loan to Palau to advise on everything from running the Remeliik (which the Australians had also donated) to using satellite-data analysis software. Working through the night and the following day, the team radioed the information they received from West Virginia to Allison Baiei, a Palauan marine police officer, aboard the Remeliik.Police efforts like these, coordinated and international in scope, are a rarity when it comes to enforcing the law at sea, but the alternative is usually no enforcement at all. More than two-thirds of the planet is covered by water, and much of that liquid expanse is ungoverned and potentially ungovernable. Criminal enterprise has flourished in the breach. The global black market for seafood is worth more than $20 billion, and approximately one in every five fish consumed globally is caught illegally.After a 51-hour push, much of it through heavy seas, the Remeliik\u2019s unrelenting pace finally paid off: It caught up with the Taiwanese ship just a few miles before the boundary with Indonesian waters. The officers escorted the ship back to port in Palau, and when they inspected the hold, Baiei told me, they found an especially grim haul. Inside, among the stacks of tuna, were hundreds of severed shark fins. The officers piled the contraband onto the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33\u2019s deck and, when they ran out of room there, piled the rest into a bloody heap on the dock. They counted, measured and photographed the fins to use for the eventual prosecution, then dumped them into the sea. \u2018\u2018Disgusting,\u2019\u2019 was all Baiei would say about the scene.In the face of this challenge, Palau has mounted an aggressive response. In 2006, it was among the first nations to ban bottom trawling \u2014 a practice not unlike strip mining in which fishing boats drag large weighted nets across the ocean floor to catch the fish in the waters just above, killing virtually everything else in their path. In 2009, it prohibited commercial shark fishing in its waters, creating the world\u2019s first shark sanctuary. In 2015, it announced plans to require observers aboard all its tuna longliners. (Elsewhere in the region, observers are aboard just one in 50 tuna longliners.) Palau has also teamed up with Greenpeace, which helped patrol its territorial waters, and it started a campaign on Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform, raising more than $50,000 to support its conservation work. Palau\u2019s most radical move, though, was creating a \u2018\u2018no take\u2019\u2019 reserve in 2015. Within this zone, which encompasses 193,000 square miles, all export fishing (along with any drilling or mining) will be strictly prohibited.From one perspective, Palau\u2019s work suggests a hopeful future. It offers a model for successful ad hoc collaboration among countries, companies and nongovernmental organizations. Palau has also emerged as a testing ground for some of the technology \u2014 including drones, satellite monitoring and military-grade radar \u2014 that might finally empower countries to spot and arrest the pirates, poachers, polluters, traffickers and other scofflaws who prowl the seas with impunity.But Palau\u2019s conservation efforts are really motivated by a more immediate sense of self-preservation. In September, I sat down with Palau\u2019s president, Tommy Remengesau Jr., in his cluttered, wood-paneled office in Koror. A sturdy man with an intense stare, Remengesau explained to me that more than half of Palau\u2019s gross domestic product comes from tourism, mostly people visiting to dive on Palau\u2019s reefs, which house more fish, coral and other invertebrates per square mile than virtually anywhere else on Earth. Remengesau boiled the problem down to simple economics, noting that sharks were an especially big draw for undersea sightseers. Alive, an individual shark is worth more than $170,000 annually in tourism dollars, he said, or nearly $2 million over its lifetime. Dead, each can go for a hundred dollars \u2014 and usually, he added, that money winds up in the pockets of a foreign poacher.The poachers calculate differently, of course. More than a dozen countries, including Palau and Taiwan, have banned shark-finning. But demand for the fins, especially in Asia, remains high. Shark-fin soup, which can cost more than $100 a bowl, has for centuries signified wealth and status, and it became especially popular in the late 1980s as a status item for China\u2019s rapidly expanding middle and upper classes. Ship captains often allow their crew members to supplement their income by keeping the fins for themselves to sell at port. Shark carcasses take up valuable hold space in smaller ships, and as they decompose, they produce ammonia that contaminates the other catch. Deckhands usually cut off the fins, which can sell for 100 times the cost of the rest of the meat. They then throw the rest of the shark back into the water. It\u2019s a slow death: The sharks sink to the sea floor, where they starve, drown or are eaten by other fish.In a given year, Palau faces 50 to 100 incursions by pirate vessels. Fish ignore borders \u2014 and, it turns out, so do many of the people pursuing them. While port inspections, wheel-room cameras, locational transponders and onboard observers are essential to better monitoring the oceans, policing is the only thing that will make Palau\u2019s new reserve, and others like it elsewhere in the world, more than just lines drawn on the water.The oceans belong to everyone and no one, and the general perception is that they are too big to need protection. We also tend to think of fish as an ever-regenerating crop, there forever for our taking. But roughly 90 percent of the world\u2019s ocean stocks are depleted or overexploited; one study predicts that by 2050, the sea could contain more plastic waste than fish. Though most governments have neither the inclination nor the resources to patrol the oceans, Palau is trying a different approach, and whether it succeeds or fails may have consequences for the entire planet.The plan was to patrol the waters near Kayangel, an atoll in the country\u2019s far north, an area popular for sea-cucumber and coral-fish poachers. A tiny, rugged fleck of land, roughly half a square mile, Kayangel has perhaps 60 year-round residents; there is no airstrip, and power and cell service are erratic. Local fishermen had spotted poachers near the atoll, and our patrol was meant to show a police presence in the area.For any given patrol, the chief of the marine police weighs a list of variables \u2014 credible threat, distance to target, available crew, sufficient fuel, weather \u2014 and decides if it\u2019s worth dispatching the Remeliik. Today, we would head out instead on one of the department\u2019s two much smaller fiberglass boats, which they use in shallow waters closer to shore. When we pulled out of port, the sea was glass-flat, but as the land behind us fell beneath the horizon, we began rolling in 10-foot swells \u2014 it was clear why this smaller boat was ill-suited to chasing poachers into deeper water.Baiei said the turning point for Palau, the moment when the nation realized that it needed help, was March 29, 2012. The other officers shook their heads at the mere mention of the date. The agonizing story began earlier that month, when two Chinese poacher boats were spotted near the atoll for several days in a row. They kept escaping: Each was equipped with three 60-horsepower outboard motors, while the local wildlife rangers had only a Zodiac with one outboard motor.Around 7 a.m. on March 29, the Palauan rangers saw one of the Chinese boats again. This time they got close enough to try to shoot out its engines, Baiei said. They hit an engine, but they also hit a Chinese deckhand, Lu Yong. (Palauan rangers say they were not aiming for him; the bullets ricocheted off the engines.) The rangers called for help to rush Lu, 35, to a nearby island where a nurse lived, but he bled to death before they got there. He had a 9-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter in mainland China. But the day would only get more tragic from there.Boarding the Chinese boat and interrogating the rest of the crew, the Palauan rangers soon learned that there was a larger \u2018\u2018mother ship\u2019\u2019 farther at sea, orchestrating the poaching raids. This was too far for the small Zodiac to travel, so two Palauan policemen, Willie Mays Towai and Earlee Decherong, along with an American pilot, Frank Ohlinger, were dispatched in a rented single-engine Cessna to find the ship and call in its coordinates.As night fell, the pilot got lost, and the plane vanished. Meanwhile, about 35 miles from shore, another team, aboard the Remeliik, finally discovered the 80-foot mother ship, which immediately bolted, ignoring several warning shots fired across its bow. After several hours of running, though, the mother ship drifted to a halt. It was soon engulfed in flames, most likely from an intentional fire set to hide any evidence of poaching. The pirate crew scrambled into a lifeboat just before the ship sank, and they were arrested shortly thereafter.The Cessna pilot and the two policemen were still lost, wandering somewhere above the Pacific. The authorities on land came up with an idea: If they could illuminate the islands brightly enough, the pilot might see them and find his way back home. The public safety director ordered all emergency vehicles to drive to the highest points in Koror and turn on their flashing lights. \u2018\u2018Aim spotlights upward,\u2019\u2019 yachters were instructed. The stadium lights at Palau\u2019s Asahi baseball field were switched on. Residents were asked to turn on all household lights. Some stood in the streets waving flashlights. Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, who happened to be vacationing in Palau, provided the two helicopters on his 414-foot mega-yacht, the Octopus, for search and rescue. Allen\u2019s crew was instructed to fire 49 flares, one per minute, into the air. An official in Angaur, an island on the nation\u2019s southern tip, suggested setting some of the outer-atoll wooded areas on fire \u2014 a plan that was quickly dismissed.Back at the command center on Koror, several police officers were trying in vain to contact the plane. Its radio was malfunctioning. They could hear Ohlinger, but he could not hear them. For nearly five hours, culminating in a mayday call at 8:16 p.m., they listened to his growing panic, his rage at the plane\u2019s broken GPS unit and compass and, ultimately, his request that someone alert his next of kin. \u2018\u2018On a good glide slope, heading north,\u2019\u2019 Ohlinger said, as he explained that he and his two passengers planned to crash-land into the sea. \u2018\u2018We are at 6,000 feet, doing 65 knots, out of fuel,\u2019\u2019 were his last words. The wreckage was never found.The major innovation, the one that in the 1930s helped transform fishing from hunting to something more akin to industrial mining, was the giant-scale purse seiner \u2014 a ship that surrounds an entire school of fish with a curtain of netting, sometimes nearly a mile around, then cinches it like a laundry bag. But more innovations followed. World War II gave incentive to the creation of lighter, faster, more durable ships that could travel farther on less fuel. Submarine combat drove improvements in sonar, which turned the ocean top into a glass table, making visible the unseen fathoms below. Subzero onboard freezers freed fishermen from their race against melting refrigerator ice. Innovations in plastics and monofilaments lengthened fishing lines from feet to miles. Lightweight polymer-based nets enabled supertrawlers to rake the ocean even more brutally.But, as the Palauans and their allies are discovering, technology can also be deployed for conservation. Just as authorities can use tracking devices and satellite data to monitor the activities of people on land, they are increasingly able to do so at sea. Since the 1990s, ships have deployed the Automatic Identification System, or A.I.S., a once-voluntary collision-avoidance system whereby onboard VHF transmitters convey their position, identity and speed continuously to other ships and to satellites. In 2002, the United Nations\u2019 maritime organization mandated A.I.S. for nearly all passenger ships regardless of size, and commercial ships, fishing vessels included, with a gross tonnage of more than 300 (typically, that\u2019s a 130-foot long vessel) in international waters.A.I.S. has its shortcomings. Captains are allowed to turn the transponders off when they perceive a credible danger of being tracked by pirates \u2014 a gaping loophole for poachers. The system can be hacked to give false locations. Many of the ships involved in the worst crimes, like the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, are smaller than 300 tonnes and thus exempt from the system entirely. Partly as a response to the deficiencies of A.I.S., many countries now also require fishing vessels to carry an additional device called a vessel-monitoring system, or V.M.S. Typically, this takes the form of a cone-shaped antenna on the roof of the wheelhouse, wired to a locked transceiver and the ship\u2019s control panel, that transmits their location and other data to local fishery authorities at all times.More sea-traffic data may become available soon as countries consider deploying devices in the water \u2014 sonar and camera buoys, as well as low-cost floating hydrophones \u2014 to catch ships approaching restricted areas. Even storm clouds, which long concealed many crimes at sea, no longer pose as much of an obstacle. Satellites armed with syn\u00adthetic-aperture radar can detect a vessel\u2019s position regardless of weather conditions. All this data becomes especially useful when coupled with sophisticated software whose algorithms can trigger alerts \u2014 if, for instance, a vessel goes \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019 by turning off its transponder, if it zigzags in certain formations that indicate that it\u2019s fishing or if it enters a forbidden area. Now, instead of blindly patrolling broad swaths of ocean, the police can target their efforts.Still, the most reliable form of ocean law enforcement continues to be real-time direct surveillance, which is neither easy nor cheap. Generating close-in imagery from the sky depends predominantly on military-grade drones. Ordering up high-resolution photographs from space is still extremely costly, sometimes more than $3,500 per picture, and the company or government that operates the satellite often requires the request for the image to be made days in advance, so operators can aim the lens at the right location on its next trip hurtling around the Earth. Palau experimented with smaller, commercially available drones in 2013, in a project funded by an Australian mining magnate, Andrew Forrest. But the drones proved to be too expensive and hard to fly, and the cameras mounted on the drones gave too tightly circumscribed a view of the waters below.The eventual dream is to create systems that pull all the antipoaching intelligence together in real time, giving the police and their helpers a God\u2019s-eye view of their adversaries. In 2014, SkyTruth joined with Google and the nonprofit group Oceana to build Global Fishing Watch, a website that will allow an army of would-be Bjorn Bergmans to track A.I.S. data on roughly 80,000 vessels worldwide. Last year, Pew teamed up with a British company called Satellite Applications Catapult to create a virtual \u2018\u2018watch room\u2019\u2019 program that, drawing on live satellite tracking data, displays a map of the world traversed by lighted dots, each one a fishing vessel. Even as the vastness of the oceans makes it easy for poachers to escape, technology is also making it harder for them to hide.Many valuable fish species \u2014 including tuna, blue marlin and mahi-mahi \u2014 huddle near floating objects for protection and mating. FADs take advantage of this instinct, attracting fish in spectacularly dense schools that fishermen quickly scoop up. \u2018\u2018Drifting\u2019\u2019 FADs are unanchored: Fishermen track them by following the currents. \u2018\u2018Moored\u2019\u2019 FADs are tethered to the ocean floor, typically with concrete blocks. Increasingly, fishing companies are deploying \u2018\u2018smart\u2019\u2019 FADs equipped with sonar and GPS, enabling operators to sit back and wait for an alert when it\u2019s time to retrieve their haul.The global popularity of FADs is, at least in part, an unintended consequence of the movement to save dolphins. Commercial fishing fleets once found tuna by looking for dolphins, which follow tuna schools and swim near the surface above them. In the 1980s and 1990s, the push for \u2018\u2018dolphin free\u2019\u2019 tuna drove many of these fishermen from the Eastern Tropical Pacific, near Baja, to the Central and Western Pacific Ocean, near Palau, where the dolphins typically don\u2019t follow tuna. In making this move, many of these ships turned to FADs as their new tactic \u2014 even though the devices are widely criticized for further industrializing the harvest of fast-disappearing species like sharks, sea turtles and tuna.On one patrol with Baiei, we stopped at a FAD so that I could dive in for a closer look. Bathwater-warm, the ocean was translucent turquoise, the current as strong as a river. The FAD was low-tech and anchored, just a plastic buoy attached to a thick, mollusk-coated rope tethered to the ocean floor more than 500 feet below. Large bamboo leaves ran down the first 50 feet of the rope, flapping like fuzzy moth wings. Hundreds of tiny silver fish darted under the shade of the leaves. Not one fish was more than a foot long.We visited three more FADs during the patrol that day, traversing more than 100 miles. All were barren. The fish, Baiei explained, were all being taken before they could even come to the reserve. Tuna, like many large ocean fish, are migratory. Even if their natural path might take them to the safety of Palau\u2019s asylum, they can be picked off beforehand in any number of ways \u2014 including by being netted at one of the more than 50,000 floating FADs in the Western and Central Pacific, most of which are perfectly legal.In recent years, a handful of countries have tried to slow the ocean plunder. They have limited trawling, put caps on FAD numbers and imposed rules to limit \u2018\u2018bycatch,\u2019\u2019 the unwanted species caught in the hunt for prized fish. Perhaps the most promising tactic has been to create more no-take reserves like Palau\u2019s. In 2014, the Obama administration added 400,000 square miles of similarly protected territory to United States waters. In 2015, the British government announced its intent to establish the world\u2019s largest continuous marine reserve (322,000 square miles) around the Pitcairn Islands. But these reserves work only if they are well policed. Otherwise, they become magnets for poachers who see them as robust and competition-free zones. And, as we saw at our own little FAD, even a well-policed reserve is not enough to protect the fish who freely swim outside their safe zones. Presently such reserves cover around 2 percent of the world\u2019s seas, but many oceanographers say we need to cover at least 10 percent to make a substantial difference.As the sun set, one marine officer said he wanted to check a final FAD near an islet called Orak, this time in hopes of landing a few fish for dinner. After dragging their longline in circles around it for an hour, they gave up, empty-handed. Docking instead at a nearby island, the officers bought some chicken stew from the local market.I wanted a better view, but as I started to climb onto an upper deck, one of the Indonesian crewmen lunged forward and grabbed my wrist. My hand was inches away from touching an electrified steel cable that the fishermen use to stun catch that flop wildly when first pulled on deck. The crewman pointed to a six-inch black burn mark on a shipmate\u2019s arm, warning me of what the cable could do.As the officers questioned the ship\u2019s captain, I wandered to the back of the ship. A ladder down a hatch led to a four-foot high tunnel, where crawling on hands and knees was the only option. Running the length of the vessel, the tunnel was lined with a dozen six-foot-long cubbies, each with wadded-up clothing at one end serving as pillows. The trip from Taiwan to these waters (about 1,400 miles) takes a little over a week. In high seas and heavy weather, staying on deck is out of the question. The farther I crawled, the darker and muggier it got and the heavier the flow of fumes, heat and noise. A rat scurried ahead. A rancid-smelling liquid dripped from above. The captain later told me that this was runoff from the upper-deck cutting tables.At the deepest end of the tunnel, I came to the ship\u2019s huge diesel engine, churning furiously. I sat in that tight space for a couple of minutes to take in the scene. It dawned on me that the passageway I had just descended was not just the men\u2019s sleeping quarters. It was also the engine\u2019s main exhaust pipe.Back on the Remeliik, I passed the time reading a confidential investigation report about the 2012 Cessna incident, which had been leaked to me by a Palauan official. It in\u00ad\u00adcluded transcripts of interviews with the 25 fishermen from the illegal Chinese boats, who had been arrested and held in the Koror jail for 17 days. Most of the men had never been to sea before, nor did they know the name of their ship, the fishing company or even their captain. Most had handed their identity cards over to the fishing company, which had hired them only several months earlier. Many claimed that they fled that day because they thought the Palauans, who were not in uniform, were planning to rob them. \u2018\u2018He claims that he does not know about any fishing permits,\u2019\u2019 a police investigator said of one deckhand. \u2018\u2018They only follow what the captain tells them.\u2019\u2019The crew members pleaded guilty and were fined $1,000 each. Their small fast boat was destroyed, their gear confiscated. They were then flown home, with their slain colleague, Yong Lu, in a coffin, on a charter flight sent by the Chinese government. One line in the investigation report struck me. It said that in several days of poaching, the Chinese crew caught fewer than a dozen fish, primarily lapu lapu, and several large clams, most of which they later threw overboard as they fled the authorities. It seemed a tragically small yield.In the wheel room of the Remeliik that night, the officers did a post mortem about the day\u2019s boarding, and the discussion turned to the crews that work on these poacher ships. \u2018\u2018Aren\u2019t they the enemy?\u2019\u2019 I asked. Several officers shook their heads to say no. Once the authorities take the foreign crews to shore, there is no guarantee that Palau will have the translators to communicate with them, jail space to hold them or even the laws to effectively prosecute them. Many of the poachers they arrest are from family-owned businesses and are unable to pay the $500,000 fine Palau has the option to levy. The government can seize the ship, but the cost to feed, house and repatriate the crew is often more than its resale value.Near the end of our patrol, Baiei asked me if I had ever seen a diver with the bends. I said I hadn\u2019t. He explained that many of the poachers they chase are Vietnamese, young divers who target sea cucumbers, which live on the ocean floor and look like giant, leather-skinned slugs. The Vietnamese crewmen hold rubber hoses in their mouths attached to an onboard air compressor, strap lead weights around their waists, then dive, often deeper than a hundred feet. During an arrest last year, Baiei said, one of these divers shot to the surface too quickly, causing excruciating bubbles to form in his joints and elsewhere. They took him to a hospital to recover. \u2018\u2018He just kept moaning for days,\u2019\u2019 Baiei said.One of the other officers, who had been listening to the conversation quietly, looked up from his inspection logs. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re the real bycatch,\u2019\u2019 he said. For Palau\u2019s police, the catch \u2014 the far more elusive target \u2014 was the fishing companies who send these desperate men to sea to flout the law. But in a sense, even those bosses are bycatch, too, in a worldwide fishing economy where sanctioned corporations, far more than poachers, are stripping the oceans of life. To save Palau\u2019s fish, and the world\u2019s, the law and its enforcers need to bring an entire industrial system to heel: a mission that requires a level of international cooperation and political will that has yet to materialize.An article on Feb. 21 about the efforts taken by Palau to stop illegal fishing in its waters referred incorrectly to the percentage of illegally caught fish that is consumed. One in every five fish consumed globally \u2014 not in the United States \u2014 is caught illegally.Ian Urbina is an investigative reporter who has been on the staff at The New York Times since 2003.Advertisement"}

The major party and state-run news organizations have been greatly expanding their operations overseas, including in the United States.\u201cI think the sense is, \u2018We own you, we run you, we tell you how things work,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201c\u00a0\u2018The party is the center, and you serve our agenda.\u2019 This is much more central now, and it\u2019s being defined for all media platforms, from social media to commercial media.\u201dUnder Mr. Xi, there has been a steady rollout of policies aimed at tightening control of every aspect of the media, including social networks, films and books.Articles on Mr. Xi\u2019s policy speech, which was not immediately released in full, said the president also demanded that journalists and news organizations \u201cstrictly adhere to the news viewpoint of Marxism\u201d and \u201craise high the banner\u201d \u2014 phrases that mean advancing the interests of the party.Mr. Xi\u2019s policy has been building piecemeal. In 2013, the government began requiring all Chinese journalists to take a test in order to get their press cards renewed, with the aim, among other things, of getting news gatherers to \u201cuphold the Marxist journalistic ideals more consciously.\u201dSome political analysts note that Mr. Xi\u2019s attempts to impose total control over the media say as much about his personal insecurities as they do about any Marxist-Leninist ideological vision that he holds.\u201cThe most important thing is for him to announce his absolute authority,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, a historian. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel effective and confident in dealing with problems, and he lacks a sense of security.\u201dMr. Zhang added, \u201cHe worries the Chinese Communist Party will lose political power, and he also worries that his peers will shove him from his position.\u201dZhang Tiantian contributed research.Advertisement"}

An acquisition would signal China\u2019s continued global business ambitions even at a time when worries about its slowing economic growth have gripped the world\u2019s markets.An announcement could come as soon as Wednesday, when Syngenta reports earnings, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A purchase of Syngenta could help China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States, revolutionize its agriculture sector. A deal could help accelerate China\u2019s push for food independence.Yet questions are expected about its intentions.\u201cNormally, the biggest worry is market concentration, but in this case, it\u2019s the Chinese government,\u201d said Joseph Foudy, a professor of Asian economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University. \u201cAre we comfortable with the Chinese government controlling our genetically modified seeds? What if they limit to countries they don\u2019t like?\u201dNo prominent politicians have raised objections as of yet, but no deal has yet been announced. The price and timing of the proposed transaction were not final and the deal could still fall apart, the people said.An acquisition is likely to face months if not years of scrutiny, both in Europe and the United States. Because Syngenta has a significant presence in the United States, the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, a government panel that reviews takeovers by foreign buyers, would most likely scrutinize any deal.The Chinese company, known as ChemChina, may have timed a takeover in anticipation of a long review process. As the Chinese economy churns along at the lowest growth rate since 2009, ChemChina may be better off trying to strike a deal now to expand its presence in markets outside China.Additionally, the agriculture sector as a whole has been hit by the slowdown, which is part of the reason some companies have sought to consolidate in the first place.But after Dow Chemical and DuPont agreed to combine in December, Syngenta\u2019s opportunity for a merger of its own could be more limited, according to a note by Citigroup analysts. They said that the two most feasible outcomes, from a regulatory standpoint with divestitures, would be an acquisition by either Monsanto or ChemChina.Several months after Syngenta rejected the takeover bid from Monsanto, the Swiss company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Mack, stepped down. John Ramsey, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, ascended to the role in the interim.The new management could make Monsanto more amenable to a refreshed bid, according to Mr. Foudy of N.Y.U.Over the last year, ChemChina has been on an acquisition spree. In its latest deal, it took a minority stake in Mercuria, a Swiss energy and commodities company, in a move to diversify its portfolio and expand into the energy sector.ChemChina has offered to pay about 470 Swiss francs ($461) for every share of Syngenta, one of the people said. That would value Syngenta at approximately $43 billion.Shares of Syngenta surged 3.7 percent, to 392.30 Swiss francs, in Zurich after reports that the companies were near a deal. In United States trading, shares of Monsanto fell 2.9 percent.Syngenta declined to comment on Tuesday; ChemChina did not respond to a request for comment.Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wages Rise as U.S. Unemployment Rate Falls Below 5%", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byIs the American worker finally getting a raise?After years of scant real gains despite steadily falling unemployment and healthy hiring, wages picked up significantly last month, a sign the job market could be tightening enough to force companies to pay more to attract and retain employees.The half a percentage point increase in average hourly earnings in January was the brightest spot in a generally positive Labor Department report on Friday, which showed job creation slowing from the white-hot pace of late 2015 even as the unemployment rate fell to an eight-year low of 4.9 percent.The last six months were the best extended period for employee paychecks since the recovery began six-and-a-half years ago.\u201cThat gain in average hourly earnings is significant,\u201d said Diane Swonk, an independent economist in Chicago. Sustained increases are still needed to make up for years of stagnation, she added, \u201cbut it\u2019s a move in the right direction, and that\u2019s reassuring.\u201dEconomists also said that the new figures suggested that the American economy was holding up well despite a slowdown in China, growing risks in emerging markets and turmoil in the stock market.\u201cThe financial markets are leery,\u201d said Michael Hanson, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, \u201cbut the labor market still looks like it\u2019s continuing to grow.\u201dPresident Obama, who expressed frustration that he has not received the credit he feels he deserves for the country\u2019s improving economy, said the jobs numbers were further signs of progress.\u201cAfter reaching 10 percent in 2009, the unemployment rate has now fallen to 4.9 percent even as more Americans joined the job market last month,\u201d he told reporters at a White House briefing in Washington. \u201cAmericans are working.\u201dOver all, employers added 151,000 jobs last month, a pace that is strong enough to keep soaking up people looking for work if it continues in the months ahead, but a big step down from December\u2019s revised increase of 262,000.The combination of rising pay with a slower pace of hiring and downward pressure on prices from a stronger dollar complicates the picture for the Federal Reserve as it contemplates its next interest rate increase.Wages have shown month-to-month strength during the recovery, only to lapse back into a funk. But a slight increase in the length of the typical workweek in January also bodes well for future salary increases, as do private reports showing the same pattern.An increase in the minimum wage in more than a dozen states at the beginning of 2016 may also be giving hourly earnings an extra tailwind.A December survey by PwC, the accounting and consulting firm, showed companies budgeting for salary raises of nearly 3 percent in 2016, the biggest annual increase since the recovery began. More than a third of executives said they were worried that labor costs could eat into corporate profit margins, nearly twice the number who cited that fear a year ago.\u201cNo doubt about it, I\u2019m hearing that executives are seeing wage pressures and not just in a few pockets of the country,\u201d said Ken Esch, a partner at PwC. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty broad-based.\u201dManagers like Dave Rozenboom, president of First Premier Bank in Sioux Falls, S.D., have had to hand out raises for both existing employees and new hires.Starting salaries for workers who handle credit card customer service and collections recently rose to $13 an hour from $11.75, Mr. Rozenboom said. Hospitals and construction firms in Sioux Falls, where the unemployment rate is 2.6 percent, are also hiring.\u201cThe economy is as strong as it has ever been here,\u201d Mr. Rozenboom said \u201cIt\u2019s a very tight labor market, and we continue to hire.\u201dSioux Falls\u2019s situation may be unusually robust, but the upward trajectory in employment across the country suggests to some analysts that Main Street business leaders like Mr. Rozenboom know something that the Wall Street pessimists don\u2019t.\u201cThe January employment report provides yet one more piece of evidence that the chance of recession this year is truly remote,\u201d said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, N.J. \u201cEconomic activity should accelerate this year as rising employment, income, home values and confidence drive more spending.\u201dOf course, markets are mercurial, foreseeing some recessions that never come to pass, while economists often fail to see that the good times are coming to an end right up until the music stops.Those industries closely tied to commodity markets where prices are dropping showed real weakness last month. Stripping out seasonal adjustments, oil and gas drillers laid off more than 2,000 workers in January, wiping out four years of employment gains. The overall mining industry, which includes the oil sector, has shed 146,000 jobs since September 2014.But jobs in manufacturing, in a reversal from its weakness in the second half of 2015, surged last month, rising by 29,000. The strong dollar and weak export markets in Asia and Europe have hurt factory employment, but some experts suggested that the worst might now be over.\u201cIt\u2019s a sign the manufacturing sector may be stabilizing,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. While the factory sector in the United States is not nearly the size it once was, it plays an important role in the ups and downs of the business cycle and is a source of better-paying jobs for blue-collar workers who have fared poorly in recent decades.The construction industry, another source of higher-paying working-class jobs, also held up well, adding 18,000 jobs despite the colder weather in the eastern half of the country.The overall figures for job creation, as well as the sector-by-sector data, are likely to be revised in future months as more data comes in. The proportion of Americans who are in the labor force, which has been stuck at lows not seen since the late 1970s, ticked up slightly in January.As has been the case since the current recovery began in mid-2009, the most educated workers are doing the best in today\u2019s job market: The unemployment rate for college graduates was unchanged in January at 2.5 percent, while joblessness rose to 7.4 percent for people without a high school diploma.\u201cWe do think the unemployment rate will continue to drift lower and that will support wage growth,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the economy is sliding into a recession.\u201dGardiner Harris contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

With each new delivery to his doorstep \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sometimes several in a day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he faces the source of his guilt and frustration: another cardboard box.Then, when he opens the shipment, he is often confronted with a Russian nesting doll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of boxes inside boxes to protect his electronics, deodorant, clothing or groceries. Mr. Garg dutifully recycles, but he shared his concerns recently on Twitter.A handful of scientists and policy makers are circling the same question, grappling with the long-term environmental effect of an economy that runs increasingly on gotta-have-it-now gratification. This cycle leads consumers to expect that even their modest wants can be satisfied like urgent needs, and not always feel so great about it.\nThe article continues:The environmental cost can include the additional cardboard \u00e2\u0080\u0094 35.4 million tons of containerboard were produced in 2014 in the United States, with e-commerce companies among the fastest-growing users \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the emissions from increasingly personalized freight services.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a whole fleet of trucks circulating through neighborhoods nonstop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dan Sperling, the founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, and the transportation expert on the California Air Resources Board. He also is overseeing a new statewide task force of trucking companies and government officials trying to reduce overall emissions from freight deliveries, including for e-commerce.Dr. Sperling said that consumers shared as much responsibility for the environmental cost of the deliveries as the companies that provided the speedy services.\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a sustainability perspective, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heading in the wrong direction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00e2\u0080\u0094 How much do you shop online? How about your family? \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Have you ever thought about the environmental impact of buying things online? Is it something we should worry about? Should we think twice before making online purchases?\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Are there times when shopping in a brick-and-mortar store makes more sense than buying online, or vice versa? Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Do you have any ideas about how the e-commerce industry and consumers can make online shopping a more sustainable practice?

{"Headline": "In Long Political Career, Sanders Relies on Son as a Constant Witness", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byWhen Mr. Sanders debated Patrick Leahy three years later for a seat in the Senate, Levi went along, staying in the car, where Mr. Leahy\u2019s son babysat him.When Mr. Sanders, the future Burlington mayor, Vermont congressman and senator convened meetings in his dark and cluttered Burlington apartment, Levi was never far, shouting \u201cBernard! Bernard!\u201d from the adjacent room.And when Mr. Sanders celebrated winning the New Hampshire primary for the Democratic presidential nomination this month, Levi, now 46, applauded on stage, right behind him.Unlike most candidates, Mr. Sanders only passingly refers to the members of his family in speeches, and they are largely absent from his ads or campaign imagery. They are, he has made clear, irrelevant to his message about waging a revolution against America\u2019s \u201crigged economy.\u201dMr. Sanders, in fact, has four children and seven grandchildren he calls his own. Three of those children are from the previous marriage of his wife, Jane. But in the beginning, there was Levi, his only biological child.And throughout Mr. Sanders\u2019s long political career, Levi has been a constant witness to a life in which socialist, anti-establishment politics and devoted parenting as a part-time father were all one and the same.\u201cHe is someone who gives hope that things can change,\u201d said Levi Sanders, who has his father\u2019s bounding walk and straight-arm lean into the lectern, before introducing the candidate in Wolfeboro, N.H., in January. He added, \u201cI could go on and on.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. Sanders married Ms. Shiling in 1964, and the lasting memory of that wedding to some who attended was a bee that flew menacingly around the rabbi\u2019s mouth. In less than two years, the marriage fell apart.In March 1969, four days after Mr. Sanders bought an A-frame farmhouse in Stannard, a tiny town with no paved roads in Vermont\u2019s Northeast Kingdom, his girlfriend, Susan Campbell Mott, delivered Levi Noah Sanders.It was a short-lived Vermont idyll. Soon after, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Mott broke up, and she moved to Burlington. Mr. Sanders followed to be close to Levi, according to his brother, who, like several others, said the parents remained amicable partners, sharing custody.Friends recalled Ms. Mott\u2019s picking up Levi at 8 a.m. at his father\u2019s dark, messy house, where there was little in the fridge. (\u201cI eat to live,\u201d Mr. Sanders liked to say.) But Levi, friends said, never wanted for food or affection.Levi Sanders\u2019s anti-establishment upbringing influenced him early on. \u201cI never have called him Dad,\u201d he told People magazine in January. \u201cEven when I was 6 years old, I thought it was childish. He was a friend, not an authoritarian.\u201dThose ideas on home schooling and home birth later became more popular. Some of his other ideas have yet to catch on.The \u201cmanner in which you bring up your daughter with regard to sexual attitudes may very well determine whether or not she will develop breast cancer, among other things,\u201d he wrote. He added that it was important for boys to rebel in school because if they bottled up their emotions, \u201c30 years later, a doctor tells him that he has cancer.\u201dMr. Sanders also thought children should be allowed to vote once they reached puberty. A political ally, Peter Diamondstone, who thought the voting age should be abolished altogether, recalled asking Mr. Sanders: \u201cSo every time you want to have a kid vote they have to go get a physical?\u201dBut when it came to his own son, Mr. Sanders was more traditional.Mr. Sanders gave clear boundaries to Levi, with whom he could occasionally be \u201coverbearing,\u201d according to Nancy Barnett, a friend. She recalled one day when Mr. Sanders, a former cross-country star, ran laps with Levi around the high school track until the 9-year-old stopped with exhaustion.\u201cBernie was adamant,\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2018You started your race \u2014 now you\u2019ve got to finish your race.\u2019\u201dMr. Sanders, as his campaigning has shown, is nothing if not perseverant.They talked often about the crummy state of the world and when Levi visited, which was often, \u201cBernard always tried to include him in the conversation,\u201d Mr. Sugarman said.He added that Mr. Sanders also took Levi to shoot hoops and get books from the library. \u201cHe wanted him to be a well-educated and happy person,\u201d he said.As Mr. Sanders finally found a steady paycheck and national exposure, as the successful socialist mayor of Burlington, Levi attended public schools and followed in his father\u2019s footsteps as a basketball player and member of the track team.\u201cA kind person,\u201d said Jennifer Swiatek, who was in German Club with Levi.And a loyal one. In 1987, Levi returned from college in Springfield, Mass., to appear in the season finale of his father\u2019s cable access show, \u201cBernie Speaks.\u201d Looking intermittently bored, freezing and exhausted in a trench coat, Levi held the microphone for his father in front of City Hall, a hospital, the local paper, the waterfront and a shelter.As mayor, Mr. Sanders kept advocating his views about income inequality and, at a 1988 forum, again denounced the \u201cpsychosomatic aspects of cancer.\u201d That year, he married Jane, and Levi transferred to the University of Oregon. After graduation, he inherited his father\u2019s ideology, but also his economic travails.In 1999, he complained that high rents forced him out of Burlington, as his $20,000-a-year job running the grocery distribution department at a food bank did not pay the bills. A blossoming animal rights activist, he also complained about the state\u2019s decision to kill a black bear that had lost its fear of humans.\u201cIt was just a friendly bear,\u201d he told The Burlington Free Press at the time.He wrote letters urging voters to continue his father\u2019s legacy by voting for progressive candidates and in 2001 was featured in the PBS documentary \u201cPeople Like Us: Social Class in America,\u201d taking the side of the poor in a fight over whether a new Burlington grocery store should be a supermarket or an upscale co-op. He noted with reluctance how poor people looked with suspicion at healthier, natural foods favored by the wealthy. \u201cWhite bread is basically a class issue,\u201d he said, holding a loaf of sourdough.At age 40, Levi Sanders ran for a seat on the Claremont, N.H., City Council, finishing seventh in a field of nine.With his presidential bid in need of some humanizing last fall, Mr. Sanders went trick-or-treating with Levi\u2019s children. Television cameras followed. But so, as always, did Levi, a few paces behind his father.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Fight Won\u2019t Die, No Matter How Hard Republicans Try", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, facing fierce criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, insisted Thursday that they would face no political retribution from their decision to shun any Supreme Court nomination made by President Obama, expressing confidence that they would not be hurt at the polls in November.\u201cThe American people are pretty much split on it,\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, citing polls that showed the country divided on whether the Senate should act on a nomination. \u201cFor that reason, I don\u2019t think it will be a major factor.\u201dBut Democrats said the issue would be valuable in motivating turnout and helping them close the gap with conservative Republican voters energized by Donald J. Trump. They said they were excited about polls showing independent voters siding with Democrats because independents could be in a position to decide not only the presidential election, but also Senate elections in swing states.\u201cTo be honest, this is why people hate the Senate,\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an interview. \u201cElections are about accountability. We have a job to do and we need to do our job. People are going to ask the same question: \u2018Why aren\u2019t you doing your job?\u2019\u00a0\u201dPolls from past presidential elections offer some guidance on voter behavior. However, both parties agreed this year\u2019s election might be unique.In 2008, the last time a new president was being elected, exit polls showed that only 7 percent of those voting considered future appointments to the court to be the most important factor in their choice, although 47 percent rated it as one of several important factors. More than 40 percent said it was a minor factor or none at all.In 2016 races, Rob Jesmer, a Republican consultant and former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said: \u201cIt is not going to change voting behavior. People who feel strongly about this have already made up their minds.Since 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.\u201cThe idea that out of all the issues facing the country \u2014 whether it is ISIS, the economy or immigration \u2014 that this is going to trump those issues, I find to be kind of laughable,\u201d Mr. Jesmer added.Democrats insisted they could use the court fight to spur voters on the individual priorities that resonate with them, citing the stakes for climate change, campaign finance changes, abortion rights, immigration \u2014 mobilizing them on a topic that goes beyond the court but is tied to who chooses the new justice.Whoever turns out to be right, both sides hardened their positions on Thursday as one potential nominee, Brian E. Sandoval, Nevada\u2019s Republican governor, sent out a statement that he did not wish to be considered for the job.Democrats opened their assault when more than two dozen senators stood in a brisk wind in front of the Supreme Court and criticized Republicans for what they said was outrageous intransigence in refusing to consider any nominee to fill the spot left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.But while the tableau of United States senators standing before the court\u2019s iconic marble pillars underscored the Democrats\u2019 determination to raise public pressure on Republicans, it also accentuated their powerlessness, in terms of legislative procedure, to force action on a nominee.Republicans adopted a strategy of trying to deflect attention from the court fight and move on to other business in the Senate.\u201cI think our friends across the aisle would agree that there is a lot of important work that we can, and should, do together,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said in a floor speech urging everyone to get back to work. \u201cI would ask our friends across the aisle, while they come out on the floor or give news conferences and express mock horror, to tone down the rhetoric and avoid the hypocrisy that seems so apparent when they argue for different standards today than they advocated in the past.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, cast the presidential election as a referendum on the court.Divisive Supreme Court decisions are more likely to be re-examined \u2014 and possibly overturned \u2014 when a court changes. In the Roberts Court, 85 cases split 5 to 4 or 5 to 3 with Justice Scalia in the conservative majority, many with similar judicial themes.\u201cDo the American people want to elect a president who will nominate a justice in the mold of Scalia to replace him?\u201d Mr. Grassley asked. \u201cOr do they want to elect President Clinton or Sanders, who will nominate a justice who will move the court in a drastically more liberal direction?\u201dMr. Reid replied by speaking about the court vacancy and quoted Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\u201cI will never agree to retreat from our responsibility to confirm qualified judicial nominees,\u201d Mr. Reid said, quoting a 2007 floor speech by Mr. McConnell.The Republicans reiterated that it would not matter who Mr. Obama put forward, Republican or Democrat, no matter how accomplished a jurist \u2014 the nomination would be dead on arrival.The White House on Thursday said that Mr. McConnell and Mr. Grassley had agreed to meet with Mr. Obama to discuss the vacancy on Tuesday. But the Republicans said they would use the session merely to restate their position. Even as Republicans expressed confidence that there would be little political fallout in November, Democratic challengers across the country began chiding Republican incumbents for refusing to consider a nominee, with particular emphasis on swing states like New Hampshire and Ohio. Some Republicans said privately that if there was a fight worth losing their Senate majority over, protecting the balance of the Supreme Court was it.Standing outside the Supreme Court, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the judiciary committee, accused Republicans of shirking their constitutional responsibility. \u201cI have served in the Senate longer than anybody who is here,\u201d said Mr. Leahy, first elected in 1974. \u201cI have never once, never once, whether the Democrats have been in control or the Republicans, whether there is a Democratic president or a Republican president, seen this total abrogation of their duties.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet Is Murder", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueThey\u2019re boring. They\u2019re useless. Everyone hates them. So why can\u2019t we stop having meetings?Supported bySpecifically, he wanted to talk about meetings as thieves: of joy, of productivity, of mental freedom. Citing a distinction first made by Paul Graham, the prominent venture capitalist, Costache told the room that some people thrive on meetings. These he called Managers, people who require a weekly calendar splotched to saturation with hourly changes of venue and cohort. But there are Makers, too \u2014 poetic souls whose well-being can be shattered by an ill-timed \u2018\u2018sync,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018brand lab\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018share-out\u2019\u2019 in a conference room. Makers can\u2019t live like Managers. They require \u2018\u2018Maker hours\u2019\u2019 \u2014 long, unspoiled afternoons to muse, contemplate the verities, build digital things and play stress-relieving games of Carcassonne. They need rich, solitary, germinative time. In Graham\u2019s formula, Makers flourish in four-hour stretches, which absolutely must \u2014 on pain of inhibiting a company\u2019s growth \u2014 be kept unblemished by meetings.To illustrate Graham\u2019s idea of \u2018\u2018Manager\u2019s schedule,\u2019\u2019 Costache put a riotously mosaicked Google Calendar week on the monitor. Then, as he described the needs of Makers, he summoned to his screen a stunning new Google Calendar week, awash in puffy clouds of white space. It looked like heaven.The room was enthusiastic. Maker hours blend childhood summer-day vagueness with a thick coat of artistic entitlement. But by the time the team dispersed, we\u2019d faced facts: We were Managers or Managers\u2019 minions, most of us, ineligible for stretches of solitude, destined for lives of video conferences and call-in codes. And indeed, only the product, design and engineering teams at Spring \u2014 today\u2019s nobility \u2014 were now slated to enjoy one full day a week of Maker time. The Maker\u2019s schedule was the privilege of the elite builders of code and apps, and the scope of makable things was not going to include casseroles, movies and corn-husk dolls anytime soon. We were to return to days chopped, like hot dogs for toddlers, into meetings.\u2018\u2018Meetings\u2019\u2019: The very word is enervating. With the freedom to peaceably assemble so high up on America\u2019s founding priority list, you\u2019d think that the workers of the free world would gather with more patriotic vigor, just as we speak, bear arms and pursue trials by jury. Instead, the spirit in which we come together, almost hourly in some professions, is something closer to despondency. Fifteen percent of an organization\u2019s time is spent in meetings, and every day, the transcontinental conference room known as the white-collar United States plays host to 11 million meetings, according to research collated by Fuze, the telecommunications company (which might have a stake in publicizing research designed to stoke meeting fatigue). One study mysteriously calculates that the nation wastes more than $37 billion in \u2018\u2018unproductive meetings.\u2019\u2019 The statistics seemed borne out by the several meeting-besotted companies I\u2019ve advised, and I began to wonder if the Manager\u2019s schedule suited anyone but tireless extroverts and PowerPoint connoisseurs.And yet we persist. Meetings must be scratching some kind of itch, if only for fellowship and a reprieve from deskbound loneliness. And what an itch: Meetings are not just considered indispensable to many professions; they are almost coextensive with them. You can make a whole career of planning, holding and attending meetings and never dare contemplate the possibility of your being exempt. They can\u2019t be avoided, but maybe they can be made bearable. I set out to see if anyone had a bright idea.I asked Graham, by email, if he still believed in the split between Managers and Makers that he outlined seven years ago. \u2018\u2018Of course I stand behind it,\u2019\u2019 he wrote back, in brisk, English-accented prose. \u2018\u2018I wrote that essay.\u2019\u2019 Graham then described his ideal meeting, conjuring a congenial fantasy. \u2018\u2018There are no more than four or five participants, and they know and trust one another. They go rapidly through a list of open questions while doing something else, like eating lunch. There are no presentations. No one is trying to impress anyone. They are all eager to leave and get back to work.\u2019\u2019Graham\u2019s minimalist approach to meetings stands in stark contrast to the one taken by Brian Robertson, the author of the notorious management method known as Holacracy, which convenes intense, expressive meetings that encourage every manner of human interaction except maybe professional ones. Robertson, who calls himself a \u2018\u2018recovering C.E.O.,\u2019\u2019 created \u2018\u2018the Holacracy Constitution\u2019\u2019 in 2009, just as skepticism about corporate structures, like the ones at the failed big banks, had turned to fever.The Holacratic system is grounded in small cells of people called Circles. Each Circle holds a weekly or biweekly \u2018\u2018tactical meeting\u2019\u2019 for progress updates and a biweekly or monthly \u2018\u2018governance meeting.\u2019\u2019 A governance meeting starts with a Check-In, or rather (according to Holacracy literature) \u2018\u2018a space for every participant to call out any distraction and get present for the meeting.\u2019\u2019 Everyone speaks, round-robin style.Now presumably present, people \u2018\u2018triage any administrative and logistical issues,\u2019\u2019 or yell out arbitrary personal concerns. Holacracy gives this example: \u2018\u2018Joe needs to leave early.\u2019\u2019 (Abstractions are common in meeting-reform discourse, so Joe\u2019s scheduling constraints are a usefully concrete example of the actual content of modern meetings.)Next, anyone can propose a Tension, which is anything that concerns her. Participants are then free to ask Clarifying Questions, but these in no way can cross into Reactions (because they\u2019re next). A Facilitator has the unenviable job of policing the fine line between pure-hearted questions and bloviation disguised as interrogatives.At last everyone in a Holacratic meeting can yammer freely, without a referee, on their sundry reactions. \u2018\u2018Any type of reaction is welcome, from intellectual critiques to emotional outbursts.\u2019\u2019 Then comes an Amend and Clarify round, and, lest any clarification stand unmuddied for even a heartbeat, a rousing Objection round follows hard upon it. An Integration round comes next, and yet another Objection round, to address any new objections to the Clarification of the Tension and the Reactions to it that have surfaced during the Integration. Finally comes the Closing round, during which each and every person present is invited to share a closing reflection about how to improve the next meeting. After this, there is, explicitly, \u2018\u2018no discussion.\u2019\u2019 Presumably, those with still more to say should be tested for Adderall poisoning.Paul Graham\u2019s idea of tracking workers into separate spheres (vocational and liberal arts?) would seem the precise opposite of Holacracy, which purports to raze hierarchies. But in giving the right of way to special employees \u2014 either those who assert themselves as Makers, or those who feel entitled to florid self-expression in the workplace \u2014 the two approaches have something in common. Both favor artistic and even capricious temperaments. These artist-first systems end up building a new form of social stratification that is every bit as forbidding as the old one.As Butterfield told me through a company representative, \u2018\u2018Slack allows teams to have both asynchronous and synchronous communication across physical locations, allowing more time for thoughtful communication than a typical meeting scenario.\u2019\u2019 With \u2018\u2018asynchronous and synchronous,\u2019\u2019 Butterfield tacitly aimed to correct the widespread impression that Slack replaces email (asynchronous communication) rather than meetings (which are synchronous \u2014 participants respond to one another in real time). The full archiving of meetings on Slack, which requires a fee for some companies, also means that everyone (even Joe, leaving early) can bear witness to a meeting, as questions and decisions are recorded for all to see. Slack\u2019s tagline is \u2018\u2018Be less busy.\u2019\u2019With the firm support of Slack, Under Armour, the athletic apparel company, has opted to turn to the software for meetings, abolishing virtu\u00adally all in-person gatherings. This appeals to Vijay Raghunathan, vice president for engineering at Under Armour, who says that for companies with small offices and spread-out work forces, Slack is a godsend, an elastic virtual room. At the same time, when team members go too far astray into gags or wordplay during a meeting, they\u2019re directed to recreational channels. Sending people to other channels when they go off-topic is called \u2018\u2018raccooning,\u2019\u2019 and being raccooned is like being sent to supremely cool detention: Dedicated channels exist for puns, parenting, puppies and dozens more special interests.So, I asked, what do we do about meetings? Just ban them?Costache thought for a minute. He aspires to turn Spring, with his partners David and Alan Tisch, into a billion-dollar business \u2014 and then return to Romania as a \u2018\u2018benevolent dictator.\u2019\u2019 You can see him pulling it off.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not that radical,\u2019\u2019 he said, at last. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s too much value to an in-person meeting. When my engineering team has to decide what they want to build in the next two weeks, this is hard to do without meetings. Say it\u2019s me and three other senior engineers discussing an architectural choice about our Python code base. We start to discuss what that looked like, and give one person feedback. .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s so much volume of information \u2014 it\u2019s like a river of information. If it\u2019s a valuable meeting, we all pour this information. Someone\u2019s distraction, another person\u2019s incomprehension. I have this image of a giant pipe, so much richness. It couldn\u2019t go on Slack.\u2019\u2019Meetings sounded like luxury goods in Costache\u2019s telling. Arid conference rooms started to fade from memory, as I pictured the Hudson, the Ganges.Aiming for Costache\u2019s idiom, I asked: Is it like high-bandwidth information versus a file that\u2019s compressed and thinned out?\u2018\u2018No. You\u2019re trying to be digital. I\u2019m going the other way. The rivers. The trickle of water. I like analog analogies. Maybe Slack is like Morse code versus in-person meetings, which are like written words. They say much more.\u2019\u2019Such consequential meetings were nonetheless the preoccupation of Henry Martyn Robert. Robert, the original meeting hacker, was prompted to renovate meetings in the 1860s, when a discussion of abolitionist politics at a Baptist church in New Bedford, Mass., devolved into chaos. Robert, an Army engineer, was supposed to be in charge. In his private, handwritten business blog, Robert wrote: \u2018\u2018One can scarcely have had much experience in deliberative meetings of Christians without realizing that the best of men, having wills of their own, are liable to attempt to carry out their own views without paying sufficient respect to the rights of their opponents.\u2019\u2019Determined to rule with more authority, Robert researched and wrote the \u2018\u2018Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies,\u2019\u2019 loosely based on the practices of the United States House of Representatives. A speaker takes the Floor; an all-powerful Chairman or Chairwoman recognizes him or her; Motions are made, and then denied or sustained; Resolutions are voted on, or tabled. Hierarchies don\u2019t just creep back in, as in Holacracy. Instead, they\u2019re explicitly enforced. The 11th edition of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, as it\u2019s now called, appeared in 2011.A meeting run by Robert\u2019s Rules can be a joy to behold \u2014 though it\u2019s clotted by as much jargon as a Holacratic meeting. That Robert\u2019s Rules crystallized in wartime may explain their frank hostility to the chaos of human emotions \u2014 the very emotions that, at tech companies, enjoy full flower. Each participant in Robert\u2019s Rules becomes a binary element: a switch, only ever on or off, pro or con. All the minds in the room, having accepted their role as machine code, come together to approximate an algorithmic organism. No Makers, no rock stars, no special snowflakes of any kind are allowed creative expression, any more than they\u2019d be allowed creativity on an election ballot.

{"Headline": "Stakes in Nevada Rise for Hillary Clinton as Caucuses Near", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byAfter solid showings in two overwhelmingly white states, Mr. Sanders will have an opportunity to answer the central question for many Democrats trying to judge whether he is more than a particularly strong early-contest protest candidate. This state is as racially diverse as Iowa and New Hampshire are not: About 20 percent of the Democratic electorate is Hispanic, and 13 percent African-American. Over 95 percent of Vermont, his home state, is white.For Mrs. Clinton, Nevada offers a chance to put her campaign on solid footing after a staggering double-digit defeat in New Hampshire that stirred new concerns among Democrats about her political strengths. She opened her first office here last April, six months before Mr. Sanders. Her national campaign manager, Robby Mook, ran Nevada for Mrs. Clinton in 2008, when she narrowly won the popular vote, though in a quirk of Nevada caucus rules, lost the delegate vote.\u201cIt really is the first test there is of how effective you are going to be in mobilizing the Democratic coalition in a general election,\u201d she said.Mr. Sanders\u2019s senior adviser, Tad Devine, said Monday that campaign workers from Iowa, where Mr. Sanders nearly tied Mrs. Clinton, were being flown into Nevada to beef up a 90-person operation already in place. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advisers declined to disclose the size of their paid staff here. Mr. Sanders began advertising here in early December; Mrs. Clinton began in early January.\u201cIt has become more competitive,\u201d Mr. Devine said. Nevada, he added, presents a \u201cfair test\u201d of Mr. Sanders\u2019s potential national appeal. \u201cNow we are moving into a different region in the country, a much more diverse group of voters.\u201dThe campaign unfurling here heading into the Feb. 20 caucuses could be instructive for reasons that go beyond Mr. Sanders\u2019s ability to extend his demographic reach and the durability of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s second bid for the presidency.\u201cMy street, oh my God, almost every house on that block of 20 houses was hit,\u201d said Elizabeth Meinhold, 59, a Clark County high-school teacher who is supporting Mr. Sanders and said she believed Mrs. Clinton stood for \u201cthe establishment.\u201d\u201cWe need real change and real movement in this country. Too much money is in the hands of a few,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe last 40 years has been deregulation, tax cuts, Reaganism \u2014 it\u2019s a disaster in my opinion.\u201dLess attention has been paid so far by the Republican presidential candidates to their party\u2019s Nevada caucuses, which take place three days after the Democrats\u2019 contest. Instead, Republicans have been focusing on their South Carolina primary, which is on the same day as the Democratic caucuses here.Nevada is a relatively new battlefield for Democrats, but it will almost certainly be an important one in the general election. That there is little history to draw on, and that Nevada is a state of constantly shifting populations \u2014 people often come here seeking luck and opportunity, and leave if they find neither \u2014 means polling is scant and suspect.The caucuses were championed by Mr. Reid in 2008 to increase Nevada\u2019s influence in the nominating process, and to bolster its economy with the influx of campaign workers and journalists that comes with a competitive contest. In an interview, Mr. Reid said he was heartened that the Iowa and New Hampshire outcomes had heightened Nevada\u2019s importance, and argued that this was appropriate, given the state\u2019s diversity and interests.\u201cI am glad that we are not going to be overshadowed by what happens in New Hampshire and Iowa,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cWhy should a person\u2019s ability to run for president be determined by New Hampshire and Iowa? They are not representative of America.\u201dMrs. Clinton has some noteworthy advantages. Her campaign is staffed by people steeped in Nevada politics, led by Mr. Mook, who is taking particular interest in the state. \u201cWe built this campaign, starting when she announced in April, to win a competitive primary,\u201d Mr. Mook said. \u201cThat means not taking anything for granted. That means building a real presence. Nevada is an important part of that strategy.\u201dWhen Mr. Clinton campaigned for his wife here on a chilly evening before the first votes were cast in Iowa, people lined up for hours to see him.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cLas Vegas has been good to us,\u201d Mr. Clinton told the crowd. \u201cNevada has been good to us. You voted for me twice. We are very grateful.\u201dRon Nelsen, 60, the owner of a garage door company, said he had always supported the Clintons and planned to again on Feb. 20. \u201cI like her vision of the country and health care and lifelong expertise in government,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care was my issue when Bill Clinton was elected the first time.\u201dBut, as in Iowa, Mr. Sanders has arrived with a boom that has discomfited the Clinton campaign, opening 11 offices in the state (compared with seven for Mrs. Clinton) and flooding television stations with advertisements.A recent debate-watching party was packed with supporters wearing red Sanders T-shirts. They cheered Mr. Sanders and hooted at Mrs. Clinton.When the lights came up during a commercial break, an organizer shouted: \u201cGet on Twitter everybody! Tweet, tweet, tweet!\u201d\u201cIn 2008, I worked in the Obama campaign and we saw a lot of young people involved,\u201d said Joan Kato, Mr. Sanders\u2019s Nevada state director, as college students sprawled on the floor of her campaign office, using cellphones to call voters. \u201cWe are seeing it again.\u201dEmmy Ruiz, who is Mrs. Clinton\u2019s state director, said the complexities involved in organizing for any caucus would pose a challenge for Mr. Sanders since he started late.\u201cYou cannot parachute in and run up the score in the caucus the same way you might be able to do in a primary,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what we have been preparing for.\u201dRepresentative Dina Titus, Democrat of Nevada, said she was confident that Mrs. Clinton, whom she supports, would be able to overcome a surge of new voters.Nevada remains \u201cClinton country,\u201d she said.Still, she said she was struck by the force of Mr. Sanders\u2019s presence. \u201cHe\u2019s making a race out of it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly going to get some votes.\u201dKimberly McGee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They included a swimming pool, a visitor center, a helipad, a cattle enclosure, an amphitheater, three houses for Mr. Zuma\u2019s personal employees and even a chicken coop. (The government tried to justify the swimming pool by characterizing it as potential firefighting equipment.)Mr. Zuma did not specify how much he would repay.The government at first insisted that the home upgrades were security enhancements, and at one point, Mr. Zuma told Parliament that he had paid for the improvements himself. But late in 2012, critics filed complaints with the office of the public protector, whose job is to investigate allegations of official misconduct, and demanded an investigation.The court is scheduled to hear the case on Feb. 9, two days before Mr. Zuma delivers his annual State of the Nation address to Parliament. At last year\u2019s address, a brawl broke out between security forces and opposition politicians who chanted, \u201cPay back the money.\u201dOn Wednesday, the two opposition parties said they were proceeding with their case, despite Mr. Zuma\u2019s announcement.\u201cHow those irregularities happened continues to be investigated in separate inquiries relating to officials and professional consultants on the project,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe report specifically found no wrongdoing of any kind by the president. It also found no benefit for which the president could to any degree be required to compensate the state in relation to nearly all aspects of the project.\u201dThe statement said Mr. Zuma had intended \u201cto achieve an end to the drawn-out dispute,\u201d but did not specify how much money he would repay. Instead, he suggested that the amount \u201cshould be independently and impartially determined\u201d by the country\u2019s auditor general and finance minister.

{"Headline": "Players Find Path to China Can Be a Golden One", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byGlobal SoccerLONDON \u2014 As the migration of soccer players from Europe to China continues, much of the rhetoric is falling short on understanding.Players leaving European clubs and heading to different continents is nothing new, look at Major League Soccer. But there is a difference between what the Chinese clubs have done and what the M.L.S. did so selectively with big names like David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Andrea Pirlo.The players heading west to M.L.S. have largely been at the end of their careers, trading their fame for a few seasons in the land of the dollar. Those rushing east to chase the renminbi are closer \u2014 much closer \u2014 to being in the prime of their careers.Many of them have been on the money trail since their early teens. Like soccer mercenaries, they have been shipped out of their countries in South America, Africa and, more recently, Asia, by talent spotters to join rich clubs in Europe.They know no other life. Their place at a top team is dependent on the whim of the coach, whose own tenure might not last a season at any one club. And when playing careers can be ended by the next tackle, why should we blame young men for crossing this final frontier in search of a living?It might just be \u2014 though nobody is betting on it \u2014 that a few of the hundreds now playing in the China are intrigued by the challenge of a different culture.But Lawrenson, who grew up in northern England, did not have to move far or learn a new language or wonder how long management would last at Liverpool. When he joined the Reds, it was a career move to one of Europe\u2019s most stable giants.There is no such stability today, and very little expectation that a top player (other than Lionel Messi at Barcelona or Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid) will stay in one place for most of their prime.Besides that, Alex Teixeira was in a place he needed to get out of. He had moved, together with a whole batch of fledging Brazilian players, to Shakhtar Donetsk when they were in their teens and Shakhtar\u2019s billionaire owner had the money to put his Ukrainian team on the map of global soccer.Then came the civil unrest, the bombing of Shakhtar\u2019s fine stadium and the team\u2019s move hundreds of miles away, along with the inevitable breakup of the club\u2019s Brazilian core, which helped revolutionize soccer in a beleaguered part of eastern Europe.So Alex Teixeira saw his teammates scatter to clubs that could afford to remove them from Donetsk. He saw negotiations between Liverpool and Shakhtar go to the brink, then collapse at the deadline for transfers in Europe. It was said that the Brazilian only had to wait until the transfer window, in July, and Liverpool would seal the deal.What were the guarantees on that? Six months is a long time in sports, and probably a longer time for a Brazilian marooned in Ukraine after some of his best pals had flown that nest.It is human nature for someone like Alex Teixeira \u2014 who is extremely talented, by the way \u2014 to ask himself, \u201cWhy not China?\u201d It would not be unrealistic for him to observe that scores of Brazilians, both top players and coaches, have joined the exodus there.Athletes do not have to cross cultural boundaries unless they really wish to. They can live wherever fortune takes them, and most barely ever come out of the cocoon that surrounds players. They are encamped in training bases, sealed off from the community around them. Their housing is taken care of, along with the schooling for their kids, their food, even their camaraderie.This is not exclusive to China. It can happen in Rome, in Madrid, even in Liverpool, because they might be required to play three games nearly every week in a 10-month season, and then they are taken off for overseas tours to make the club even more money and to build the brand.Those tours invariably go to one of two places \u2014 the United States or Asia.According to legend, the new frontier of China is where soccer developed, centuries before England and Scotland began to export it 150 years ago. China, of course, has gone through periods of upheaval, when its culture and economy and its sports could not even think about competing with the West.No more. And whatever the slowdown in China\u2019s economy, there is clearly enough money left around for its clubs to throw unforeseen fortunes at the talented feet of foreign players.The players are following the same instinct that Europeans did when they left a century or two ago to find their fortunes in places like Shanghai and Guangzhou: Go east, young man.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China\u2019s Economic Picture Turns Uglier, Beijing Applies Airbrush", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byBEIJING \u2014 This month, Chinese banking officials omitted currency data from closely watched economic reports.Weeks earlier, Chinese regulators fined a journalist $23,000 for reposting a message that said a big securities firm had told elite clients to sell stock.Before that, officials pressed two companies to stop releasing early results from a survey of Chinese factories that often moved markets.The effort to control the economic narrative plays into a wide-reaching strategy by President Xi Jinping to solidify support at a time when doubts are swirling about his ability to manage the tumult. The persistence of that tumult was underscored on Thursday by a 6.4 percent drop in Chinese stocks, which are now down more than a fifth since the beginning of this year alone.But the tightly scripted story makes it ever more difficult to get information needed to gauge the extent of the country\u2019s slowdown, analysts say. \u201cData disappears when it becomes negative,\u201d said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, which analyzes the Chinese economy.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.The party\u2019s attitude has raised further questions among executives and economists over whether Chinese policy makers know how to manage a quasi-market economy, the second-largest economy in the world, after that of the United States.Economists have long cast some doubt on Chinese official figures, which show a huge economy that somehow manages to avoid the peaks and valleys that other countries regularly report. In recent years, China made efforts to improve that data by releasing more information more frequently, among other measures. It also gave its financial media greater freedom, even as censors kept a tight leash on political discourse.\u201cMany economic indicators are on a downward trend in China, and economic data has become quite sensitive nowadays,\u201d said Yuan Gangming, a researcher at the Center for China in the World Economy at Tsinghua University.The restrictions illustrate the Chinese government\u2019s competing priorities, said Leland R. Miller, president of China Beige Book International, which surveys Chinese companies. \u201cThe environment is getting tougher and tougher to operate in,\u201d he said, though he added that his company had not been told to rein in its activities.\u201cWe are going to continue to see crackdowns on people telling a different story than what Beijing wants to hear,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAt the same time, Beijing appears to be conflicted on this issue, because it recognizes that without independent gauges, commercial relations and foreign direct investment will suffer, due to growing skepticism over official data.\u201dA spokeswoman for Markit declined to comment, while Caixin representatives did not respond to a request for comment.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.\u201cIt\u2019s a very influential economic indicator, and it\u2019s highly cited overseas,\u201d said Mr. Yuan, the researcher at Tsinghua. \u201cGiven the international worry over the Chinese economy, I had a sense last August that the Caixin indicator wouldn\u2019t really last long, because its publishing in mainland China had touched high-tension lines.\u201dBoth sets of numbers, which show commercial banks\u2019 foreign exchange purchase positions, appeared last year in the central bank\u2019s monthly announcements. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, did not answer a request for comment.The National Bureau of Statistics did not return requests seeking comment.Ms. Stevenson-Yang, of J Capital Research, said she and her colleagues had seen growing discrepancies in official data in the last two years in a variety of sectors, including retail, shipping and steel production. She said a colleague had once called a Chinese cement factory to ask for production data, and a factory employee had thought the researcher was calling from a government-affiliated research association. The employee told the researcher that the factory had already changed its numbers twice and would rather not do it again, so the researcher could choose any number that fit.\u201cWhen you go around and meet state-owned industry people, everybody laughs at the national statistics, so I don\u2019t know why foreigners believe them,\u201d Ms. Stevenson-Yang said.Capital Economics, a London research firm, said in a recent report that problems with China\u2019s statistical system \u201cgo beyond those found in an emerging economy. The biggest is that the G.D.P. growth rate is politically sensitive, which makes it more likely to suffer manipulation.\u201d The firm does its own growth-rate estimate for China\u2019s gross domestic product, which it put at 4.3 percent last year.China\u2019s online monitors have intensified their policing of chatter about markets. \u201cThe People\u2019s Bank has gone crazy,\u201d read one recent post that was later deleted, referring to the central bank. Another deleted post said: \u201cOne mistake after another. All assets are gone.\u201dLast June, Liu Qintao, a journalist for a newspaper in Shandong Province, posted in an online forum a message he had seen about Dongguan Securities, a Chinese brokerage firm. The post said Dongguan Securities had warned \u201cV.I.P. investors\u201d about coming risks and had urged them to sell.The next day, Dongguan Securities said none of its employees had issued the warning. Chinese stock markets began crashing two weeks later.On Jan. 8, more than six months after he posted the message, officials fined Mr. Liu $23,000 on a charge of having spread fabricated information. Mr. Liu said in an interview that he was being made a scapegoat and was appealing the fine.\u201cI didn\u2019t fabricate the message,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would I do that? Who would make up things like that? All I did was copy and paste it.\u201dThe China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to a request for comment.Last summer, Mr. Carnes said, China started to make it more difficult to gain access to online information about companies. \u201cIn general, over time, the trend has been positive and improving, but since last summer, we did see another step backward,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic and feel over all that the long-term trend is still improving,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is an unfortunate setback.\u201dEdward Wong reported from Beijing, and Neil Gough from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "The Last of the Bushes", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byGEORGE H. W. BUSH was the first politician I ever disliked. I was 12, my parents were loyal Democrats, and every night we\u2019d watch the news, cheer for whatever Bill Clinton was saying on the trail, and then glower at the screen when Peter Jennings went to Brit Hume, then the White House correspondent, for an update on what the incumbent president was up to.One answer, I learned later, was that relatively few people really did. Not that Bush hadn\u2019t earned his share of admirers across his distinguished career. But by the standards of modern presidents he lacked a truly passionate fan base. The conservative movement was perpetually disappointed in him; liberals gave him no credit for his moderation; the press never swooned for him; and few voters bonded with him the way they did with the beloved Reagan, the charismatic Clinton \u2013 or even, eventually, with a more populist and swaggering President Bush.So my 12-year-old self\u2019s political instincts weren\u2019t all wrong. The elder Bush had many gifts, but he was not a particularly appealing politician.Neither, it turns out, is his second son. We\u2019ve reached the last stand of the Jeb Bush campaign, the make-or-break moment, and unless New Hampshire delivers a dramatic surprise his $100 million juggernaut is just days or weeks away from breaking down. And in many ways, the Jeb! campaign has recapitulated his father\u2019s struggle to play the modern presidential part.So unless something dramatic changes, Bush family history will have repeated itself \u2014 the first time as a rise and fall, the second time just as a flop.But before it does, it\u2019s worth recalling that after he was ejected from the White House, people realized that actually George H. W. Bush had been a pretty good president.Not a transformative one, to be sure; not an ideological hero in the mold of Reagan or Franklin Roosevelt. But precisely because the elder Bush lacked certain politicians\u2019 gifts, he also lacked certain characteristic politicians\u2019 weaknesses \u2014 the appetitive indiscipline of his successor, the headstrong utopianism of his son, the polarizing arrogance of our present chief executive.Which meant that while his presidency left no major domestic policy legacy, it also bequeathed few disasters, and left the economy in good shape for its 1990s boom. His foreign policy built on Reagan\u2019s achievements, but Bush presided successfully over an extraordinarily fraught four years (the Berlin Wall, the invasion of Kuwait, the fall of the Soviet Union) and left office with U.S. interests arguably stronger than at any point in modern history.But the funny thing is, it might be true. Jeb has proven, over many painful months, that he lacks the gifts required to win a primary campaign. But the democratic process is hardly infallible, and a great deal of damage can be done by presidents rich in political charisma \u2014 and with it zeal, self-righteousness and certainty.Between Cruz, Rubio, Hillary and Bernie \u2014 to say nothing of Donald Trump \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of those qualities to go around. Which makes me fear that we could do a lot worse than John Ellis Bush. And that we probably will.Now, before he goes \u2014 please clap.Advertisement"}

Income inequality remains stark. In recent weeks, volatility in the stock market and boisterous populism on the 2016 campaign trail have amplified fears about the economy\u2019s ability to raise living standards for most Americans.Mr. El-Erian, former chief executive of the bond-trading giant Pimco, considers those fears well founded. Not long ago, he observed in an interview, some analysts envisioned high finance as a new engine of United States growth in a globalized economy, a step up \u201cthe value-added chain,\u201d like earlier moves from agriculture to manufacturing to high technology.Recent economic history, however, has highlighted the limitations of reliance on the financial industry. It places an increasing proportion of income in the hands of wealthy Americans, who spend a smaller percentage of their income than the less affluent, suppressing demand. It fuels bubbles in the value of financial assets that destabilize markets when they burst. The Fed\u2019s stimulative tools operate through Wall Street, exacerbating those problems.What\u2019s vital now, Mr. El-Erian argues, are large-scale investments in the \u201creal economy\u201d with greater potential to create stable, widely distributed growth. They are measures only a president and Congress can take: improved public infrastructure, enhanced education and job training, an overhaul for a convoluted tax system rife with perverse incentives.That\u2019s enough to depress anyone watching Washington in recent years. Politicians have acknowledged the need to take such steps but have consistently proved unable to bridge partisan differences and take them.Results in the early stages of the 2016 campaign have increased pressure for Congress to act by highlighting the breadth of economic discontent among voters. But the divergent nature of the solutions proposed by both parties \u2014 tax cuts versus tax increases, smaller government versus ramped-up spending \u2014 point toward continued gridlock.A small glint of encouragement lies in Mr. El-Erian\u2019s assessment that even small steps from government can produce a virtuous cycle of productive investment by businesses awash in cash.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually take a Big Bang,\u201d Mr. El-Erian said. \u201cWashington just needs to deliver a small bang.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gogel, the chairman and chief executive of Clayton Dubilier & Rice, said during a panel discussion on Tuesday. \u201cBut as private equity investors, we\u2019re both buyers and sellers. We\u2019ve just come off of five extraordinary years last year in terms of where the private equity industry returned some $900 billion of proceeds back to investors.

He said the turmoil in the markets in recent months had reduced the valuation of those companies by \u20ac1.5 billion since CVC\u2019s exit.\u201cWhen I look at those stocks that are now worth four-and-a-half billion, I say those are pretty good values,\u201d Mr. Koltes said.William E. Ford, the chief executive of General Atlantic, said there was a \u201creal turning of the tide\u201d in terms of the investment environment, with a significant valuation reset in the public markets.\u201cThat\u2019s likely to follow through to the private markets,\u201d Mr. Ford said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the early stages of the private market revaluation. It will take on the order of six to 12 months to really take hold.\u201dAs for Mr. Black, he said Apollo\u2019s teams were reviewing three or four memos a week related to the debt of \u201cvery good, franchise companies\u201d were the pricing has come down substantially in recent months and can provide attractive returns.\u201cThat is a very attractive risk-reward opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot more of them coming.\u201dHe also noted that Apollo had put about a third of the capital in its latest fund \u2013 about $18 billion \u2013 to work up until about a month ago.If the deals are completed, Apollo will have put about half of the capital in its latest fund to work, Mr. Black said.\u201cI think there are opportunities on a selective basis on the equity side,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, increasingly over this next year, there will be more opportunities on the debt side.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Syrian Opposition Groups Sense U.S. Support Fading", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byGAZIANTEP, Turkey \u2014 The United States and its allies have spent many millions of dollars backing Syrian opposition fighters they deem relatively moderate and secular, and civilian groups whose work on small businesses and local councils they billed as the cornerstone of Syria\u2019s future.But the very Syrians who benefited \u2014 and risked their lives in the process \u2014 now say that investment is in danger of going down the drain, and they see little urgency from Washington, diplomatic or military, to save it.\u201cWhat are you going to do, other than statements?\u201d Zakaria Malahifji, the political chief of one of the largest rebel groups given weapons and salaries by the C.I.A. and its counterparts in several European and Arab states, demanded in a recent message to contacts at the French Embassy.In nearly five years of war and insurrection, many Syrians have been repeatedly disillusioned by what they saw as a mismatch between tough American rhetoric against the Syrian government and comparatively modest efforts to aid some of its opponents. President Obama said President Bashar al-Assad must go, and drew a red line over the use of chemical weapons, but backed off on both, diminishing anti-government Syrians\u2019 trust.But the confusion and despair has reached a new level over the last week, as forces backing Mr. Assad have pushed farther north into Aleppo Province, sending tens of thousands of new refugees to the Turkish border. With insurgent groups losing troops and territory, their villages shattered by Russian warplanes, civilians and fighters have in recent days used phrases like \u201cno hope,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s finished\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cBye-bye, revolution,\u201d Abu al-Haytham, a spokesman for Thuwwar al-Sham, another rebel group supported through the C.I.A. program, said in a text message on Friday from Tal Rifaat, a town in northern Aleppo that is increasingly threatened by the government advance.American-backed insurgents have long been used to the American stance in recent years, that the United States did not want them to actually win the war \u2014 lest a sudden toppling of Mr. Assad lead to Islamist rule \u2014 but wanted to prevent them from losing for long enough to pressure the government to negotiate for a political solution.Now they fear that the United States and its allies may actually let them lose. Many of the rebel leaders who have received Western support were headed Tuesday night to meet with American officials and others in Istanbul and Ankara, but they were not hopeful for game-changing developments.The Obama administration has said for months that there is no military solution to the conflict in Syria, and that its plan for confronting the chaos inside the country was to try to forge a political transition through United Nations-led talks that would ultimately lead to Mr. Assad\u2019s departure. But as those negotiations faltered last week amid heavy bombings by the Syrian government backed by Russia, it was clear that the strategy was doing nothing to change the dynamic on the ground.Secretary of State John Kerry was left berating Russia publicly for failing to live up to its commitments to pursue a cease-fire and allow humanitarian access inside Syria, while making a frantic round of phone calls to Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, to try to salvage the political talks.Mr. Kerry has been subject to increasing criticism, after an incident last week in which Syrian civil-society workers buttonholed him at a London cocktail party thrown by Prince Charles after an international donors\u2019 conference on Syria. According to one of the Syrians who was there, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her organization, the Syrians asked the secretary to put more pressure on Russia and the Syrian government to stop attacks and sieges on civilians.The Syrian said Mr. Kerry seemed to blame the opposition for refusing to participate in United Nations-led talks in Geneva, and when the Syrians mentioned that 230 barrel bombs had fallen on Aleppo that day, he corrected them, saying it was 180.Over four years of war has forced more than four million to flee the country, fueling a migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe.Then, the Syrian said, Mr. Kerry added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to get much worse. This will continue for three months, and by then the opposition will be decimated.\u201d Pressed further, Mr. Kerry said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do, go to war with Russia?\u201dAs this story rocketed around social media, the State Department spokesman, John Kirby, declared on Monday that Mr. Kerry was \u201cmaking no predictions about three months this or three months that.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Kirby told reporters that \u201cthere\u2019s been no badgering of the opposition,\u201d and that Mr. Kerry simply objected to the rebel groups\u2019 placing \u201cpreconditions\u201d on the negotiations.\u201cIf you put preconditions on it, you make it too easy, certainly for the regime and its supporters, to use that as an excuse not to talk and not to sit down and not to begin any dialogue,\u201d Mr. Kirby said.Opposition representatives say they are not imposing preconditions but asking for the implementation of existing U.N. Security Council resolutions to end starvation sieges and indiscriminate bombings, tactics forbidden under international law, and that access to aid should not be subject to negotiations.Here in Gaziantep, the rebel representative, Mr. Malahifji \u2014 whose group\u2019s Koranic name translates to Go Straight as You Were Commanded \u2014 was one of several Syrians worried that the government and its allies could fight all the way to the Turkish border within weeks. Asked about the chance of retaking areas lost over the past week in Aleppo Province, Mr. Malahifji, who is originally from Aleppo\u2019s old city, gave a deep sigh.\u201cWe need real diplomatic pressure or air support, and we don\u2019t have either,\u201d he said, adding that rebels could recover ground only if the United States allows its allies to give them antiaircraft missiles. That is unlikely because of fears they could fall into extremist hands. Still, he warned that even if the government routs rebels from northern Aleppo Province, it would not end the conflict. \u201cThey can capture it, but they can\u2019t rule it,\u201d Mr. Malahifji said. \u201cThey will not last long, but now we are looking at a humanitarian catastrophe.\u201dAlong parts of Syria\u2019s frontier with Turkey, aid agencies reported a drastic increase in the number of people fleeing the Aleppo area, where there have been more than 200 airstrikes a day.Doctors Without Borders, a medical charity, said roughly 23,000 Syrians were massed near the border town of Azaz, adding to the pressures created by tens of thousands of displaced Syrians already encamped in the region. \u201cThere is an urgent need for shelter, water access, sanitation and showers, and specific nonfood items such as blankets and insulating mattresses for displaced families,\u201d the charity said in a statement.The United Nations refugee agency implored Turkey \u2014 which already houses more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, the most of any country \u2014 to allow \u201ca broader access to Turkish territory for all those in need of international protection.\u201dThe agency also asked for other nations to \u201cswiftly and meaningfully increase support to Turkey.\u201dHuddled in restaurants and offices around Gaziantep, Syrian and international development workers were more bereft than ever.Dahham, who uses a nickname to protect family back in Syria and to avoid jeopardizing aid by criticizing the West, said programs he had worked on, to build up village economies, were now in jeopardy.Aside from the blow to the villages, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of money\u201d for the backers.A group of international aid workers sat in a cafe discussing what they called \u201cthe million-dollar question\u201d: how to respond to Syrian partners who were calling in despair and asking if their work had been in vain.Their projects with refugees in Turkey and with communities inside Syria, they said, were predicated on the idea that one day, the refugees would return and the towns would govern themselves. Now, they said, those Syrians would be more likely to think of joining the flow of refugees.\u201cWhat happened in Aleppo really takes away a lot of the hopes for that transitional future,\u201d one worker said. \u201cHow do you tell someone, \u2018You need to stay engaged,\u2019 when their home village just took hundreds of bombs in a day?\u201dReporting was contributed by Julie Hirschfeld Davis in Washington, Rick Gladstone in New York, Hwaida Saad in Beirut, Lebanon, and Karam Shoumali in Gaziantep, Turkey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Far Left Has America Moved?", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFROM the earliest days of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, a comforting assumption developed among much of the center-right political world. The thinking went like this: President Obama was far more liberal than the majority of the country. But given his extraordinary political talents, the fatigue of the George W. Bush years, the economic crisis and the excitement of electing the first African-American president, the country picked him not because of his ideology but in spite of it.Once this unique political figure was no longer on the ballot, America would revert to the less liberal, more center-right direction that was the norm after World War II. Under this scenario, President Obama wasn\u2019t some profound historical shift but more of an eccentric diversion.How did we get here?Though only 16 years separated the election of Bill Clinton and that of President Obama, the two politicians seemed to represent the same party in name only. The 1992 campaign was dedicated to defining \u201ca different kind of Democrat.\u201d That was basically a nicely packaged phrase to stress that Bill Clinton and Al Gore were not crazy \u2014 or weak \u2014 liberals like the party\u2019s recent lineup of losers.By 2008 a different set of issues emerged, addressed with a new vocabulary. Mr. Obama made the case that he and the Democratic Party were best able to deal with the crushing pain of disappearing jobs and escalating inequality. The urgent need to prevent any more terrorist attacks had morphed to an urgent longing to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Liberals now called themselves progressives and embraced the label.This starts to paint a very different picture of the direction of the country. Instead of President Obama representing a quirky left shift engendered by his charisma, Iraq and the Great Recession, what if he turned out to have been a transitional figure to a considerably more leftward tilt? What if in 10 or 20 years we look back on the Obama years and they seem as conservative as the 1992 \u201cDifferent Kind of Democrat\u201d years do now?We\u2019ve heard that this election is rewriting old rules. Mostly that refers to the success of nontraditional candidates like Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders. But there\u2019s always the chance that something more fundamental is afoot. Perhaps the reality of the new American economy is becoming too exhausting.Advertisement"}

And the coin of the 2016 Republican presidential race has been anger and fear.It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Gov. John R. Kasich remains a pauper in the Republican campaign. Alone among major contenders, the second-term Ohio governor doesn\u2019t employ applause lines about the evils of Mr. Obama or apocalyptic portraits of American decline. He laughed in an interview at the language employed by his rivals.\u201cI don\u2019t think people want to live in the dark,\u201d Mr. Kasich said. \u201cIf that\u2019s where the market is, then they\u2019re probably not buying me. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where the market is.\u201dNow, with the least campaign cash of any contender, he is hoping to survive the 11-state set of Super Tuesday primaries next week and keep his candidacy alive until he can reach neighboring Michigan on March 8 and his home state\u2019s winner-take-all primary on March 15.All the while, he\u2019ll face pressure to abandon the race from mainstream party leaders who loathe Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz and believe Mr. Rubio is their best bet.It\u2019s not Mr. Kasich\u2019s policies that distinguish him from the field. He\u2019s an anti-abortion social conservative who signed a law this week in Ohio barring state contracts with Planned Parenthood.Like his rivals, he has proposed deep tax cuts to stimulate the economy. His plan to lower the current top rate of 39.6 percent to 28 percent, the same figure President Ronald Reagan signed into law in 1986, matches a proposal advanced by the onetime front-runner Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida.That matters less in 2016. For all the numbers Mr. Kasich reels off about adding jobs and turning Ohio\u2019s deficit into a surplus, governing experience represents a liability for the many Republican voters who blame politicians for their uncertain economic future.Mr. Kasich\u2019s more potent distinction, his strategists believe, is his optimism. Where rivals paint scathing black-and-white contrasts with Mr. Obama, Mr. Kasich speaks in practical terms about how presidents must compromise.His tempered portrait more closely matches the reality of a country in which unemployment and budget deficits have sharply declined, even though middle-class incomes remain stagnant. Instead of foreboding, he conveys empathy.Mr. Kasich defends his decision to expand Medicaid under Mr. Obama\u2019s health law, apostasy to Republican rivals, as a hand up to the drug-addicted and mentally ill that saves money. He hugs troubled voters and, at times, sheds a tear with them.\u201cI think my candidacy represents hope to people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have solutions to these problems, and if we dwell on the negatives and not on the positives, how are we going to get out of this? How are we going to change things?\u201dThe slender hope for Mr. Kasich\u2019s candidacy rests on his ability to rapidly leverage that brand into a much larger share of the Republican audience. All available signs cast doubt. One month into the contest, Mr. Kasich has the market for optimism all to himself.Advertisement"}

The national carrier, Iran Air, signed a deal to buy more than 100 planes from Airbus. The Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization, one of the largest state entities, started a $2 billion joint venture with an Italian steel producer, Danieli. PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn of France will invest $439 million in carmaker Iran Khodro.But when smaller private businesses reach out to their foreign counterparts the response they get is still: how will you pay? Nuclear sanctions might be lifted but almost all international banks continue to shy away from the Iranian market because of unilateral American regulations that label Iran as a state sponsor of terror.\u201cWe are not getting any credit, inside or outside of the country, we can\u2019t make transfers and the government has other priorities,\u201d Mr. Esghi said. Next week Mr. Esghi, the public face of the largest private business ownership organization in the country, will be shutting down his own business, a bus factory, and sending his remaining 14 employees home. The reason, he said, is that there is no work and no prospect of any, even after the lifting of sanctions.\u201cI\u2019ll be the unemployed secretary general of the Tehran Chamber of Commerce,\u201d he said. \u201cIronic, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThe lifting of the sanctions, Mr. Esghi said, will have some positive effects for those in the private sector who manage to get their hands on some of the money coming in. \u201cBut mainly, it seems, the government is getting fatter and fatter,\u201d he said.President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday repeated the government\u2019s aim of achieving 8 percent growth this year, not an unreasonable goal given the influx of frozen assets and the enormous investment needed for Iran to modernize facilities grown decrepit after years of sanctions. But to achieve such growth levels, experts here say, particularly in an era of low oil prices, would require an easing of financial strictures that Iran\u2019s conservative leaders show no signs of tolerating.Some analysts say the state-backed conglomerates are the only entities able to handle the $50 billion or so in annual investment that the country needs.\u201cOur bigger companies are our top priority,\u201d said Amin Amanzadeh, a financial reporter for several Iranian newspapers. \u201cThey are the only ones who can handle foreign investment. Also, if they improve the whole economy will.\u201dBut critics of the quasi-socialist conglomerate system dismiss such claims, saying it is notoriously corrupt and inefficient. More likely, they say, the conservative leadership\u2019s overriding aim is to keep Western influence in the economy and society to a minimum.Iran\u2019s hard-line factions do not dispute the point. \u201cInvestments through our big enterprises can be controlled,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, an analyst who is close to Iran\u2019s leaders. Really opening up the country, in the way some emerging-market countries have, is out of the question, he said.\u201cThat would provide leverage to Western governments and investors, leverage they would use to influence our politics, culture and society.\u201dIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been emphasizing that point ever since the nuclear deal was signed in July. Most analysts say it will be a long time, if ever, before Iran relaxes controls even to the level of China when it began reforms in the 1970s.Already the influx of foreigners that comes with the foreign investments just agreed to will be an issue for the hard-liners who say they protect Iran\u2019s ideology, Mr. Esghi said. There are currently fewer than 1,000 Westerners living in Tehran, a city of 12 million. \u201cImagine a hundred thousand living here,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the stomach for that.\u201dFor President Hassan Rouhani, who ran on the promise of lifting sanctions and ending Iran\u2019s isolation, the continuing restrictions could pose political problems. Although sanctions were lifted only two weeks ago, Iranians are already complaining about the glacial pace of change.\u201cSure there is money coming in,\u201d said Reza Alaverdi, a porter at Tehran\u2019s grand bazaar as he was pushing a cart laden with locally produced shirts through the narrow alleyways. \u201cIt\u2019s just not coming to me.\u201dOne of the few indicators of change visible to all, Iran\u2019s national currency, the rial, has not moved since the lifting of the sanctions. \u201cThe government wants to keep the price of the dollar high, now that they have access to dollars,\u201d said one money changer who refused to give his name.The housing market has stalled, as have land prices, a reflection some say of the crash in the oil market. \u201cAs long as oil prices are low not much will change,\u201d said Ismael Tabrizi, a watch seller.Those in the private sector have few hopes of fast improvement, said one entrepreneur, frustrated that international partners are not providing credit and banks refuse to make transfers.The problem he says, is that while the state-backed conglomerates cinch deals with the help of special guarantees, the government is doing nothing to help smaller businesses and entrepreneurs secure credit.\u201cI just went to a conference in Dubai,\u201d said Kaveh Sheikholeslami, an importer of neurosurgery equipment. All the Western manufacturers wanted to sit down with him, he said. But he could not close any deals.\u201cI wanted to buy a $30,000 product, but they asked me, \u2018Can you transfer to our bank account?\u2019 I had to say no, finished my coffee and moved on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instead of Democracy, Uganda Moves Toward Dictatorship Light", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisKALUNGU, Uganda \u2014 For eight hours, under a beating sun, thousands of people stood in an open field, waiting patiently.The crowd cheered wildly.The days of overt one-party states in Africa are over, analysts say, but the earlier pressure for genuine multiparty democracy seems to be fading.Leaders across the continent who have been in office for many years feel the need to hold elections and even to go through the motions of campaigning, but the outcome is rarely in question. Many of Africa\u2019s recent elections were actually less fair than the ones of just a few years ago.Of course, this has happened in Egypt, Iraq and Russia, among other places. But in sub-Saharan Africa, the strongmen have a very specific need to appear democratically elected. This region is more dependent on foreign aid than any other, and Western donors like democracy, although there is a continuing debate about whether the donors care about it as much as they used to. Cooperation on counterterrorism and competition with China are other strategic issues the donors are now balancing.Uganda is gearing up for elections on Thursday, and the country, a reliable Western ally and the recipient each year of $750 million in American aid, is much harder to read than the others. Analysts call Uganda \u201cdictatorship light.\u201d Mr. Museveni, a university-educated rebel who seized power in 1986, is still genuinely popular but at the same time repressive, acting as if his perch were shaky. Foreign journalists have recently been arrested. Opposition politicians are routinely harassed.At the same time, Uganda feels much freer than, say, Ethiopia or Rwanda, two countries with impressive development whose opposition has been effectively neutralized. Ugandans love talking about politics, and many openly criticize their leader, which would be a very dangerous no-no in Rwanda or Ethiopia.Mr. Museveni is known as a deft manager, and this campaign season one of his new tactics, a group the government calls the Crime Preventers, is a perfect example of how he constantly keeps people guessing. Are the Crime Preventers simply volunteer citizens organized by the government to battle petty crime and safeguard the exercise of democracy? Or is their true purpose to crush any election-related protests?\u201cThis is what none of us can ever understand,\u201d said one Western diplomat with years of Uganda experience, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cMuseveni steals when he doesn\u2019t need to.\u201dUganda\u2019s economy has been steadily growing. Crime in the capital is relatively low. New schools, new roads, new malls and new bridges are popping up everywhere. Bulldozers are common sights, along with the ubiquitous Chinese foreman taking a drag on his cigarette, squinting under the sun at Ugandan laborers digging a ditch or performing some other rudimentary road-building task.These are the everyday things Mr. Museveni highlighted at the recent campaign rally in Kalungu, a bushy hamlet near Lake Victoria.\u201cIt\u2019s good that your district is small enough and you have a grader already,\u201d Mr. Museveni told the crowd. \u201cWe shall add you another one from Japan. We shall also give you an excavator, a road compactor, a bowser and two tippers,\u201d referring to big trucks used to work on roads.Some analysts say the electorate is becoming lethargic, with opposition sympathizers tired of trying to defeat Mr. Museveni and concluding that elections here are mostly a sham, to bestow legitimacy. This fatigue seems to be what seeped into Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, where the most recent elections were less competitive than the ones that came before.Then there are the Crime Preventers, more than 100,000 citizens who have been deputized to control crowds, arrest suspects, guard ballot boxes and gather intelligence. Their political bent is no secret.Zereth Adio, a Crime Preventers zone coordinator, said her group was preparing for trouble from \u201cthose opposition guys.\u201dWhen asked which candidate most Crime Preventers supported, she said, \u201cthe Old Man\u201d \u2014 the name many Ugandans use for Mr. Museveni. All four other Crime Preventers present said they would vote for the Old Man.\u201cThis is what I worry about,\u201d said Professor Kabumba, who spoke from behind his desk in a dimly lit office in central Kampala. \u201cJust beneath the facade of democracy is a real military government. The chance of a peaceful transition of power is slim to zero.\u201dBut then he laughed.\u201cYou see people walking around freely,\u201d he said. \u201cI can sit here and say these things. That\u2019s the genius of it all. It\u2019s like that movie \u2014 what\u2019s it called? \u2014 \u2018The Truman Show.\u2019 At what point will people know this is like a TV show, that it\u2019s all being managed?\u201dAt the end of the campaign rally in Kalungu, Mr. Museveni\u2019s convoy left as quickly as it had materialized, zooming away in a cloud of noise and dust.\u201cI think the Old Man should be in power until he dies,\u201d said Paul Ssebbowa, a farmer, as he began his long walk home.His parting words: \u201cThere\u2019s no one else.\u201dJosh Kron contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are We Doomed to Slow Growth?", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byOn MoneyOne day in 1980, when I was 10, I sat in my great-grandmother\u2019s living room and poured out questions about what life was like for her as a girl in Belarus. At 90, she was still sharp and could answer my questions. But she didn\u2019t betray any of the emotion I hoped for. Born in 1890, in a tiny village powered by horses and the sun in a manner hardly changed from the time of ancient Rome, she grew up to witness the invention of the airplane and the adoption of electricity and the telephone. I wanted her to join me in marveling at this series of world-changing transformations, which I knew were beyond anything her girlhood self could have imagined. She just answered my questions calmly, politely. \u2018\u2018No, I don\u2019t remember the first airplane I saw.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018No, I don\u2019t remember the first person I called on a telephone.\u2019\u2019A key question in economics today is: Does technological advancement, and the improvement in average people\u2019s material conditions that it creates, continue upward at a steady rate? Or has it already peaked? It\u2019s no small question. If we have learned anything, it is that peace, democratic values and even self-reported happiness are closely connected with economic growth. Economies that are stagnant lead to conflict; if the pie isn\u2019t getting bigger, after all, the only way to improve your lot is to grab someone else\u2019s slice. It\u2019s telling to look at the current presidential campaign through this lens. Bernie Sanders is arguing that this stagnant-pie-stealing has been going on for some time, while Donald Trump says that he can keep outsiders away from our desserts altogether. In a nation whose politics have long been characterized by indefatigable optimism \u2014 in rhetoric if not in reality \u2014 it\u2019s striking that no presidential candidate in 2016 is offering an expansive, optimistic vision of the future.In articulating such a vision, the candidates will find little help in Robert Gordon\u2019s \u2018\u2018The Rise and Fall of American Growth.\u2019\u2019 Published by Princeton University Press last month, the book is this year\u2019s equivalent to Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u2018\u2018Capital in the 21st Century\u2019\u2019: an essential read for all economists, who are unanimously floored by its boldness and scope even if they don\u2019t agree with its conclusions. Through a careful study of the entire history of American technological advancement, Gordon concludes that despite all the upheaval of the past 200 years, there have really been only a handful of fundamental steps forward: electricity, the telephone, the combustion engine, mass production, indoor plumbing, the conquest of infectious diseases and the computer. He argues that everything else, including the Internet and the smartphone, is simply a variation on these themes \u2014 and that for all our 21st-century talk of \u2018\u2018innovation,\u2019\u2019 the pace of real transformative innovation has radically slowed during the past half-century.We can see this, he argues, in the diminishing impact on productivity in the American work force. Productivity growth, at its simplest, means that people can achieve more in a given amount of time than they used to be able to. It\u2019s the only way that human beings, as a group, can become better off. There was an enormous upward shift in productivity between 1920 and 1970, a rate of growth unseen at any other time in human history. But after 1970, that growth slowed. Then there was another, lesser blip upward during the years surrounding 2000, as computers went mainstream and became married to communication, in the form of the Internet. If we exclude that blip, though, the past 50 years have seen roughly half the rate of productivity growth as the 50 that preceded them. Gordon argues that this relatively slow growth in productivity, together with rising inequality, helps explain not just the stagnation in American wages but the general feeling of anger and despair. Worse, he argues that this post-1970 sluggishness is with us to stay, because the remarkable series of inventions of the previous 100 years is unlikely to be repeated.I, too, am more optimistic than Gordon, but for reasons that have little to do with future technological advances. As Gordon acknowledges, there is generally a long gap between a new technology\u2019s invention and its wide impact on productivity. Primitive steam engines began appearing in the 17th century, and the telephone was patented in 1876. Yet we didn\u2019t see that huge spike in productivity until 1920.That\u2019s because productivity, and our lives in general, improve not at the moment of invention but when society creates the conditions to allow new ideas to become integrated into our daily lives. The basic technological conditions for the expansive productivity growth of the 1950s and 1960s existed in 1900 and, arguably, long before that. But society had to do a lot of work first. There had to be new schools (only about 10 percent of Americans attended high school in 1900, and far fewer went to college) so that people had the education to use the new inventions. Unions and the modern corporation matured to help allocate labor. A new political system evolved to fit an economy that operated nationally, not just as far as a mule could walk.It was, of course, a messy, often ugly, nonlinear process. The single hardest task was internal: Americans had to change how they thought about themselves. Not only did some of the iconic jobs of the 20th century not exist in the 19th century; they weren\u2019t conceivable. There weren\u2019t many large corporations, so there was less of a tradition of specialized jobs with narrow tasks. People had to learn to think of national markets, huge firms, accredited professions, new forms of urban identity. While writing this column, I was emailing with a friend, a woman who does brand marketing for a credit-card company. It occurred to me that literally every noun in her job title would have made no sense to her great-grandmother, or to mine.The very evidence Gordon cites for pessimism \u2014 persistent inequality, low productivity growth, lack of major innovations \u2014 can also be read as signs of opportunity. In the last century, the main way a person\u2019s productivity rose was by going to work at a large company and doing what the boss said. Today, lots of people are finding ways to improve their own lot \u2014 and overall productivity \u2014 on their own. They sell crafts on Etsy, get funding on Kickstarter, build toys with 3-D printers. They learn through online classes and prove their skills on sites like Topcoder.Right now, the benefits of this digital, shared, distributed economy are accruing only to a tiny group of people and, even more, to the companies that serve them. But it\u2019s at least conceivable that digital technology could help build new models of education, new ways for workers to collectively bargain, new tools to allow more people to identify and sell their skills and ideas to those who want them. There could be financial products that make it easier to withstand increasing volatility and insecurity. There could be an easier path to entrepreneurship, so more people with good ideas could present them to the market.I called Gordon and described this vision to him. He replied, with a kind chuckle: \u2018\u2018You are in a dream world. Your list of needed improvements in institutions and society are a wish list that isn\u2019t happening now and is very unlikely to happen in the future.\u2019\u2019 And maybe he\u2019s right. The language of the current presidential campaign \u2014 when it\u2019s coherent at all \u2014 is of taxes and regulation, immigration and carpet-bombing. It is the language of zero-sum stagnancy, not expansive, shared growth. But it\u2019s worth being clear: If we are indeed doomed to a generation of slow growth, it\u2019s a lapse in our collective imagination, not in technological innovation, that is holding us back.Adam Davidson is a founder of NPR\u2019s \u2018\u2018Planet Money\u2019\u2019 and a contributing writer for the magazine.Advertisement"}

Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mrs. Clinton has also proposed tax increases on the rich and corporations to pay for her agenda, which she estimates would cost an additional $100 billion a year, or $1.2 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan includes a new, across-the-board 2.2 percent income tax to help pay for his single-payer, government-run health plan for all. But progressive economists and business groups say middle-class taxpayers would pay more for the European-style social welfare state that Mr. Sanders envisions.It is not just Mr. Sanders\u2019s assumptions for health savings that critics contest. Jared Bernstein, the former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, examined a paper by the economist advising Mr. Sanders, Gerald Friedman of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, that is circulating on the left.While calling Mr. Friedman\u2019s work a good effort, Mr. Bernstein cited several assumptions as \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d Among them were minimal health-cost inflation, economic growth reaching 5.3 percent and, in that heated-up economy, no action from the Federal Reserve to apply brakes.\u201cWe need a deep investment in infrastructure, more efficient health care and less student debt,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cBut when you put it all together, government\u2019s role in the economy goes well beyond anything we\u2019ve ever considered.\u201d He said protecting the Affordable Care Act against Republican opposition should be a higher priority \u2014 a critique echoed by Mrs. Clinton.But he called it a \u201cfairy tale\u201d in this political climate. Along with other economists in a \u201clefty chat group\u201d he joins online, Mr. Aaron said, he believes that if Mr. Sanders were elected and fought for a single-payer plan, it \u201cwould rapidly destroy his administration by using up every ounce of political capital he\u2019s got.\u201dOn his campaign website, Mr. Sanders proposes more than $18 trillion in new spending over 10 years; he does not account for some ideas he favors, like universal prekindergarten and child care, that could put the total above $20 trillion. About $14 trillion of the total is for health care; the rest is chiefly for infrastructure, free college, Social Security, paid family leave and clean-energy initiatives.Adding $20 trillion to projected federal spending would mean about a 37 percent increase in spending through the 2026 fiscal year \u2014 close to the 40 percent that Mrs. Clinton suggested. But Kenneth E. Thorpe, a prominent health policy economist at Emory University who advised the Clintons in the 1990s, recently concluded that Mr. Sanders\u2019s health plan would cost $27 trillion, not $14 trillion, which would put total spending for all of his initiatives above $30 trillion through 2026.Mr. Thorpe in recent years helped Gov. Peter Shumlin in Mr. Sanders\u2019s home state of Vermont design a single-payer plan there. It was unsuccessful.\u201cThe problem was that the price tag and the amount of disruption and redistribution was just so enormous,\u201d Mr. Thorpe said of Mr. Shumlin\u2019s efforts, \u201cthat he just had to drop it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And you should be frightened by how little many of the people who would be president have learned from the past eight years.If you\u2019ve been following the financial news, you know that there\u2019s a lot of market turmoil out there. It\u2019s nothing like 2008, at least so far, but it\u2019s worrisome.Once again we have a substantial amount of troubled debt, this time not home mortgages but loans to energy companies, hit hard by plunging oil prices. Meanwhile, formerly trendy emerging economies like Brazil are suddenly doing very badly, and China is stumbling. And while the U.S. economy is doing better than almost anyone else\u2019s, we\u2019re definitely not immune to contagion.It looks, in other words, as if we\u2019re still living in the economic era we entered in 2008 \u2014 an era of persistent weakness, in which deflation and depression, not inflation and deficits, are the key challenges. So how well do we think the various presidential wannabes would deal with those challenges?Well, on the Republican side, the answer is basically, God help us. Economic views on that side of the aisle range from fairly crazy to utterly crazy.On the Democratic side, both contenders talk sensibly about macroeconomic policy, with Mr. Sanders rightly declaring that the recent rate hike was a bad move. But Mr. Sanders has also attacked the Federal Reserve in a way Mrs. Clinton has not \u2014 and that difference illustrates in miniature both the reasons for his appeal and the reasons to be very worried about his approach.Now, the idea of making the Fed accountable sounds good. But Wall Street isn\u2019t the only source of malign pressure on the Fed, and in the actually existing U.S. political situation, such a bill would essentially empower the cranks \u2014 the gold-standard-loving, hyperinflation-is-coming types who dominate the modern G.O.P., and have spent the past five or six years trying to bully monetary policy makers into ceasing and desisting from their efforts to prevent economic disaster. Given the economic risks we face, it\u2019s a very good thing that Mr. Sanders\u2019s support wasn\u2019t enough to push the bill over the top.But even without Mr. Paul\u2019s bill, one shudders to think about how U.S. policy would respond to another downturn if any of the surviving Republican candidates make it to the Oval Office.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Streetcar Service Proposed by Mayor de Blasio May Require 2 New Bridges", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byThe Brooklyn-Queens streetcar proposed by Mayor Bill de Blasio could require the construction of two new bridges, one over Newtown Creek and a second over the Gowanus Canal, a top administration official said on Friday.At a briefing for reporters, the official, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen, and other administration leaders made public new details about the streetcar proposal, with the potential need for the two bridges among the most notable and expensive elements of the planned system, which would run between Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Astoria, Queens.While the exact route has not been finalized, Ms. Glen said, planners have determined that the Pulaski Bridge, between Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and Long Island City, Queens, and the bridge that traverses the Gowanus Canal at Hamilton Avenue near Red Hook, Brooklyn, may not be able to accommodate streetcars.The new bridges, which would be covered under the project\u2019s estimated $2.5 billion cost, could also include paths for bicyclists and pedestrians, Ms. Glen said.In the two weeks since Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, announced the proposal, some experts have raised concerns about problems with streetcars in other cities and have questioned whether other parts of New York City have more pressing transit needs.Mr. de Blasio, at a news conference on Tuesday during which he championed the proposal, said the streetcar would connect a string of booming neighborhoods where rising real estate tax revenue would provide a compelling opportunity to finance the system.Ms. Glen said that in a so-called fatal-flaw analysis, city officials had found that there would be major challenges to building the system but that it was feasible.The city will start meeting with local residents in the affected neighborhoods soon to get feedback on the route, officials said. One major challenge will be deciding how much underground infrastructure, like utilities and sewer lines, must be moved.Polly Trottenberg, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner, said at the briefing that the project would most likely require the removal of hundreds of street parking spaces \u2014 an idea that could face resistance from residents. Earlier in the week, Mr. de Blasio said that some parking would be lost but that officials would seek to minimize the impact.\u201cI think given the many, many benefits of the project, it will more than be appropriate in terms of any trade-off with parking,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.Building two new bridges would make the city\u2019s timeline for completing the project \u2014 officials have pushed for a 2024 opening \u2014 even more difficult to achieve, said Jon Orcutt, a critic of the plan and a spokesman for TransitCenter, a transportation nonprofit.\u201cThe biggest concern is these kinds of transit projects haven\u2019t performed well and have been difficult to implement,\u201d Mr. Orcutt said of streetcar plans across the country. \u201cThis one is much bigger than what we\u2019ve seen elsewhere.\u201dThe New York proposal would dwarf other recent streetcar systems in the United States. The city envisions 30 stops over a 16-mile route and 60 streetcar vehicles. A new streetcar in Washington, which is scheduled to open next weekend after years of delays, is a 2.4-mile route with five vehicles, though the city wants to expand.Another issue in New York is whether riders would be able to use MetroCards on the streetcar and transfer to buses or subways for free. The city said it would work with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state-controlled agency that runs subway and bus lines, to reach an agreement to allow for transfers.A spokesman for the authority, Adam Lisberg, said in a statement that the agency was looking forward to learning more about the city\u2019s proposal.In many ways, the city\u2019s plan parallels a study commissioned by a nonprofit called Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector that examines how a waterfront streetcar could work and the effect it might have on the local economy. The 184-page study provides a detailed look at the possible costs attached to such a system, including $427 million for utility relocation and $260 million for 52 streetcar vehicles.The study recommends two facilities for maintenance and storage, at a cost of $100 million. The system would need at least 140 employees to operate the streetcars and a host of other workers, including traffic enforcement agents, according to the study.Among the local leaders involved with the nonprofit are Helena Durst, of the Durst Organization, and Jed Walentas, of Two Trees Management, along with others from business and transportation groups, including Transportation Alternatives and the Regional Plan Association.Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who worked on the study, said that he expected more criticism of the proposal and that he was prepared to win over New Yorkers.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a great project built that doesn\u2019t have people complaining,\u201d he said, \u201cand when it comes to a parking spot, a lot of people believe that was guaranteed in the Constitution.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "De Blasio Announces New Safety Measures After Fatal Crane Collapse", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byThe change, which was to take effect on Monday, was one of several new policies Mr. de Blasio announced on Sunday as investigators worked to determine what caused the fatal collapse and officials faced questions about the city\u2019s protocol for ensuring crane safety.The new rules would require crawler cranes to stop operating and go into safety mode under two scenarios: when there is a forecast for steady wind speeds of 20 miles per hour or higher or gusts of at least 30 m.p.h., and when actual readings reach those levels. Previously, such cranes could operate until measured wind speeds reached 30 m.p.h. or gusts increased to 40 m.p.h., though individual manufacturers sometimes set stricter standards.\u201cIf at the end of one workday there is a forecast for these kinds of wind levels the next workday, we will require that the crane be put into secure mode the day before,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. The fine for failing to take appropriate precautions would be increased to $10,000 from $4,800, he said.The operator of the crane that toppled onto Worth Street in TriBeCa during the morning rush on Friday was working under a 25 m.p.h. limit for securing it, and city officials said workers had begun to lower it as winds neared 20 m.p.h. Mr. de Blasio said forecasts had not indicated that winds would climb above 25 m.p.h. on Friday.City officials said a preliminary analysis based on recorded wind speeds in Central Park showed that the new standards would have put crawler cranes out of operation on 40 days in 2015. The previous rule shut them down for only seven days.Officials said the new rules were temporary and would be in place until a task force, to be convened by the mayor, recommended long-term restrictions within 90 days.In the wake of the accident on Friday, the city ordered that 376 currently operating crawler cranes, as well as 43 larger tower cranes, be secured. A National Weather Service forecast predicted wind speeds of 11 to 16 m.p.h. on Monday.As a further safety measure, uniformed personnel, including police officers, will now help enforce sidewalk and street closings related to crane use, a task previously left to construction crews, with city oversight.The new policies also call for operators to notify nearby residents and businesses before a crane is moved, as opposed to only when a crane is first installed.Mr. de Blasio said officials were still evaluating what role wind conditions, human error or structural or equipment problems might have played in the collapse, which sent the crane\u2019s 565-foot boom crashing across roughly two full city blocks.The crew, in trying to secure the crane and redirect pedestrians away from the area, \u201cwas doing exactly what they were supposed to do at that time,\u201d he said.Three people injured in the collapse have been released from the hospital, Mr. de Blasio said. The crane itself was cut up and removed from the street by Sunday afternoon; some of the surrounding blocks remained closed as workers continued to repair water main leaks.\u201cWe all know there is a construction boom going on in our city,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cAlthough we value the work that\u2019s being done, we value what it means for our economy, we value the jobs that are being created \u2014 nothing is more important than the safety of our people.\u201dConstruction executives interviewed on Sunday said that while they were not familiar with details of the new rules, they did not oppose them.Ross Spivak, president of RES Consulting NYC, which plans to use crawler cranes on a coming project in Manhattan, said while the new regulations could not eliminate all potential dangers, he supported stricter enforcement. \u201cI have no issue with the fines,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart to take risks.\u201dSandra E.

So we have a lot of data, but it\u2019s kind of messy.Some economic data like income and unemployment is indeed sensitive in China. But the authorities will have no choice but to release them, or else they will be creating a situation where a blind man is trying to feel an elephant. Christopher Balding, associate professor at Peking University HSBC Business SchoolMany parts of Chinese data are riddles inside enigmas, so I\u2019ve learned to never take anything as final.Chinese data even among specialists are hazy and require time just sorting through the definitions and changes.I don\u2019t think anyone has any real illusions that the economy is growing at 7 percent. Only a couple of people would write that with a straight face anymore. I think the party is becoming a lot more sensitive to that.The People\u2019s Bank of China has to learn how to interact with the markets rather than just repeating \u201ceverything is fine,\u201d because people are watching a lot closer than they used to.China used to publish widespread aggregate employment levels throughout secondary industry [the manufacture of finished products]. In 2013, they stopped publishing the aggregate number of employed persons in these industries. They just started releasing a couple of aggregate employment levels for small numbers of subsectors. It\u2019s very limited, but it\u2019s a start.They haven\u2019t published wage data since the end of 2014.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.Yuan Gangming, researcher at the Center for China in the World Economy, Tsinghua UniversityThe National Bureau of Statistics is not as unreliable as it used to be. I\u2019ve been following Chinese economic data for quite some time. In the past, the forgery of data was common. In 1998, during the Asia financial crisis, some data like industrial output and electricity were not made available to the public.Over all, the National Bureau of Statistics is a lot more reliable than some local statistics bureaus.Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital ResearchSenior officials require that the various institutions that collect the data be in on the original sources and ask those sources to change the data when needed.There\u2019s a small group at the National Bureau of Statistics that takes in the provincial numbers for gross domestic product, and when these conflict with national numbers, they make a judgment call.Data disappears when it becomes negative. That\u2019s happened in a lot of series. The Ministry of Commerce has a series on retail enterprises and retail sales of various products. Those series stop when the numbers get bad.I\u2019ve been trying to deal with household income data. That\u2019s frustrating. They report that in different ways all the time, so the numbers aren\u2019t comparable.The most egregious faking is in services and job creation.For steel numbers, they report the steel output of a select number of mills. They randomly add different companies to the sample that had never been there before. We found that happening in 2014. They added all these phantom companies that nobody had heard of before. The companies report a raw number of tons of steel produced. There were 85 companies. Then suddenly there were 95 companies. They don\u2019t tell you about this change upfront. They\u2019ll only tell you if you ask them.On retail data, they change the companies that are the key enterprises. They don\u2019t consistently define key enterprises. Usually you can find the definitions on the National Bureau of Statistics website. But those change. This year, a key enterprise might be defined as over 25 million renminbi per year in revenue.On housing price data, the localities change different districts of their cities for the basis of comparison. If they think their prices are too high, they\u2019ll choose a district of the city that has a high average price. Then they\u2019ll use that as the basis of comparison. If you want low year-on-year growth, you need a high basis of comparison. If you want growth to look high, take down the basis of comparison.Trucking is a very fragmented world in China. There are a zillion tiny companies that only weigh one truck or two trucks. There are some stations that weigh trucks. But it\u2019s hard for me to believe that anyone reports accurate numbers on these trucks.Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital EconomicsUnfortunately, it looks increasingly likely that the government will continue to announce G.D.P. growth targets. That will include a target of average growth over the five-year period. The government appears to view targets as essential for policy making. It is unlikely that the National Bureau of Statistics would publish numbers lower than the target number.China has set G.D.P. growth targets for a long time. For most of the past 20 years, it really didn\u2019t matter that much because the economy was growing much faster than the targets. It has only really become a problem as growth has slowed.There\u2019s also much more scrutiny on policy makers for their economic policy making. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that the world felt the Chinese government could do no wrong when it came to managing their economy. But there\u2019s a lot more skepticism now both in China and abroad.We used to have debates with clients on whether growth was as slow as what our proxy measures suggested. In the past year or so, I haven\u2019t had anyone dispute that growth is significantly lower than official figures. Most investors take it as a given that the official figures are overstating China\u2019s growth.The debate is over the quality of the information. It\u2019s not hard to find individual data series that will back any given argument. You have to look at a broad span of data.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Fred Hu, founding partner of Primavera Capital GroupThey have over time really made efforts to improve the quality and reliability of economic data, but it\u2019s obviously still a work in progress. I would say economic data, with a few exceptions, are released to the public on a regular basis.My country still doesn\u2019t permit freedom of speech and freedom of information. Most public discussions are severely restricted or penalized. Again, in the economic arena, it has been a notable exception.In social sciences, economists tend to have the biggest degree of freedom in discussing economic issues or policy issues, and economists can be highly critical of government policies without undue personal consequences.Owen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

Oh, and it seems that tolerance is also in short supply.So the government will appoint a minister of tolerance, too.The sheikhs who rule the United Arab Emirates have announced the most sweeping government reorganization in their country\u2019s 44-year history, which included the creation of the two new ministers.The announcement was made with all the trappings of a royal decree by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and the country\u2019s prime minister \u2014 on Twitter.It is not exactly clear how the new ministers or the cabinet will pursue their new mandates.The rulers of the United Arab Emirates like to do things in their own way.\u201cThe government feels that we have provided basic services so far, education and health, so now we should strive for higher goals,\u201d said Abdulkhaliq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist.Government departments around the globe with grand aspirations.Not everyone is convinced.\u201cThe Ministry of Happiness sounds sort of Orwellian and sinister given that this is a surveillance state, but it is in line with their quite high self-regard,\u201d said Nicholas McGeehan, a researcher at Human Rights Watch.The government remains dominated by unelected royals, and those who criticize them or engage in political activity risk arrest, prosecution and imprisonment.\u201cYou can be happy as long as you keep your mouth shut,\u201d Mr. McGeehan said. \u201cThat is the sort of social contract that is in place there.\u201dThe country\u2019s active economy and open immigration rules have made it a magnet for international talent, and large numbers of skilled professionals from Syria, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon have sought to pursue their fortunes, and their happiness, in the emirates as conditions in their own countries have deteriorated.But the majority of the foreigners in the United Arab Emirates are low-paid Asian laborers, and it remained unclear how interested the state was in increasing their happiness.Internationally, the country is already pretty happy.Israel, at No. 11, was the happiest country in the Middle East, but the United Arab Emirates still beat all other Arab countries. Egypt, with widespread poverty and a growing jihadist insurgency, was ranked No. 135; Syria, torn apart by civil war, was No. 156, third from the bottom.It was unclear who would be named to fill the new Emirati ministries. But some Emiratis immediately took to social media to pitch themselves for the jobs.One Twitter user, Maya AlHawary, replied to Sheikh Mohammed that the new minister of happiness must work hard, with patience and tolerance, qualities she promised to provide.Advertisement"}

But in the end, Ms. Legaretta and Mr. Araiza agreed, Mexicans should not worry about the tumbling peso unless they hanker for expensive imports.But her breathless introduction to economics did nothing to soothe Mexican consumers\u2019 worries: The peso has fallen more than 30 percent against the dollar over the past year, with an especially sharp drop this week.In Mexico, where currency collapses have led to triple-digit inflation and deep recessions, the peso\u2019s tumble creates rising anxiety.\u201cFor many generations in Mexico, a weaker peso has generally been associated with a crisis,\u201d said Alonso Cervera, the managing director for Latin America economics at Credit Suisse. \u201cNot everyone understands that the causes are external.\u201dOne of those causes is the fall in oil prices, which saps market confidence in oil exporters like Mexico. The government here relies on oil revenues to finance part of the budget, and the price drop has already forced budget cuts. Last week the president of the central bank, Agust\u00edn Carstens, insisted that more cutbacks were needed to avoid \u201ca much longer and more painful adjustment process.\u201dStill, analysts say the economy is better protected than in the past. Public debt is manageable and the central bank sits on healthy foreign reserves. Unlike many of the emerging market economies that have also watched their currencies struggle against the dollar, Mexico\u2019s economy grew a modest 2.5 percent last year, and is expected to grow again this year.\u201cThere are many forces at play and it is very difficult to disentangle them,\u201d said Gabriel Lozano, the chief Mexico economist for J.P. Morgan, who argues that the Mexican economy shows many signs of strength. \u201cYou have a lot of buffers.\u201dBut public jitters can cause consumers to delay purchases and investments, putting brakes on the economy. To stave that off, officials have struggled to find the right language to project calm.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that we\u2019re experiencing a moment of great uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets,\u201d Mexico\u2019s finance secretary, Luis Videgaray, said in a recent radio interview. \u201cIn the face of that, governments have to act like the Mexican government has been doing, with full responsibility, with early measures to protect economic stability and that way protect the most important thing \u2014 which is to protect the economy of Mexican families.\u201dThe greatest worry is that a weaker peso will generate inflation as higher import prices are passed on to consumers. That means wherever one looks here, the effect of higher-priced American products is creeping in.\u201cThe price of apples went up from one day to the next,\u201d said Moi Gregorio, 33, the manager of a juice stand in Mexico City who blends apples from Washington State with other fruits grown in Mexico into his fresh juices. \u201cIf the price of the dollar stays like this, I won\u2019t have any choice but to raise the price.\u201dFor now, merchants are swallowing the cost increases. \u201cThe price of chicken has been going up every day since September,\u201d said Edgar Hern\u00e1ndez, 35, manager at a market counter that sells fresh poultry.Perhaps the Mexican-raised chickens eat imported animal feed, he speculated. Whatever the reason, \u201cI can\u2019t raise my price to the customer.\u201dThe price of cotton imported from the United States is a problem for LeRoy Laboratories, a national company that makes bandages and other medical supplies, said Armando Lezama Laguerenne, 48, who works in sales and training for the company.Rather than pass on the full price increase to consumers, the company is trying to reduce costs and raise productivity, even if that means cutting some jobs, he said.For now, Mexico\u2019s inflation rate is stable, well below the central bank\u2019s 3 percent target.And a cheaper currency is a blessing to some parts of the economy, like tourism. Other services are prospering, too.\u201cI have been drawing up budgets for foreigners nonstop\u201d since the fall, said Carlos Llergo, a producer for Arre Lul\u00fa, which provides production services for companies that shoot advertisements in Mexico.\u201cEven when the peso wasn\u2019t so cheap, they came for the locations or the well-qualified technicians,\u201d Mr. Llergo said. \u201cNow that it\u2019s cheaper and they make more money, they are in heaven.\u201dAvelino Rodr\u00edguez, managing partner for The Lift, another production services company, said that the cost of shooting a Corona beer ad recently was 10 percent under budget because of the peso\u2019s fall.But a cheap peso on its own is not enough to assure business, he said. Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil are all competitors \u2014 and their currencies have fallen, too.One of Mexico\u2019s most successful industries faces a similar challenge.\u201cYes, we are more competitive, but so are all the emerging markets that make auto parts,\u201d said Oscar Albin, the executive president of the National Autoparts Industry.Mexican factories sold some $85 billion in parts last year. \u201cIf we all have the same advantage, then it stops being an advantage,\u201d he said.On top of that, many components, like steel, plastic and fabric for seats, are priced in dollars.It is not just pricing that has given Mexico an edge, Mr. Albin said, \u201cIt\u2019s the productivity that makes us competitive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The line at the table kept moving as Mr. Sanders and Benjamin T. Jealous, a former N.A.A.C.P. president, spoke. The Brookland Baptist congregation proved to be a tough crowd.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have in America today a broken criminal justice system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said, pausing briefly after this line from his stump speech, which is usually met with applause. Here it garnered very little.His visit underscored Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficulty in strengthening his support among black voters in South Carolina, who make up more than half of registered Democrats heading into the state primary this Saturday. While some applauded politely as he offered now-familiar lines about racial discrimination, the loudest claps came when he talked about President Obama.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should not be having more people in jail, largely African-American and Latino, than any other country on earth.

{"Headline": "Obama Is Pressed to Open Military Front Against ISIS in Libya", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byBut Mr. Obama, wary of embarking on an intervention in another Muslim country, has told his aides to redouble their efforts to help form a unity government in Libya at the same time the Pentagon refines its options.Those include airstrikes, commando raids or advising vetted Libyan militias on the ground, as Special Operations forces are doing now in eastern Syria.\u00a0Covert C.I.A. paramilitary missions are also being considered, but the\u00a0use of large numbers of American ground troops is not on the table.\u00a0Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among others, say some kind of American and allied military force will be needed. But\u00a0Mr. Obama has not yet made a decision, nor have the size or contours of any possible American military involvement been determined.\u00a0\u201cThe White House just has to decide,\u201d said one senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. \u201cThe case has been laid out by virtually every department.\u201d\u00a0The push for military action comes in response to growing concern over the Islamic State\u2019s presence in Libya.82 people have been accused by American officials of trying to help the Islamic State. How serious is the threat?The number of Islamic State fighters in the country, Pentagon officials said this week, has grown to between 5,000 and 6,500 \u2014 more than double the estimate government analysts disclosed last fall. Rather than travel to Iraq or Syria, many new Islamic State recruits from across North Africa have remained in Libya, in militant strongholds along more than 150 miles of Mediterranean coastline near Surt, these officials said. The top leadership of the Islamic State in Syria has sent half a dozen top lieutenants to help organize what Western officials consider the most dangerous of the group\u2019s eight global affiliates. In recent months, United States and British Special Operations teams have increased clandestine reconnaissance missions in Libya to identify the militant leaders and map out their networks for possible strikes. Military planners are still awaiting orders on whether American involvement would include striking senior leaders, attacking a broader set of targets, or deploying teams of commandos to work with Libyan fighters who promise to support a new Libyan government. Any military action would be coordinated with European allies, officials said.But commanders say they are dealing with a patchwork of Libyan militias that remain unreliable, unaccountable, poorly organized and divided by region and tribe.\u201cHow long will the United States and the Europeans wait until they say, we have to work with whatever militias we can on the ground?\u201d said Frederic Wehrey, a Libya specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who frequently visits the country.In a meeting of his National Security Council last Thursday to discuss escalating the fight against the Islamic State, Mr. Obama asked his advisers to prepare whatever military measures were necessary to combat the militants in Libya while not undercutting the international effort to help form a national unity government.For the president, the challenge is to avoid embarking on yet another major counterterrorism campaign in his last year in office while also moving decisively to prevent the rise of a new arm of the Islamic State that if left unchecked analysts say could attack the West, including Americans or American interests.Mr. Carter summed up the balancing act between nurturing the fragile and fitful political process and gearing up for what would most likely be a Special Operations war this way last week: \u201cWe\u2019re looking to help them get control over their own country.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be on a glide slope to a situation like Syria and Iraq. That\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re watching it that closely. That\u2019s the reason why we develop options for what we might do in the future.\u201dA dozen American and European military, intelligence and counterterrorism officials said in interviews that they had little doubt that the Islamic State in Libya posed a serious threat.\u201cYou could see a very large holding, an area that is effectively governed by ISIS in Libya, and Libya\u2019s proximity to serve as a gateway into southern Europe,\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said this week in calling for military strikes against Islamic State leaders.\u201cThe last thing in the world you want is a false caliphate with access to billions of dollars of oil revenue,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.There is no functioning government now in Libya, where a NATO bombing campaign helped overthrow Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi nearly five years ago. Warring factions are far more focused on fighting one another than on battling the Islamic State, and Libya\u2019s neighbors are all too weak or unstable to lead or even host a military intervention.Forming a unity government could lay the groundwork for the West to provide badly needed security assistance to the new Libyan leadership.Options under discussion include sending Italian and other European troops to Libya to establish a local stabilization force and reviving a Pentagon plan to train Libyan counterterrorism troops.More than a dozen countries have had attacks since the Islamic State, or ISIS, began to pursue a global strategy in the summer of 2014.But lawmakers in Libya\u2019s internationally recognized Parliament last week overwhelmingly rejected a proposed United Nations-backed unity cabinet, dealing a blow to diplomatic efforts to swiftly reconcile the country\u2019s splintered factions.Senior administration officials say the parallel tracks of supporting the political process in Libya while fighting the Islamic State are \u201cmutually reinforcing.\u201d But at some point, current and former administration officials said, the United States may have to act unilaterally or with allies if faced with a credible threat from the Libyan franchise.\u201cWeighing our actions based on how it impacts the Libyan political environment is an almost impossible juggling act,\u201d said Juan Carlos Zarate, a former top counterterrorism official under President George W. Bush. \u201cWe may not have a choice if ISIS continues to control greater swaths of territory and assemble more terrorists.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re looking to take decisive military action against ISIL in conjunction with the political process\u201d in Libya, he said. \u201cThe president has made clear that we have the authority to use military force.\u201dIndeed, the United States killed a senior Iraqi leader of the Islamic State \u2014 Wissam Najm Abd Zayd al Zubaydi, also known as Abu Nabil, who was also believed to be the group\u2019s top commander in Libya \u2014 in an airstrike in November near the eastern Libyan city of Darnah.\u201cThey\u2019re welcoming foreign fighters to flock there, the way, in years past, they did in Syria and Iraq,\u201d Mr. Carter said of the Islamic State in Libya last week. \u201cAnd they\u2019re trying to take over the reins of the economy and tax it the way you see ISIL doing \u2014 you see the same kind of ambitions on their part that you see realized in full flower in Syria and Iraq.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "HSBC Posts 4th-Quarter Loss and Comes Under S.E.C. Scrutiny", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byThe lender, which is based in Britain but generates more than half its earnings in Asia, also forecast that slowing economic growth in China would contribute to a \u201cbumpier financial environment.\u201dFor the three months that ended Dec. 31, HSBC, Britain\u2019s largest by assets, posted a loss of $1.33 billion, compared with a profit of $511 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Before taxes, HSBC posted a loss of $858 million in the final quarter of last year.In addition to reporting its earnings, HSBC said that it and \u201cmultiple financial institutions\u201d were facing an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator, HSBC said, was looking into the hiring of candidates who were referred by, or related to, government officials or employees of state-owned enterprises in Asia.\u201cHSBC has received various requests for information and is cooperating with the S.E.C.\u2019s investigation,\u201d the lender said.For all of last year, HSBC reported a pretax profit of $18.9 billion, compared with $18.7 billion in 2014.But the lender\u2019s quarterly results were weighed down by restructuring costs and provisions for legal and regulatory matters, including a $370 million charge for potential settlements and $337 million to compensate customers who were improperly sold products in Britain. The quarter also included loan-impairment charges and provisions for credit risk of $1.64 billion and a reduction in the fair market value of its debt.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks\u2019 bottom lines.In Asia, the bank\u2019s pretax profit of $2.82 billion in the fourth quarter was lower than some analysts had expected.In a research note, the Citigroup analysts Ronit Ghose and Andrew Coombs said they had expected a pretax profit of $3.5 billion from HSBC\u2019s Asian business in the fourth quarter, but the bank had lower revenue than Citigroup had forecast and \u201cslightly higher\u201d provisions on loan losses.Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said in a news release that \u201cChina\u2019s slower economic growth will undoubtedly contribute to a bumpier financial environment, but it is still expected to be the largest contributor to global growth as its economy transitions to higher added value manufacturing and services and becomes more consumer driven.\u201dShares of HSBC declined as much as 5 percent in early trading in London on Monday and were still down 3.75 percent in midafternoon trading. They fell about 2 percent in Hong Kong.The bank said on Monday that it had decided to retain and restructure its business in Turkey, which would have accounted for some of the job cuts. HSBC said that it had received several offers since putting the business up for sale in June, but that none \u201cwere deemed to be in the best interests of shareholders.\u201dThe lender announced the formal review in April, citing increasing regulatory requirements and a tax that had hit banks based in Britain particularly hard. The political environment, however, shifted after the Conservative Party gained full power in May 2014, after five years of a coalition government. Since then, the British government has softened its tone on the banking industry, hoping to keep London an attractive home for such businesses.HSBC employs about 46,000 people in Britain, but a British exit would not affect the bulk of those jobs, Mr. Gulliver said.HSBC also said on Monday that it had cut Mr. Gulliver\u2019s salary, reflecting the bank\u2019s \u201cweaker financial performance.\u201dMr. Gulliver\u2019s total compensation declined about 4 percent in 2015 to 7.34 million pounds, or about $10.6 million, the bank said. That is down from \u00a37.62 million in 2014.Revenue at HSBC fell 22 percent to $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter, from $13 billion in the period a year earlier.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined 5 percent to $8.06 billion in the period, from $8.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.Pretax profit in HSBC\u2019s investment bank, known as global banking and markets, rose to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter, from a loss of $85 million in the period a year earlier. Pretax profit at its commercial banking business and its retail and wealth management unit both fell, however.In 2012, HSBC agreed to a $1.9 billion settlement after it was accused of laundering money for drug cartels and transferring funds for Iran and other nations under United States sanctions.Mr. Flint said that the bank was confident its program was \u201cdesigned well,\u201d but he added that the monitor had \u201cspecific, very detailed technical issues\u201d that needed to be addressed.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a work in progress,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Milk, beans, soap, hot sauce, tampons, Tylenol \u2014 you name it, there\u2019s a line around the block to buy what little is available.But one thing that could always be counted on in this oil-rich nation was the gasoline. Virtually free, it cost a fraction of a cent per liter. Customers usually tipped the gas attendant more money than it took to fill their tanksUntil Friday. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro increased gas prices more than 1,300 percent, to 1 bol\u00edvar per liter from 0.07 bol\u00edvars for low-grade fuel, at the same time that he instituted a long-expected devaluation of the currency.\u201cI used to pay five bol\u00edvars to fill my tank \u2014 now it will be 200 or 300,\u201d lamented Juan Olivera, a cabdriver. He said he would pass the additional cost on to customers, and worried that the increase could exacerbate inflation, already expected to be 720 percent this year. \u201cNow everything will go up, and so will our crisis,\u201d Mr. Olivera said.Mr. Maduro took no joy in announcing the increases on national television this week. Gasoline subsidies are something few Venezuelan politicians have dared to touch. In 1989, there were riots when the government tried to raise gas prices.This time, there were no signs of unrest in Caracas. There were long lines in the heat as drivers filled up on Thursday before the increase took effect, but many people interviewed said the move was actually too late \u2014 and too little.\u201cHe should have gone even higher,\u201d Alfredo Gallardo, an accountant, said of the president. \u201cWe should pay more \u2014 everyone.\u201dMr. Gallardo, who drives a Toyota Yaris, recalled a recent trip to the pump where he paid \u201cmaybe five or six bol\u00edvars\u201d to fill up with 91-octane gasoline, equivalent to about half a cent if traded on the streets here, where $1 fetches almost 1,000 bol\u00edvars.For years, gas has flowed like water here. Actually, \u00c1ngel Ladino, a water truck operator, pointed out, \u201cIt costs me a lot more to buy one liter of mineral water than to fill the entire tank of this truck.\u201dLast month, the state-owned oil and gas company known as Pdvsa sent 37,401 liters to some of its local distributors, enough to fill up 830 cars. The cost: 1,645 bol\u00edvars, or $261 under the official exchange rate at the time (that\u2019s about 31 cents per car).And the fuel prices affect air travel, too: It cost 2,640 bol\u00edvars, or $13, for a foreigner to fly last year from Caracas to Puerto Ordaz, a city more than 300 miles southeast.Jos\u00e9 Guerra, a former central bank official who is now a legislator opposed to Mr. Maduro, said the price increase and attendant currency devaluation did not go far enough and would do little to help Venezuela pay its mounting debts abroad or for social programs at home.\u201cVenezuela is at risk of default,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an economic plan.\u201dGerardo Bol\u00edvar, 35, who works for an insurance company, does not trust the government to spend the money wisely. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this price increase if crime continues to rise, there is still not enough money and there\u2019s no food?\u201d Mr. Bol\u00edvar asked.He is thinking of switching to 91-octane fuel from 95 to fill up his Fiat, but was worried because cheap gas ruined one of his former cars, and spare parts can be hard to come by in Venezuela.Mar\u00eda Eugenia D\u00edaz reported from Caracas, and Nicholas Casey from Mexico City.

{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Break Up the Banks. They\u2019re Not Our Real Problem.", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byOpinionIN the movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d Steve Carell plays a slightly altered version of me. In real life, I am a portfolio manager and financial services analyst who over a 25-year career has, at times, been highly critical of bank behavior.More than eight years after the financial crisis, many people say that the large banks still pose a threat to the economy and should be broken up. Such a view captures the justifiable anger many Americans still feel toward the large banks. But I don\u2019t agree. Breaking up the banks would ignore the significant progress made by regulators to reduce the risks posed by these institutions, and it wouldn\u2019t address what I believe is the central problem with the economy today.First, let\u2019s analyze why the financial crisis occurred. If I could sum up the catastrophe in one word, it would be \u201cleverage.\u201d Using borrowed money, the financial system made huge bets just when losses were about to explode because of subprime mortgage loans.In the first quarter of 2001, Citigroup\u2019s assets stood at $1 trillion, a level it had taken the entire 20th century to reach. By 2007, only six years later, that balance sheet had doubled to $2 trillion. Ditto for Goldman Sachs. In 2000, the investment bank\u2019s assets stood at $275 billion. Eight years later, its balance sheet had grown to over $1 trillion.Leverage caused the explosion in these balance sheets. In the first quarter of 2001, Citigroup was leveraged 21 to one (meaning it had $21 of assets, including debt and shareholder equity, for every dollar of shareholder equity alone). By mid-2007, leverage had climbed to 33 to one.The explosion in leverage occurred for several reasons, but one underappreciated factor has to do with psychology and corporate culture. An entire generation of Wall Street executives came of age in the 1990s and 2000s. Their incomes started to rise after the recession of the early 1990s, going up in virtually a straight line until the financial crisis. Each year they made more, and each year the balance sheets of their respective firms grew. The system fed on itself.Unfortunately, Wall Street mistook leverage for genius. Then came the irresistible force known as subprime loans.Subprime mortgages were typically 30-year loans with a low teaser interest rate for the first two or three years and a reset rate that was significantly higher. The lenders making these loans cared only that the borrower could pay the teaser rate. Borrowers were forced to refinance frequently \u2014 which everyone connected to the industry loved because it was a fee bonanza. The large banks repackaged and re-securitized the loans over and over again, also generating big revenues. Meanwhile, credit standards were lowered to the point where anyone with a pulse could get a loan.As long as housing prices kept going up, this whole process could continue. For consumers, this was a disaster. For the financial system, it was a time bomb. It never dawned on either lenders or regulators that housing prices kept going up mainly because underwriting standards were getting looser. By the spring of 2007, subprime mortgage credit losses were soaring and the securitization market froze. In this macabre game of musical chairs, whoever was left holding the loans was dead. Among the biggest holders were large banks and brokerage firms.Under the new regulatory regime, the leverage of the large banks has been reduced. While Citigroup\u2019s leverage peaked at 33 to one, today it stands at less than 10 to one. The Federal Reserve has forced similar reductions in leverage across the board. Risky proprietary trading desks have been eliminated at banks by the Volcker Rule, part of Dodd-Frank. And while the consumer protection board has been around for only a few years, it seems to have made progress in safeguarding consumers from the more egregious practices of the financial-services industry.This new system is not perfect. The problem of derivatives \u2014 they can increase risk, rather than reduce it, as they were designed to do \u2014 has not been completely solved. The so-called living wills (plans the banks must file with regulators in case they run into serious trouble and have to be dismantled) are not complete. And the regulators will have to deal with some of the consequences of the Volcker Rule, such as reduced liquidity in the buying and selling of bonds and other parts of the fixed income market. Yet it is simply a fact that the United States financial system is much less risky than it was before. That does not mean that losses cannot occur, but United States banks are in much better shape to withstand them.It\u2019s no longer accurate to say that the large banks pose a systemic danger to the American economy. Some argue that they should be broken up solely because they are too politically powerful. Perhaps so, although that power hasn\u2019t managed to prevent regulators from dismantling bank leverage and risk. Furthermore, no advocate of a breakup has come forward with a plan on how to do it. Large banks are global, complex, integrated institutions. Breaking them apart would be incredibly difficult, long and disruptive, and the banks might have to freeze loan growth during the process, slowing our economy even further.The central economic problem of our time is income inequality, especially the lack of personal income growth for most Americans, which was one of the underlying causes of the financial crisis. In lieu of rising incomes, credit was allowed to be democratized. Living standards were maintained only because increased credit supplemented deteriorating incomes. That helps explain, post-crisis, why United States growth is slow: Without easy credit, consumers cannot increase spending, because their incomes have fallen since 2007.If we want a stronger economy, improving the distribution and growth of personal income should be our focus.

{"Headline": "Yankees\u2019 Offer Could Lead to an Accord Over Tickets", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byTAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The Yankees have not won a playoff game since 2012, and they spent the winter addressing this shortcoming in a very un-Boss-like manner, becoming the only team in baseball not to sign at least one free agent.But on the business side, the Yankees are still adept at throwing their considerable weight around.They did so last week when they announced they would no longer accept print-at-home tickets, instituting mobile ticketing along with standard hard-copy tickets \u2014 moves that could make it more cumbersome for buyers and sellers on the resale market who do not go through the Yankees\u2019 ticket exchange. Although the Yankees said the moves were to combat fraud, industry analysts and competitors saw the latest broadside against StubHub, which the Yankees have frequently accused of undercutting the value of their tickets, as another attempt by a professional sports franchise to seize control of the resale market.After Lonn Trost, the Yankees\u2019 chief operating officer, was lambasted as elitist for suggesting in a Thursday radio interview that some fans do not belong in premium seats, the team president, Randy Levine, in an interview Saturday, said StubHub had stoked the controversy, accusing it of putting out a narrative \u201cthat\u2019s completely fraudulent and completely false.\u201dBut he also offered an olive branch.The Yankees, Levine said, would be willing to allow StubHub and other companies to unlock mobile tickets so they could be resold separate from the Yankees\u2019 ticket exchange and without price floors.\u201cThe bottom line is, we would work with ticket providers as long as we know they\u2019re legitimate, doing it in the spirit of helping our ticket buyers,\u201d Levine said. \u201cBut the ones I\u2019ve talked to, including StubHub and SeatGeek, they don\u2019t want to do that because they don\u2019t want to spend the time and money.\u201dGlenn Lehrman, a spokesman for StubHub, welcomed the offer, which he said the company had not heard before. \u201cThat is definitely news to us and definitely something we\u2019d be interested in,\u201d Lehrman said. \u201cYou\u2019d be opening up a playing field and being given the opportunity to buy and sell tickets in an open marketplace, which is what we\u2019re asking. All we would like is an opportunity to compete.\u201dIf an accord is reached, it will end the latest dust-up between the Yankees and StubHub. Three years ago, the Yankees broke away from Major League Baseball\u2019s partnership with StubHub to begin their own ticket exchange with Ticketmaster, then successfully sued StubHub to keep it from setting up operations within the shadow of Yankee Stadium and the Yankees\u2019 spring training home in Tampa, Fla. When the Yankees announced last Monday that they were no longer producing or accepting print at-home tickets and instituting mobile ticketing, ticket company officials and industry analysts said the only way to sell tickets outside the Yankees\u2019 clearinghouse would be the old-fashioned way: exchanging hard-copy tickets from hand to hand.This left StubHub considering partnerships with couriers, who would pick up and deliver tickets, something that could have been done last season with a couple of clicks on a laptop or phone, Lehrman said.Levine reiterated the Yankees\u2019 stance that protecting customers from fraud was the primary driver in their decision to discontinue print-at-home tickets. He cited two types: someone printing out multiple copies of the same ticket and doctoring a printout to change the row and seat numbers to fetch a higher price. \u201cEvery game, we have serious, serious fraud,\u201d Levine said. He added that StubHub agreed to pay the Yankees nearly $100,000 in fines last season for fraudulent tickets, of which about five or six per game were sold via StubHub. Jason Berger, the managing partner of AllShows.com and a past president of the National Association of Ticket Brokers, said fraud existed on some level with all ticketed events. But he said the Yankees\u2019 initial approach was misguided and stemmed from their refusal to lower ticket prices since the new stadium opened in 2009.\u201cIt\u2019s like they are jumping over a dollar not to chase a dime, but to chase a penny,\u201d Berger said. \u201cThe Yankees are cornering themselves: You can\u2019t do this, you can\u2019t do that, and tickets are more expensive. And look at the stadium \u2014 it\u2019s half empty. The Yankees are losing the big picture of what drives fans to buy tickets.\u201dAttendance declined by 6.1 percent at Yankee Stadium last season to an average of 39,430, the team\u2019s lowest since 2000, according to Baseball-Reference.com.The Yankees are at the forefront of a burgeoning movement by sports teams to gain greater control of their ticket inventory, thereby garnering a greater share of resale fees, instituting price floors and having greater access to marketing data. The Dallas Cowboys, with whom the Yankees are business partners, eliminated print-at-home tickets before last season, and the Golden State Warriors told season-ticket holders they would lose the rights to future tickets if they resold them anywhere else but the team\u2019s exchange. N.F.L. teams have instituted price floors on their ticket exchanges, and several N.B.A. teams have established procedures that make it more unwieldy to buy tickets outside their exchanges.In an effort to combat low pricing on the secondary market in recent years, many teams \u2014 including the Yankees \u2014 have instituted dynamic pricing, which allows teams to change the face value of tickets based on the day of the week, the opponent, the weather and other factors.\u201cThe market is such a Wild West,\u201d said Jesse Lawrence, the chief executive of TiqIQ, a ticket aggregator. \u201cTeams are taking back control of their ecosystems. The Yankees are sort of three years ahead of the curve in what they\u2019ve done to build their own ticket exchange. They\u2019re pretty progressive in how they think about the market.\u201dLawrence said that if the Yankees reached an agreement with StubHub and others to make mobile tickets available through the secondary market, it could work like the arrangement that teams such as the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz have with Flash Seats. Mobile tickets can be resold anywhere, but the buyers have to register with Flash Seats to receive the tickets, allowing teams to know who is sitting in each seat and having the means to contact them.\u201cThis is one more step in the effort by sports teams nationwide to control resale, to control the price, to capture the data of the resale purchaser so they can market to them, and to increase transaction fees,\u201d said Jon Potter, president of Fan Freedom, a customer advocacy group.Increasingly, the distinction between the primary and resale markets is disappearing. Ticketmaster, which has long dominated the primary market, is veering into the resale market, and StubHub made a foray into the primary market with a recent agreement to carry all tickets to Philadelphia 76ers games.In November, a federal court judge, Maxine M. Chesney of the Northern District of California, called primary and secondary market tickets \u201ccommodities reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes\u201d when dismissing a suit by StubHub against the Warriors. (StubHub is appealing.)What distinguishes the Yankees is that unlike the Cowboys and the Warriors, who have fervent demand for tickets, the Yankees rarely play before sellout crowds at home.The Yankees have instituted price floors on their ticket exchange, arguing that brokers who dump tickets to unattractive games for well below the list price are devaluing the team\u2019s brand by undercutting the prices of unsold tickets.Levine said that price floors did not exist for every game and were not the same in all sections. He added that 87 percent of tickets purchased on the Yankees\u2019 exchange sold for more than the price floor last season.But New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, recently raised concerns that such practices impede an open market, suggesting in a report on the ticket industry that price floors constitute an abuse of monopoly power, especially when combined with efforts to keep buyers and sellers off platforms without price floors. \u201cThere is little to say in favor of price floors,\u201d Schneiderman wrote. \u201cThey tend to expose the public to the full costs of the new ticket economy while depriving the public of the benefits.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe consumer harm caused by price floors is directly related to the success of the efforts to pressure consumers to use only the primary seller\u2019s (usually Ticketmaster\u2019s) platform.\u201dLevine said the Yankees were complying with the attorney general\u2019s suggestions. He said that mobile ticketing was more convenient for fans, and that the Yankees were not profiting from it. \u201cWe strongly believe that we have the right to maintain control over our inventory as long as the market provides ample opportunity to have choice in other ways,\u201d Levine said.An article in some editions last Sunday about the Yankees\u2019 policy on print-at-home tickets referred incorrectly in some copies to the selling price for 87 percent of tickets purchased on the team\u2019s exchange. Those tickets sold for more than the price floor, not more than face value.Ken Belson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everyone Loses if Britain Exits the E.U.", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe prospect of a British exit from the European Union has been around for a long time. Britain never fully warmed to the idea of the European Union, and the \u201ceuroskeptics\u201d clamoring to get out give the impression that nothing the union could offer would sway them.Mr. Tusk\u2019s plan would create a special mechanism to protect non-euro members \u2014 Britain never adopted the euro and proudly uses its own currency \u2014 from any unfair advantage eurozone countries may have. It would allow Britain to reduce welfare payments to non-British European citizens living in Britain. It would formally recognize the \u201copt-out\u201d clause that allows Britain to reject some European Union measures, such as taking in a set quota of refugees. And it would acknowledge Britain\u2019s right to sovereignty.Britain benefits enormously from membership in the union\u2019s common market and, as a member, it is also able to influence European policies. It would lose on both counts if it were to withdraw, and that would affect Britain\u2019s ties to NATO and to the United States. The Tusk proposal gives Britain leeway to distance itself from policies it finds onerous. As Mr. Cameron accurately argues, Britain would then have the \u201cbest of both worlds.\u201dMr. Tusk\u2019s job now is to persuade the other 27 members of the union to accept the concessions to Britain; his proposal is being debated in the European Parliament ahead of the European Summit meeting in Brussels on Feb. 18 and 19. One controversial point is the provision allowing Britain to curb social benefits for European workers in Britain. But not to compromise, Mr. Tusk warns, \u201cwould be compromising our common future.\u201d And that would be a tragedy for Britain, other European nations, and for a world that needs a united and prosperous Europe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Paris Terror Attacks, France Struggles With Faith on the Job", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byWhile supervisors had sometimes reminded him of a company dress code requiring whiskers to be kept \u201ctidy\u201d and \u201cshort,\u201d Bachir said that the rule had been enforced only sporadically over his six years working for Securitas, a private security company. This time, the manager made clear that the new crackdown was \u201cbecause of what was happening in the news,\u201d said Bachir, who asked that his last name not be used to protect his family\u2019s privacy.Bachir trimmed his beard that weekend. But he said his boss sent him home about 10 days later, again citing his failure to comply with the dress code. Soon after, Bachir received a registered letter from Securitas, saying that he was fired.The issues have become thornier after the latest wave of terrorist activity, including the November attacks in Paris that left 130 dead. With much of the region on edge, the French government has set a forceful tone, granting sweeping emergency powers to the police and stepping up the scrutiny of mosques, Islamic associations and individuals. The sense of unease is particularly palpable for companies operating in sensitive areas like transportation, security and infrastructure.Adding to workplace conflicts like the one at Securitas, as well as reports of tensions at other large employers, is that many Muslims have become more assertive in fighting stigmatization on the job. But many managers and union leaders in France report feeling ill equipped to respond to employee demands for things like dedicated prayer rooms or pork-free canteens \u2014 let alone to detect and combat genuine radicalization at work.\u201cToday, we are in a very complicated situation,\u201d said Philippe Humeau, a researcher at InAgora, a consultancy that specializes in religion and the workplace.\u201cMost companies don\u2019t know much about Islam,\u201d he said. And in the current climate, \u201cwe are seeing companies confuse strict religious practice, which is already difficult to accept in France, with radicalization.\u201dThe risk is that companies, in a quest to protect their staff and their clients, unfairly profile certain employees.Bachir is convinced that he was fired over fears that his religious expression made him a possible security threat. He filed a discrimination complaint against Securitas with French prosecutors, who are reviewing it.He is one of at least a half-dozen security guards \u2014 all bearded Muslim men \u2014 who have been let go by Securitas since the November attacks. They are all challenging their dismissals in a French labor court.Their dismissals followed a similar pattern. In late November, they received the same written warning, copies of which were reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cThe face must be close-shaven, goatees, mustaches and beards kept short, trimmed, tidy and maintained,\u201d the warnings stated. Weeks later, they were sent dismissal letters. The letters refer to repeated violations of the dress code, while a few, including Bachir\u2019s letter, also list additional infractions such as unexcused absences and tardiness.\u201cThat beard did not just grow from one day to the next,\u201d said Eric Moutet, a lawyer representing the men. \u201cBut suddenly now it\u2019s a problem? Clearly it\u2019s not something about his behavior that has changed but rather it is the way that person is now being viewed.\u201dSecuritas, which provides about 400 security agents to Orly airport under a multiyear contract and an additional 1,000 at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, declined to discuss the specific dismissals, citing the pending litigation. The security company said the beard rules, and the subsequent firings, adhered to the law. As a private company working on behalf of public sector clients like the airport, Securitas said it must conform to France\u2019s strict secularism laws.\u201cWe are confident,\u201d Michel Mathieu, the head of Securitas\u2019s French operations, said, in reference to the decision to fire the Orly guards. The company has not accused the guards of any illegal activities, nor has it presented any evidence that they engaged in radical behavior on the job. But he said that recent events had led Securitas to revisit its approach to all forms of religious practice in the workplace.What some might view as overt religious profiling, Mr. Mathieu insisted had become a necessity for a company like Securitas, whose mission is to protect against potential dangers that now include Islamic terrorism. The risks, he added, were no longer abstract. Last year, Securitas alerted the French authorities to four security agents who, despite a rigorous vetting process that includes multiple background checks, were found in possession of jihadist propaganda on the job.\u201cFrench companies have been touched by the phenomenon of radicalization,\u201d Mr. Mathieu said. \u201cWe have to be able to speak about these things.\u201dIn the days after the deadly November attacks, it emerged that one of the gunmen identified in the attack at the Bataclan concert hall had once worked as a bus driver for RATP, the Paris transportation authority. Almost immediately, the French media questioned whether more radical Islamists might be lurking among the RATP\u2019s staff. Some labor union leaders complained that managers, fearful of complaints from Muslim employees, had long tolerated religious behavior on the job that was explicitly prohibited by the company\u2019s own policies.The RATP chief executive, Elisabeth Borne, swiftly dismissed the speculation as overblown and warned against \u201cconflating\u201d religious practice with extremism. But the company also quietly acknowledged that workplace conflicts linked to religious behavior, albeit still \u201cvery marginal\u201d in number, had become a concern in recent years.\u201cThe RATP cannot escape the difficulties confronted by French society,\u201d the company said in a statement.Officially, France\u2019s vigorous brand of secularism applies to all religious faiths. But over the last decade, regulations on la\u00efcit\u00e9 (pronounced lie-EE-see-tay) have tended to focus on Islam. A law prohibiting government employees and high school students from wearing head scarves and other \u201cconspicuous\u201d religious attire was introduced in 2004. A specific prohibition against women wearing full-face veils in public went into effect in 2011.The principle of la\u00efcit\u00e9, however, applies only to those who work in France\u2019s vast public sector economy. For private companies like Securitas, the situation is murkier.Under French labor law, private employers are required to respect the religious freedom of their employees, meaning that such companies are expected to tolerate religion on the job. Only proselytizing and acts of pressure toward other employees are expressly banned.The regulations do, however, allow for a number of exceptions, like employee health and safety, operational continuity and protecting commercial interests. And private companies working in the public arena create a gray area.In strict practice, the rules mean that an employee who accepts a job at a butcher shop, for example, could not refuse to handle pork. A train driver would not be allowed to stop on the tracks to pray. A waitress could not decline to serve alcohol to customers.But many situations are less clear cut.Fatima Afif had worn her head scarf for close to a decade as an employee of Baby-Loup, a day care center in a working-class suburb of Paris. But when she returned to work in 2008 after an extended parental leave, she was ordered to take it off.The nursery, owned by a private association that catered to single and working mothers, argued that it needed to be religiously neutral in order to serve a large immigrant community that had become increasingly diverse. When Ms. Afif refused to comply, she was fired.The case eventually became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, pitting civil rights groups and Islamic activists against an unlikely coalition of secularists, feminists and politicians on the far right. The French courts struggled to reach a consistent verdict.The courts\u2019 flip-flops over the Baby-Loup case \u201cleft people more uncertain about the legal framework,\u201d said Guy Trolliet, a job coach and consultant on intercultural and religious affairs.Employers indicate that conflicts over religion in the workplace are on the rise. A 2015 survey of 1,300 French companies by the Observatory of Workplace Religious Practice, a research group based at the Institute of Political Science in Rennes, France, found that 12 percent of human resources managers had faced disputes over religious practices that were difficult to resolve, up from 6 percent in 2013. Among the most difficult situations cited included employees\u2019 rejection of the company\u2019s authority to set limits on religious behavior as well as refusals by some men to work alongside women, either as a colleague or a boss.But the legal issues, as well as the political and social implications, have left many companies \u2014 private and state-owned \u2014 unsure how to proceed. That uncertainty has resulted in an ad hoc approach that is rife with potential problems, both for companies and their staff members.Some employers complain that they have limited means with French law to try to determine whether the religious behavior of specific employees should be a legitimate cause for concern. While the country\u2019s intelligence services maintain a list of around 10,000 people with known or suspected links to radical Islamic groups, privacy laws prevent law enforcement from sharing those names with employers.Gilles Leclair, the head of security for Air France, told a French parliamentary committee last spring that the airline was particularly sensitive to the threat of infiltration by radical groups. \u201cBut legally, we can\u2019t force employees to inform us\u201d about troubling behavior, he said, and individuals were often able to successfully challenge such dismissals in French labor courts. \u201cIt\u2019s all well and good to detect radical phenomena, but we also need the legal means\u201d to respond, Mr. Leclair said.Guillaume Pepy, the head of SNCF, the French national railway operator, recently conceded that the country\u2019s anti-terrorist services had alerted the company \u2014 which employs 50,000 people \u2014 to as many as 10 employees in the last year whom they suspected of having ties to Islamist groups. But rather than fire the employees and risk a costly discrimination suit, Mr. Pepy told a French radio in January that it was SNCF\u2019s policy to ensure that the individuals were not allowed to be train drivers or signal operators or to hold other positions that could pose a security threat.\u201cWe don\u2019t fire them, because that could be a powerful incitement to radicalization,\u201d Mr. Pepy said.Analysts said most companies were able to deal with more common employee requests \u2014 including the ability to wear head scarves or arrange schedules and break times to allow for prayers and other observances \u2014 and that those actions could be easily distinguished from proselytizing or abrupt changes in behavior that could be a sign of radicalization.But those lines aren\u2019t always discernible and some people, like the job coach Mr. Trolliet, worry that the current environment of fear could quickly erode employers\u2019 openness to religious accommodation in general.\u201cAs always,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are groups that have a hidden agenda, who will use the leverage of well-meaning people.\u201dBecause they work for a public entity, employees of the RATP, the Paris transport authority, are expressly prohibited from \u201cany behavior or wearing of conspicuous signs that could reveal an affiliation with any religion or philosophy whatsoever.\u201d Violations of this rule are meant to be subject to disciplinary action, including potential termination.So when Christophe Salmon, a delegate for CFDT, a leading French labor union, started receiving complaints about a group of male bus drivers who were refusing to address female colleagues or shake their hands, he raised the alarm. At certain bus depots, he said, some male employees wouldn\u2019t take the wheel of a vehicle that had been previously driven by a woman.Rather than report the behavior to the authority\u2019s human resource managers, Mr. Salmon said that supervisors simply adjusted the drivers\u2019 schedules and routes to avoid handoffs between women and men. In one case, Mr. Salmon said, a woman who lived within walking distance of her depot asked to be transferred to a job across town rather than stay and continue to endure the harassment.Some of the drivers were ultimately reprimanded, but none were fired, an outcome that Mr. Salmon said amounted to \u201ca kind of trivialization\u201d of such behavior. The authority responded by distributing a 34-page handbook in 2013 that defines the principles of religious neutrality and diversity to managers and describes a number of common workplace situations. However, Mr. Salmon said, few supervisors received formal practical guidance on how to address conflicts when they arose.\u201cThese guys have been very well trained to drive buses and trains, but they know nothing about la\u00efcit\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Salmon said, referring to the supervisors. \u201cAll they have is a bunch of guidelines on paper.\u201dIn an emailed statement, the Paris transport authority said it took questions of religious conflict \u201cseriously,\u201d although it declined to discuss specific cases. The company recently announced the creation of a new working group, reporting to the chief executive, that was intended to provide \u201cconcrete support to front-line managers\u201d on questions of religious behavior. In addition, plans are in the works to develop a dedicated peer-support network, giving staff members a resource for informal advice when issues arise.Uncertain about the true security threats to their operations and staff, many employers are now struggling to strike an appropriate balance between vigilance and protection of the rights of their employees.\u201cThat is the real trap for employers,\u201d said Lionel Honor\u00e9, director of the Observatory of Workplace Religious Practice.Paradoxically, he said, it is often the employees most open to dialogue who are the first to be pressed to adapt their religious practices, while more troubling behavior is sometimes allowed to continue unchallenged for fear of escalating the problem.\u201cRadical people make some managers nervous, and so they leave them alone,\u201d Mr. Honor\u00e9 said.At Securitas, Mr. Mathieu conceded that the company\u2019s crackdown on beards and other forms of religious expression had raised concerns among staff members, and not only among Muslims. He said that the company was sensitive to the risk of making \u201cerrors of good faith\u201d about religious behavior on the job.\u201cPeople can confuse these things, either voluntarily or involuntarily,\u201d Mr. Mathieu said. \u201cI always want to make things as transparent as possible.\u201dMr. Moutet, the lawyer for the Securitas guards, said that the number of dismissed Muslim workers who had contacted him to bring religious discrimination suits had been rising over the last year. That increase, he feared, was in parallel with the tougher line against terrorism being taken by the French authorities.\u201cIt seems that there are some companies that are taking advantage of the mood of panic to try to clean house and sweep out certain people that they simply don\u2019t like,\u201d Mr. Moutet said.Bachir, the former Orly guard whose beard cost him his job, worries that cases like his will become more common. He still maintains a valid security guard\u2019s license, which is granted only after an extensive police background check. But Bachir, who is married and is a father, said he was considering a new line of work or even going into business for himself.\u201cToday in France, la\u00efcit\u00e9 only has one meaning, and it is anti-Islam,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has become so widespread. And now, yes, it has infected the workplace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Beats Bernie Sanders in Nevada Caucuses", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byMrs. Clinton\u2019s team breathed a sigh of relief as the results of the often-unpredictable campaign made clear that she had rebounded after her crushing defeat in the New Hampshire primary. At a caucus at the famed Caesars Palace, blackjack dealers, pit bosses, cooks and housekeepers excitedly declared their support for the former secretary of state.Voters in many predominantly Hispanic and black neighborhoods backed Mrs. Clinton after she worked hard to connect with them, most notably when she comforted a tearful young Latina who feared her parents would be deported. That moment was turned into a powerful ad here for Mrs. Clinton, whose message of solidarity with minority voters stood in contrast to Mr. Sanders\u2019s more esoteric attacks on Wall Street and the campaign finance system.With votes from 92 percent of caucus precincts counted, Mrs. Clinton had won 52.6 percent, while Mr. Sanders had drawn 47.3 percent in relatively modest turnout. Mrs. Clinton had been far ahead in the polls until recently, when Mr. Sanders became better known here and struck fear into the Clinton campaign that he might prevail in Nevada and deal her a serious setback.In her victory speech Saturday afternoon, in a ballroom at Caesars Palace, Mrs. Clinton devoted her campaign to \u201chotel and casino workers who never wavered\u201d and \u201cthe thousands of men and women with kids to raise, bills to pay and dreams that won\u2019t die.\u201d She used plural pronouns like \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d more than usual, as opposed to leaning on \u201cI,\u201d a clear attempt to make her campaign about voters as Mr. Sanders has done powerfully.\u201cWe look at our country and see so much that isn\u2019t working the way it should,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cAmericans are right to be angry, but we\u2019re also hungry for real solutions,\u201d she added, a line that seemed aimed at aggrieved voters who like the urgency of Mr. Sanders but may doubt he can enact his ambitious agenda.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory was a serious setback for Mr. Sanders, who campaigned hard in Nevada in hopes that a surge of Latino and black voters would heed his call for a political revolution.Mr. Sanders delivered a bullish concession speech on Saturday, saying that his message had inspired historic numbers of young and working people to vote and that it would lead to victories in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 1 and ultimately the Democratic nomination.\u201cWe have come a very long way in nine months,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThe wind is at our backs. We have the momentum. And I believe that when Democrats assemble in Philadelphia in July at that convention, we are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.\u201dYet in the view of several political analysts, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory in Nevada and proven popularity with minority voters increases the likelihood of her winning the South Carolina primary on Saturday and many of the Super Tuesday contests, which would put her on even more certain path to the party\u2019s nomination.Robert Shrum, a longtime strategist for presidential campaigns, said that with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Nevada win, \u201cmost Democrats will conclude \u2014 again \u2014 that she will be the nominee.\u201dMrs. Clinton had for months considered Nevada a haven that would provide a welcome shift from the mostly white electorates of New Hampshire and Iowa. But in recent weeks, Mr. Sanders\u2019s populist message began to take hold and polls tightened. Her campaign, bracing for another loss, seemed to look beyond Nevada to the contest next weekend in South Carolina.Still, early organizing in the state and a last-minute on-the-ground push by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and its supporters paid off. And Mrs. Clinton, who is typically a reserved presence on the trail, seemed to embrace the quirkiness of campaigning in Las Vegas, posing for photographs with Britney Spears, who was in town for her show at Planet Hollywood, and even receiving the endorsement of 500 sex workers, mostly from Carson City brothels, who formed the \u201cHookers 4 Hillary\u201d group.9 PhotosLess than an hour before the caucuses began, Mrs. Clinton was shaking hands in the employee cafeteria at Harrah\u2019s casino. \u201cI need your help this morning, in the showroom at 11 a.m.,\u201d she told the predominantly Spanish-speaking workers.Several Hispanic voters cheered Mrs. Clinton with enthusiasm. \u201cShe\u2019ll change immigration. She\u2019ll change the economy. She\u2019ll change todo!\u201d said Dora Gonzalez, 54, a casino porter at the Bellagio, using the Spanish word for everything.\u201cAnd she\u2019s a mujer!\u201d added her friend Elba Pinera, 51, originally from Honduras, using the Spanish word for woman.Mr. Sanders, who performed well in the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire, is now under pressure to show that he can attract the broad cross-section of Democrats necessary to remain competitive with Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders did appeal to a good number of Hispanic voters: According to entrance polls by Edison Research, he was ahead of Mrs. Clinton among Hispanics. These numbers may not reflect the final vote tally, however, because Mrs. Clinton was performing strongly in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods around Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas. Mrs. Clinton won 60 percent of the delegates in the 22 Latino-majority precincts that had reported results on Saturday night, according to her campaign aides.Mr. Sanders fared poorly among African-American voters, earning support from only 22 percent of them, according to the entrance polls.Sanders advisers acknowledged on Saturday that his weak performance with African-Americans meant he could face significant difficulties in the South Carolina primary and the Super Tuesday states, many of which have large African-American populations. Mr. Sanders has been reluctant to reshape his political message to appeal more sharply or dramatically to black voters \u2014 which he did not do in his concession speech here \u2014 and political analysts said that time was running out to show he could expand his base of support.\u201cWhen will Sanders prove that he can win a state with a big minority population? That has to be his top goal right now, and he\u2019s far from it,\u201d said Brent F. Nelsen, a political scientist at Furman University in South Carolina. \u201cA lot of Sanders loyalists here are confused why African-Americans aren\u2019t supporting Bernie, since he\u2019s speaking their economic language. But a lot of blacks here and elsewhere also care about personal loyalty and relationships, and Clinton has a strong edge there.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s earlier surges in Iowa, where he nearly tied Mrs. Clinton, and in New Hampshire came at a high price, according to campaign finance data released on Saturday. He spent $35 million in January, an enormous amount, and ended the month with half as much cash on hand as Mrs. Clinton, after out-raising her by several million dollars.In Nevada, Mrs. Clinton benefited from deep connections to the state. Robby Mook, her campaign manager, had served as her Nevada director when she narrowly defeated Mr. Obama here in 2008. Her current state director, Emmy Ruiz, delivered a victory in Nevada to Mr. Obama in his 2012 re-election campaign.Her support among labor also ran deep, even though the Culinary Workers Union, which represents 57,000 members, many of whom are Latino, declined to endorse a candidate. But on Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who also remained neutral, said in an interview he had spoken to D. Taylor, the head of the union\u2019s parent group, to make sure its members could have paid time off to participate in the caucuses, a move that operatives in the state believed helped tip the race in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s favor.She overwhelmingly defeated Mr. Sanders in the caucuses that were held at six major Las Vegas casinos, including Harrah\u2019s, the Wynn and New York-New York, which heavily drew working-class minority voters.Before the 2008 election, Mr. Reid lobbied for Nevada to be among the early-voting states, arguing that its mix of urban and rural areas, and a population that is nearly half minority, could indicate how candidates would fare among a more diverse electorate. \u201cIf you\u2019re my color and you start school, you\u2019ll be in a minority in Clark County,\u201d Mr. Reid said Thursday in an interview, referring to the state\u2019s most populous county.The state has just six electoral votes in the general election, but its population reflects the composition of other potential Western battlegrounds like Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.The Nevada results were personally important for Mrs. Clinton, who struggled in 2008 to win caucus states, though she prevailed here against Barack Obama. In this campaign, she has won the two caucuses so far, here and in Iowa. Immediately following her speech, Mrs. Clinton flew to Houston for a rally. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to Texas. Bill is on his way to Colorado. The fight goes on!\u201d she said.Amy Chozick reported from Las Vegas, and Patrick Healy from New York.Advertisement"}

He had much to celebrate. As the nation\u2019s first indigenous leader, Mr. Morales transformed Bolivia\u2019s rigid socioeconomic structure by spreading the wealth of a commodities boom. He has championed those in indigenous communities, and under his watch the number of Bolivians living in extreme poverty has decreased from 37 percent to roughly 19 percent. During the past decade, one of South America\u2019s most politically volatile countries has enjoyed a long stretch of relative stability.Mr. Morales is now asking voters to approve on Sunday a constitutional change that would allow him to run for a fourth term, which could keep him in office until 2025. Bolivians should say no.A decade in power has changed Mr. Morales, and not for the better. He has become increasingly imperious and authoritarian, presenting himself in rallies and speeches as the only safeguard against right-wing radicals who want to re-establish an oligarchy. There is, in fact, broad consensus that the country needs to build on Mr. Morales\u2019s vision of social inclusion and equality. Yet he has chosen to ignore this, fostering instead a with-us-or-against-us culture that has sent dozens of Bolivians into exile and poisoned the country\u2019s politics.On the economic front, a couple of corruption scandals have sparked outrage over the government\u2019s lax fiscal controls, even as Mr. Morales gets high marks for sound macroeconomic policies that have kept inflation relatively low as the economy has grown. One scandal, which came to light last year, involves the disbursement of tens of millions of dollars from a development fund that were deposited in indigenous leaders\u2019 personal bank accounts. More recently, Mr. Morales has faced withering criticism amid growing evidence that a young woman he dated a decade ago has exploited her ties to the president for personal gain.On a recent afternoon, as Mr. Morales listened to speech after speech singing his praises at the groundbreaking of a residential complex, Laura Choque, a 46-year-old nurse who has voted for him in every election, watched from a distance with disdain. \u201cHis promise was that he was a leader who shared our roots,\u201d she said. But, referring to the cultlike adoration that has become a hallmark at Mr. Morales\u2019s events, she added: \u201cThis all has made him very arrogant.\u201dAdvertisement"}

To this day, his motive is unclear: Was he desperate to escape the burdens of high office? Or did he believe in his own indispensability and wish to evoke pleas from member states for him to remain?Those pushing for a more transparent selection process are hoping that the Security Council might offer more than one candidate for the General Assembly to choose from \u2014 although the General Assembly has never had the chutzpah to turn down a candidate whom the council has presented it with. The former Irish president Mary Robinson is one of the Elders, the group of global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela that is advocating reform.The United Nations is often blamed for this failure; in fact, responsibility lies with the five permanent members of the Security Council and the transgressors in the region. The five have an opportunity to help choose a leader who just might be able to change these dynamics and restore the United Nations\u2019 relevance.Who, then, could be a front-runner?Yet some United Nations insiders speak of a woman far more established on the world stage: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. There was speculation in the German media last year about her possible candidacy, though it subsided and since then she has had her work cut out as Germany welcomed a huge influx of refugees.Germany\u2019s remarkable response under her leadership to Europe\u2019s refugee crisis has also underlined Mrs. Merkel\u2019s humanitarian credentials. At the height of last year\u2019s wave of migration, the contrast between Mrs. Merkel\u2019s willingness to accept desperate asylum seekers in their hundreds of thousands contrasted with the parsimonious response of Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, as well as with a growing xenophobia among some Eastern European leaders.The task facing Mr. Ban\u2019s successor is daunting. Despite the reforms he championed, the United Nations remains browbeaten, anxious about change and suspicious of outsiders. This new, multipolar world where conflict transcends national boundaries is a hugely difficult one to navigate, but if anyone can meet this challenge, it could be Germany\u2019s chancellor.Mark Seddon was a communications aide to the United Nations secretary general from 2014 to 2016.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Global Banking Hub Is Mostly Leery of an E.U. Exit", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 With a referendum looming on whether Britain will leave the European Union, the country\u2019s voters seem sharply divided on whether to stay or go.But for the big banks that dominate the City, as London\u2019s financial industry is known, there is little disagreement: They don\u2019t want to risk going it alone.\u201cLondon is a global center; it\u2019s also a European center \u2014 one is contingent on the other,\u201d said Alan Houmann, managing director of European government affairs for Citigroup. \u201cFinancial institutions come into London from third countries, like the U.S. and from the rest of the E.U., so this creates this huge ecosystem at which London sits at the center.\u201dPrime Minister David Cameron, who wants his country to remain in the bloc, is negotiating changes to the country\u2019s terms of membership ahead of a summit meeting with European leaders on Feb. 18 and 19. (The referendum in Britain could come as soon as June.) With his counterparts in Europe, Mr. Cameron is trying to secure Britain\u2019s status in the financial hierarchy by seeking assurances that banks and other firms will not be discriminated against as the eurozone becomes more integrated.He is navigating a political minefield. As much as Germany and France want Britain to stay part of a club that has helped reinforce peace and regional stability for decades, other members worry about the precedent of granting any one country too many side deals or breaching fundamental principles of unity.And the big banks are hardly a sympathetic cause, making industry executives somewhat more tempered in their comments on a Brexit. The British public blames highly paid bankers for the financial crisis and the scandals over currency trading and interest-rate rigging.Bankers do not exactly love the raft of regulations in Europe, like the cap on bonuses and a proposal to tax financial transactions. But many believe that a Brexit would be problematic.Were Britain to leave the European Union, bankers in London might no longer have the automatic right to provide services to clients in other European nations \u2014 like securities trading, foreign exchange and investment management.Britain would also cede its ability to help shape, block or amend European financial and banking laws. It could be demoted, in the catchphrase of anti-Brexit campaigners, from being a rule maker to a rule taker.\u201cBanks won\u2019t disappear from London overnight, but they will over time if Britain votes \u2018no,\u2019 \u201d to the European Union, Michael Sherwood and Richard Gnodde, the co-chief executives of Goldman Sachs International, argued in an op-ed article in The Times, the London newspaper.Goldman has been more visible than many big banks on this issue and has donated a six-figure sum to Britain Stronger in Europe, a lobbying campaign that is opposed to a Brexit. Goldman declined to comment on its donations.Even bankers who operate solely within Britain acknowledge the potential disruptions.Secure Trust, a small, domestically focused British bank, has little to gain commercially from the European Union\u2019s single market. The bank\u2019s chief executive, Paul Lynam, is also unhappy with the way European regulators interpret international rules. He notes, for example, that the European Union requires Secure Trust to maintain capital reserves \u2014 cushions against risk \u2014 that he says are larger than necessary for an institution like his that mainly serves consumers and small businesses.Although he believes that a Brexit would be \u201cmade to work,\u201d it would most likely mean years of negotiation over the details of Britain\u2019s new relationship with the bloc. This process, he said, would be \u201cmessy, costly, disruptive and time-consuming.\u201d\u201cWe need to know what are the options being offered to us by way of concessions, relative to the dangers of the leap into the unknown,\u201d Mr. Lynam said.He is also concerned about the backlash among the banks\u2019 customers. Most opinion polls show that the British public is almost evenly split on the Brexit issue.\u201cIf I take a public position I will upset half my customers \u2014 a quarter of a million customers,\u201d said Mr. Lynam. \u201cSo I won\u2019t be in a rush to do that.\u201dStill, some in the City have openly contemplated a Brexit.One is Norman Blackwell, a former adviser to two Conservative prime minsters, John Major and Margaret Thatcher, who is now chairman of Lloyds Banking Group. Last year, Mr. Blackwell told the House of Lords \u2014 where he is a member \u2014 that Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc might become \u201cincreasingly unsustainable.\u201d He noted that his comments reflected his personal views.And some hedge fund executives in the City would just as soon quit the European Union. Hedge funds have tended to chafe under the closer oversight that European regulators have demanded since the global financial crisis of 2008.But among the City\u2019s hedge funds, there is no consensus, particularly given that they would still face European rules to court European business.\u201cHedge fund businesses in the U.K. recognize that they would not be able to avoid E.U. regulation if there were a Brexit, since all non-E.U. hedge funds today have to comply with a range of E.U. rules in order to raise capital in the E.U. or trade on the bloc\u2019s capital markets,\u201d said Jack Inglis, chief executive of the London-based Alternative Investment Management Association, a trade group.Even the big international banks that benefit most from the European single market assume they would probably survive a Brexit. Most have operations in the eurozone that could be expanded.Some are already moving some operations from London to reduce costs. Credit Suisse, for example, opened a branch office in Dublin.Seen in that light, a Brexit is not as risky to any specific bank as it is to London\u2019s role as a global financial center.\u201cIf no one moves, then no one moves,\u201d Mr. Houmann of Citi said. \u201cIf everyone moves a bit, then there\u2019s quite a big drop.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Common Political Ground on Poverty", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIf you have been paying any attention to America\u2019s paralyzed politics, you are not going to believe this.Even as substantive legislation in Washington remained largely bogged down by bitter partisan mistrust, some of the leading thinkers on opposite sides of the ideological divide \u2014 experts on the right who have advised Republican policy makers alongside left-leaning scholars who have Democrats\u2019 ear \u2014 came together to champion an increase in the minimum wage.They called for increasing the earned-income tax credit for adults without children. They also proposed more federal investment in early childhood education and community colleges. They defended a common core in education.These folks do not often agree. The group included Robert Doar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Lawrence Mead of New York University, who believe that welfare should come with stiff work requirements to discourage dependency. They sat across from Sheldon Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation and Jane Waldfogel of Columbia University, who believe in a cash safety net of last resort, at least for families with children.\u201cEverybody had to swallow very hard to put their name on that,\u201d acknowledged Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute, who was part of the 15-member group.It is easy to dismiss the exercise as a futile effort to find a minimum common denominator between disparate opposites. The report is not likely to make its way into legislation any time soon. But, the experts hope, the next administration might turn its attention to poverty and find a set of viable ideas on the shelf.The collection of proposals \u2014 from promoting strong and stable families to improving the quantity and quality of work \u2014 actually adds up to a coherent approach to improving an anti-poverty strategy that has fallen far short of its goals.\u201cThe report took us longer than we thought,\u201d Mr. Danziger told me. \u201cBut everybody agreed that even though there were things in it we didn\u2019t like, the package together would be better than the status quo.\u201dConsider the call to increase the minimum wage. The scholars made note of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s recent assessment that the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 and index it to inflation would provide higher pay to 16 million to 24 million workers and lift a million people out of poverty \u2014 at a cost of 500,000 jobs over three years and a slight uptick in consumer prices.Conservatives still found the costs too high and the benefits insufficiently compelling. Most of the income gains would benefit the nonpoor, they argued. And what if the budget office underestimated job losses? What if fixing the minimum wage to inflation brought other costs?This debate was a \u201cclear example of how values can influence the reading of research evidence,\u201d the report admitted candidly.Nonetheless, in the service of a deal, those on the right and the left held their noses and agreed to \u201crecommend an increase below what the administration has proposed, but still large enough to substantially improve the rewards associated with work among the less-skilled.\u201dThe two sides will never entirely agree, of course, partly because they view the causes of poverty from such different angles.To the left, deprivation is caused mostly by factors beyond the control of the poor. These include globalization that undercut good jobs previously within the reach of the less educated, an educational system segregated by race and class, lack of parental resources, discrimination, excessive use of prison.Experts on the right, by contrast, put a lot of the weight on personal responsibility, often faulting the bad choices of the poor. And government support, by providing the poor with an income with few strings attached, has made their choices worse.Yet common ground does exist. Understanding the causes of poverty has improved over the last few decades, helping push solutions through the ideological fog.Many liberals are still skeptical that encouraging marriage will do much to help the poor, but most have come to accept that the children of intact families have a better shot in life. Some conservatives have come to acknowledge that though the push to tie work requirements to public assistance may have made sense in the booming 1990s, the approach might require adjustments to fit the present, less dynamic economy.This opens up opportunities for deals. Conservatives want those on government aid to get a job? Liberals will agree, provided there is a guarantee that jobs are available and that there is a safety net for those at the very bottom who simply cannot work.\u201cIf we require more work as a condition of receiving public benefits, we should support policies expanding work availability to those who need it,\u201d the report states.Progressives, Mr. Danziger told me, placed more weight on the part of the report that calls for \u201censuring jobs are available.\u201d Conservatives, by contrast, preferred the bit that mentioned \u201craising work levels among the hard-to-employ.\u201dThere is another hurdle that may be even harder to overcome: money. The report\u2019s \u201cclose tax expenditures\u201d approach to financing useful proposals has become the standard Hail Mary pass. But given all the interests with a stake in the present tax system, it never seems to muster much support.As Mr. Strain put it, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to deny that conservatives want to spend less money than liberals.\u201d Indeed, when House Speaker Paul D. Ryan proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit, he favored paying for it by cutting funds for other anti-poverty efforts.Still, it is worth seeking a deal. If the Democrats retain the White House while the Republicans maintain their grip on Congress, neither party will be able to dominate Washington policy making. For the poor, a compromise along these lines would be a lot better than doing nothing.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated when the photograph was taken.

The second set of bonds is now worth much more because of the accrued interest.Argentina responded by offering one set of hedge funds, who did not sue on the pari passu clause, 150 percent of their judgement. Another set, that did not sue to collect on their bonds, but to enforce the pari passu clause, have been offered up to 72.5 percent of their claims.

{"Headline": "Janet Yellen Sounds a More Cautious Note on the U.S. Economy", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Republicans described the Federal Reserve as ineffective, secretive and out of touch with the economic realities of ordinary Americans.The Democrats showered it with praise, using words like \u201cherculean.\u201dAnd those were just the opening statements on Wednesday, as the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, began two days of testimony on Capitol Hill.Ms. Yellen functions as the nation\u2019s economic weather forecaster and, on Wednesday, she sounded more worried than at her last public appearance, in December.She meant that convulsions in the stock markets could harm the economy. But Ms. Yellen said it was too soon to assess any damage, and she suggested it was also too soon to say whether the Fed would raise interest rates in March. \u201cLet\u2019s remember that the labor market is continuing to perform well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be careful not to jump to a conclusion about what is in store for the economy.\u201dEven those plans, however, now look ambitious. Like predicting the weather, economic forecasting is an inexact science.Around the world, equity markets have tumbled, erasing wealth and undermining confidence. And loans, already in short supply, are becoming even harder to come by. Investors are demanding higher rates from risky borrowers while pumping so much money into safe havens like government debt that governments are increasingly charging interest instead of paying it, a phenomenon known as negative interest rates.Ms. Yellen argued on Wednesday that the rest of the world was to blame. She said the crucial question confronting the Fed was whether the domestic economy is strong enough to keep growing modestly even as the global economy struggles. That disconnect has raised the value of the dollar, allowing consumers to purchase imports more cheaply, but has reduced demand for American exports.She also suggested, ever so gently, that investors were not behaving rationally, indicating that the markets might rebound. While global economic and financial conditions have taken a turn for the worse, \u201cwe have not seen shifts that seem significant enough to have driven the sharp moves that we have seen in markets,\u201d she said.The Fed is not ready to raise rates at the moment but, as Ms. Yellen noted, \u201cThere are a number of weeks before we meet again in March.\u201dMembers of both parties challenged Ms. Yellen\u2019s economic assessment \u2014 the Fed is a popular punching bag, particularly during a presidential campaign \u2014 but political imperatives muddled their arguments. Republicans said the economy was struggling and the Fed should do less; Democrats painted a sunny picture and said the Fed should do more. Several noted the high rate of unemployment among black Americans in urging the Fed to extend its campaign.Representative Maxine Waters of California, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, hailed the Fed\u2019s \u201cherculean efforts\u201d and the resulting \u201ctremendous progress,\u201d before warning against rate increases as \u201ca step that takes us further away from making sure that the needs of vulnerable populations are met.\u201dThe Republican argument is that the Fed is making things worse.\u201cIt\u2019s really disingenuous to say to the American people that these policies have contributed toward 4.9 percent unemployment,\u201d said Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina. He added, referring to the activists, \u201cI think that should be understood and absorbed by these wonderful people who have come, that the types of policies that have been enacted, been enforced, this last seven years, have worked against your interests.\u201dOne sign the economy is not doing so badly is that the sharpest questions at the hearing focused mostly on other issues. Republicans once again pressed Ms. Yellen to embrace legislation increasing the transparency of the Fed\u2019s decision making, as they have done at each of her previous appearances.The legislation would require the Fed to articulate a rule for setting interest rates and explain any deviations. Proponents claim such a rule would discourage the Fed from trying to do too much. Ms. Yellen has previously described the proposal as a \u201cgrave mistake,\u201d saying it would constrain the Fed from responding appropriately to unexpected economic developments.Members of both parties also criticized a new tool the Fed is using to raise its benchmark rate. It is paying large banks billions of dollars not to make loans at rates below the benchmark. Congress created the power in 2006 without any objections, but banks are less popular now.Ms. Yellen also struggled to answer questions about a growing trend among central banks around the world, which are experimenting with negative interest rates because they have exhausted their traditional tools for stimulating growth.Asked whether the Fed could impose such a policy, Ms. Yellen said she was not aware of any obstacles, but she cautioned that the Fed had not carefully explored the issues.Pressed repeatedly, she finally conceded, \u201cIt is something we will look at, we should look at, not because we think there is any reason to use it, but to know what potentially would be available.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in an economy where the standard task is sitting in front of a computer, lunch is less intuitive and far more optional.Now some 62 percent of professionals say they typically eat lunch at their desks, a phenomenon that social scientists have begun calling \u2018\u2018desktop dining.\u2019\u2019 Eating takes a back seat to meetings, catching up on to-dos or responding to email. Roughly half of American adults eat lunch alone. In research from the Hartman Group, many so-called millennial wage earners said they actually preferred eating solo. A quarter of those surveyed agreed with the statement \u2018\u2018I eat alone to multitask better.\u2019\u2019There is a possible health benefit to all of this: Our unaccompanied lunches are probably smaller. Studies on pigs, rats, puppies, chickens, gerbils and other animals dating back to the 1920s show a phenomenon researchers call \u2018\u2018social facilitation,\u2019\u2019 in which the presence of others makes an individual eat more. For years, scientists believed humans were different. Animals feed, they thought; humans dine. In subsequent research, it turned out that humans feed, too. Simply eating with one other person increases the average amount ingested by 44 percent. In fact, the more people present, the more people eat. One study showed that with seven or more, subjects ate 96 percent more than they would have alone.But with the clearly delineated lunch on the decline, workers end up snacking. In a study of 122 employees, people on average cached 476 calories\u2019 worth of food in their desks. One person squirreled away 3,000 calories, including Cheetos, candy bars and five cans of pop-top tuna fish. In addition to the personal food stashes, there are those areas in an office where food accumulates like driftwood \u2014 the leftover sandwiches from a catered lunch; the remains of a birthday cake; banana bread someone baked at home; the bottomless candy dish. When researchers interviewed administrative staff members at the University of California, Davis, one respondent called these common stockpiles \u2018\u2018food altars.\u2019\u2019Sometimes these collective food repositories become fraught, and in the case of shared workplace refrigerators, even hazardous. In a survey of more than 2,100 full-time professionals, nearly all had access to refrigerators. When asked about cleanliness, a full 40 percent were unaware of fridge cleaning or knew it to be rare or nonexistent. Navigating around a colleague\u2019s forgotten bag of slimy baby carrots might be gross, but the bigger danger in a fridge is the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Unlike other pathogens like E. coli, listeria can thrive at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the recommended temperature for refrigerators. Even in the Seattle law office of Bill Marler, the most prominent food-safety lawyer in the country, the fridge was, until recently, a mess of expired food, rotting salad and long-abandoned deli meat. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s embarrassing,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018Like an insurance salesman not having insurance.\u2019\u2019Beyond any health risks, the desk lunch detracts from our sense of the office as a collaborative, innovative, sociable space. It is hard to foster that feeling when workers eat single-serving yogurt alone, faces lit in the monochrome blue of their computer screens. Brian Wansink, a professor and the director of Cornell University\u2019s Food and Brand Lab, points out that desktop dining isn\u2019t even a sign of industriousness anymore; these days, a desk luncher is as likely as not to be scrolling through Facebook. Wansink and other researchers did a survey of fire-department captains and lieutenants in a major American city. They found significant positive correlations between work performance and eating and cooking as a team. Firehouses where firefighters ate together reported more cooperative behavior; they were better at their jobs.Advertisement"}

Officials have suggested that hailing Mr. Xi as a leader of such stature \u2014 one in the footsteps of Deng, who ruled China through its transformation after Mao\u2019s death \u2014 carries a warning not to question, let alone challenge, his authority as the government navigates turbulent changes.Mr. Xi has appeared frustrated by what he saw as foot-dragging and insubordination from local officials, said Mr. Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But he said that no evidence supported speculation that Mr. Xi faced concerted opposition from senior officials.On the contrary, Mr. Xi\u2019s far-reaching reorganization of the Chinese military in recent months showed that he remained dominant, despite worries over the slowing economy, Mr. Johnson said.\u201cI have always thought the game was about the 19th Party Congress, and I would say that this is the opening shot in the lead-up to that meeting,\u201d he said.

That was widely seen as reflecting Mr. Hu\u2019s position as a relatively weak leader, long overshadowed by Mr. Jiang, who governed through consensus that critics said bred deadlock and corruption.Since coming to power in November 2012, Mr. Xi and his allies have implicitly presented their task as cleaning up the mess left by Mr. Hu: corruption, excessive industrial investment, pollution, social rancor and inequality, and incipient opposition to one-party rule.\u201cHe\u2019s been reconfiguring the patterns of Chinese politics to strengthen his position step by step,\u201d Mr. Jin said. \u201cThe anticorruption campaign, taking control of law and order, reforming of the military, all have concentrated power,\u201d he said. \u201cThis \u2018core\u2019 expression is another step.\u201dAdam Wu contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nervousness About Global Banking Giants Intensifies", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byStocks & BondsAn unsettling trend has emerged from the heavy selling that sent global markets tumbling this year: Investors are getting nervous about the world\u2019s biggest banks.The concerns about the banks are clearly reflected in the stock markets, where shares in banking giants are plunging. But there are also ominous signs in markets that investors use to bet on the perceived creditworthiness of large financial firms.A crucial benchmark for the banking sector, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, was down more than 3 percent on Monday and had lost nearly 20 percent of its value this year.There were other signs of nervousness.Investors are again rushing into benchmark government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which falls as its price rises, declined to 1.75 percent on Monday; it yielded 2.27 percent at the end of last year. The price of gold is rising. The Vix, which measures investors\u2019 expectations of volatility and is known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, rose over 10 percent.But the plunge in bank stocks seemed to stir up the most concern.When investors sell bank shares or bet against the banks in credit markets, it can be a signal that a period of financial turbulence has entered a new, potentially more serious phase. It suggests that banks \u2014 meant to act as the gears of an economy, transmitting credit to firms and households \u2014 are becoming more vulnerable to the market volatility and any underlying economic weaknesses. In sluggish economic times, banks may suffer higher losses on some loans, while the current low interest rates make it hard for lenders to earn robust profits on other loans.Analysts noted that the declines in bank shares had occurred as other traditional indicators of fear flashed more brightly. \u201cThe fear trades are becoming more obvious \u2014 and one of those is dumping financial stocks,\u201d said James W. Paulsen of Wells Capital Management.It was not just bank stocks showing pain.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down by more than 2 percent for much of Monday but, after a late rally, the benchmark closed down 1.42 percent. It has lost over 9 percent of its value this year and is now 13 percent below the nominal high that it reached last year.The Nasdaq index, which contains many technology stocks, declined 1.82 percent. It is now 17.92 percent below the nominal high that it reached last year. A decline of 20 percent or more would put the Nasdaq in a bear market.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.1 percent, at 16,027.05.While many large technology companies have strong profits and sturdy balance sheets, their shares are often highly valued, making them vulnerable when markets sell-off. And some analysts think the fall in technology shares is a sign that the froth is finally coming out of the market, putting it close to a bottom. \u201cThis is reminiscent of the late stages of a correction rather than the early part of one,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. Correction is the Wall Street term for a market decline of 10 percent or more.Still, the recent plight of bank stocks does not bode well.On Monday, shares of Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s largest bank, plummeted nearly 10 percent in Frankfurt, while those in Standard Chartered, a British bank, fell nearly 6 percent, and stock in Citigroup declined more than 5 percent.Deutsche Bank and a handful of other European banks are contending with their own problems that could explain the depth of their recent declines. Banks issue debt to raise money for their loans and operations. In recent weeks, investors have paid a higher price to buy insurance against a bank defaulting on such debt. The cost of using so-called credit-default swaps to gain protection for five years on Deutsche Bank\u2019s debt has doubled since the start of this year, according to data from Markit.Outside of Europe, though, the moves in bank shares are hardly reassuring.Citigroup\u2019s shares, for instance, are down by more than a fourth so far this year. And its stock trades at nearly half of the bank\u2019s book value, which is a theoretical measure of the value that would be left for shareholders if the bank were liquidated. The discount to book value exists at other large banks and effectively indicates that investors have doubts about the banks\u2019 ability to earn a strong return on their capital.Still, Citigroup made over $17 billion in profits last year, has stable management and, looking at its balance sheet, possesses the financial strength to weather an economic slowdown.There is a good chance that investors have become too pessimistic about the big banks\u2019 prospects, and their stocks could bounce back if the wider funk in the market passes. Most banks, after all, are substantially stronger than they were in 2008. And, since then, the banks have managed to earn profits even as they have dealt with a barrage of government lawsuits as well as economic and financial turbulence in Europe and Asia.Still, the declines in bank shares may not indicate that banks are particularly fragile right now but that investors think they will struggle to earn solid profits in the future, at least in part because of ultralow interest rates around the world.Central banks have kept interest rates low to stimulate demand for loans. But loans with low interest rates are often less profitable for banks. As a result, banks may then lend less, which may then reduce the overall impact of low interest rates on the economy.Monday\u2019s trading illustrated the deep stress in the energy sector. Shares in Chesapeake Energy, a beleaguered oil producer, lost a third of their value on Monday. The trade publication Debtwire reported that Chesapeake had hired restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis, leading investors to speculate that Chesapeake was considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as the low price of oil weighs on the energy industry.Chesapeake put out a statement late Monday morning that Kirkland & Ellis had been one of its legal advisers since 2010 and was counseling the company in its financial restructuring efforts. But the oil driller took pains to note that it \u201ccurrently has no plans to pursue bankruptcy.\u201dMichael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If There Is a Recession in 2016, This Is How It Will Happen", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byEconomic TrendsBut after thinking about it some more and talking with some people on the pessimistic end of the spectrum, I think I have a handle on how the economy could end up in a substantially worse place by the end of the year.Here\u2019s that narrative.What we\u2019re dealing with isn\u2019t just a run-of-the-mill economic slowdown in emerging markets, but the reversal of a 15-year cycle in which capital has flowed into emerging markets year after year while debt grew. Now that\u2019s reversing, and we\u2019re seeing a version of Warren Buffett\u2019s maxim that \u201cyou only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.\u201dThis will put those countries\u2019 economies under pressure. Global investors will discover more poorly run companies and weak governmental structures than they had generally assumed existed during the emerging markets boom, when an influx of foreign money masked those problems.The steep drop in oil prices is both a cause and effect. For oil-producing countries (in the Middle East, certainly, but also the likes of Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria), falling oil prices mean a drop in revenue and a lot of stress on major oil companies. And the slowdown in economic activity across global emerging markets reduces demand for oil, creating a vicious cycle.That isn\u2019t the only vicious cycle at work here. The weakening of emerging economies causes their currencies to fall relative to the dollar. Now that should help their exporters, but in the current moment it can make the debt crisis worse. Every tick the Chinese renminbi, the Indonesian rupiah or the Brazilian real goes down against the dollar makes it harder for the countries\u2019 companies to repay their debts. Then you get further retrenchment.But our story of how the United States might fall into recession isn\u2019t done. Exports to these emerging economies are a small enough piece of overall American G.D.P. that it would take an all-out collapse to move the dial on United States growth. And the energy sector in the United States expanded a lot in the last few years, but oil and gas extraction still accounted for only 730,000 jobs in December, in an economy with 143 million of them.So in normal times, an emerging market panic, a drop in oil prices and a strengthening dollar shouldn\u2019t matter much for the United States. In 1998, for example, all of those things were happening, yet growth roared ahead in 1999.But if there\u2019s a recession in 2016, it will be because of two crucial differences in the economy.First, the starting point for the United States and other advanced economies was much stronger then. From 1996 to 1998, the United States economy grew an average of 4.3 percent a year; from 2013 to 2015 the rate was less than half that, 2.1 percent. A much smaller hit to growth would be more likely to put us in recessionary territory now than in the late 1990s.Second, the Federal Reserve is in a radically different spot than it was in the 1990s. The central bank\u2019s job is to act as a shock absorber for the economy to try to maintain growth without significant inflation.It was better positioned and more inclined to play that role in 1998. From September through November of 1998, the Fed cut its main target interest rate three-quarters of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent because it worried that tumult in financial markets during that summer would halt the United States expansion.Now, it\u2019s not clear that the Fed has the ability or the will to be a shock absorber for the economy in the same way. That same interest rate is now in the range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent, which means an interest-rate cut of the same amount would put the Fed in the uncharted territory of negative interest rates. Depositors end up paying the bank. That\u2019s already happened to the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.So the story of a 2016 United States recession is this: Tumult in emerging markets and the commodities sectors creates both real and psychological hits to an economy that is already growing sluggishly. Policy makers lack either the tools or the will, depending on your view, to take action to contain the damage. And so what should be relatively small hits to the economy are enough to suck the United States into a contraction.If you like, add the possibility that there is a major unforeseen shock out there that makes all of this worse. Think of it this way: The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks helped ensure that an economic slowdown set off by the popping of a technology bubble would become a recession. But the attacks alone probably wouldn\u2019t have led to a recession if they had happened in 1999.Your guess is as good as mine on the odds that this series of events will happen. (The jobs report on Friday could soothe such jitters or heighten them.) But this much is clear: When an economy is already vulnerable, as the United States looks to be in 2016, it takes less to tip it over the edge than when it is strong. Sorry, but not every economic story has a happy ending.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boko Haram Raid in Nigeria Kills at Least 65", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byKADUNA, Nigeria \u2014 It was a particularly brutal raid, the kind that had become rare in recent months. Dozens of homes were burned to the ground. Children were abducted and carried off into the bush. People seeking refuge under a familiar tree were blown up by a suicide bomber who had infiltrated their ranks.Boko Haram has marauded across northern Nigeria for years, killing thousands of civilians, burning entire villages and kidnapping hundreds of women and girls \u2014 crimes that came long before the group declared allegiance to the Islamic State last year.Nigeria and its neighbors have struck back, chasing the militants out of villages they had seized. The military campaign has been so effective, according to Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that he recently declared the group \u201ctechnically\u201d defeated. His key evidence: the military had reclaimed territory from fighters in northern Nigeria roughly the size of the state of Maryland.Even so, the group has launched attacks at a relentless pace across northern Nigeria and neighboring countries in recent weeks, including an assault in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State, in late December. But its recent attacks, while deadly, have been relatively simple, carried out by suicide bombers who often hide explosives under religious gowns or in bags of vegetables. Mr. Buhari\u2019s supporters cite the tactic as evidence that the group is grasping for relevance after being scattered by the military.Then, over the weekend, the group appeared to go back to its old playbook: storming a town with multiple fighters and leaving a path of destruction. Militants descended on Dalori, a small village just outside of Maiduguri, on Saturday evening, unleashing a torrent of gunfire and setting homes ablaze as suicide bombers attacked fleeing residents, according to witnesses and officials.And while government and military officials maintain that they have wrested control of territory from Boko Haram, a handful of people have been showing up in Maiduguri recently, saying their villages have been overtaken as well. Analysts warn that the war against Boko Haram may have shifted, but it is far from over.Residents point to painful reminders that the group is very much alive. The nearly 300 schoolgirls it abducted from the village of Chibok in 2014 are still missing, they note, and neither the government nor the military know where they are.This weekend in Dalori, witnesses said that fighters rampaged through the village for hours, and some residents complained that the authorities had not arrived fast enough to help fight the attackers.In a news release, military officials reassured residents \u201cof the commitment of the military to apprehend and deal with the perpetrators.\u201d Hours before the attack this weekend, the military announced several aerial bombings of the Sambisa Forest, where fighters are believed to be hiding.The challenge comes at a particularly bad time for Nigeria. The country faces mounting economic problems because of the falling price of oil, on which its economy is heavily reliant, and it will need to find a way to deal with major budget gaps.Separately, attacks on pipelines in the southern state of Bayelsa have unleashed thousands of barrels of oil into farmland and waterways. For years, the country has battled militants hoping to trade the threat of violence for shares in oil revenue.In Dalori, the militants arrived in cars and on motorbikes on Saturday night and began shooting indiscriminately, government officials said. Gunshots could be heard from as far away as residential housing for the University of Maiduguri, about two miles down the road. Some fighters were dressed in military uniforms, witnesses said.The militants set fire to as many as 300 homes in the village, burning alive some people who were inside. At least three children were killed, one local government official said.\u201cThis put the villagers and the neighborhood into pandemonium,\u201d according to a news release from Nigeria\u2019s National Emergency Management Agency, and they \u201cstarted running helter-skelter.\u201dMany residents took cover under a huge tree that was a usual evening spot for trading, officials said. Among those gathered were people from a nearby camp that served as a refuge for people who had fled their homes because of Boko Haram violence.As they waited for the mayhem to subside, a suicide bomber sneaked in among the crowd and detonated explosives, killing and injuring numerous people, the officials said.One man said his four children had been snatched up by fighters who fled with them into the bush.A member of the Civilian Joint Task Force, an anti-Boko Haram vigilante association in the area, said that the homes of the group\u2019s members had been attacked in Dalori but that members did not seem to have been singled out. The militants were merely interested in inflicting as much damage as possible.\u201cIt is the normal Boko Haram style of attack, where they come and tear down villages,\u201d said Abba Aji Kalli, the task force member. \u201cWhat they did here was to burn down what they wanted to burn, and took away what they wanted to take.\u201dThe attack added to the 2.5 million people who have been displaced from their homes across four countries because of violence from Boko Haram. The villagers who lost their homes have nowhere to go. The nearby camp that houses thousands of other displaced people is already full.\u201cThe entire village is burnt, and the people have nowhere to stay,\u201d said Abdullahi Umar, a spokesman for the Borno State Emergency Management Agency, adding that officials would somehow find accommodations for them. \u201cThe state government will also provide them with food. They have lost almost everything: their foodstuff, cattle and the rest.\u201dIliya Kure reported from Kaduna, and Dionne Searcey from Dakar, Senegal.

{"Headline": "Airlines Reap Record Profits, and Passengers Get Peanuts", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byHelped by falling oil prices, airlines are reporting record profits, but for many passengers this sudden bonanza has meant little more than extra bags of free peanuts and pretzels.The four biggest domestic carriers \u2014 American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines \u2014 together earned about $22 billion in profits last year, a stunning turnaround after a decade of losses, bankruptcies and cutbacks. A big reason for this is the plunging price of jet fuel, which now costs only a third of what it did just two years ago.But that windfall is only slowly finding its way down the aisles. Days after reporting record profits, for instance, two of the nation\u2019s biggest airlines brought back free snacks in coach.Airfares, however, have remained stubbornly high.At the same time, demand is rising, meaning flights are full and airlines have few incentives to discount fares.\u201cThis is like a perfect storm for the airlines right now, and it could keep going on for the next year,\u201d Mr. Seaney said. \u201cGiving free peanuts and chips is a way to address the issue that consumers think the airlines have been nickel-and-diming them.\u201dFor now, airline executives have been clear about their priorities: to show improvements in their financial performance.This means emphasizing acceptable returns on invested capital by raising dividends, buying back more shares and paying down debt. It does not mean using the savings from fuel costs to finance the type of market share battle that proved so damaging before the industry began to consolidate.What managers want to avoid is the kind of price war that devastated the airlines\u2019 economic well-being in the decades after the industry\u2019s deregulation in the late 1970s. While this period of unfettered competition pushed down ticket prices and benefited consumers, it proved unsustainable.When the Great Recession hit, airline executives reduced the number of flights and successfully argued for the industry to consolidate. Successive mergers between Delta and Northwest Airlines, United and Continental, Southwest and AirTran Airways, and American and US Airways left four big domestic airlines in control of 80 percent of all seat capacity.\u201cThis is a period of good health like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Ed Bastian, Delta\u2019s president, who will become chief executive in May. \u201cWe will want to stay disciplined to make sure we don\u2019t repeat the errors of the past.\u201dAs a result, airlines have placed extraordinary emphasis on what industry insiders call \u201ccapacity discipline\u201d \u2014 not adding seats faster than demand. The Justice Department, though, is investigating whether this industry practice amounts to possible collusion among the big airlines.In addition, airlines are finding more creative ways to wring more money from passengers, including charging for aisle and window seats, shrinking legroom to pack in more seats on each plane, and offering priority boarding for a fee.\u201cThey simply folded them into the fares,\u201d Mr. Hobica said. \u201cThey call them carrier surcharges and fees. They just don\u2019t call them fuel surcharges.\u201d\u201cFor the past several years, I\u2019ve just had the genuine feeling that we\u2019re all being overcharged,\u201d Mr. Perosi said. \u201cMost of the time, all the extra add-on fees are more expensive than the actual airfare.\u201dRepresentatives from the major airlines insist that the extra charges are part of the cost of doing business and are not tied just to the cost of fuel.Gasoline prices and home heating bills have not fallen as fast as oil prices, but those declines have still been much more substantial than the drop in airfares.Airlines maintain that consumers are benefiting from their improved financial performance, and that airfares are shrinking, albeit slightly. Average ticket prices fell 3 percent to $385 in the second quarter last year, the most recent period for which figures are available, according to the Department of Transportation. Airlines have reported that the trend has since continued.Carriers also point out that they are improving their services by buying new planes, installing larger overhead bins, upgrading their entertainment systems and refurbishing airport lounges \u2014 all improvements that customers can see. At the same time, rank-and-file employees are getting bonuses, and new labor agreements show gains that were unimaginable just a few years ago.If there is any crack in the airlines\u2019 fare structure, it is, not surprisingly, in markets where upstart carriers have provided vigorous competition.Low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air have passed the savings from lower jet fuel prices on to consumers by offering discounted tickets \u2014 including $80 round-trip fares on dozens of routes like Chicago to Atlanta, and Dallas to San Diego \u2014 prompting a response from the major airlines.American said last October that it would offer \u201cno frills\u201d fares on routes where it competes with Spirit. The tactic resembles Delta\u2019s \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares, which are nonrefundable and do not allow for any changes or even seat selection.\u201cThe big airlines are sending a message: \u2018If you do this to us, we will cause you pain,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Hobica said. \u201cI don\u2019t think American is happy to fly from Dallas to San Francisco for $40 one-way, but it will do it to show it won\u2019t be bullied around by some upstart.\u201dBut such bargains have not trickled down to Jonathan Aberman, a venture capitalist in Washington who flies often. He said he had seen \u201cabsolutely no change\u201d in the cost of his airline tickets in recent years.Indeed, Delta last month successfully pushed through a $6 fare increase \u2014 which was quickly matched by the other major carriers \u2014 although it was lower than previous increases of $10 or more by other carriers.\u201cIt\u2019s very straightforward,\u201d Mr. Aberman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the industry to monopolize. As a result, they have enormous pricing power.\u201dMartha C. White contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Today\u2019s Republicans Don\u2019t Get About Reagan", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHE supported the biggest amnesty bill in history for illegal immigrants, advocated gun control, used Keynesian stimulus to jump-start the economy, favored personal diplomacy even with the country\u2019s sworn enemies and instituted tax increases in six of the eight years of his presidency.He was Ronald Reagan.The core beliefs that got Reagan elected and re-elected were conservative: lower taxes, smaller government and a stronger, more assertive military. But Reagan was also a pragmatist, willing to compromise, able to improvise in pursuit of his goals and, most of all, eager to expand his party\u2019s appeal.The current field of Republican presidential candidates invokes Reagan as a patron saint, but the characteristics that made him a successful politician seem lost on them. Instead, they\u2019ve turned his party into a swamp of nativism, ideological extremism and pessimism about the country\u2019s future, in direct opposition to Reagan\u2019s example. And they\u2019ve transformed primary season into a reality show of insults, betrayals and open feuds, defying the so-called 11th Commandment that Reagan espoused: Thou shall not speak ill of any fellow Republican.Once in office, Reagan said that anytime he could get 70 percent of what he wanted from a legislature, he\u2019d take it. Today\u2019s congressional Republicans won\u2019t settle even for 99 percent: Their mentality has shifted away from having policies and governing and toward a kind of bitter-end obstructionism.In the early days of the presidency of Bill Clinton, congressional Republicans essentially went on strike, treating any legislative accomplishment as a Republican defeat, but they came to the table for a budget deal in 1997. With President Obama, they have largely refused to accept the basic legitimacy of a Democratic president. The tactical obstinacy of the 1990s has curdled into the belief that any compromise constitutes betrayal, a dynamic now playing out in the primaries.The issue that shows the divide most sharply between Reagan and the current crop of presidential hopefuls is immigration. In the past, Republican candidates have been justly criticized for deploying racially coded messages around crime and welfare. But in the main, the party has for decades embraced Reagan\u2019s notion of American identity based on immigration, assimilation and economic opportunity. Every Republican presidential nominee since Reagan has been a moderate on immigration, and has wanted to bring Latinos into the Republican fold.How did the inclusive, forward-looking Republican Party of Reagan become the crass, xenophobic party of Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz?The rise of super PACs and the right-wing media has disempowered the party\u2019s gatekeepers, while wage stagnation has widened the opening for populist demagogy. This year\u2019s primary candidates have learned the lesson not only that exploiting prejudice around immigration and terrorism works politically, but so, too, does defying the party\u2019s elders and its official apparatus. Thus Mr. Trump thrives and the establishment favorite, Jeb Bush, is already out.A more surprising reason for the shift? Money. In economic terms, Republican politicians see increasing returns to extremism. The Citizens United decision has raised the potential financial stakes of presidential elections for media companies, political professionals and candidates alike. The presidential campaign of 2016 will most likely cost upward of $5 billion, more than 10 times the one that elected Reagan in 1980.A lot of people get rich in a $5 billion industry, and some are politicians. Mr. Trump is not the only contender to make the calculation that running for president is win-win, burnishing \u201cbrand\u201d value even for the losers. Ben Carson \u2014 yes, still in the race \u2014 seems more interested in selling books than in attaining higher office. Marco Rubio has already enjoyed years of patronage from a billionaire auto dealer in Florida.The examples of Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee underscore the point that a no-hope presidential run has more upside than downside. A career as a right-wing celebrity \u2014 a stint on Fox News, speaking fees, book advances \u2014 is more profitable than one in the Senate. These incentives have helped to shift the Republican Party from a party of opportunity to a party of opportunists.The loser could be the party itself. Unless it repudiates the inflammatory rhetoric of the primary, it will lose Reagan\u2019s claim to the center and become more like one of Europe\u2019s chauvinistic right-wing parties. In the 1980s, it was said that the Democrats looked for heretics while the Republicans looked for converts. To watch the spectacle in the 2016 primaries is to see those tendencies reversed.Jacob Weisberg is chairman of the Slate Group and the author of the Ronald Reagan volume in the American Presidents series.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nikkei Plummets in Japan on Yen Strength", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byThe benchmark Nikkei 225 average fell as much as 5.4 percent before closing 4.8 percent lower as investors continued their flight from relatively risky stocks and into bonds and other assets seen as havens. The shift has rattled markets around the world, but Japan is particularly vulnerable because of a jump in the value of the yen. A stronger currency hurts profits at companies like Toyota and Hitachi, which earn much of their income abroad.The yen climbed as high as 110.9 to the dollar Friday before settling back to about 112 in late-afternoon trading. The currency\u2019s value has increased about 10 percent since its most recent low in December.Investors\u2019 embrace of the yen has been little affected by the Bank of Japan\u2019s introducing negative interest rates two weeks ago. The move pushed the yield on 10-year government bonds into negative territory this week and should in theory make holding yen less attractive. But investors appear to believe that the alternatives are worse.The Nikkei more than doubled between late 2012 and the middle of last year, buoyed by an improving global economy and the loose monetary policy of the central bank. Under Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor appointed in early 2013, the bank has been flooding financial markets with cash by buying large amounts of government bonds. The policy led to a sharp devaluation of the yen, but its weakening effect on the currency appears to be waning.The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, sought to calm the market turbulence on Friday.\u201cThe flight from risk is spreading to financial markets around the world, but the Japanese economy is in very solid shape, so investors\u2019 psychology is too pessimistic,\u201d he told reporters after a regularly scheduled Cabinet meeting.He added that \u201cabrupt exchange rate movements are undesirable\u201d \u2014 a phrase often used by the Japanese authorities to signal displeasure with the yen\u2019s direction, which has sometimes been followed by actual financial intervention to reverse its course.Advertisement"}

And no, this isn\u2019t a column or even a formal blog post; it\u2019s simply an assortment of my tweets during the debate. Think of it as journalism on the fly \u2014 here goes!Hillary Clinton opens with a statement that strikes me as a bit more populist than usual\u2013presumably Sanders\u2019 influence. #DemDebateClinton also smacks Sanders by adding: \u201cI\u2019m not making promises that I cannot keep.\u201d She says his numbers don\u2019t add up.Good for Sanders for acknowledging that the backdrop is that he and Clinton agree on a great deal. #DemDebateAs Clinton & Sanders feud over who is more progressive, worth remembering that only 31 percent of Americans identify as liberal.This #DemDebate about labels\u2013\u201cI\u2019m more progressive than you!\u201d\u2013is silly. It\u2019s jostling over ideological purity. Let\u2019s talk about policies.But Clinton can\u2019t pounce on Sanders\u2019 lack of accomplishments because when she was in the Senate she didn\u2019t get much passed either.Sanders is right that Wall St donations helped win Clinton admin financial liberalization. It wasn\u2019t bribes, but it bought access.Of course it was a mistake for Clinton to take $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs in one year. Of course.Er, when an industry pays a lot of money to a candidate, it\u2019s an investment. And it\u2019s seeking a return on that investment.Hillary Clinton is now for ending the carried interest loophole for hedge funds & private equity.  But she didn\u2019t try when she was senator.Wow! Sanders goes way too far when he says that the business model of Wall Street is fraud. Banking is crucial for our economy. #DemDebateYes, Wall Street has gotten away with too much. But underwriting stocks and bonds, corporate lending\u2013that is essential business, not fraud.Having lived in a Communist country, I assure you: The only thing worse than a country with  bankers is one without them.Sanders is pretty incoherent on foreign policy. But to his credit he was right on what counted most, the Iraq war, and Clinton was wrong.A bit silly to be debating whether we should normalize relations with Iran, when Iran isn\u2019t willing to normalize relations with us.Tweeps are making fun of Sanders for saying North Korea is greatest threat. But he has a point: Kim Jong Un has nukes and is unpredictable.I might have nicer things to say about North Korea if it would give me another visa. Just in case you\u2019re reading this, Kim Jong Un!A Sanders vulnerability: He didn\u2019t accomplish much in 25 years in Congress: 3 laws, of which 2 renamed post offices https://t.co/P4rVSlwJcGAnyone who remembers McGovern in 1972 has trouble with Sanders\u2019 electability. It\u2019s true that he has won hearts in Vermont. But\u2026One problem for Sanders on electability: 50 percent say they will never support a socialist. That\u2019s quite an obstacle in November.Clinton is too glib on email issue. Big problem is the time she told an aide to send material by non-secure means https://t.co/iozrxQwg6QSanders doesn\u2019t have the killer instinct\u2013refusing to attack Clinton on emails\u2013which is really very refreshing.Next shoe to drop on emails, I\u2019m guessing, will be the revelation that Chinese & Russians were snooping on Clinton\u2019s server.I bet Clinton is thinking of the general election when she backs the death penalty: three-fifths of Americans support it.Good comments on Flint. But lead poisoning is a national crisis, not just a Flint crisis, affecting 535,000 US children.Here\u2019s a piece I did on lead poisoning in inner-city Baltimore, where more kids are lead-poisoned than in Flint https://t.co/rNk9JW7ncEYes! Lead poisoning is a national tragedy. Flint should galvanize us to address this everywhere, not just in Flint. https://t.co/bNTThq1tSnClinton says donors didn\u2019t affect her positions. Her stance on a bankruptcy law opposed by banks may be an exception https://t.co/850wPpmY8EBernie Sanders always comes across as a very decent guy.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Last Budget, and Last Budget Battle With Congress", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byThe deficit would increase in this fiscal year to $616 billion from $438 billion last year, the budget projects, in part because of tax cuts that Mr. Obama and Congress agreed in December to make permanent. That would make this year\u2019s shortfall equal to 3.3 percent of the economy\u2019s output, or gross domestic product, up from 2.5 percent and exceeding the 3 percent threshold that economists consider sustainable for a growing economy.Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed 10-year savings \u2014 some spending cuts, but primarily almost $3 trillion in higher taxes from wealthy individuals and some businesses, including a $10-a-barrel fee on crude oil \u2014 would push deficits down again for a couple years and offset costs of the president\u2019s proposed initiatives.Then deficits would begin increasing again with the retirement and health costs of aging Americans. The administration says annual deficits would remain below 3 percent of the gross domestic product through the decade to 2026. The accumulated debt held by the public would grow from $14 trillion currently to $21.3 trillion in that time, but measured against a growing economy, the debt would be stable at about 75 percent of gross domestic product.While Mr. Obama has achieved little to restrain the growth of the entitlement programs that many consider unsustainable, deficits would not return to levels exceeding $1 trillion, and nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic product, like the deficit he inherited in 2009, his budget projects.That prompted the legacy-minded president to take something of a victory lap in his budget\u2019s opening message. Striking an optimistic tone that contrasted sharply with the doomsday talk from Republican presidential candidates and congressional Republicans, he wrote, \u201cTogether, we have brought America back.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the past seven years on our economy,\u201d he later said at the White House. \u201cUnemployment is down. Deficits are down. Gas prices are down. Job creation, wages, the rate of Americans with health coverage are all up.\u201d\u201cAmerica is as strongly positioned as any country on earth to take advantage of the opportunities of the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Obama added.Republicans disagreed.\u201cThis budget joins his others by placing America on a fiscal path that is unsustainable and threatens our long-term economic growth,\u201d said Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.Mr. Enzi and the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, have said they will not invite Mr. Obama\u2019s budget director, Shaun Donovan, to testify before their panels, That is a break with a tradition dating to the start of the modern budget process in 1975 and a snub that captures the hostility that Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda faces.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, dismissed the president\u2019s budget as \u201ca progressive manual for growing the federal government at the expense of hard-working Americans,\u201d noting that the oil tax alone could add 24 cents a gallon to gasoline prices. Mr. Obama proposed the tax to pay for more than $300 billion in infrastructure improvements over 10 years.The president said he had spoken to Mr. Ryan about the cybersecurity initiative, which is the centerpiece among new proposals that could garner bipartisan support, administration officials say, despite Republicans\u2019 condemnation of the budget as a whole. \u201cThis is not an ideological issue,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The $19 billion cybersecurity request reflects a 35 percent increase above current spending. Part of that, a $3.1 billion proposal to overhaul the government\u2019s computer systems, was prompted by a huge embarrassment: the Chinese theft of security records on 22 million Americans from the system run by the Office of Personnel Management.The discovery prompted a major review of the government\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d computer systems that concluded, as numerous government-sponsored reports had warned for years, that the systems were simply not designed to withstand modern cyberattacks.On Tuesday, Mr. Obama said the problem was so severe that some government systems, including for Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service, were running on software systems dating to when he was a child in the 1960s.As for the rest of the $1.2 trillion in discretionary spending in the budget, about half would go to domestic programs and half to the military.To pay for his initiatives and reduce deficits, Mr. Obama added to a raft of tax proposals he has made for years to close loopholes and limit breaks for the wealthy and some businesses. Cigarette taxes would go up to finance universal prekindergarten, and other new revenues would go toward initiatives including worker retirement savings options, wage insurance, college assistance and an expanded earned-income tax credit for childless workers \u2014 an idea Mr. Ryan has proposed.Some administration officials said the nearly $3 trillion in tax increases over 10 years would achieve rough parity in deficit reduction efforts after five years in which Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans have cut $4 trillion in spending to reduce deficits.Republicans rebuffed the proposed tax increases, as they have in the past. Yet a few of Mr. Obama\u2019s revenue ideas in the past ultimately have been embraced in bipartisan budget deals to offset the costs of initiatives popular in both parties.Administration officials pointed to a number of initiatives that could draw support from some Republicans, especially senators vulnerable in this election year. Such initiatives include increased spending to treat people addicted to opioids and heroin, cancer research, efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system, and stepped-up fighting against the Islamic State.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of the budget that would be set aside for discretionary spending. It would be $1.2 trillion not $1.2 billion. The article also misstated the amount of the deficit last year. It was $438 billion, not $503 billion. The error was repeated in a summary of the story on the homepage.David E. Sanger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The government, MetLife says, initially said it would consider that probability when examining the risks in the firm.

{"Headline": "Realistic Growth Prospects", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "God, I can\u2019t wait for the primary to be over, one way or the other. But it does seem to me that I should talk a bit about what a progressive reasonably can say about prospects for economic growth under a better policy regime. There are, I would argue, three numbers that are relevant. First, there\u2019s the rate of growth of the economy\u2019s supply-side potential \u2014 the rate it can grow at a constant rate of unemployment. Second, there\u2019s the size of the output gap \u2014 the amount of extra output we could gain by getting up to full employment. Third, there\u2019s the extent to which we can accelerate the rate of growth of potential.On the first number, look at the chart: over the past five years US growth has fluctuated around 2 percent, while unemployment \u2014 both the conventional number and the broader U6 number \u2014 has gradually declined. This strongly suggests potential growth under 2 percent. Why so slow? Productivity has been sluggish, and the working-age population is growing much more slowly than it used to as baby boomers hit retirement age.What about the output gap? Wage growth is still weak and inflation fairly low, suggesting that unemployment can go significantly lower from here \u2014 maybe down to the 4 percent of the late 1990s, possibly even lower. The standard Okun\u2019s Law relationship would say that bringing unemployment down another percentage point would add 2 percent to real GDP. Maybe, maybe we could argue for an extra-large pool of discouraged workers that raises this to 3. That\u2019s a lot of foregone output in an absolute sense.However, it doesn\u2019t make a huge difference when we\u2019re talking about longer-term growth prospects. Closing a 3-point output gap over 10 years raises the 10-year growth rate by only 0.3 percent. 2016 isn\u2019t like 1933, when the output gap was probably around 30 percent, making a huge growth rate over the next decade possible when wartime mobilization finally brought full employment and then some.Finally, how much can we reasonably project for a rise in potential growth? A big increase in infrastructure investment would certainly help. Other progressive priorities \u2014 while good things! \u2014 would be at best a mixed bag in terms of their effect on measured GDP. For example, guaranteed pr-K and childcare might free more parents to stay in the paid workforce; on the other hand, better benefits would (and should) free some people to cut hours to focus on their families. And nobody knows the secret of raising productivity growth. In general, any economist talking about potential growth should start from a position of modesty: nothing in what we know or have experienced in the past justifies making big promises. By all means we should try everything we can think of \u2014 but our policies should make sense even if it turns out that the effects on long-run growth are modest.What I would say is that it\u2019s unreasonable to assume growth over the next 10 years more than a fraction of a percentage point above 2 percent \u2014 say 2.5 percent at the upper end. Maybe we can do better, but we shouldn\u2019t count on it.And let me say that the great thing about a progressive agenda is that it doesn\u2019t require big growth promises to make it work, because the elements of that agenda are good things in their own right. Conservatives need to promise miracles to justify policies whose direct effect is to comfort the comfortable (cutting taxes on the rich) and afflict the afflicted (slashing social insurance); progressives only need to defend themselves against the charge that doing good will somehow kill economic growth. It won\u2019t, and that should be enough.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Promise of Artificial Intelligence Unfolds in Small Steps", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byWhen IBM\u2019s Watson computer triumphed over human champions in the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d it was a stunning achievement that suggested limitless horizons for artificial intelligence.Soon after, IBM\u2019s leaders moved to convert Watson from a celebrated science project into a moneymaking business, starting with health care.Yet the next few years after its game show win proved humbling for Watson. Today, IBM executives candidly admit that medicine proved far more difficult than they anticipated. Costs and frustration mounted on Watson\u2019s early projects. They were scaled back, refocused and occasionally shelved.IBM\u2019s early struggles with Watson point to the sobering fact that commercializing new technology, however promising, typically comes in short steps rather than giant leaps.Despite IBM\u2019s own challenges, Watson\u2019s TV victory \u2014 five years ago this month \u2014 has helped fuel interest in A.I. from the public and the rest of the tech industry. Venture capital investors have poured money into A.I. start-ups, and large corporations like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple have been buying fledgling A.I. companies. That investment reached $8.5 billion last year, more than three and a half times the level in 2010, according to Quid, a data analysis firm.And software engineers with A.I. skills are treated like star athletes, prompting bidding wars for their services.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely at a peak of excitement now,\u201d said Jerry Kaplan, a computer scientist, entrepreneur and author, who was a co-founder of a long-forgotten A.I. start-up in the 1980s. \u201cExpectations are way ahead of reality.\u201dThe term A.I. has long been a staple of science fiction \u2014 as machines that think for themselves and help humankind or as ungrateful creations that try to wipe us out. Or so the thinking at the movies goes.The reality, however, is a little less dramatic. The automated voice on your smartphone that tries to answer your questions? That\u2019s a type of A.I. So are features of Google\u2019s search engine. The technology is also being applied to complex business problems like finding trends in cancer research.The field of artificial intelligence goes back to the beginning of the computer age and it has rolled through cycles of optimism and disillusion ever since, encouraged by a few movie robots and one very successful game show contestant.The history of tech tells A.I. backers to hang in there. Silicon Valley veterans argue that people routinely overestimate what can be done with new technology in three years, yet underestimate what can be done in 10 years.Predictions made in the \u201990s about how the new World Wide Web would shake the foundations of the media, advertising and retailing industries did prove to be true, for example. But it happened a decade later, years after the dot-com bust.Today\u2019s A.I., even optimists say, is early in that cycle.\u201cI think future generations are going to look back on the A.I. revolution and compare its impact to the steam engine or electricity,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cBut, of course, it is going to take decades for this technology to really come to fruition.\u201dThere are reasons for enthusiasm. Computers continue to get cheaper even as they get more powerful, making it easier than ever to crunch vast amounts of data in an instant. Also, sensors, smartphones and other tech devices are all over the place, feeding more and more information into computers that are learning more and more about us.Just in the last year or two, researchers have made rapid gains using a machine-learning technique called deep learning to improve the performance of software that recognizes images, translates languages and understands speech. That work has been done at start-ups and at big companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, as well as at universities and private research centers like the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\u201cThere\u2019s been surprising progress in the problems of perception, seeing, hearing and language,\u201d said Peter Lee, corporate vice president for Microsoft Research.At Enlitic, a start-up in San Francisco, Jeremy Howard, the founder and chief executive, believes that A.I. can transform the huge industry of health care, saving lives and money \u2014 an ambition similar to IBM\u2019s. \u201cBut that\u2019s a 25-year project,\u201d he said.Enlitic is concentrating first on radiology. Medical images are nearly all in digital form, Mr. Howard notes, and the tireless scanning for telltale signs of abnormal tissue is a task for which deep-learning image recognition technology is well suited.Enlitic has tested its software against a database of 6,000 lung cancer diagnoses, both positive and negative, made by professional radiologists. In research soon to be published, its algorithm was 50 percent more accurate than human radiologists, Enlitic said.\u201cYou have to take technology that works and apply it to a known problem,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cInnovation alone is a mistake.\u201dNo company has made as big or as broad a bid to commercialize its A.I. technology as IBM has with Watson. It set up Watson as its own business in 2014, and invested billions to accelerate the development and adoption of the technology, including buying several companies. The Watson unit now has 7,000 employees.The Watson technology has been totally revamped. In its \u201cJeopardy!\u201d days, Watson was a room-size computer. Today, it is so-called cloud software, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers. The Watson software itself has been carved up into dozens of separate A.I. components including a language classifier, text-to-speech translation and image recognition.IBM is trying to position Watson as the equivalent of an A.I. operating system, a software platform others use to build applications. Nearly 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software. IBM now has more than 500 industry partners, from big companies to start-ups, in industries including health care, financial services, retailing, consumer products and legal services.At IBM, Watson\u2019s early struggles in health care are viewed as a learning experience. The IBM teams, the executives say, underestimated the difficulty of grappling with messy data like faxes and handwritten notes and failed to understand how physicians make decisions.\u201cThere were a lot of challenges with the early customers,\u201d said John Kelly, the senior vice president who oversees Watson, adding that the business was \u201ctaking off\u201d now.IBM does not break out financial results for Watson. It describes the business as \u201clarge and growing,\u201d contributing to the company\u2019s $18 billion a year in revenue from business analytics.At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Watson technology is one ingredient in an automated expert adviser for cancer care. The University of Texas health system is also using Watson in software to help diabetes patients and caregivers manage the disease, in a project that is expected to be introduced by the end of this year.\u201cIt was a lot harder than we thought,\u201d said Dr. Lynda Chin, the chief innovation officer for the university health system. \u201cBut our experience has convinced me that we can build an A.I. engine that improves care.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 14 Years at Odds, Argentina Aims to Settle Debt With Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byAfter a bitter face-off for more than a decade between Argentina and a group of disgruntled New York hedge funds, both sides have come to the negotiating table with fresh hopes of a resolution.But the dispute, which has left Argentina largely cut off from international markets, still promised a few twists as a new round of talks took place this week in Manhattan.On Tuesday, Argentina struck a deal to pay $1.35 billion to a group of Italian investors whose bonds the country defaulted on in 2001, according to news reports.The deal is the first settlement with so-called holdout creditors who have not\u00a0participated in earlier restructurings over debt from nearly 15 years ago. But Argentina has yet to come to an agreement with the New York hedge funds \u2014 holdouts led by the billionaire Paul E. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management.A stalemate involving the creditors and Argentina\u2019s last president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, led the country to default on its debt again in 2014. The new administration of President Mauricio Macri has indicated that it wants to resolve the debt as part of a bigger move to reform Argentina\u2019s economy.Luis Caputo, the newly appointed finance secretary, and other senior government representatives met this week with principals at the hedge funds \u2014 including Mr. Elliott\u2019s NML Capital unit, Aurelius Capital, Montreux Partners, Dart Management and Davidson Kempner \u2014 in Manhattan, according to a court-appointed arbiter Daniel A. Pollack. The group is seeking a resolution for claims totaling around $9 billion, he added.In dispute is how much Argentina should pay in interest.At a news conference in Buenos Aires announcing the deal with Italian bondholders, Argentina\u2019s economic minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, touched on the question of interest payments. \u201cWe have said that we will respect the bond principal and that we are going to be firm in negotiating the interest, and in this particular agreement we have achieved just that.\u201dBut, Mr. Prat-Gay added, \u201cThe difficulty that we have right now is that some bondholders want to be paid an interest rate that, under any type of judicial criteria, is unacceptable.\u201dThe battle between Argentina and its holdout creditors stems from 2001, when the country defaulted on billions of dollars in debt. Argentina offered to exchange the bonds it defaulted on for new bonds worth significantly less, a move that holdouts rejected. NML Capital sued Argentina seeking full repayment \u2014 principal and interest \u2014 and a Manhattan district court judge ruled that whenever Argentina paid one group of bondholders, it would also have to pay the holdouts.This ruling could complicate Argentina\u2019s deal with Italian holdout creditors. As part of the deal reported on Tuesday, Argentina will pay 150 percent of the original $900 million that the Italian bondholders hold from Argentine debt issued more than a decade ago. These details were reported by Bloomberg and Reuters, citing Task Force Argentina, the representative for the bondholders.There are other issues that stand to complicate negotiations. Mr. Caputo is expected to publicly announce a proposal for the New York hedge funds this week. But these holdouts have requested that Argentina sign a nondisclosure agreement promising not to discuss the negotiations publicly.Under President Macri, who was sworn in as president in December, the government has already taken steps to reform the economy, removing capital controls on its currency, the peso.

{"Headline": "A God of the Bullring Made Human", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 It was not long after the first trumpets on Sunday that Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s found himself in familiar territory: inches from the vicious horns of a fighting bull, so close they nearly brushed up against the pink silk of his traje de luces, or suit of lights.Careful not to twitch a muscle, which could have been a trigger for the bull to attack him, Tom\u00e1s stood firm in this dangerous position and alone at the center of the Plaza M\u00e9xico, the biggest bullring in the world. Tom\u00e1s\u2019s cultish followers are called Tomasistas, and the bullring was filled with more than 45,000 spectators, the largest draw for a matador in recent memory.All of them were eager to witness the Great One before he decided to retire or before another horn wound ended his career for him.Tom\u00e1s, 40, was not like other matadors. He was the embodiment of mystery \u2014 in and out of the ring. For years, he has refused to give interviews or to appear on television. You had to see him live to see him at all, and he performed so infrequently, usually once or twice a year, that tickets sold out within hours.His mastery, though, was not only in his marketing. Tom\u00e1s\u2019s performances were savage ballets, a blend of elegance, fearlessness, timing and sacrifice. He seemed determined to pass bulls ever closer to his body, pushing the boundaries of how close a man could get.By overcoming death, Tom\u00e1s represented a kind of immortality, and now here he was, swinging the red muleta behind his back, the red furls of the wool cloth slicing through air heavy with cigar smoke as the 1,150-pound Bellotero, his first bull of the afternoon, gazed at his tiny waist. Finally, Tom\u00e1s made a pass, and the crowd exploded.Ol\u00e9!Then another pass.Ol\u00e9!Then he got too close. A horn caught the inside of Tom\u00e1s\u2019s leg. He crashed to the sand, and the crowd shrieked as the bull\u2019s horns tore away at the back of his thighs.As a teenager in a suburb of Madrid, where the bullfighting schools are perhaps the most competitive in Spain, Tom\u00e1s struggled to attract attention from the bullring promoters, managers and financiers who bankroll young matadors. He moved to Mexico to attract attention and perfected a style of bullfighting so dangerous he has nearly been killed.In 2010, Tom\u00e1s had just finished an effortless natural, or left-handed pass, in Aguascalientes, Mexico, when a bull plunged his horn into Tom\u00e1s\u2019s thigh, punctured the femoral artery and drained much of the blood from his body. For a while, it was unclear whether Tom\u00e1s would survive.\u201cFor me, the bull is like a god,\u201d Barrera said. \u201cThe wild bull has a lot of values the human being admires: to be fierce, to be impetuous, to have a breed, to have self-esteem, to fight for what you want, to fight for your life. That\u2019s why you consider him a god, and why in many cultures he has been considered a god.\u201dBullfighting is more religion than sport, more sacrifice than killing, a ritual left from the ancient world. Among the pharaohs of Egypt, the wandering tribes of the Levant, the Greek and Cretan amphitheaters, the bulls of the ancient world were deities.\u201cIn the eyes of these people, the bull had become a symbol of the all-powerful and the all-fertile,\u201d Jack Randolph Conrad wrote in \u201cThe Horn and the Sword,\u2019\u2019 an anthropological history of the human-bull relationship. Bulls represented the spirit of immortality, Conrad wrote, and were worshiped in elaborate ways.In ancient Egypt, women appeared naked in front of bulls to absorb their fertile powers, and Roman soldiers bathed in bull blood and feasted on bull testicles to obtain the immortal spirit. The bulls were sacrificed in elaborate rituals by taurine priests to bestow their godly powers to the public, and the modern bullfight can be viewed as a distant, commercialized relative of these ancient sacrifices.\u201cIt all comes back to sacrifice,\u201d Josephs said. \u201cYou know, the matadors are really the only high priests from the pagan days we have left.\u201dHe then placed the sword cleanly, and earned an ear, or trophy, though the audience was clamoring for two ears, an honor akin to a triumph that would allow him to be carried from the plaza on shoulders.\u201cHe gives me the entire range of emotions,\u201d Pedro P\u00e9rez, a Tomasista, said as Tom\u00e1s made his way back to the passageway around the ring, his face covered with dirt. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to be happy or sad, cheer or cry. You never know what will happen next.\u201dP\u00e9rez had arrived early from Tlaxcala, another state, and had rarely seen the streets outside the bullring so packed. Vendors had set out their grills and paella pans, and restaurant tables were filled with aficionados wearing sombreros and ascots and feasting on specialties like shrimp tacos doused in cheese sauce and washing it all down with cold micheladas, beer cocktails laced with pepper flakes and spiked with clam juice.Oddly, it was hard to find any animal rights activists, who have developed a presence in Mexico City, often shouting through their bullhorns that something as cruel as the bullfight should be abolished in places that still hold them: the south of France; Spain, outside of Barcelona; Portugal; Peru; Mexico; Colombia; Ecuador; Guatemala; and Venezuela.The bullfight here, featuring Tom\u00e1s and Joselito Adame, a Mexican matador, was the biggest of the winter season, if not the coming year. Before the gates opened, front-row seats were being resold on websites for nearly $8,000 each.Bullfighting may have taken a financial beating in recent years \u2014 from protests, prohibitions, the struggles of the Spanish economy \u2014 but Tom\u00e1s has been considered a kind of savior amid the dwindling spectacle, a lone figure who, through his bravery and art, can still inspire a new generation of enthusiasts.But inside the stadium, as the sun fell and the house lights came on, Tom\u00e1s struggled. His second bull lacked strength, and despite the engineering of some breathtaking passes, he missed and struggled with his sword, killing poorly.And with his last bull, he never had a chance. Once the chute swung open and the animal emerged, the frustrated crowd whistled in protest. The bull, despite its speed, was too small, they felt. A substitute bull was called in. This bull was also small, and lacked strength, and Tom\u00e1s had no choice but to kill it quickly and register his most disappointing performance in years.Adame then seized the moment. With the final bull of the day, he executed all the tricks to win the laggard crowd over. He dropped to his knees, spun the capes like pinwheels and got so close he touched the horns with his fingers.He even attempted a dangerous style of killing called recibiendo, placing the sword as the bull charged into him rather than jumping over the horns. The move capped a performance that lacked Tom\u00e1s\u2019s poetry but earned Adame a triumphant two ears for excitement. Adame, not Tom\u00e1s, was carried through the streets as fans reached out to touch his hand, his suit of lights \u2014 any part of him. It was as if they were touching a saint.Back at his hotel, Tom\u00e1s emerged to have a late dinner with his handlers. He wore dark jeans, black shoes, a flamenco-style scarf. He was asked how he felt.\u201cWhat can one do?\u201d he said in Spanish, shaking his head. He looked sullen and deflated and very much like a typical matador after a rough afternoon \u2014 no longer the mysterious god of the bulls so many people had come to see.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Companies Rush to Return to Post-Sanctions Iran", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported by7 PhotosVOLGOGRAD, Russia \u2014 At a sprawling pipe factory in this gritty industrial town, an exhibit of Surrealist art, featuring reproductions of Mondrian, Malevich and Magritte, lines the walls. One of the company\u2019s biggest shareholders, a collector of Surrealist works, says the art will stretch engineers\u2019 minds and unlock workers\u2019 creativity.Commentary at the exhibit gets to an existential debate with Shakespearean flair: \u201cTube or Not Tube?\u201d It is a fitting question for the factory owner, the Tube Metal Company, the biggest supplier of pipes to oil and natural gas producers.Like many players in the oil patch, the Tube Metal Company, or TMK for short, is being hurt by weak energy prices. With oil dipping below $29 a barrel, TMK has been pulling back in the United States and elsewhere.But TMK contends it has an edge in a relatively untapped market, Iran, a country with warm political relations with Moscow that has tens of billions of dollars in newly unfrozen, shah-era money to spend on oil infrastructure. During the Soviet era, TMK was the dominant provider of pipes to Iran.Russian companies are broadly gearing up to get back into Iran.Sukhoi wants to sell its Superjet airliners to a market starved for transportation. Avtovaz has started talks to open an assembly plant for Lada cars in Iran.The oil and natural gas giants Gazprom and Lukoil are weighing investments in a liquefied natural gas project on the Persian Gulf, and an oil field. The Eurasia Drilling Company, an oil field services business, and Tatneft, a second-tier Russian oil company based in Tatarstan, a predominantly Muslim region east of Moscow, both have good prospects.\u201cIf you have dry firewood and the wind is blowing, the fire will get going,\u201d Sergei G. Chetverikov, director of the pipe factory here, said of TMK\u2019s prospects in Iran. \u201cAll you need is the match.\u201dAfter the signing of the nuclear deal with Iran, the Obama administration promoted the benefits for nonproliferation and global security. But the administration was less vocal about the benefits for business.That is because the United States is cautiously eyeing Iran.Under the deal, authorities in Tehran agreed to open their nuclear program to stepped-up inspections and to ship enriched uranium to Russia, in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. But the United States still has sanctions on Iran for supporting terrorism and human rights abuses.Those sanctions prohibit most commercial ties with Iran, so American companies are not permitted to vie for contracts with its oil and natural gas industry. The United States is allowing trade only in Persian rugs and commercial airplanes.European companies are better positioned, as much of the region tries to develop diplomatic ties with Iran.With ink still drying on the nuclear deal last July, Germany\u2019s vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, escorted to Tehran a delegation of executives from his country\u2019s largest companies, including Daimler, Volkswagen and Siemens. Airbus, the aerospace manufacturer, is starting negotiations with Iran. Last month, Hellenic Petroleum, a Greek oil refiner, struck the first deal to buy Iranian crude oil after sanctions were removed.Russia has an advantage. It has long backed Iran diplomatically and it has deep military ties.After the nuclear deal, Vice Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin of Russia said his country was beginning to supply S-300 antiaircraft missile systems to Iran. \u201cThis contract is now executed and paid for,\u201d Mr. Rogozin said.He noted that the deals between Russia and Iran were not just in the military arena. The S-300 supply, he added, would \u201copen the entire road for cooperation with Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201dLike other countries, Russia sees opportunity in a country long starved for capital.Iran\u2019s economy is expecting a jump-start from $29 billion in frozen offshore assets, unfrozen as a condition of the deal. The International Monetary Fund projects that Iran\u2019s economy will grow 5.5 percent in 2016 and in 2017.The energy industry is especially attractive for overseas companies.Iran holds the Middle East\u2019s second-largest oil deposits, after Saudi Arabia, and by some estimates the world\u2019s largest reserves of conventional natural gas. Even before sanctions were lifted, Iran signed deals to export gas to Iraq and Pakistan.But its industry lacks the pipes to deliver that gas, as companies woefully underinvested during the era of sanctions. In total, Iran could spend as much as $100 billion rebuilding its natural gas pipelines, analysts said.TMK says it is in a good position to provide much of that business.At its gigantic metal works here, it pours, grinds and welds the huge steel straws that pull much of the world\u2019s oil out of the depths. The company says 20 percent of the global oil brought to the surface at one point or another flows through a TMK tube, including high-end varieties of pipe made for the insides of oil wells.\u201cWe make the pipe Bentleys,\u201d Vladimir Shmatovich, vice president for strategy, said in an interview.Russia does face some challenges as it prepares to jump into Iran.With its own set of Western sanctions over the Ukrainian conflict and weak oil prices, the Russian economy is suffering, and companies are having a tough time raising money. That could make it difficult for companies like Lukoil and Gazprom, their revenues shrinking, to immediately revive their production deals in Iran.\u201cThe general feeling is still cautious,\u201d said Ildar Davletshin, an oil and gas analyst at Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank. With low oil prices, the budgets of Russian oil companies are \u201cunder huge stress.\u201dTMK views Iran as an antidote to the industry woes.After the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iran in 2006, Russian companies like TMK had to retreat. TMK\u2019s bottom line suffered.So TMK shifted gears, moving to the United States. As the shale boom took off, the company bought 12 factories in North America.Now, the pendulum is swinging the other way. With energy prices falling, shale companies are suffering. TMK\u2019s North American division, Ipsco, has idled two plants and plans to lay off 40 percent of its 2,700-person work force.At home in Russia, TMK is hunkering down.It has put in place incentives for workers who find ways to cut costs on the factory floor, such as vacations in Sochi, the Black Sea resort. TMK is also nudging its Russian workers to adopt the timesaving ways of the Toyota production system, a Japanese industrial philosophy.More important, TMK wants to increase production.And it is looking to the past for how important Iran could be. In the Soviet period, the plant here provided up to 40 percent of the pipes used in Iran\u2019s oil industry \u2013 including casing set into oil wells and pipes carrying natural gas over the desert.\u201cThe idea is simple: They lift the sanctions, we send the pipes,\u201d said Mr. Chetverikov, the TMK plant director here.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Bernie Sanders Plays in Vegas", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byLas Vegas \u2014 MARYLAND PARKWAY, a street in central Las Vegas best known for its gritty shopping centers and petty crime, is now home to a brightly lit campaign office. Cartoon portraits of an aging senator with oversize glasses and wild cowlicks hang around the main room. On the wall is a growing collage of handwritten signs explaining \u201cWhy I\u2019m voting for Bernie\u201d: because \u201cMinimum wage is not enough,\u201d because \u201cCollege should not be a financial obstacle,\u201d because \u201cI am a socialist.\u201dBernie Sanders was never expected to get as far as the Nevada caucuses, which take place Feb. 20, let alone do well in this blue-collar, conservative state. And yet, in recent months, and especially in the wake of his blowout win in the New Hampshire primary, there is a sense that the old verities are falling apart and that the avuncular, bespectacled Vermonter could win over a sizable chunk of the union members and minority voters who were supposed to vote in lock step for Hillary Clinton.It\u2019s not purely coincidence: Even as he stumped in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Sanders didn\u2019t ignore Nevada. The office on Maryland Parkway is one of 11 spread around the state (Mrs. Clinton has seven). He has spoken to overflowing crowds in Las Vegas and Reno. Like those handwritten signs, the speeches took on the same laser-focused economic theme that, increasingly, many working-class Nevadans appear receptive to.That\u2019s because, while Mr. Sanders\u2019s message of taking up policy arms against the billionaire class may sound like so much heated campaign rhetoric, in Nevada \u2014 which was not only the state hardest hit by the recession and housing crisis but also has been the slowest to recover \u2014 it speaks to unfinished business. The state has some of the highest rates of unemployment and child poverty in the country. In our glacially recovering housing market, one out of four homeowners still has negative equity in their homes.And because the Nevada economy is recovering, albeit slowly, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s more modest economic proposals, and her less aggressive stance toward Wall Street, may prove more attractive to voters.At least, that\u2019s how things should play out. But if the 2016 Democratic race has shown anything, it\u2019s that the party establishment woefully underestimated the breadth and depth of voter support for progressive policies, not to mention voter anger with centrist Democrats whose support for a moderate course looks suspiciously like the status quo.There\u2019s no denying that Mr. Sanders\u2019s insistence that income inequality is the most pressing issue of our time, that this more than anything else limits the freedom and opportunities of ordinary Americans, is a more accurate depiction of the experience of Nevada\u2019s largely working-class population. Particularly in Las Vegas, many young people, and their parents, live at the mercy of billionaire casino moguls, and they\u2019re tired of it.Indeed, Nevada might as well be a courtroom exhibit in the case against many of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s key policy ideas. Some of her more moderate plans have already proved insufficient in this state. Her proposed $12 federal minimum wage \u2014 although a significant improvement nationally \u2014 is lower than what Nevada unions have fought for and what corporations have proved willing and able to pay.Her plan for debt-free college will increase access to higher education, but the public universities in Nevada already have low-cost tuition and serve lower-income minorities well. Their six-year graduation rates, however, top out at 55 percent, because it\u2019s so hard to work your way through college here and finish on time. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s New College Compact would require students to work at least 10 hours a week and contribute their earnings to their college costs.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals are a step in the right direction. But with the economy tepid and income inequality only growing, modesty is not a good enough policy. And as anyone who has spent time in the real Las Vegas \u2014 the struggling, striving working-class metropolis behind the neon lights \u2014 can attest, her proposals won\u2019t make a dent in most Americans\u2019 lives.Nevada\u2019s recent history testifies to the tragic ramifications of corporate greed and power, but also to the benefits of worker-centered policies. Mr. Sanders speaks directly to those themes, and to voters\u2019 growing concerns. Nevada, more than any other early contest, will show how well he is getting through to them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Cases for Public Investment", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "One of the annoying aspects of the Sanders/Friedman flap was the assumption of many Sanders supporters that anyone who doesn\u2019t accept extravagant economic projections is against a big program of public investment. Actually, it was destructive as well as annoying; aside from being an insult to progressive economists who believe in infrastructure but also believe in arithmetic, it created at least the possibility that other people would take the crash-and-burn of a particular piece of analysis as evidence that the whole case for spending more is wrong.So let\u2019s talk about the cases for a lot more public investment right now. Yes, cases, plural. There are at least three reasons to conclude that we should be spending much more than we are.The first case is simply that America has an obvious infrastructure deficit, and that it has never been cheaper to address that deficit. Government borrowing costs are at record lows; markets are in effect pleading with the government to borrow and spend. So why not do it? It\u2019s completely crazy that public construction as a percentage of GDP has declined to record lows even as interest rates have done the same:The second case is a bit, but only a bit, harder: we are still in or near a liquidity trap, a situation in which cutting interest rates as far as possible isn\u2019t enough to restore full employment.The standard analysis looks something like this:By the \u201cnatural\u201d rate of interest I mean the short-term rate set by the Fed that would produce full employment. In the aftermath of a financial crisis, with a big private-sector debt overhang, it\u2019s possible \u2014 and has turned out in fact \u2014 that this rate becomes negative for an extended period (and no, the possibility of slightly sub-zero interest rates doesn\u2019t significantly change the picture.)What this means, in turn, is an extended period during which conventional monetary policy can\u2019t restore full employment; and while unconventional monetary policy can and should be tried,one thing that we know works is increased public spending. So there\u2019s an overwhelming case for a burst of spending while we\u2019re in the trap. That spending can be withdrawn later on without hurting employment, because once you\u2019re out of the liquidity trap the Fed can offset the contractionary effects of a fiscal tightening by holding off on the monetary tightening it would otherwise have pursued.You might ask, but are we still in that condition, given that the Fed has started to raise rates? Well, it shouldn\u2019t have \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be raising rates until it sees the whites of inflation\u2019s eyes. And it would take only a modest shock to push us well into negative-natural-rate territory again. Put it this way: the asymmetric-risks story many of us have been using to argue against rate hikes is also a reason to consider increased public investment a valuable insurance policy, giving the economy headroom that might turn out to be crucial if anything goes wrong.What about the possibility that the natural rate will stay negative for a very long time, maybe even forever? That\u2019s the secular stagnation hypothesis, and needs a longer discussion than I have time for this morning. But suffice it say that the case for more public spending remains very strong.Finally, there\u2019s hysteresis: the proposition that demand-side weakness now breeds supply-side weakness later, so that there are big payoffs to boosting the economy through public spending. There\u2019s now a lot of evidence for that proposition, with my only worry being that potential output isn\u2019t an actual number, just an estimate that may tell us more about the dreary minds of international agencies than about real supply-side effects. More on that soon too. But it\u2019s a further reason to spend more now, and to worry even less about any debt that we run up at today\u2019s low, low rates.The point is that perfectly standard, mainstream economics makes a powerful case for (much) more infrastructure spending. And this needs to be said often.Paul Krugman is an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Merkel Pay for Doing the Right Thing?", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byBERLIN \u2014 A former German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, recently called Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to open the door to an unlimited number of refugees a \u201cmistake\u201d and offered this verdict: Merkel had a \u201cheart, but no plan.\u201dThis view of the German leader, who is beloved but now begrudged, is gaining ground as refugees from a ravaged Syria and elsewhere pour in. Local authorities are strained to the limit. Billions of euros have been spent with no end in sight. Many people came in whose identities are unknown; they have to register if they want handouts, but some have not and there are security concerns. Cologne has become a byword for concern over how a large influx of Muslim men will affect the place and security of women in German society.Three important state elections loom next month. It seems inevitable the far-right Alternative for Germany Party will surge. Merkel will be blamed. Her support has already tumbled. One poll this month showed 46 percent of Germans support her, compared with 75 percent in April last year \u2014 and that\u2019s with a strong economy. She could be vulnerable if her Christian Democratic Party turns on her. Europe without Merkel will sink.So why did this customarily prudent chancellor do it? Because she is a German, and to be German is to carry a special responsibility for those terrorized in their homeland and forced into flight. Because she once lived in a country, East Germany, that shot people who tried to cross its border. Because a united Europe ushered Germany from its darkest hour to prosperity, and she is not about to let the European Union pitch into mayhem on her watch \u2014 as it would with more than a million ragged refugees adrift. And, yes, because she has a heart.Merkel did the right thing. The question now is how she handles the consequences. Management involves setting limits. After taking in more than one million refugees last year, Germany cannot take in that number again in 2016. As Germany\u2019s president, Joachim Gauck, said recently: \u201cA limitation strategy may even be both morally and politically necessary in order to preserve the state\u2019s ability to function.\u201d He added, \u201cIf democrats refuse to talk about limits, they leave the field open to populists and xenophobes.\u201dBut setting limits is not a just a German issue. It\u2019s a Syrian issue. It\u2019s a Turkish issue. It\u2019s a Russian issue. It\u2019s an American issue. It\u2019s a European issue. Merkel needs Europe to have a functioning external border if it is to remain borderless within the 20-plus-nation Schengen zone. Otherwise national borders will go up. The European Union will unmake itself. \u201cNo European border, no Schengen!\u201d Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, Gauck\u2019s chief adviser, told me.Merkel\u2019s domestic dilemma demands international answers.She needs the Syrian war, the main source of the refugee outflow, to end, but the latest American-Russian plan for a cessation of hostilities almost looks more likely to unravel in the weeks ahead than hold. She needs Turkey, in exchange for billions of euros, to tighten its borders and stop the refugee exodus. But Turkey is playing an extortion game, and is not above a little schadenfreude at seeing the Europe that rejected it fray.In Russia, she needs President Vladimir Putin\u2019s cooperation, but his strategy is the undermining of a united Europe; a \u201cweaponized\u201d refugee flow achieves just that. Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, declared in Munich this weekend that, \u201cWe are rapidly rolling into a period of a new cold war.\u201d He asked: \u201cIs this 2016 or 1962?\u201d Around Aleppo, a world war in miniature unfolds.Merkel needs the United States to exercise its power in a way President Obama has refused to do through the inexorable spread of the Syrian crisis. Unless the United States is prepared to establish a safe area in northern Syria and put pressure on Turkey to turn a chaotic refugee flow into an orderly process, the current untenable situation will persist. If America is unprepared to reverse Russian-Iranian gains in Syria, it must at least show commitment to managing the consequences. She needs European countries like Poland and Hungary \u2014 recipients of huge injections of cash from the European Union \u2014 to snap out of their ungrateful moods of nationalist xenophobia, but that\u2019s not going to happen soon.The European idea has not been this weak since the march to unity began in the 1950s. Germany is awash in so-called Putinversteher \u2014 broadly Putin sympathizers like Schr\u00f6der \u2014 who admire him for his strong assertion of Russian national interests. Michael Naumann, a former minister of culture, told me: \u201cThe United States has left us, we are the orphaned kids in the playground, and there\u2019s one tough guy, Putin. It\u2019s really that simple.\u201dGermany is Europe\u2019s core, its dominant power. If Merkel\u2019s refugee gambit implodes, the reverberations will be felt everywhere. The country feels restive, placid on the surface, tense beneath. A woman told me of how a 15-year-old Syrian refugee was admitted to her daughter\u2019s class. The girl\u2019s cellphone rang, the ring tone was a muezzin\u2019s call to prayer, and the teacher burst out: \u201cSo next you\u2019ll have a suicide belt!\u201d There was embarrassment all around, apologies and parental letters. \u201cThe situation\u2019s out of control,\u201d the woman said.At the Berlin state office for health and social affairs, a sprawling maze of buildings, white tents have gone up. Long lines of refugees make their way through the various bureaucratic hurdles to identity cards. They huddle in the rain, their sneakers muddy, their jackets too flimsy for the cold.Mustafa Dilaneh left Latakia, Syria\u2019s main port, in August, and paid $6,000 for his passage to Germany. He has been granted German residency until Feb. 22; he hopes for a passport after that. He is learning German. He wants to return home, but first, he says, President Bashar al-Assad \u201cmust go or die.\u201d Failing that, he has a dream of America. \u201cI love New York so much,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe city no sleep.\u201dA Facebook friend taught Dilaneh that phrase. This is the world\u2019s first massive smartphone coordinated migration. Syrians don\u2019t see the West as alien; they know it through countless images, brands and tunes. But for some Germans, these Middle Eastern refugees are an alien threat.I went out to Nauen, a small dismal town near Berlin where unemployment is high. Signs brandished at rightist demonstrations last year said, \u201cNauen will stay white.\u201d In August, a gymnasium that was to have housed refugees was burned down in an unsolved act of arson. The charred skeleton of the building with its blackened pillars and piles of rubble still stands. It cost about four million euros to build and will need at least that amount to replace.A new emergency center for several hundred refugees is planned nearby, with a view of this stark symbol of hatred. To say Nauen is combustible would be an understatement. \u201cThere will more protests,\u201d Volker M\u00fcller, who works to promote intercultural understanding, told me. \u201cIn some ways this feels like a bigger problem than German reunification.\u201dThe scale of Germany\u2019s challenge is evident at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, built to last by the Nazis, and used in 1948 and 1949 for the Berlin Airlift that, at its height, saw American C-47s landing every 90 seconds to bring the supplies essential for the preservation of freedom in part of the divided German capital. Now the vast 52-foot high hangars are being converted into shelters for thousands of refugees who sleep, 12 to each screened white rectangular bedroom unit, where aircraft were once housed. Already there are 2,600 or so refugees; there may eventually be 7,000. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to find a place for them,\u201d Sascha Langenbach, a spokesman on Berlin social issues, told me. He predicted another 60,000 may come to the capital this year.I spoke to a couple of young refugees from Aleppo, Mahmoud Sultan and Mulham (he preferred not to give his family name out of concern for his family\u2019s safety). They complained about the food, about the noise, about the difficulty of studying German, about how weeks stretched into months at this \u201cemergency\u201d center.They had not wanted to leave Aleppo. But, as Mulham put it: \u201cYou have this hope the war will end. For one year, two years, three years, you keep this hope. You think, I owe my country something and I will stay. Until in the fifth year you realize there are five wars! The rebels against Assad, ISIS against the Free Syrian Army, the Saudis against Iran, the Kurds against ISIS, and Russia against America! And you lose hope.\u201dThe refugees did not leave because they had a choice. They left because they concluded they had none. Merkel, given her personal history and her nation\u2019s, had little choice but to take them in.Now she needs those five wars to abate, and Western allies to come together with something of the resolve that Tempelhof symbolizes, if she is to calm a strained Germany, hold Europe together, and survive. That will require leadership and determination of a kind she demonstrated but that is in short supply in the social-media echo chamber of our times.This column has been updated to reflect news developments.

{"Headline": "Bill Clinton Defends Welfare Law From Bernie Sanders\u2019s Attacks", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Repeatedly saying that the law did \u00e2\u0080\u009cway more good than harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton, in brief remarks to The New York Times, offered a striking contrast to his fiery outbursts against Barack Obama in South Carolina before the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary eight years ago. Back then, Mr. Clinton sharply defended himself and Mrs. Clinton from attacks by supporters of Mr. Obama, comments that upset many African-American Democrats who liked the Clintons but were supporting Mr. Obama.With Mrs. Clinton in far better political shape heading into the South Carolina primary on Saturday than she was in 2008, Mr. Clinton surely saw less need to lace into Mr. Sanders. But his care with his words was notable given the harshness from Mr. Sanders, who said on Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton had rounded up votes for a welfare bill that, in his view, harmed \u00e2\u0080\u009csome of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton, in pushing back against Mr. Sanders, noted that during his presidency, median incomes for African-Americans rose sharply and the poverty rate declined; a record number of African-American-owned businesses opened; and the homicide rate for African-Americans tumbled. But he bemoaned cuts in federal subsidies to state assistance programs, which had been promised stable financing in the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened was, the people who still needed some assistance didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were able to restore virtually all the cuts to legal immigrants that the Republicans demanded, we kept the guarantee of nutrition and health care. But the law needs to be changed to help the poorest of the poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that it did far more good than harm, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that subsequent events showed it needs some improvement.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton, who never mentioned Mr. Sanders, made his comments after a campaign rally here where he barely mentioned the Vermont senator, instead offering a glimpse of a general election argument that Mrs. Clinton might make against Donald J. Trump. Mr. Clinton took issue with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political tagline, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d saying that America is a strong country that needed to do more to help people of all races and incomes, from struggling coal miners and small-business owners to African Americans and police officers who are divided by a lack of trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think America ever stopped being great \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have to make America whole again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton told a couple of hundred supporters in Rock Hill, a modest-size city near the North Carolina border.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do we make America whole again? Well, we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build a wall around this country. We should do what Hillary wants to do. We should tear down the barriers and build ladders to prosperity.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile Mrs. Clinton has been decrying \u00e2\u0080\u009csystemic racism\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the criminal justice system ahead of the South Carolina primary, where more than half of Democratic voters are likely to be black, Mr. Clinton took a different tack here. He praised police officers generally and said that communities needed \u00e2\u0080\u009cneighborhood councils\u00e2\u0080\u009d and other groups that would build closer ties with beat cops and law enforcement officials.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to put more police on the street that look like the communities they are policing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know that anytime people have a lot of guns, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violence, and drugs are being sold, once in a while something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen that shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did not pass judgment on who was to blame in such incidents, but focused instead on the need for the police and community officials to work together.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need the police, we need the police, but we need a police that people trust are on their side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.Throughout his speech, Mr. Clinton seemed to be reaching out to white voters at a time when Mrs. Clinton is explicitly courting African-Americans and Hispanics. Mr. Clinton said the government needed to do more to help coal miners whose livelihoods were being threatened by the steady decline in coal production. He called for making greater high-speed Internet broadband available in \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery small town in rural America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would lead to new job opportunities for miners and others.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose coal miners in West Virginia didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey kept the lights on for decades, their children fought in our wars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Referring to miners as \u00e2\u0080\u009cour brothers and sisters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added that people of all races \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeserve the chance to begin again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sounding a little like Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whom he never mentioned by name \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mr. Clinton also called for tougher enforcement of trade deals and a tougher stance against China on currency manipulation.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to say, \u2018Look, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play us for suckers anymor\u2019e,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.The former president also drew strong applause when he backed President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitutional authority to nominate a new justice to the Supreme Court after the recent death of Antonin Scalia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe should do his job and put up somebody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Clinton repeatedly praised Mr. Obama while also noting that many Americans still had not rebounded with the improving economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes 10 years to fully get over a financial crunch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. Referring to Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State of the Union address last month, Mr. Clinton continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe painted this beautiful picture of the future, but the problem is, a lot of Americans are staring at this picture but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find themselves in it. Hillary is running for president to put every single American in that picture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Inklings of a Chill in the Art Market", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported bySotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, which both reported slightly lower sales in 2015 last month, faced their first major stress test of the year this past week with the February sales of Impressionist and modern works in London, followed by their contemporary auctions a week later.Demand was more selective, but so, too, was the supply. Much of the drop-off in totals can be explained by owners\u2019 reluctance to consign trophy-quality works when buyers are nervous or distracted \u2014 and when the auction houses and third parties are less willing to risk guaranteeing sales. Only four lots were financed in this way at these evening auctions.\u201cThere are so many concerns in the world at the moment,\u201d said Patrick Legant, a London-based art adviser. \u201cPeople would have felt it wasn\u2019t the right time to sell.\u201dWhen high-quality works were offered, and were not fresh to the market, the math could be sobering.Christie\u2019s did find a telephone buyer for Max Ernst\u2019s important and much-exhibited 1941 Surrealist landscape, \u201cThe Stolen Mirror,\u201d for a top price of \u00a37.6 million, or about $11 million, with fees, just above the low estimate. The only lot in the sale to be guaranteed by the auction house \u2014 two others were backed by third parties \u2014 this vision of moss-encrusted figures in a ruined port, painted in the year when the German artist fled Nazi-occupied France for the United States, had been bought by its London-based seller for $16.3 million at Christie\u2019s in New York in 2011.There was also a shortfall between some of the values put on works in late 2015 and what the market was prepared to pay in early 2016. Matisse\u2019s historically interesting but visually uninspiring 1923 painting, \u201cLa Le\u00e7on de Piano,\u201d had been owned by the same Scottish family since 1926. It carried a low estimate of \u00a312 million at Sotheby\u2019s and fell to a single bid of \u00a310.8 million from the international dealer David Nahmad.\u201cThere were no blockbuster lots,\u201d said Abigail Asher, partner at the New York art advisers Guggenheim Asher, who was at Christie\u2019s. \u201cIt looks like a retrenchment, but there was bidding from real end-users and some strong prices. These are people who want to live with a picture.\u201dAt Sotheby\u2019s, there was a protracted duel between a telephone bidder and the Oslo dealer Ben Frija for one of the last two large-scale lifetime casts of Rodin\u2019s 1890-91 bronze, \u201cIris, Messag\u00e8re des Dieux,\u201d left in private hands. This extraordinarily modernistic female nude, once owned by the actor Sylvester Stallone, was eventually bought by Mr. Frija for \u00a311.6 million, almost double the low estimate of \u00a36 million.Oliver Barker, a senior specialist in contemporary art at Sotheby\u2019s, gave a winning bid of \u00a37.3 million on behalf of a client for Paul Delvaux\u2019s 1936 surrealist masterwork, \u201cLe Miroir,\u201d showing a fully clothed woman gazing at the reflection of her naked self. The painting achieved an auction record for the Belgian artist, just as it did in 1999 when its American seller bought it at auction in London for \u00a33.2 million.The Delvaux was typical of the sort of work that appeals to serious buyers of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art.Impressionist and modern, known as \u201cImps & Mods,\u201d was the biggest-selling category at auction until 2005, when it was overtaken by contemporary. With some collectors now wary of the high prices being paid for works by living artists, the new crossover category of \u201c20th Century\u201d \u2014 combining the later works from Imps & Mods with earlier pieces from postwar and contemporary \u2014 has become the key money-making market for international auction houses. Sotheby\u2019s, which last month announced its acquisition of the formidable New York art advisers Art Agency, Partners, and Christie\u2019s promoted this February fortnight of sales as a celebration of 20th-century art.But where does this leave early Impressionism? Totally out of collecting fashion, judging by results at these London auctions. At Christie\u2019s, the third-party guarantor bought Camille Pissarro\u2019s 1869 landscape, \u201cLe Village \u00e0 Travers les Arbres,\u201d with a single bid of \u00a3602,500, while Sotheby\u2019s saw all four of its Impressionist paintings from the 1860s and \u201870s fail to sell. Monet\u2019s 1871 landscape, \u201cUn Moulin \u00e0 Zaandam,\u201d estimated at \u00a3800,000 to \u00a31.2 million, was among the casualties. It had been bought three years earlier at Sotheby\u2019s, when Russian and Chinese buyers were much more active, for \u00a31.1 million.\u201cIt\u2019s not a collapse,\u201d said Mr. Legant, the art adviser. \u201cPeople are taking a breather. They\u2019re watching the market, and auctions tell you where the market is heading.\u201dWherever it is heading, it looks as though the destination is going to be different from what it was in 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cond\u00e9 Nast Adapts to New Forces, Leaving Some Employees Unsettled", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byThe economy had crashed. The publishing industry was fighting a financial crisis that amounted to an existential threat. Mr. Newhouse, in his 80s, was approaching the end of his career. They were concerned, they told him at his apartment, decorated with selections from a postwar American art collection, about Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s future. To succeed, they said, Cond\u00e9 Nast needed strong creative leadership across its portfolio of disparate magazines, the kind of leadership that Mr. Newhouse himself and his longtime artistic director Alexander Liberman had provided for decades.It was Ms. Wintour herself, the longtime editor of Vogue and one of the most powerful figures in fashion and publishing, who was eventually appointed as Mr. Liberman\u2019s heir \u2014 artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, overseeing its portfolio. She and Bob Sauerberg, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s chief executive, have introduced a rash of changes, both cultural and structural, that have left some in the company reeling.New editors have been appointed at Allure, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, Architectural Digest and Self. And in recent months, a round of layoffs struck GQ, Teen Vogue, Glamour, Self and Allure. Details, the men\u2019s lifestyle magazine, was shuttered entirely after 33 years.In a separate interview, Mr. Sauerberg confirmed that Cond\u00e9 Nast took in over $1 billion in revenue in 2015. The company said that while its print business, spread across nearly 20 magazines, remained profitable, revenue there had been flat since 2012. Its digital business is up nearly 70 percent over the same period but that component, as with virtually every other legacy media company, represents a much smaller percentage of overall revenue, which has declined in recent years.Mr. Sauerberg\u2019s plan focuses on maintaining print share, and increasing digital revenues through a focus on video and selling some publications to advertisers as a bundle, for example, and by increasing web traffic. Shortfalls in the meantime mean cutting costs, as Cond\u00e9 Nast is required by its parent company, Advance Publications, to show a profit.In interviews, nearly a dozen current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters, lamented a focus on the bottom line and a relentless pursuit of web traffic. Many acknowledged that the era of lavish spending at Cond\u00e9 Nast, with clothing allowances and town cars idling outside the headquarters, waiting to whisk employees to appointments, was not sustainable. But they suggested that financial survival and journalistic swagger \u2014 the kind that made Cond\u00e9 Nast an emblem of the golden age of publishing \u2014 need not be mutually exclusive.Mr. Sauerberg defended the recent upheaval as vital restructuring. His aim, he says, is to ensure that his company continues to influence the world. \u201cI am the top of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cI am incredibly competitive. I want to win. I want to be the best.\u201dCathy Horyn, a critic at large for New York magazine and a former fashion critic for The New York Times, says that Cond\u00e9 Nast is \u201ca delicate organism, and historically that company has proven that it gets along better with an artistic director.\u201d Ms. Wintour, she says, \u201cbrings the most institutional knowledge, but the big question is that the outside world has changed so much and can Anna play catch-up?\u201dThe decisions made in recent months have been Mr. Sauerberg\u2019s. But for those who work at Cond\u00e9 Nast, or follow the company, it is Ms. Wintour, or at least the myth that surrounds her, that looms behind every change.In addition to editing Vogue, she oversees magazines as varied as Brides and Golf Digest (Mr. Remnick, at The New Yorker, and Mr. Carter, at Vanity Fair, are largely left to their own devices). She has also grown increasingly influential in Democratic politics. And she has been involved with the recently named Anna Wintour Costume Center at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the annual Costume Institute Benefit at the Met. It is easy to forget that she has been making magazines for decades.Half a dozen current and former Cond\u00e9 Nast employees described working with Ms. Wintour as a privilege in some ways \u2014 she has access to improved budgets, the best photographers, and celebrities and socialites to fill pages \u2014 and a fraught experience in others. She gravitates toward her own distinctive visual style and can be dismissive when displeased, some staff members said.When asked about those accounts, Ms. Wintour stared stonily and asked whether The New York Times was a tabloid newspaper. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cI am decisive, you know. I don\u2019t believe in wasting anybody\u2019s time. I like to be honest. I like to be clear. In my own personal career, I have felt almost the most difficult thing to deal with is someone who doesn\u2019t tell you what they are thinking.\u201dShe agreed, when asked, that there was an element of sexism in the way she is viewed. \u201cBut I decided long ago that I can\u2019t let any of that bother me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my style is too direct for some, maybe they should toughen up a bit.\u201dShe strongly disagreed that the magazines she most closely oversees have begun to resemble Vogue, saying each of them has \u201ca very original voice.\u201dIn some ways, Ms. Wintour and Mr. Sauerberg make an unlikely pair. He is quiet and studied, and speaks with pride about the technical aspects of the business that he has worked on for some years, including a new content management system, growth on the digital side of the business and improved offerings for advertisers.He is an avid golfer who studied finance at the University of Arkansas. At Cond\u00e9 Nast, he oversaw consumer marketing then served as president before formally taking over as chief executive this month.He does not believe in motivating his staff, he said. \u201cI believe in hiring motivated people and giving them the rein and the authority to do great work.\u201dWhen asked about a view among some of his staff that he is more of a business figure than a creative leader, he conceded that his career had drawn him in that direction, but that he was looking forward to showing more. \u201cYou can make the statement that the guy came up this way,\u201d Mr. Sauerberg said, referring to his background, \u201cand it is my job to show them that it\u2019s not this way.\u201dIn recent emails to the staff, he drew attention to companywide internal awards as well as National Magazine Award nominations, and pointed to a social media advertising campaign based on a series of videos Cond\u00e9 Nast had put together about its creativity.Mr. Sauerberg, Ms. Wintour said, was not the same as Mr. Newhouse. But she says he is passionate about the magazines, and has his own skills: \u201cEverybody brings something different to a position. And it\u2019s not cookie-cutter. Nobody is ever the same.\u201dShe spoke warmly of Mr. Newhouse and Mr. Liberman, who she said had always encouraged her to take risks. But when asked whether running a publishing company at a time of web-traffic targets and downsizing was less fun than in the prior era, she reacted strongly.\u201cI don\u2019t like that word \u2018fun\u2019 because it sounds light,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s intriguing. It\u2019s intellectually stimulating. It\u2019s different. Why do people want to get stuck in the past?\u201d\u201cIf we sit back with our quills and the visors on and, you know, the old kind of printing presses that I used to see with my dad,\u201d she said, referring to her father, Charles, who edited The London Evening Standard, \u201cwhat is the point of thinking that way? Come on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "NATO and Europe\u2019s Refugee Crisis", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialGen. Philip Breedlove of the United States Air Force, NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander for Europe, said last week that the mission had \u201cliterally come together in the last 20 hours\u201d and that he had been asked to \u201cgo back and define the mission.\u201d Part of that mission must be to help refugees at risk. Last year, 3,800 people drowned trying to cross the sea to Europe, and more than 400 have already drowned this year, many of them children. Frontex, the European Union border agency, and the Greek Coast Guard have simply not been able to cope.Concern for refugees\u2019 safety was not, however, the reason Germany, Greece and Turkey \u2014 the three countries most affected by the crisis \u2014 asked NATO for help. The main concern is political: public dismay at the prospect that the tide of refugees shows no sign of abating. Last week, Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, threatened to send millions of refugees on to Europe. Turkey has already taken in three million people and is under pressure to take in more.This is an especially critical issue for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has met with the Turkish government six times in an effort to enlist its help to stem the flow of refugees. Her popularity has plummeted as Germans have soured on an open-arms approach that saw more than a million asylum seekers arrive in Germany last year alone.Meanwhile, with its economy still in tatters and refugees continuing to arrive at a rate of nearly 2,000 a day, Greece stands accused by the European Union of bungling the processing of the applications of more than 800,000 asylum seekers who arrived on its shores last year, then allowing people to continue overland to Germany and other destination countries. It is the responsibility of the first country of arrival to process asylum seekers\u2019 applications, but Greece\u2019s reception centers are woefully substandard.So far, only 497 people have been relocated. That paltry number speaks volumes about the real crisis unleashed in Europe by the refugee influx, one that NATO ships in the Aegean cannot solve: the failure of European Union member states to forge a united, humane response to the tide of desperate humanity seeking help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Period Room as Reconstruction Site", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byAntiquesMuseumgoers most likely presume that period rooms remain static, but many are being overhauled. Major institutions are upgrading furnishings, adding technological and musical flourishes, and exploring the lives of the forgotten artisans and patrons who made the original d\u00e9cor possible.By year\u2019s end, the museum\u2019s gilded French salon from the 1730s will be redone to look as if aristocrats were playing cards there and partaking in coffee and chocolate by candlelight. In two rooms salvaged from early-18th-century British homes, the curators plan to display needlework and botanical studies \u2014 pieces highlighting the role of women in 18th-century salon culture \u2014 as well as scientific equipment like telescopes and microscopes that amateur male and female scientists tried out.In rooms from a 1770s house in Charleston, S.C., the museum will display artifacts related to Cherokee tribes in South Carolina and African-born slaves, who brought rice cultivation techniques with them. The house originally belonged to Col. John Stuart, a Scottish immigrant and slave owner who devoted decades to negotiating with American Indians. The museum has found descendants of a branch of the Stuart family who intermarried with Cherokees.Jennifer Komar Olivarez, the museum\u2019s curator of design and decorative arts, said a major goal for the revamped rooms was to bring out \u201cvoices that have been concealed.\u201dShe somehow concealed her murky past \u2014 as a teenage single mother, she had called herself a widow, though it is unclear whether she actually had a first husband. Her dressing room\u2019s satinwood and pearly inlays, Mr. DiMeo pointed out, may have made their way to New York partly via Mr. Huntington\u2019s rail lines.Sylvia Yount, the museum\u2019s curator overseeing the American Wing, said that future displays in the dressing room could include costumes similar to Arabella Worsham\u2019s wardrobe.Jeff Haydon, Caramoor\u2019s chief executive, said the collection needed judicious pruning: \u201cIn some rooms literally there were 16 pairs of candlesticks.\u201dAmong the Sotheby\u2019s lots from Caramoor are a set of blue enameled Chinese vessels and candlesticks (estimated at $300,000 to $500,000), made for an 18th-century shrine. Around 1910, the art dealer and collector Samuel P. Avery Jr. donated them to what is now the Brooklyn Museum, but they ended up back on the market by the 1940s.Rich Bertoia, the company\u2019s auction coordinator, said that Mr. Greene is widely admired in the field for turning up \u201csuch elusive finds.\u201d Estimates will reach tens of thousands of dollars each for hand-painted metal trains with cars nearly two feet long and bridges detailed with flags and gaslights.The New-York Historical Society show closes on Feb. 28. Mike Thornton, an assistant curator, said that parts of the collection will go on view again around the holidays for the next few years. The society also plans to organize traveling versions of the exhibition, and it will use Jerni playthings in shows that examine the history of toy manufacturing, \u201cchart the progress of westward expansion and document the impact of train transit on New York\u2019s industry and economy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Drivers Up Against the App", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe want to show Uber that without us full-time drivers, they won\u2019t have any cars on the road,\u201d Abdoul Diallo shouted from atop a concrete stage. Mr. Diallo, a Guinean immigrant who has emerged as a leader of the strikes, was holding up his own sign: \u201cNo Drivers, No Uber \u2014 It\u2019s That Simple.\u201d\u201cThis is the formula!\u201d he hollered to the crowd.\u201cIn the beginning, your company was great for both drivers and customers,\u201d Mr. Diallo and his partners wrote this month in a letter to the service. \u201cYou treated drivers well and we loved you for that. Little did we know that it would be a short-lived momentary ecstasy that you used to lure us in in great numbers, just so that you can execute your plans and strategies toward world domination.\u201dUber, mostly through the voice of Josh Mohrer, the 33-year-old general manager of Uber New York, has said it is pained by the grievances of the drivers, who, while not employees of the service, are known as \u201cdriver-partners\u201d in the company\u2019s jargon. Like most tech operations, Uber has a data set for everything, and Mr. Mohrer said his numbers proved that January\u2019s price cut, like a steeper one two years ago, increased the demand for rides and therefore led to larger driver paychecks.\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitive to think that lower fares will mean more money, but that is the reality,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added that he understood why the drivers might be anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ask to say, \u2018Just trust us.\u2019\u201d\u201cUber treats its drivers however it wants,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the ones who do everything except provide the technology.\u201dA former import-export trader who studied for a business degree, Mr. Diallo, 29, has been driving for the company for three years in a $50,000 Chevrolet Suburban. At first, he said, the job was great: He could afford his lease and still make money because he was taking in as much as $5,000 a week.But in 2014, Uber cut its rates by 20 percent and not long after that it increased its commissions. Last year, it forced new drivers working for its luxury arm, Uber Black, to pick up passengers through its less expensive option, UberX. On top of this, Mr. Diallo claimed that Uber\u2019s aggressive hiring has flooded the city with too many drivers chasing too few fares.\u201cPeople can\u2019t make a living,\u201d Mr. Diallo said on the phone after a meeting to coordinate the New York actions with others in London and San Francisco. \u201cThey\u2019re picking up $8 fares. They\u2019re driving their cars into the ground. Collectively, there\u2019s a lot of money coming in, but no one individual is making much.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere it\u2019s literally unbearable.\u201dUber likes to say that its drivers, not its riders, are its customers. And while the company might not give its customers health care or a pension, it does provide them access to high-tech support centers, modeled on Apple\u2019s Genius Bars, where they can ask questions about commercial licenses, receive free medical exams or get a can of soda. Uber also helps its drivers negotiate leases with car dealers.Uber also disputes the claim that there are too many drivers in New York. There are still more taxi riders that the company could woo, and, according to Mr. Mohrer, after the recent cuts were made, trips in the Bronx and Queens, where many drivers live, went up by nearly 25 percent.But if all this data has the weight of scripture for Uber executives, it has been less persuasive to the drivers, who say the statistics do not fully describe the experience of working for the company. Though lower prices might increase their workload and thus their gross, they say, the increased revenue will be eroded by a corresponding increase in expenses.At the Super Bowl rally, a driver named Mustafa, who declined to give his last name because he feared reprisals from Uber, said he expected to make about $40 an hour after the cuts. But that was before he paid for higher costs of maintenance, gas and washes; for his car lease, insurance and sales and income taxes; for emissions inspections and the 2.5 percent of earnings he gives each year to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation; and, of course, for his commissions.\u201cWhen you put it together, the numbers don\u2019t add up,\u201d Mustafa said. \u201cI\u2019m taking home less than minimum wage.\u201d\u201cWe stood behind them,\u201d said Ronnie Paulino, a driver who has worked for Uber for a year. \u201cThen they turned around and cut our pay.\u201dAfter speaking this month to an economics class at New York University, Mr. Mohrer acknowledged that when he first came to Uber, there were fewer drivers and stronger bonds between them and his management team. But as the fleet has grown, he said, he has tried to remain responsive to the drivers, who, on average, work 30 hours a week \u2014 or triple the rate of their peers in smaller cities.\u201cThey\u2019re more vested and engaged in Uber, so we take a more careful approach here,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a deeper relationship.\u201dBut deeper doesn\u2019t necessarily mean easier. A few weeks ago, Mr. Mohrer met with the leaders of the strikes at his office on West 27th Street in Chelsea\u2019s gallery district. He said they had a frank discussion about the rate cuts, which could be rescinded if the cuts do not achieve their goals. While he was not explicit about what those goals might be, he insisted that the conversation had been useful. \u201cI want to do this regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving drivers the opportunity to speak to me and my staff can result in more rapid change.\u201dThe strikers found the meeting less successful. \u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThey treated us like jokers.\u201d From his perspective, Mr. Mohrer offered no concessions on the cuts and was firm on only one position: that there would never be a tipping option on Uber\u2019s app.And that was the message Mr. Krasniqi delivered to the crowd in Queens on Super Bowl Sunday. Cupping his hands to his mouth, he reported on the meeting, then told the drivers to call their friends and relatives who also worked for Uber and urge them to stop driving.\u201cThat\u2019s how we built them up \u2014 with our friends and families,\u201d Mr. Krasniqi roared. \u201cAnd if we built them up, we can destroy them!\u201dIt is hard to tell at this point just how serious the threat to Uber from sustained unrest would be. The challenges of organizing a work force composed of men and women of disparate ethnicities and languages loosely connected by a cloud-based app are significant. \u201cIf the drivers can come together in a block causing problems, they might get something,\u201d said Evan Rawley, a professor of strategy at the Columbia Business School who studies the taxi industry. \u201cBut this is not West Virginia coal miners who all grew up together in the same small town.\u201dThere is a potential wild card: Class-action lawsuits have been filed against Uber, including in the federal courts in Brooklyn and San Francisco, which seek to make the drivers full employees. If the suits are successful, they could cripple Uber\u2019s business model, though some legal experts have said they are skeptical that the drivers could prevail when they use their own vehicles, and decide themselves when and whether to pick up passengers.\u201cThe solution is not to stay with Uber,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThe solution is to have our own platform \u2014 to build a real partnership and really be partners.\u201dFor now, however, they are still planning strikes, even if the one on Super Bowl Sunday was of questionable effectiveness. The drivers celebrated the action on their Facebook page, posting a screen shot of Uber\u2019s app that night \u2014 accompanied by the hashtag #SHUTDOWNSUPERBOWL \u2014 that showed a wait time at Kennedy Airport of 72 minutes.But the very next morning, Uber sent an email to its drivers announcing that the day before, it had broken its record for the most trips on a Sunday.\u201cThanks to you, our driver-partners,\u201d the email read, \u201chundreds of thousands of New Yorkers moved safely around the city this weekend.\u201dA cover article this weekend about Uber drivers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the company misstates, in some editions, the percent of earnings that Uber drivers pay to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation.

{"Headline": "Squire Patton Boggs to Acquire San Francisco Law Firm", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported bySquire Patton Boggs, a law firm that was built on powerhouse lobbying in Washington but later encountered turbulence as the legal economy shifted, is acquiring a smaller firm based in San Francisco, Carroll, Burdick & McDonough.The firms, which announced the deal on Monday, said the combination would become effective in March, joining the approximately 1,500 lawyers at Squire with Carroll Burdick\u2019s 50.In 2014, Patton Boggs, started by Thomas Boggs Jr., merged with Squire Sanders as its future became shaky. The combined firm is one of the three largest in the country, but earnings from its best-known practice, lobbying, have been declining. Last year, $25 million of the firm\u2019s annual revenue came from its lobbying practice, a 20 percent drop from its 2014 lobbying earnings of $32 million. The firm reported $870.5 million in annual revenue in 2014.The new matchup with Carroll Burdick, which has an international focus, gives the firm a broader base and taps into that firm\u2019s strength in product liability and class-action litigation. That is useful expertise for Squire Patton Boggs, which represents the auto-parts supplier Takata, which has faced congressional inquiries into accusations that its airbag inflaters have serious defects that have led to 10 deaths and the recall of millions of airbags.Among Carroll Burdick\u2019s clients are two German car giants, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz.\u201cWith this combination, and the new relationships that come with it, we have even greater opportunities to better serve our clients with strong and developing global businesses,\u201d Mark J. Ruehlmann, the Squire Patton Boggs chairman, said in a statement.The chairman of Carroll Burdick, Matthew Kemner, will serve as a board member of Squire Patton Boggs.\u201cAs we looked to grow and expand the range of services we could offer clients,\u201d Mr. Kemner said, \u201cjoining a firm with the scale, practice breadth and global reputation of Squire Patton Boggs was a logical step,\u201dThe smaller firm, which does not disclose its annual revenue, has offices in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Beijing, Hong Kong and B\u00f6blingen, Germany, near Stuttgart. The merger means the new entity will have 45 offices in 21 countries.The merger is part of the continued consolidation of legal practices in recent years as firms seek to bolster their market shares. There have been 16 such combinations this year, according to Altman Weil, the legal consultancy that keeps tabs on the numbers.The combined firm gives Squire Patton Boggs more of an international outlook, allowing it to edge away from any reputational or other reliance on its lobbying practice, which has struggled in recent years despite having a roster of notable names, including two former senators, Trent Lott and John Breaux.One major blow came after the firm, which lost its driving force when Mr. Boggs died in 2014, had to terminate a major source of income, the sugar industry\u2019s multimillion-dollar court case against corn syrup manufacturers. That was a result of a conflict stemming from representation by the firm of corn syrup manufacturers in another dispute.Advertisement"}

Corbat, a 27 percent pay raise, as the big bank crossed several hurdles on its way toward becoming a more profitable and stable company.Mr. Corbat was awarded total compensation of $16.5 million for last year, up from $13 million in 2014.In addition to his $1.5 million salary, Mr. Corbat was awarded $9 million in stock and about $6 million in a cash award.For the bank, 2015 was certainly better than the previous year, when it failed the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual stress test, agreed to multibillion-dollar mortgage settlements and became embroiled in a series of scandals related to its Mexican operations.Last year, Citigroup earned $17.2 billion, its highest profit since 2006. The bank continued to whittle down its \u201cbad bank,\u201d known as Citi Holdings, which holds many of Citigroup\u2019s unwanted assets.As part of that paring down, Citigroup completed the sale of a subprime lending unit, called OneMain, and sold off other consumer units around the globe.Citigroup also passed its 2015 stress test, which was considered a litmus test for Mr. Corbat\u2019s leadership.This year so far has been a bit rocky for Citigroup as well as for other banks. Shares of Citigroup are down nearly 24 percent since the start of the year, as investors fret about the bank\u2019s exposure to the slowdown in emerging market economies and the collapse in oil prices.Mr. Corbat\u2019s $16.5 million in compensation was slightly higher than the $16 million pay package that Bank of America\u2019s chief executive and chairman, Brian T. Moynihan, received. Mr. Moynihan\u2019s pay package last year was 23 percent greater than his 2014 compensation.JPMorgan Chase increased the pay package of its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, 35 percent, to $27 million last year.The pay package of Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief of Goldman Sachs, was cut for the first time since 2011. Last year, his pay was $23 million, $1 million less than he made in 2014.

The crash dealt a serious blow to Egypt\u2019s vital tourism industry: an important source of hard currency for the country, which relies heavily on imports.Hours after the October downing of the Airbus A321-200, which killed 224 people, Egypt\u2019s local Islamic State affiliate claimed responsibility. The group said it had brought down the plane with a bomb concealed in a soda can.The Russian aircraft disintegrated in the air over the Sinai Desert 23 minutes after taking off from the popular Red Sea resort city of Sharm el Sheikh on Oct. 31. The flight was a charter operation by Metrojet, a Russian airline taking its passengers, nearly all of them Russian tourists, to St. Petersburg.Mr. Sisi seemed unusually ill-tempered during much of his speech \u2014 a sharp contrast to the calm, sweet-talking paternal persona he had carved for himself during and after Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster, which he led with popular and media support.

{"Headline": "Bill Clinton Unleashes Stinging Attack on Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byMILFORD, N.H. \u2014 Bill Clinton uncorked an extended attack on Senator Bernie Sanders on Sunday, harshly criticizing Mr. Sanders and his supporters for what he described as inaccurate and \u201csexist\u201d attacks on Hillary Clinton.\u201cWhen you\u2019re making a revolution you can\u2019t be too careful with the facts,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, deriding Mr. Sanders\u2019s oft-mentioned call for a political revolution.The former president, addressing a few hundred supporters at a junior high school here, portrayed his wife\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination as hypocritical, \u201chermetically sealed\u201d and dishonest.He even likened an incident last year, in which Sanders staffers obtained access to Clinton campaign voter data, to stealing a car with the keys in the ignition.Mr. Clinton discussed the race for nearly 50 minutes, and his comments took on a harder edge the longer he spoke. What began as a testimonial to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s leadership and a statesmanlike lecture on her approach to issues evolved into an angrier recitation of grievances against Mr. Sanders and his fervent supporters.\u201c \u2018Anybody that doesn\u2019t agree with me is a tool of the establishment,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Clinton said, mocking what he described as the central critique of Mrs. Clinton by Mr. Sanders.14 PhotosMr. Clinton\u2019s comments represented an escalation in the language that he and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign have used to attack Mr. Sanders, who has maintained a sizable advantage in the polls here. Mr. Clinton made headlines in 2008 for fiercely defending his wife, and leveling tough attacks on Senator Barack Obama, but he has been largely restrained so far in this campaign.Criticizing Mr. Sanders\u2019s hastily presented health-care plan, which Mr. Clinton claimed the Vermont senator had already disavowed, the former president asked: \u201cIs it good for America? I don\u2019t think so. Is it good for New Hampshire? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe New Hampshire I knew would not have voted for me if I had done that.\u201dBut Mr. Clinton\u2019s most pointed remarks may have been when he took aim at Sanders supporters who, he said, use misogynistic language in attacking Mrs. Clinton. He told the story of a female \u201cprogressive\u201d blogger who defended Mrs. Clinton online through a pseudonym because, he said, the vitriol from Mr. Sanders\u2019s backers was so unrelenting.\u201cShe and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary, to explain why they supported her, have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often, not to mention sexist, to repeat.\u201d Mr. Clinton, growing more demonstrative, added that the liberal journalist Joan Walsh had faced what he called \u201cunbelievable personal attacks\u201d for writing positively about Mrs. Clinton.In a demonstration of how engrossed he is in this campaign, Mr. Clinton recited the names of the regional newspapers that are backing his wife\u2019s campaign and, in a rarity, mentioned Mr. Sanders by name.\u201cBernie took what they said was good about him and put it in his own endorsements,\u201d said Mr. Clinton, fuming that Mr. Sanders used complimentary language from a Nashua Telegraph endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in his own campaign appeals.Then, reflecting the fury among Clinton campaign advisers over what they see as the kinds of behavior Mr. Sanders gets away with, Mr. Clinton noted that the senator\u2019s campaign had used the image of an American Legion officer in New Hampshire without his permission.A week in February 1992 revived Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and made the state hallowed ground for the Clintons.\u201cIf you point it out, it just shows how tied you are to the establishment,\u201d he said.In a response, Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, called it \u201cdisappointing that President Clinton has decided to launch these attacks\u201d and said Mr. Sanders would continue to focus on his message against the rigged economy, campaign finance corruption and income inequality. \u201cObviously the race has changed in New Hampshire and elsewhere in recent days,\u201d Mr. Devine said.The appearance by Mr. Clinton, absent the entourage and crowds that usually surround the former president, was striking and somewhat poignant, and it felt far apart from the frenzied final campaigning happening around the state on Sunday. The junior high school\u2019s small gym was not full, and only a handful of reporters showed up, at a time when campaign events are being flooded with dozens of national and international journalists.But with Mrs. Clinton in Flint, Mich., and other Clinton staffers absorbed in the primary, Mr. Clinton seemed almost on his own: He was introduced by a local mayor and Larry Lucchino, the former chief executive of the Boston Red Sox.Recalling his own, formative experience in this state, Mr. Clinton sounded wistful in reminiscing about his duels with Paul Tsongas, the Massachusetts senator who beat him here.\u201cWhen I campaigned against Paul Tsongas we actually had substantive debates,\u201d he said with perhaps a selective memory given the intense attacks at the time over allegations of Mr. Clinton\u2019s sexual misconduct and his avoidance of the draft.Now, he complained, Mrs. Clinton is suffering through attacks from a would-be purist who, he said, is in reality a veteran politician hardly unfamiliar with the ways of politics.

Well, among other things, the fate of the planet.But the situation on that front has changed drastically for the better in recent years, because we\u2019re now achingly close to achieving a renewable-energy revolution. What\u2019s more, getting that energy revolution wouldn\u2019t require a political revolution. All it would take are fairly modest policy changes, some of which have already happened and others of which are already underway. But those changes won\u2019t happen if the wrong people end up in power.To see what I\u2019m talking about, you need to know something about the current state of climate economics, which has changed far more in recent years than most people seem to realize.To find anything equivalent on the left you have to go far out of the mainstream, to activists who insist that climate change can\u2019t be fought without overthrowing capitalism. Still, my sense is that many Democrats believe that politics as usual isn\u2019t up to the task, that we need a political earthquake to make real action possible. In particular, I keep hearing that the Obama administration\u2019s environmental efforts have been so far short of what\u2019s needed as to be barely worth mentioning.But things are actually much more hopeful than that, thanks to remarkable technological progress in renewable energy.And none of this will require new legislation; we can have an energy revolution even if the crazies retain control of the House.Now, skeptics may point out that even if all these good things happen, they won\u2019t be enough on their own to save the planet. For one thing, we\u2019re only talking about electricity generation, which is a big part of the climate change problem but not the whole thing. For another, we\u2019re only talking about one country when the problem is global.But I\u2019d argue that the kind of progress now within reach could produce a tipping point, in the right direction. Once renewable energy becomes an obvious success and, yes, a powerful interest group, anti-environmentalism will start to lose its political grip. And an energy revolution in America would let us take the lead in global action.Salvation from climate catastrophe is, in short, something we can realistically hope to see happen, with no political miracle necessary. But failure is also a very real possibility. Everything is hanging in the balance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Start to Lose Confidence in Their Currency", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 As the Chinese economy stumbles, wealthy families are increasingly trying to move large sums of money out of the country, worried that the value of the currency will fall and their savings will be worth less.To get around the country\u2019s cash controls, individuals are asking friends or family members to carry or transfer out $50,000 apiece, the annual legal limit in China. A group of 100 people can move $5 million overseas.Some methods are perfectly legal, like investing in real estate elsewhere, buying businesses overseas and paying off debts owed in dollars. Others, like Smurfing, are more dubious, and in certain cases, outright illegal. Chinese customs officials caught a woman last year trying to leave the mainland with $250,000 strapped to her chest and thighs and hidden inside her shoes.If the government cannot keep citizens from rushing to the financial exits, China\u2019s outlook could darken. The swell of outflows is a destabilizing force in China\u2019s slowing economy, threatening to undermine confidence and hurt a banking system that is struggling to deal with a decade-long lending binge.The capital flight is already putting significant pressure on the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi. The government is trying to prevent a free fall in the currency by stepping into the markets and tapping its huge cash hoard to shore up the renminbi. But a deep erosion of those reserves may set off further outflows and create turbulence in the markets.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.China is also trying to put the brakes on outflows, by tightening its grip on the country\u2019s links to the global financial system. The government, for example, just started to clamp down on people\u2019s use of bank cards to buy overseas life insurance policies.Such moves have trade-offs. The limits create concerns that the government is pulling back on reform efforts that China needs to keep growth humming in the decades to come. But the near-term pressure also requires serious attention, given the global shock waves.\u201cThe currency has become a very near-term threat to financial stability,\u201d said Charlene Chu, an economist at Autonomous Research.Navigating such problems is fairly new for China.For years, China soaked up much of the world\u2019s investment money, as the economy grew at annual rates in the double digits. A largely closed financial system kept China\u2019s own money corralled inside the country.Now, with growth slowing, money is gushing out of the country. And the government has a looser grip on the spigot, because China dismantled some currency restrictions to open up its economy in recent years.\u201cCompanies don\u2019t want renminbi and individuals don\u2019t want renminbi,\u201d said Shaun Rein, the founder of the China Market Research Group. \u201cThe renminbi was a sure bet for a long time, but now that it\u2019s not, a lot of people want to get out.\u201dManaging the situation has proved complicated for the government.The Chinese central bank is fighting the downward pressure by purchasing large sums of renminbi, selling dollars from its currency reserves to do so. China\u2019s reserves sank by $108 billion in December and an additional $99 billion in January, to $3.23 trillion. A year and a half ago, they stood at $4 trillion.And the renminbi still faces plenty of headwinds.The government has been cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, making it less attractive for savers to keep their money in the country. Corporate profits are shrinking because China has too many spare steel mills, car factories and empty houses, leading investors to seek better returns elsewhere.Ronald Wan, a Hong Kong money manager who is on the boards of numerous state-owned enterprises in mainland China, said that pessimism was becoming the consensus. \u201cAmong the companies I have been in contact with,\u201d he said, \u201call of them have the intention of moving money out of the country.\u201dThe government\u2019s next move, in part, will depend on whether it can stem the outflows, or at least slow them significantly. And in China, it is a bit of a cat-and-mouse game.Individuals can move $50,000 a year across China\u2019s borders. Companies and sophisticated investors have more freedom to send out money legally for big-ticket purchases and investments. Overseas and domestic companies, which maintain bank accounts in various currencies, can also shift their cash, as well as borrow based on which currency they think will fall in value.But unofficial methods abound.Companies have filed misleading invoices to keep more profits outside the country, although Chinese authorities have cracked down on the practice.Mr. Rein described doing market research with a wealthy woman in Shanghai who changed $7 million this winter from renminbi into dollars, by using 140 relatives, friends and even friends\u2019 relatives who each carried $50,000 apiece.The government, though, is trying to cut off some routes.Two years ago, the government gave permission for insurers to invest 15 percent of their assets overseas, up from 1.5 percent. But China abruptly told insurers this winter to suspend many of their overseas plans, according to Hong Kong financiers.Beijing has restricted the withdrawal of renminbi from overseas branches of Chinese banks. In Shenzhen, banks have begun requiring that residents make reservations up to a week in advance if they want to change the daily maximum of $10,000 worth of Chinese currency into dollars.In January, Zou Tai, a hospital worker from east central China, caught an early morning flight to buy a $50,000 life insurance policy in Hong Kong. Scores of Chinese customers have been doing the same to get money out of the country, since the policy is bought in renminbi and can be cashed out in American dollars.\u201cThe buying power of the renminbi keeps dropping,\u201d Mrs. Zou said. \u201cI feel that China\u2019s leaders will have no choice but to devalue the renminbi.\u201dMrs. Zou acted in the nick of time, because the government is now pushing back. UnionPay International, a government-controlled bank card company, recently announced that it would start strictly enforcing a pre-existing but widely ignored limit on overseas insurance purchases of $5,000 a year per card.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Bond Yield Slides Below Zero and Stocks Fall", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Given Japan\u2019s outsize public debt, holding an i.o.u. from its government might seem like a risky proposition that would require the promise of a substantial reward.But this week, as global economic fears drove money into safer assets, investors in Japanese debt began essentially performing that service for free.On Tuesday, the yield on Japanese 10-year bonds, the benchmark of government borrowing, dropped to zero for the first time. They quickly fell into negative territory, meaning some investors were buying bonds despite knowing that if they held them until maturity, they would come away with less money than they paid.And on top of that, a strong yen dragged Japanese stocks down more than 5 percent in the worst trading day this year. The market opened lower again on Wednesday.The move was intended to bolster the Japanese economy, but the flight by global investors to perceived safe assets is complicating the effort.Like savers depositing money at a local bank, banks keep their own unused cash at the central bank. The interest they earn on those reserves \u2014 or do not earn, as the case may be \u2014 helps determine the cost of other kinds of borrowing and lending.The Bank of Japan\u2019s new policy is intended to stimulate the economy, which narrowly avoided falling into recession last quarter. By making it unprofitable for banks to hold cash, Mr. Kuroda hopes to encourage them to lend more freely and get businesses and households to spend. He also wants to give a lift to consumer prices, which have been sagging after a welcome but short-lived bout of inflation.In other countries that have introduced negative interest rates, like Sweden and Switzerland, government bond yields have also been pushed below zero.Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said that the reversal in bond yields was bound to happen eventually, given the negative interest rate policy, but it occurred more quickly than many expected. The imposition of negative rates on bank reserves will not even take effect until next week.The speed, he said, was because of a factor that is complicating Mr. Kuroda\u2019s stimulus program: a rush by global investors to buy the yen, which is seen as a safe currency at a time of economic uncertainty. The resulting rise in the yen\u2019s exchange rate has hurt the Japanese stock market and darkened the outlook for inflation, canceling out much of the efforts of the Bank of Japan, or B.O.J.\u201cThe China slowdown, falling oil prices, fears about a U.S. recession \u2014 the headwinds facing the B.O.J. are very strong,\u201d Mr. Adachi said.One goal of negative interest rates is to redirect investors\u2019 money from bonds into more theoretically productive assets like property and stocks. But in at least one sector, finance, the policy has deepened the equities rout. Banks are reluctant to pass the costs of negative rates on to depositors, for fear they will pull their money out of their accounts en masse. Instead, the banks are absorbing the penalties themselves, cutting into profits.This week the yen has strengthened to a little over 114 to the dollar, about 10 percent stronger than its most recent low. That is bad news for the many Japanese companies that earn revenues outside Japan: the stronger the yen, the less their foreign-currency earnings contribute to profits.The Nikkei 225-stock average dropped 5.4 percent Tuesday, its biggest one-day drop since May 2013, as investors reacted to the potential blow to corporate earnings. It was down a further 0.7 percent in early trading Wednesday morning.Easy money from the central bank had kept the yen relatively weak since 2013, but a reversal appears to be gathering pace despite the central bank\u2019s latest move.Japan\u2019s status as a haven for investors can seem puzzling. It is carrying the heaviest government debt load in the world, at the equivalent of about two and a half years\u2019 economic output. But most experts are sanguine about the risks. The debt is still amply funded by local savings. And taking the private sector into account, Japan as a whole is a major net creditor, not a borrower. That greatly reduces the risk of instability.For now, the bigger danger appears to be that efforts to get its economy growing again will stall. Stimulus by the Bank of Japan has played an outsize role in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic policy, known as Abenomics. One concern for government and central bank officials is that companies will resist demands to increase workers\u2019 pay as the stronger yen eats into profits. That would block what the bank and many economists see as a crucial means of promoting spending and inflation.\u201cCorporate management now has many excuses for not raising wages,\u201d Mr. Adachi said. He added that the Bank of Japan would likely impose even steeper negative rates, something Mr. Kuroda hinted was possible in a policy speech last week.\u201cOne purpose of the B.O.J.\u2019s move was to dispel the idea that it lacks ammunition,\u201d he said. \u201cKuroda will continue to try and surprise the market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Capitalism More Appealing", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byPolitical EconomyCapitalism is under attack. Witness the popularity of Bernie Sanders, the socialist running neck and neck in the opinion polls with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Monday. To rehabilitate the system of free enterprise, it needs to be buttressed by a modern conception of fairness.Viewed from Mars, capitalism has been a huge success. Free enterprise has generated wealth and removed hundreds of millions of people from poverty. But viewed from Earth, what often stands out is how many have been left behind by the march of globalization and technology, while others have gotten ahead by methods more foul than fair.The classic left-wing response to the perceived unfairness of capitalism has been to tax and spend. That doesn\u2019t work well. High taxes can sap entrepreneurial spirit, while high welfare spending can leave poorer people dependent on handouts.Just because that response has been tried and failed doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be tried again. The success of left-wing populists like the Syriza party in Greece and the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party in Britain shows that such ideas still have appeal.This makes it important for centrists \u2014 whether they consider themselves left-wing progressives, radical centrists or liberal conservatives \u2014 to articulate a credible middle road. It should be based less on the view that fairness is the same as equality and more on the idea that people should get a fair crack at a good standard of life.There are two main aspects. First, it is important to tackle the foul methods by which people and companies get ahead and that make it tougher for hard-working, honest people to make progress.One example of this is evading or avoiding tax. This is rife in some countries, like Greece. But it is a global problem that makes people furious everywhere. Witness the anger in January in Britain over how Google, the Internet giant, was seemingly able to run rings around the authorities and pay what looks like a tiny amount of tax.Corruption, which is again widespread across the world, also creates indignation. Sweetheart deals between politicians and business line the pockets of the few to the detriment of the many.Another justified target of ire is the existence of markets that favor insiders at the expense of the general public. Finance is at the top of the list. The global financial crisis exposed how many bankers had a one-way bet: During the good times, they raked it in; during the bad, the state picked up the pieces. This was a mockery of how capitalism is supposed to work.Monopolies and vested interests are yet another source of resentment. Sometimes, the culprits are the oligarchs who pull the strings in government to get the rules written in their favor by giving bribes to politicians or senior officials.But often the beneficiaries of vested interests are not particularly rich or powerful as individuals. Greece is one of the best examples of this phenomenon. Over decades, it perfected the art of doling out special privileges to such an array of groups \u2014 farmers, notaries, pharmacists, civil servants, teachers and ordinary retirees as well as shipping magnates \u2014 that its economy gummed up.Such practices sap entrepreneurial spirit, but they do so by locking people out of opportunity rather than by using the methods of old-fashioned socialism. They also inflict bigger taxes on honest citizens and higher prices on consumers.A modern conception of fairness would put an assault of foul methods at its heart. But it would do more than that.Although successful societies need welfare states, most of Europe\u2019s welfare states need refocusing. Part of the problem is that too much government spending is directed to what Europeans call the middle class rather than the needy.The situation varies from country to country, but the main goodies are generous state pensions for middle-to-high earners and tax breaks that benefit relatively well-off people. To be fair, some countries are reining these in. For example, Britain no longer offers such attractive incentives for rich people to save for their retirement. But in many countries, there is a lot that could be done.The money saved from funding this middle-class welfare state could be redeployed where it is needed. The priority would often be to invest in schools, so children get a fair start in life, and in adult education, so that older people whose skills become obsolete as a result of technology can retrain.Such a conception of fairness is not really new. It has a lot in common with classic liberalism. Nor is it dead. Successful politicians around the world \u2014 like Narendra Modi of India with his fight against corruption or Matteo Renzi of Italy with his willingness to confront some vested interests \u2014 are deploying some strategies from this playbook.It is a rich source of ideas with which to tackle the unfairness of capitalism without falling for the inefficiency of socialism.Hugo Dixon writes a biweekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s 3 Mandates: Price Stability, Jobs and ... Wall Street?", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byEconomic ViewSuppose a visitor from the future comes and tells you these facts about the financial markets in the year 2030: The stock market has fallen sharply, as have the price of oil and investors\u2019 expectations for interest rate increases over the next couple of years.You would probably assume that the economy was heading down the tubes and in real trouble, quite possibly moving toward a recession.A different visitor from the future arrives and tells you of this state of the world in 2035: The jobless rate is below 5 percent, and employers are hiring at a rapid clip and giving workers their biggest raises in years. Service industries that account for a large percentage of the economy are growing nicely, and consumers are spending money at a steady pace. Everything is just fine.You\u2019ve surely already guessed that both these descriptions apply to the United States in 2016, with big implications for businesses of all stripes and for the presidential election. But the tension \u2014 between a miserable few months in the financial markets and generally solid economic data \u2014 also exposes one of the thorniest questions with which policy makers at the Federal Reserve must grapple.If it\u2019s market data, then Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, and her colleagues should forestall any further interest rate increases indefinitely and perhaps reverse their quarter-point increase in December and entertain instead more radical easing measures. If it\u2019s economic data, they should feel comfortable proceeding with pushing interest rates higher.But beneath that question lies an even harder one. Can Ms. Yellen wean the economy off what is often called \u201cthe Greenspan put?\u201d And should she?The Greenspan put is the idea \u2014 much disputed within the halls of the Fed, but taken for granted in much of the financial world \u2014 that the central bank will forever stand willing to intervene to keep markets from falling too much. Greenspan is, of course, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, and a put is an options contract that insures against decline.Perhaps most famously, in October 1987, the morning after the stock market crashed, the Fed offered this one-sentence statement: \u201cThe Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation\u2019s central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.\u201dIt did the trick. The market stabilized, and the United States economy kept growing for four more years. Eleven years later, when a crisis in emerging markets seemed to threaten the booming American economy, the Fed cut interest rates three times, successfully containing the damage. When the dot-com bubble was collapsing in 2001, it did the same, less successfully.In each case, Fed officials argued that they were not focused on trying to prop up the market for its own sake, but were trying to keep the economy on an even keel despite market turmoil. When the stock market drops, Americans are less wealthy and so would be expected to spend less money, and capital is more expensive for businesses, which would tend to make them less inclined to invest.While headlines tend to focus on the stock market during periods of turmoil, these episodes usually involve a lot more happening in the financial world beneath the surface, like the interest rates on riskier bonds spiking relative to those of safer bonds, and the drying up of credit availability. In effect, the Fed cut rates in these episodes not to try to bail out investors in the stock market, but to offset these effects for ordinary consumers and businesses.That\u2019s the line you\u2019ll hear from Fed officials, anyway. The challenge is that, in practice, this behavior looks an awful lot like the Fed stepping in to bail out the stock market \u2014 so much so that financial markets tend to price in lower future interest rates whenever there is a drop in the stock market, as has happened in the early weeks of 2016.The Fed started the year with signals that it would most likely raise its short-term interest rate target four times in 2016. After an approximately 10 percent drop in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index \u2014 but steady economic data \u2014 futures markets now suggest only one rate rise is the most likely outcome. In other words, markets seem to believe that the Greenspan put has become the Yellen put.And to the degree that the Greenspan put is real, and continues, it raises difficult questions.It might seem great to keep markets from falling too much, but that can create complacency and just encourage investors to take greater risk \u2014 creating much more damage when the bubble ultimately pops. This arguably is part of what happened in the 2008 financial crisis: that years of Greenspanian work to keep markets from plummeting had made the entire financial system brittle and overleveraged.There\u2019s a simpler moral case against central banks propping up falling markets, which is that it implies a government entity using public resources to keep a predominantly wealthy investor class from losing money. The interests of Wall Street and Main Street don\u2019t always align.There are some hints that the Yellen Fed is reluctant to react to the latest palpitations in markets. On Tuesday, the Fed vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, noted that there had been episodes in which markets tumbled but no broader slump ensued.The challenge, as Mr. Fischer suggested, is to decide which type of market move this really is.Is it more like mid-2007, when turmoil in financial markets was the early warning of a recession that wouldn\u2019t begin until the end of that year? Or is it more like 1998, when the Fed cut rates in response to market turmoil that never caused economic ripples on United States shores?He and Ms. Yellen will show their conclusions through their actions \u2014 and in the process send a signal to Wall Street about whether, a decade after Mr. Greenspan left office, his approach to the job persists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Unicorn", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital.For a moment, there was no more prestigious endorsement for a technology start-up than joining the so-called Unicorn Club, consisting of more than 150 private technology companies valued at a billion dollars or more. Now, with valuations deflating, it\u2019s often viewed as more of a scarlet letter.However, because the only membership criterion is valuation, the members of this club have about as much in common with each other as a gram of gold has with a barrel of oil.Some private market valuations got ahead of themselves, requiring adjustment. But that\u2019s hardly remarkable; this happens frequently in public markets, too. The issue is that many unicorns are not sustainable; they have a shiny veneer of revenue growth, without a sufficiently durable competitive advantage to create substantial, long-term value.Several well-known Internet companies, particularly the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now a unit of Alphabet \u2014 have built powerful positions. The market recognized this by adding more than $250 billion in market cap to this group over the last 12 months \u2014 even while the broader market was down more than 10 percent.The huge success of the FANG stocks, however, distracts from the reality that the web has ground down the barriers to entry in many technology markets, increasing transparency and competition. For new entrants, lower barriers create opportunity. But they create the same chance for scores of other start-ups, too, making it challenging to build a durable advantage.Just when a firm seems to be getting a dominant foothold, a plethora of start-ups emerge to erode its advantage. Less than a year ago, GrubHub had a market cap of more than $4 billion and seemed to be on the way to a powerful monopoly in food delivery. But myriad start-ups, backed by billions of dollars, have been competing for its market. Investors no longer see GrubHub as a putative monopoly. Accordingly, its stock is down more than 60 percent over the last year.There are limited sources of genuine competitive advantage in Silicon Valley, as with other businesses. Most significant are economies of scale. McDonald\u2019s buys ingredients more cheaply than a stand-alone burger joint, and its marketing costs are spread across tens of millions of customers.For technology companies, the holy grail is a specially durable subset of scale advantage: network effects, virtually unknown in the rest of the economy. The most potent flavor is on the consumer side, where a service\u2019s utility increases as more people use it. That creates a powerful barrier: If one\u2019s friends and family are all on Facebook, an alternative social network, even with superior features, is unlikely to be tempting \u2014 which is why Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users each month, and rising. A Big Mac, in contrast, does not taste any better even with millions of simultaneous consumers.In Silicon Valley, virtually every pitch deck claims network effects \u2014 but they are rarely spotted in the wild. The largest on-demand home cleaning service in any locale may have a cost and speed advantage versus competitors, which helps attract more consumers and more cleaning people.But this virtuous cycle, despite the common misconception, is just a garden variety impact of local scale \u2014 not network effects. A large customer base does not make any service even a smidgen more valuable to someone getting their home cleaned. For a small discount, customers will happily try an alternative cleaning service, on-demand car valet or flash sale. Monopolies in these categories, like most others, are unlikely. In contrast, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it would take to pry Snapchat out of a teenager\u2019s hands \u2014 but it sure wouldn\u2019t be a cheap coupon.It\u2019s not just start-ups that find it hard to build a monopoly. Even in the rarefied air of the FANG stocks, monopolies are hard to come by.Amazon is a powerhouse with substantial scale advantages \u2014 its latest quarterly revenue was $36 billion, and it has increasing customer loyalty, including more than 50 million paying Prime subscribers. But Amazon is far from a monopoly. In retail, beyond a few narrow categories where it dominates (notably: books), Amazon is a leading player in intensely competitive markets. In cloud computing, its innovative Amazon Web Services is the leading player serving start-up customers and is making inroads with enterprises. But it does not have the cloud to itself. It is locked in ferocious competition with Microsoft, Google and several others. Unsurprisingly, in the decade since its debut, the service has cut prices more than 50 times.Similarly, Netflix is the leading subscription video distributor. It has more than 75 million subscribers and is producing hundreds of hours of original content. Netflix has scale advantages and strong customer captivity, but zero network effects; it does not become more entertaining with more subscribers. It is well placed to create enormous value as a long-term leader in this market but is far from a monopoly. It\u2019s too late for start-ups to enter the fray, but there are already formidable competitors, such as HBO and Amazon, driving up content acquisition costs and keeping a lid on consumer prices. Netflix is already on track to spend more than $5 billion on content this year \u2014 more than half its forecast revenue. And other deep-pocketed players, such as YouTube and Apple, have adjacent businesses that are strong enough to be potentially serious future players as well.That Silicon Valley is not all bulletproof billion-dollar companies and \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets is no cause for gloom. The current environment is a reminder of the primacy of business economics and market structure. At least for the moment, investors will revert to saving billion-dollar valuations for exceptionally defensible, growing businesses. That closes the chapter on the ill-fated unicorn experiment, which valued growth at any cost. Hopefully, it also spells the end of the term itself \u2014 which predictably turned out to be as useless a descriptor on the way down as it was on the way up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Livin\u2019 Bernie Sanders\u2019s Danish Dream", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAmerican capitalism has always been distinct from continental European capitalism. We\u2019ve had more entrepreneurial creativity but less security. Our system has favored higher living standards for consumers while theirs has favored stability for employees and producers.For the past several decades, the United States has had a bipartisan consensus that we should stick to our style of capitalism and our style of welfare state. There has always been a broad consensus that a continent-size nation like ours had to be diverse and decentralized, with a vibrant charitable sector and a great variety of spending patterns and lifestyles.American values have always been biased toward individualism, achievement and flexibility \u2014 nurturing disruptive dynamos like Bell Labs, Walmart, Whole Foods, Google and Apple \u2014 and less toward dirigisme, order and economic equality.First, Sanders would centralize power in Washington. If you radically increase the amount of money going to the Washington establishment, as Sanders would, you\u2019re giving that establishment greater resources to control American life.Second, Sanders would weaken the ability of members of the middle class to make choices about their own lives. He would raise taxes on the rich, but there is only so much money you can squeeze out of such a small group of people. European welfare states generally rely on a highly regressive value-added/sales tax \u2014 usually around 20 to 25 percent.Middle classes across Europe bear a much higher tax load than the American middle class. As Austan Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to President Obama, has noted, you really can\u2019t have a Swedish-style welfare state without a broad high tax burden. That means less spending power for most Americans, and fewer resources to choose one\u2019s own lifestyle.It\u2019s possible that entrepreneurs, company founders and others would pay these rates without changing their behavior, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it. When you make risk-taking less rewarding, you get fewer risk-takers, which is exactly what you see across the Atlantic. When you raise taxes that high, the Elon Musks of the world find other places to build their companies.Fourth, Sanders would Europeanize American public universities. It sounds great to make college free. In fact, it\u2019s a hugely expensive program that would mostly benefit the already affluent.There\u2019s nothing wrong with living in northern Europe. I\u2019ve lived there myself. It\u2019s just not the homeland we\u2019ve always known. Bernie Sanders\u2019s America is starkly different from Alexander Hamilton\u2019s or Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s America or even Bill Clinton\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s America.It\u2019s amazing that so many young people want to mimic a continent that has been sluggish for decades. It\u2019s amazing that so many look to the future and want a country that would be a lot less vibrant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Comic Take on Wall Street by an Ex-Bear Stearns Executive", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byA strong, intelligent woman struggles to break through the double-pane glass ceiling of a top investment firm on Wall Street.A rich, good-looking investment banker makes a killing on mortgage-backed securities, the toxic bundles of debt that in 2008 put the economy on the edge of collapse.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I made light of anyone\u2019s pain,\u201d Ms. Sherry said, sitting at the dining room table of her Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking the Central Park reservoir. Ms. Sherry said she wanted to write about the mortgage crisis in an engaging way that ordinary readers could understand and also show them that many bankers were as hoodwinked as the rest of the public.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to bash Wall Street, and we hear a lot of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI also wanted to make clear to the reader the good that banks do as well as the bad.\u201dMs. Sherry\u2019s novel is a breezy comedy in the style of \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary.\u201dLike her heroine, Ms. Sherry worked on the Bear Stearns trading floor, then a notoriously rowdy place. She said she took the frat-boy antics in stride. \u201cI felt embarrassed sometimes, but not unsafe,\u201d she said.In her novel, she presents those experiences as farce. A comic tone, she said, would make the subject more accessible and \u201cwiden the conversation.\u201dThe novel\u2019s dueling themes divide the mass-market publishing world. Some observers say readers might embrace it as a lighthearted but inspiring empowerment parable. \u201cI think it can work,\u201d said Louisa Ermelino, the reviews director at Publishers Weekly, who has not read the work but knows its gist. \u201cEven though she is rich and powerful, she\u2019s still a woman up against men in suits on Wall Street.\u201dFor other students of the genre, though, it\u2019s a step too far in favor of the 1 percent. \u201cI would expect a novel set in the mortgage crisis to look at the precarious situations of more ordinary working women,\u201d said Suzanne Ferriss, an English professor at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and a co-editor of \u201cChick Lit: The New Woman\u2019s Fiction.\u201d\u201cThere was a backlash against \u2018Primates of Park Avenue,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Ferriss noted, referring to a tongue-in-cheek memoir by Wednesday Martin about trying to fit in on the Upper East Side. \u201cThat suggests to me that in the current climate, this might not have many followers.\u201dThis question of whether feminism outweighs populism echoes the countervailing currents in the presidential race. Voters in the Democratic primary are watching an accomplished, experienced member of the establishment, Hillary Clinton, argue that the top echelons of power are rigged against women, while her main rival, Bernie Sanders, has soared in the polls by saying that the system is rigged in favor of the rich and powerful. Republicans are watching a billionaire populist, Donald Trump, clash with Megyn Kelly, a star anchor at Fox News who questioned his respect for women in a debate.When asked whom she supported, Ms. Sherry smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m waiting for Michael Bloomberg to get in the race.\u201dThe heroine of \u201cOpening Belle\u201d resembles Ms. Sherry, but with a little less gilt and gloss. \u201cI wanted her to be relatable,\u201d Ms. Sherry said.Isabelle, blond and 5-foot-11, has three children and a handsome husband who doesn\u2019t work (but still doesn\u2019t do his share of housework). They live on Central Park West.In a good year, Isabelle earns $3 million. Ms. Sherry said she considered how that would play to readers, but she wanted to be realistic. \u201cI hate the term \u2018Manhattan poor,\u2019 \u201d she said, but added that after taxes, as a couple with one income and three private-school tuitions, \u201cThey weren\u2019t living large.\u201d\u201cIsabelle thinks it\u2019s O.K. to want to make money,\u201d Ms. Sherry said, \u201cand ambition is not a bad thing.\u201dMs. Sherry interviewed former colleagues and a new generation of bankers. She said she found that while the most overt harassment has generally stopped, hurdles remain, particularly for working mothers. \u201cThey feel they never performed better, yet they feel written off,\u201d she said.At Bear Stearns, Ms. Sherry said she and her female peers jokingly referred to themselves as \u201cThe Glass Ceiling Club.\u201d In the novel, Isabelle joins a secret society of the same name. Her female colleagues share their grievances about men and the young female assistants on the trading floor who flirt with their bosses and let them think all women welcome their advances. One dresses so provocatively she is nicknamed \u201cNaked Girl.\u201dMs. Sherry said her editors took out one scene she wrote where a woman goes to lunch with her boss to discuss her accounts and he instead invites her to spend the afternoon in bed. Ms. Sherry noted that she knows women who had the same experience in real life.One is Sandra Ripert, a real estate agent today who was a Bear Stearns assistant 25 years ago and an aspiring trader who felt she wasn\u2019t taken seriously because she lacked the right degrees or connections. \u201cAs a woman and as a Latina \u2014 I was very sultry-looking \u2014 it was hard to get ahead,\u201d Ms. Ripert said.In the early 1990s, Ms. Ripert said, when she was earning $24,000 a year, a boss invited her to lunch and she thought it meant she was in line for promotion. Instead, she said, her boss told her he had booked a room for them. She left the firm not long after.Back then, Ms. Ripert said, she found Ms. Sherry \u201cvery professional and very quiet,\u201d and also enviable. \u201cAt that time, you just wanted to be a Maureen Sherry.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Democratic Debate, Candidates Clash on Money\u2019s Role", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byMrs. Clinton, lobbing her harshest assault yet in their race for the Democratic presidential nomination, said months of criticism by Mr. Sanders over her taking speaking fees from Wall Street banks amounted to a suggestion that she was corrupt \u2014 or, as she put it, a \u201cvery artful smear.\u201d It was the sort of cutting remark she usually reserves for Republicans, and it drew boos from many in the audience at the University of New Hampshire.\u201cThere is this attack that he is putting out, which really comes down to, anybody who took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just absolutely reject that, senator. And I really don\u2019t think these attacks by insinuation and innuendo are worthy of you. Enough is enough. If you\u2019ve got something to say, say it directly.\u201dMr. Sanders, who largely kept his cool in the debate, ignored the broadside and instead reiterated his familiar critique that a \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting Mrs. Clinton is funded in part by banks.\u201cThere is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cIt is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.\u201dThe ferocity of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks in the debate was risky, given that many voters, including some Democrats, already have an unfavorable opinion of her. She is also running far behind Mr. Sanders in the polls leading up to Tuesday\u2019s primary in New Hampshire, and her attacks \u2014 while geared toward undercutting his popularity here \u2014 might backfire with some undecided voters who have positive feelings about Mr. Sanders.Mrs. Clinton, appearing tense and even angry at times, was particularly sensitive about receiving millions of dollars in speaking fees, including $675,000 for three speeches from Goldman Sachs. She downplayed her turn on the lecture circuit, noting that she had also addressed other groups such as the American Camping Association and that the banks merely wanted to hear her views on world affairs.But she did acknowledge that she had not \u201cdone the job I should in explaining my record\u201d about financial regulation, suggesting that is why she had been unable to beat back questions about her speaking fees. Yet when asked if she would release all the transcripts of her speeches to banks, she hedged.\u201cI will look into it,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the status, but I will certainly look into it.\u201dBut they kept putting their own personal spin on the word \u201cprogressive,\u201d with Mrs. Clinton deriding Mr. Sanders as the \u201cself-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism\u201d and accusing him of judging her unfairly. Rebutting Mr. Sanders\u2019s claim that she is a political moderate, Mrs. Clinton sought to align herself with some of the most popular names in Democratic politics to suggest that Mr. Sanders was impugning them, not just her, with what she described as a purity test.\u201cThe root of that word, progressive, is progress, but I\u2019ve heard Senator Sanders\u2019s comments and it\u2019s really caused me to wonder who\u2019s left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cUnder his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street.\u201dMr. Sanders, asked if President Obama was a progressive, at first did not answer the question, instead bringing up a comment by Mrs. Clinton when she called herself a moderate. But he ultimately took on the question. \u201cDo I think President Obama is a progressive? Yeah, I do,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI disagree with him on a number of issues, including the trade agreement, but, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.\u201dMrs. Clinton, who is leading in national polls and narrowly won the Iowa caucuses on Monday, departed from the approach she used at Democratic forums late last year when she largely ignored Mr. Sanders and focused her fire on Republicans. On Thursday, though, there was only a fleeting mention of Donald J. Trump as she went after Mr. Sanders with an intensity that reflected a nomination fight worthy of the name.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.The debate was the first to feature only Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, and the narrower aperture revealed significant differences. Mrs. Clinton seemed more tense at times in their rapid-fire exchanges. Mr. Sanders seemed surprised at times by the level of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vitriol, but it never threw him off his central message.\u201cMillions of Americans are giving up on the political process, and they\u2019re giving up on the political process because they understand that the economy is rigged,\u201d he said. He zeroed in on wealthy Americans and Wall Street firms giving huge sums of money to candidates \u2014 an implicit criticism of Mrs. Clinton, though he did not say her by name.Mr. Sanders twice let opportunities go by when he could have pressed Mrs. Clinton on her taking speaking fees from banks. Instead, he ignored her and presented his own well-honed lecture about what he described as a corrupt system in which the financial institutions have outsize political influence and are treated with kid gloves when they break the law.\u201cOne of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars apiece. That is what the political revolution means.\u201dMrs. Clinton repeatedly tried to frame Mr. Sanders as a politician who has had ambitious ideas for decades but little to show for it. \u201cThe numbers just don\u2019t add up from what Senator Sanders is proposing,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cA progressive is someone who makes progress. That\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201dMr. Sanders dismissed the idea that his record in Congress showed he was unable to enact major changes. \u201cWell I haven\u2019t quite run for president before,\u201d he said.While their disagreements were more muted, the two also clashed over foreign policy. And, once again, it was Mrs. Clinton going on the offensive. She suggested the senator was na\u00efve for wanting to insert Iranian troops into Syria and suggested he would be too hasty to normalize relations with the government of Iran.\u201cYou are voting for both a president and a commander in chief,\u201d she said, speaking directly to voters.Mr. Sanders responded by invoking her 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war to question her judgment and recalled that, in the 2008 Democratic primary, she had called Mr. Obama na\u00efve \u201cbecause he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.\u201dMrs. Clinton, asked if Mr. Sanders could win the general election, said she had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the Sanders campaign but believed he would \u201cface the most withering onslaught from Republicans.\u201d She then tacitly suggested that Mr. Sanders\u2019s left-wing views would not be popular in some states in November.\u201cIt will put the nominee into the spotlight,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been vetted. There\u2019s hardly anything you don\u2019t know about me.\u201dMrs. Clinton said she was \u201c100 percent confident\u201d that she did not face any legal threat from the federal investigations into her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Mr. Sanders, in turn, said he would stand by his past pledges not to politicize the issue.The biting exchanges at the start of the debate, though, seemed long gone as the forum concluded.\u201cIf I\u2019m so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Mr. Sanders returned the peace offering, noting that campaigns can \u201cget out of hand.\u201d But he said he respected Mrs. Clinton and that their shared views were far superior to those held by Republicans.This prompted broad smiles from them both, an impromptu handshake and a loud ovation from appreciative Democrats in the audience.Advertisement"}
