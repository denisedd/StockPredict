{"Headline": "Twitter, to Save Itself, Must Scale Back World-Swallowing Ambitions", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtTwitter is the world\u2019s most important social network.Wall Street has only one template of success for an Internet company: Google and, later, Facebook. By filing for an initial public offering, Twitter was telling the world that it was part of the same club \u2014 that there was no upper bound to its business aims, and that it would try to build a money machine that matched the size and importance of its service.But what if the best path for Twitter, as a service, is for Twitter the company to abandon that dream? What if becoming a $25 billion, $50 billion or $100 billion world-swallowing Internet giant just isn\u2019t in the cards for a niche service like Twitter?Perhaps there\u2019s more promise in a future as an independent but private company; as a small and sustainable division of some larger tech or media conglomerate; or even as a venture that operates more like a nonprofit foundation.Even if Twitter intends to remain a public corporation \u2014 because there does not seem to be much appetite, nor a very obvious mechanism, for investors to take it private \u2014 it\u2019s time for Mr. Dorsey to reset expectations for what his company can become. Twitter should think of itself and portray itself to investors as more of a public utility than as a business that never stops growing, and that could ever hope to approach the market value of Facebook.This does not mean that Twitter should abandon making money. Twitter can still run a fine business that generates enough to maintain and improve the reach of the service. But every Internet company doesn\u2019t have to be the biggest, boldest, always-growing entity we are conditioned to expect.Instead of aiming for something like Facebook, Twitter could mold itself on some other template for success. It could become a venture like Wikipedia, run by a nonprofit that depends on donations, or a business like The New York Times Company, a publicly traded enterprise controlled by a family that has a preference for journalistic ambition.In other words, Twitter should make clear that there are limits to the scope of its business ambitions, and that it is guided by a philosophical bias for the health of the service over an ambition to grow at any cost.There\u2019s a simple reason for Mr. Dorsey to consider some other path: Implausible expectations are a setup for a bleak future. After losing its dominance as a search engine, Yahoo has faced more than a decade of struggle mainly because it has tried too long to become the one-stop portal that it isn\u2019t.In that effort it has squandered talent and money and run through more chief executives than you\u2019d find at a Brooks Brothers sale. If, instead of pursuing the moon, Yahoo had vastly lowered its ambitions and planned to do one or two things really well, it could have found a sustainable path forward.Clarifying Twitter\u2019s mission would be painful for the people who work at the company. There could be more layoffs and a plummeting of the equity they hold in the company if it were to go private. It would also be painful for investors who bought in to the company expecting it to be the next big thing.But limiting Twitter\u2019s scope would almost certainly be better for the service. Twitter needs to improve its product: It should have better ways of addressing abuse and harassment, and it should be easier for users to find tweets about topics that interest them. But it isn\u2019t clear that the solutions to these problems are found in growth.Mr. Dash pointed out that making Twitter easier for new people to join could in fact worsen the problems of harassment. \u201cThe discussion is always about reducing friction to joining,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one of the things that might drive better behavior might be to increase friction \u2014 to make it harder to sign up. But nobody\u2019s having that discussion.\u201dSetting a cap on Twitter\u2019s business scope could also tame some of the overreactions that occur whenever the company tries to make reasonable improvements to its service.This week, in anticipation of what turned out to be a modest feature that recommends interesting tweets to people, thousands of users on the service lost their minds predicting that Twitter as we know it was soon to be dead.I suspect they are leery because they see a company being pushed to change by Wall Street, for reasons that aren\u2019t exactly obvious to the people who now love and value Twitter as it is. They see their favorite band straining to become U2. And they hate U2.Twitter, as it is right now, is mostly pretty good for lots and lots of people. Facebook has five times as many users, Instagram is as luxurious as a European vacation, and Snapchat is too cool for school. But because Twitter is an accessible, real-time network that has become the nerve center of the world\u2019s journalists, politicians, activists and agitants, it has, for better or worse, demonstrated an unrivaled capacity to influence real things in the real world.\u201cTwitter has created space for the amplification of the voice of marginalized people in ways that we have not seen before,\u201d said DeRay McKesson, one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cIt has redefined our understanding of the public sphere to be more inclusive and more accessible and to have substantive impact on real-world events.\u201dOf course, Twitter could be better. But it does not need a wholesale overhaul just for the sake of fueling growth.\u201cTwitter maybe hasn\u2019t evolved the product to the point that Wall Street analysts might like, but the utility that Twitter has for providing real-time news is real, and it hasn\u2019t really been disrupted by anyone else,\u201d said Mike Jones, the chief executive of a start-up incubator named Science Media.Mr. Jones used to be the chief executive of Myspace, the once-giant social network, but he rejected any comparison between Twitter and that now vastly diminished network.\u201cFor me and for lots of people, Twitter has actual utility to it, and for those people, that\u2019s what will keep it around,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It firmly established \u201cblack-ish,\u201d if there was any doubt, as a sitcom that\u2019s not just timely but up to the challenge of its times.The action in \u201cHope\u201d started as a lot of topical sitcom episodes do, with a family watching the news on TV. The story was about a young black man brutalized by the police on video, with an indictment decision pending \u2014 but which one? The episode made the confusion part of the joke: Was it Chicago? Cincinnati? Charleston? Who can keep track? (Watching the episode, I had to Google whether the case \u2014 with familiar scenes of protest and coverage from CNN\u2019s Don Lemon \u2014 was fictional.)I\u2019m not sure if this is a matter of \u201cblack-ish\u201d getting braver so much as the show realizing it was ready. Having fleshed out and added characters (Ruby, for instance, who can bring down the house with a line reading of \u201ccilantro\u201d), it built a multigenerational clan that could believably pin down a touchy subject from every angle.The show now has history, it has our investment, and that lets an episode like \u201cHope\u201d land hard. Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross) could take the semi-thankless position of arguing for the legal system (and wanting to keep her younger kids innocent) without seeming simply na\u00efve. Pops (Laurence Fishburne) could both bluntly argue that \u201cthe police are damn thugs\u201d and reveal himself as a former member of the less-than-militant Bobcats (\u201cWe were Panther-adjacent!\u201d).Most movingly, \u201cHope\u201d subtly circled back to that 2014 pilot, in which Andre worried that Junior (Marcus Scribner) was forgetting his blackness; when Junior resolves to join the protest, Andre suddenly worries that his son has become black-aware enough to get himself killed.That, and Andre\u2019s reminding Rainbow how exciting it was to see President Obama inaugurated, and how terrifying to see him leave the protection of his limo \u2014 and how the two feelings are inextricable \u2014 gave the show a new and well-earned depth.But beyond the character moments, \u201cHope\u201d managed to work in a stunning amount of American racial history (and current events) into a single episode without coming off like a sitcom Wikipedia page.A sitcom can\u2019t erase differences. (I can come to \u201cblack-ish\u201d only as a white guy who watches it every week with two sons who love it; that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019ll never need the same version of The Talk that the Johnson kids get.) But \u201cHope\u201d proved how sitcoms can still matter; even in a time of fragmented audiences, they can connect. No talk is going to work miracles, but it beats saying nothing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.B.I. Chief Presses Congress to Act on Data Privacy", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of the F.B.I., battling Apple over unlocking an iPhone used by one of the killers in a December rampage in San Bernardino, Calif., called on Congress on Thursday to settle the question of when law enforcement officials should get access to citizens\u2019 private data.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d the F.B.I. chief, James B. Comey Jr., told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201d\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation is not about us trying to send a message or establish some precedent,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s about trying to be competent in investigating something that is an active investigation.\u201dAt the same time, he acknowledged that the question of whether a company like Apple should have to unlock its encryption technology \u201cis the hardest question I\u2019ve seen in government, and it\u2019s going to require negotiation and conversation.\u201dHe said that Congress was in the best position to establish clearer lines on such issues. \u201cIt is this body that should be determining the answers,\u201d he said.But answers from Congress appear doubtful. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey acknowledged that they were uncertain where the line should be drawn between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement. Other lawmakers said that, with Congress gridlocked on far less complicated issues, a resolution seemed highly unlikely.Officials in the Obama administration drafted legislation beginning in 2011 that sought to address some of the encryption issues now being raised. But their proposals were effectively shelved in 2013 when leaks by Edward J. Snowden ignited public concerns about government spying.The hearing on Thursday was intended to discuss \u201cglobal threats\u201d with intelligence leaders government-wide but was instead dominated by questions for Mr. Comey about the Apple dispute.In the San Bernardino case, the F.B.I. is trying to get Apple\u2019s technical assistance in unlocking the phone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people in December. A judge in California last week ordered Apple to cooperate, but the company has resisted.Microsoft will file a brief backing Apple next week in a federal court in California, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, said on Thursday.Microsoft was one of the few prominent technology companies that had not yet clearly backed Apple in the case. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter have all backed Apple in the case. But Microsoft had previously supported Apple only indirectly through a statement issued by an industry coalition.Mr. Smith, the Microsoft official, was speaking Thursday at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, one focused on international legal conflicts related to data flowing across borders. Microsoft is fighting cases in courts in the United States and Brazil related to law enforcement demands for data held overseas and is pressing Congress to modernize laws to reduce these conflicts.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has suggested that Congress is a better place than a court to work out the conflicts arising in its case, and Mr. Smith said that \u201cwe agree wholeheartedly with Apple that the right place to bring this discussion is here to the House of Representatives and the Senate so people elected by the people can make these decisions.\u201dIn the Apple case, the government is relying on the All Writs Act, passed in its current form in 1911. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, Mr. Smith placed on a table an antique adding machine he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington and Nick Wingfield from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beer Ads That Portray Women as Empowered Consumers, Not Eye Candy", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingFor years, one of the main criticisms of beer advertising was that it tended to either objectify women or disregard them entirely. Marketers seemed to be too busy trying to appeal to the young male audience they knew would consistently drink beer by the case to worry about anyone else.Now, that appears to be changing.Allen Adamson, the former chairman of the brand consulting firm Landor Associates, said the fraternity house imagery and sophomoric humor that long defined many beer campaigns has come \u201cunder siege,\u201d led by millennials who are more conscientious about male chauvinism.With more consumers switching to craft beers \u2014 which grew to 10.7 percent of the dollar share in 2015, according to Nielsen \u2014 and beer\u2019s already having lost 10 percentage points of its volume share to wine and spirits since 2002, the major labels have had to refocus their efforts, Mr. Adamson said.\u201cIt was fine to show a frat party making fun of girls five or eight years ago,\u201d Mr. Adamson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s ineffective and potentially damaging to do today.\u201dOn Sunday, Coors Light, the second-best-selling domestic beer, after Bud Light, unveiled a new campaign that it hopes will appeal to women in a way its past advertising has not. The campaign, which is called \u201cClimb On,\u201d features enough shots of climbers atop Rocky Mountain peaks to make sure nobody forgets the particulars of the Coors brand. But sprinkled among images of rugged bull riders and boxers are some of women scaling walls, running races and white-water rafting. The narrator asks, \u201cWhat would we be without our mountains?\u201d \u2014 a tagline intended to evoke a sense of empowerment that the company believes women will respond to more than, say, former pitchmen like the football coach Mike Ditka.The new campaign arrives after Ipsos, the market research firm, said that women consumed more than 17 billion servings of beer in 2014, or 25 percent of the volume of the category \u2014 up from around 20 percent in previous estimates, and equal to the amount of beer that millennial males drank that year.The number astounded David Kroll, who became chief marketing officer at MillerCoors in July.\u201cDisappointing,\u201d Mr. Kroll said in an interview, \u201cthat we weren\u2019t speaking to women.\u201d\u201cThat was a pivot point,\u201d Mr. Adamson said.The \u201cClimb On\u201d commercials, produced by the ad agency 72andSunny, which has worked with companies like Target, Google and Samsung, are part of what Mr. Kroll described as a modernizing effort by the Coors Brewing Company. That effort is meant to better align the company with the interests of millennials, who are more sensitive than previous generations to marketing that might be considered sexist or chauvinistic, he said.\u201cThe thought of being fully inclusive to women, when you speak to millennials, they\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, duh,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Kroll said. \u201cIn some respects, beer is just catching up to the millennial mind-set.\u201dCoors Light is not alone in this effort. Heineken has recently appealed to \u201cmoderate drinkers\u201d with a new ad that suggests modern women will be more attracted to men who drink less. The latest commercial, one of three since the campaign began in 2011, features women singing the Bonnie Tyler song \u201cI Need a Hero\u201d as they walk away from ostensibly inebriated men.Some brands have also introduced new products to attract women in recent years, though results have been mixed. In 2011, for instance, Molson Coors introduced a \u201cbloat resistant\u201d beer called Anim\u00e9e that came in different flavors and colors, while the Carlsberg Group created a gender-neutral beer called Copenhagen with a minimalist aesthetic that resembled a sleek bottle of white wine. Both were short-lived.When it comes to gender-neutral advertising, though, the brand consultant Dean Crutchfield says that Coors Light, which has long sought to portray a robust masculinity in its marketing, is taking a considerable risk.\u201cIf you alienate your core, your credibility and relevance tumbles,\u201d Mr. Crutchfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your brand, your heritage, your past and your future. It\u2019s been all wrapped around the males. To suddenly unwrap that, it does carry risk.\u201dBritt Dougherty, MillerCoors\u2019s senior director of marketing insights, says that women rarely self-identify as beer drinkers, and that beer companies have not done a good job trying to recruit them. According to Ms. Dougherty\u2019s estimates, a more gender-friendly advertising approach could add from five million to nine million barrels to the industry\u2019s sales in the United States over the next five years.\u201cIt takes time to undo that baggage,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve represented a version of masculinity that wasn\u2019t appealing to women.\u201dAlso figuring into Coors\u2019s calculus is a Brewers Association estimate that women consumed 30 percent of the craft beer on the market in 2014. And Nielsen says craft beer\u2019s market penetration in off-premise, or in-home, consumption continues to increase, rising half a percentage point from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2015.Jackie Dodd, who runs the popular cooking and beer blog The Beeroness, said she felt that craft beers, or microbrews, had always been about community and collaboration, including male and female brewers.\u201cI don\u2019t think craft beer ever marketed towards women, they just valued them and that conveyed,\u201d Ms. Dodd wrote in an email. \u201cI\u2019m not sure macro can do that, or even knows how. But if they can, more power to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When she met the residents of Duquesne Court, in Springdale, they told her stories about who had gotten cancer and whose children died young. But she also understood such things could come to seem normal to the residents, for whom moving away was simply not a practical option.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I would say to everyone in Duquesne Court: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, what do you think about those stacks? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right there at the end of your street.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They would look up and say: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh. Stacks. Right.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so much a part of the community that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even see them anymore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Johnson said.It all began almost 10 years ago, when Brian Cohen, an English art historian and photographer, moved his family to the area, after visiting friends there on a beautiful day. When asked if he felt lured under false pretenses, he insisted he loves the city, while admitting, with dry English wit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPittsburgh is not known as the sunniest city in the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cohen was inspired to act in 2010, when his wife, Ilyssa Manspeizer, suggested he seek funding for a project about fracking. His proposal to a local foundation was not successful, but the funding was ultimately found elsewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought about that for a second,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a really good idea. It quickly occurred to me that this is a big, big story. Much bigger than someone like myself could tackle alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought, why not propose a project where a whole group of photographers get together, in the tradition of something like the F.S.A.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u2014 the Farm Security Administration photography program begun during the Great Depression.He enlisted his colleague Laura Domencic, the director of the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, to help organize a six-photographer collective for the Marcellus Shale Documentary Project. The group, which also featured Noah Addis, Nina Berman, Scott Goldsmith, Martha Rial and Ms. Johnson, shot a project about fracking that has been exhibited regularly since 2012.Thrilled by its success, Mr. Cohen suggested another collaboration in 2014, to examine the poor air quality in his adopted city. He combined both endeavors in The Documentary Works, an umbrella organization with a website to archive and support projects focusing on issues affecting the area.For the new venture, Mr. Cohen re-enlisted Ms. Johnson and Mr. Goldsmith, and included Ms. Johnson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend Annie O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill. The resulting exhibition and companion book are a pastiche of styles and narrative techniques, which was intentional, according to Ms. Johnson.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have the past, we have the present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ms. Johnson, a National Geographic fellow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have color and black-and-white. We have this smorgasbord of visual solutions that hopefully brings not just the people, but the issues to life.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cohen photographed the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s industrial infrastructure in color, and subtly manipulated the images to enhance the \u00e2\u0080\u009cugly beauty\u00e2\u0080\u009d of smoke rising into the sky. Ms. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Neill used Polaroid Type 55 film to shoot portraits of survivors of a 1948 environmental disaster, in which local residents died because of polluted air trapped in the atmosphere, a condition known as inversion. Mr. Goldsmith shot black-and-white, documentary photographs of local miners organizing, patients in hospital beds, and a train derailment, among other subjects.Initially, Ms. Johnson used her iPhone to shoot mostly landscapes in Cheswick, but soon felt she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting the narrative depth she craved.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a photographer, you have to find a way, emotionally, into the story, into the subject matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happening, so I thought, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to go close to the stacks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I went right to the base, and saw, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh my God, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a street, almost exactly opposite to the entry of this plant.\u2019\u200a\u00e2\u0080\u009dDespite its lingering reputation, Pittsburgh is no longer the industrial hub it once was. Mr. Cohen notes that the economy has begun to roar again, this time because of what is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cEds and Meds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They now have \u00e2\u0080\u009ctechnology, robotics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle is here. Facebook just opened up a center.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMs. Johnson concurred, surprised to find her city had become a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvital, youthful place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she has spent so much of her time on the road. While she agreed that the air quality had improved, she stressed that her group of collaborators was interested in creating dialogue and encouraging the community to stand up for itself. They see themselves as concerned citizens, trying to make a difference, something Ms. Johnson hopes to inspire in others, wherever they live.\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook around you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she challenged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want to change?

{"Headline": "Why Tech Degrees Are Not Putting More Blacks and Hispanics Into Tech Jobs", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byConspicuously AbsentTechnology companies employ strikingly few black and Hispanic workers. They blame the recruitment pipeline, saying there aren\u2019t enough of them graduating with relevant degrees and applying for tech jobs.Yet the data show that there are many more black and Hispanic students majoring in computer science and engineering than work in tech jobs. So why aren\u2019t they being hired?Those who enter the candidate pipeline fall out somewhere along the way \u2014 and the culture and recruiting methods of tech companies seem to have a lot to do with it.The pipeline problem is not a myth. Black and Hispanic students are underrepresented in computer science and engineering programs, relative to their share of the population, while Asian students are overrepresented.But technical workers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter, according to the companies\u2019 diversity reports, are on average 56 percent white, 37 percent Asian, 3 percent Hispanic and 1 percent black.One issue is that black and Hispanic computer science and engineering graduates are less likely than white and Asian ones to go into tech jobs. Forty percent of young Asian graduates do so, compared with 16 percent of black graduates and 12 percent of Hispanics, according to American Community Survey data.Meanwhile, 10 percent of black computer science and engineering graduates have office support jobs, which include administrative support and accounting jobs, compared with 5 percent of white graduates and 3 percent of Asians.\u201cAny student of color looking at the numbers from the tech giants is going to be turned off and wary about taking a job there because it tells you something about what the climate is,\u201d Ms. Beasley said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be the token.\u201dRecruiting is another issue. Part of it is looking not just at Stanford and M.I.T. but also at places like historically black colleges. Even at the colleges that tech companies typically recruit from, students who are not white or Asian might not be in the networks to know about opportunities at tech companies.Tristan Walker, a tech start-up founder and chief executive of Walker & Company, said he didn\u2019t know about Silicon Valley until he was 24 and arrived at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\u201cThere definitely isn\u2019t a pipeline problem, even going to the same schools companies go to,\u201d Mr. Walker said. He puts the onus on the companies. \u201cThese folks aren\u2019t working hard enough, they\u2019re just not.\u201dWhen companies come to campus to recruit, for example, black and Hispanic students often simply don\u2019t show up for information sessions, Ms. Powers said. But they\u2019re more likely to come to workshops, like for writing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or preparing for interviews.\u201cThat gets a higher yield in terms of students showing up, and they leave with an impression that we value them and their growth, as opposed to it just being a sales pitch,\u201d she said.Tech companies often give coders whiteboard interviews \u2014 asking them to solve a problem by writing code on a whiteboard, so the interviewers can see their thought process. At Code 2040, however, they discovered that many black and Hispanic students, unlike white and Asian ones, had never heard of this type of interview and were unprepared for it.\u201cThere\u2019s still a dominant cultural narrative in black and Hispanic communities that you have to be twice as good and keep your head down and work hard,\u201d Ms. Powers said. \u201cThat does not translate to Valley culture, starting with the whiteboard interview,\u201d because it requires people to work through errors in front of the interviewer, as opposed to presenting only the right answer.Some researchers offer other strategies: Use standardized interview questions, not subjective ones; evaluate hiring managers based on whether they bring in diverse candidates; build a Rolodex of potential hires by working with networking groups for minorities; hire more than one minority member in each batch of new hires, so they have a support network.Techniques like these could expand the pipeline for tech companies \u2014 and for any other industry, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tips and Myths About Extending Smartphone Battery Life", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byTech FixAshlei Teme\u00f1a\u2019s family trip to Disneyland last Thanksgiving break turned into a nightmare when her smartphone battery hit empty.Ms. Teme\u00f1a, a San Francisco support technician, had gotten separated from her family and realized she had no way to find anyone. Instead of riding roller coasters, she wandered around searching for the group \u2014 eventually locating them four hours later watching fireworks.\u201cI wanted to throw my phone on the ground by the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Teme\u00f1a said.Many consumers can relate. Despite the leaps forward in mobile phone technology with crisp, clear screens and faster chips, batteries have made only sluggish progress. That has propelled a desire for longer battery life to the top of the list of factors considered by consumers when they purchase smartphones, according to a 2014 survey by the research firm IDC.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of investments on all fronts for improving the technology above and beyond that, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see that hitting any kind of mass market for several years out,\u201d Mr. Quong said. In general, lithium ion improves about 10 percent a year in terms of the amount of energy that can be stored in a given space, which is partly why consumers perceive batteries as being far behind other technologies.The results showed that some conventional beliefs about extending battery life \u2014 like turning off Wi-Fi or shutting down all your phone\u2019s apps \u2014 produced negligible or even harmful results. The Wirecutter also found plenty of helpful practices to get more use out of your battery, like playing music stored directly on the device (instead of streaming it) or tweaking email configurations.The Wirecutter tested a range of recent Apple and Android smartphones with the latest operating systems in tightly controlled environments. Your phone\u2019s results will vary depending on the phone model, cellular carrier, location and other factors, but the general results should hold. Here are eight tips and seven myths busted by our findings:A smartphone\u2019s screen consumes more energy than any other component, so the easiest way to cut down battery drain is to reduce your screen brightness. In an hourlong test, an iPhone 6s used 54 percent less battery power with the screen brightness at minimum as compared with maximum brightness. An Android test phone used 30 percent less.But it\u2019s tough to use a dim screen in bright environments, so most phones offer an auto-brightness mode that automatically adjusts the screen\u2019s brightness based on ambient light. The Wirecutter found that enabling auto-brightness saved a good amount of battery life.When browsing the web, your smartphone also burns through power when it downloads mobile ads on websites. Installing an ad blocker will greatly extend battery life.Email can have a major impact on battery life if you have multiple email accounts and receive lots of email. Your smartphone can update your email automatically using a technology called push, which brings new messages to your phone the instant they are transmitted. Push can be a power hog because it requires your phone to constantly listen for new messages, so if you get a lot of email, there\u2019s a good chance your phone is using lots of energy.The Wirecutter tested an iPhone 6s Plus configured with three email accounts, receiving a total of 20 to 30 messages an hour. In these tests, having push active over the course of a day caused Mail to account for 5 to 10 percent of the phone\u2019s overall battery use.To save energy, most phones can be configured to instead check for (or \u201cfetch\u201d) emails on a schedule \u2014 say, every 30 minutes \u2014 or only when you manually tell your email app to refresh.The next tip may come as unwelcome news. Nowadays, online streaming is the most popular way to listen to music, with services like Spotify, Pandora and Apple Music \u2014 but this method guzzles lots of battery power. In the Wirecutter\u2019s tests, streaming music over a Wi-Fi connection for two hours used 10 percent of an iPhone\u2019s battery reserves; streaming the same music stored directly on a device over two hours consumed only 5 percent.Fortunately, streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music still let you listen to songs the old-school way: by storing the music right on your device.You may have noticed that when you\u2019re in a place without good Wi-Fi or cellular coverage, your phone\u2019s battery seems to drain much more quickly. That\u2019s because the phone uses energy searching for a good signal and, if the signal is very weak, trying to get a better connection.To conserve battery life, disable the phone\u2019s wireless circuitry. Airplane Mode, an option that will turn off all wireless features, is a quick and easy solution in areas with poor reception.Alternatively, you can disable (in your phone\u2019s settings) a single wireless feature. For example, if you have terrible wireless carrier coverage in your office, but Wi-Fi is great, disabling cellular connectivity while there will keep the phone from wasting energy trying to get a cellular connection while still letting you connect to the Internet over Wi-Fi.Consumers can get even better results with a bit of sleuthing. Both the iPhone and Android systems provide a simple way to see which apps are using a lot of battery power. For iPhones and Android phones, open the Settings app and in the Battery menu, there are sorted lists of apps that are using the most energy.On the iPhone\u2019s battery usage screen, tap the clock button to reveal information about how much of your battery life each app is consuming when you\u2019re actively using the app (\u201cscreen\u201d) compared with when you\u2019re not (\u201cbackgd\u201d). On Android, the most useful information are the timers for \u201cCPU total\u201d and \u201cCPU foreground.\u201d Foreground is how much time you had the app open; subtract \u201cforeground\u201d from \u201ctotal,\u201d and you\u2019ll know how much time the app has been busy in the background.Be on the lookout for apps that are active for extended periods in the background and are using a lot of battery power. Examples include an email app that spends lots of time checking for new messages even when your phone is asleep, a news reader that updates articles in the background or a fitness app that constantly monitors your location.If you find apps using up lots of energy in the background, disable their background activities. On an iPhone, go to the Settings app, tap General and then Background App Refresh and disable the background activities for any apps. On Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Data Usage, choose an app, then select \u201cRestrict Background Data\u201d for background data usage.If a location-based app is using a lot of power, especially in the background, there\u2019s a good chance the app is using GPS, Wi-Fi and the phone\u2019s sensors frequently. You can decide whether to disable location features for it (either via your phone\u2019s Location Services settings, or by changing settings in the app itself). On an iPhone, you can disable the app\u2019s ability to track your location by going to Privacy menu and Location Services.To disable location tracking on Android, go inside the Settings app, tap Apps, choose an app and select \u201cPermissions,\u201d then tap to disable Location permission.Both Apple and Google recommend disabling push notifications, which are essentially app alerts, to conserve battery life. Notifications require regular communication with notification servers, and each notification causes your phone to wake up for a few seconds, including turning on the screen, to show you a message and give you a chance to act on it.In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing, receiving a few dozen notifications over the course of an hour didn\u2019t noticeably affect battery usage. But if you get a lot of notifications each day, that energy use can add up. If a particular app or service (say, Twitter or your email client) is constantly producing notifications, consider disabling notifications for that app.On an iPhone, open the Settings app, tap Notifications, tap the app name and disable Allow Notifications. On Android, disable notification in an app\u2019s settings menu, or long-press the notification itself and select the \u201ci\u201d icon. This will send you to that app\u2019s App Notifications settings, where you can block all notifications.There is plenty of inaccurate conventional wisdom about methods to prolong battery life. Let\u2019s start with one of the worst \u201ctips\u201d: Closing (or force-quitting, as it\u2019s commonly called) apps you are not currently using. The theory is that apps running in the background are using your phone\u2019s components, so quitting them will save energy.While that may be true on a computer, smartphones are designed differently: Once an app is no longer in the foreground \u2014 meaning you are not actively using it \u2014 most or all of its processes are frozen. In other words, while an app may still be loaded in a phone\u2019s memory, it probably is not doing much in the background to drain your battery.Finally, quitting apps actually has drawbacks: When you force-quit an app, all of its code can be purged from your phone\u2019s RAM, which means that the next time you open the app, the phone has to reload all of that code. That, of course, requires energy.A common suggestion for extending battery life is to disable Wi-Fi. However, if you\u2019re in range of a strong Wi-Fi signal, your phone uses less energy to connect to the Internet with a Wi-Fi connection than a cellular one. If you regularly use apps that rely on your location, having Wi-Fi enabled helps your phone determine its location without having to rely solely on power-hungry GPS features, so it actually helps a battery last longer.Many apps that use your location do so only intermittently. Even using the Maps app for short navigation sessions doesn\u2019t use more than a few percent of your battery\u2019s capacity \u2014 and having the phone\u2019s screen continually on is a big part of why navigation uses a lot of power.In other words, don\u2019t disable all of your phone\u2019s location-based features just to extend your battery life. You won\u2019t see a big jump in use time, but you may end up disabling \u2014 and subsequently missing \u2014 useful features. Instead, check (using the tips above) to see if any of apps consuming the most battery life also track your location. If so, and if you don\u2019t need that location tracking, consider disabling it for those apps.Many people, and even smartphone vendors such as Apple, claim that using Wi-Fi for wireless data consumes less power than using a cellular signal, so you should use Wi-Fi whenever you can. However, the Wirecutter\u2019s testing found this isn\u2019t always the case.In testing in a location where both Wi-Fi and cellular LTE signals were strong, an hour of browsing over Wi-Fi used roughly the same amount of battery power as an hour using LTE on an iPhone. On a Motorola Android phone, LTE used only 2 to 3 percent more power than Wi-Fi.In other words, as long as you have a good signal, you probably won\u2019t see a huge difference between Wi-Fi and cellular data, and it\u2019s probably not worth the hassle of switching between the two.Both iPhones and Android phones include a hands-free feature for summoning their virtual assistants by speaking voice commands. You can just say \u201cHey Siri\u201d to the iPhone or \u201cO.K. Google\u201d and then speak your request or command. While convenient, this feature requires your phone to constantly listen for that special phrase, which uses some power.Yet if you have one of the phones that supports this feature, disabling it won\u2019t conserve much battery life. In the Wirecutter\u2019s testing with an iPhone 6s Plus and a Nexus 6P, there was a negligible difference in battery usage between having the always-on virtual assistant enabled or disabled over a two-hour period.Using Siri or O.K. Google uses some energy, so if your phone\u2019s battery is getting low, you should probably stop asking the phone question after question during your commute. But just having the feature enabled isn\u2019t worth worrying about \u2014 and it can be quite convenient.A common warning around the Internet is that you should use only the charger that came with your phone, otherwise you could damage your phone\u2019s battery. In reality, the phone itself contains all the circuitry responsible for charging its battery. The AC adapter (as it\u2019s more accurately known) simply converts the AC current from a wall outlet into low-voltage, low-amperage DC current that it provides via a USB port. This is why you can also charge your phone using the USB port on a computer, a USB battery pack or a charger in your car \u2014 the phone is designed to allow it to charge from a variety of power sources that can produce a wide range of current.Finally, you may see warnings that a cheap third-party charger could damage your phone. There\u2019s some truth here: Many chargers \u2014 especially budget models sold online, or even at your local shopping mall kiosk \u2014 are poorly made, or use low-quality components. A poorly made charger can not only damage your phone, but could also hurt you by exposing you to dangerous currents. So if you\u2019re replacing your phone\u2019s AC adapter, or buying an extra, stick with a reputable vendor.For many years, devices that used rechargeable batteries required \u201cconditioning\u201d or \u201ccalibrating,\u201d a procedure that prevented the battery from forgetting how much capacity it actually had. Today\u2019s smartphone batteries no longer suffer from this issue.If you have tried all the above and still struggle to get through the day with your battery, consider buying an external battery. These accessories \u2014 which can take the form of a bulky case with a built-in battery that you wear on the phone, or a separate battery pack that connects to your phone with a cable \u2014 can provide power to last an additional few hours at the end of the day, or even to fully charge your phone\u2019s battery.For days of smartphone power, the Anker PowerCore 15600 is the Wirecutter\u2019s pick if you need to charge a phone repeatedly or keep a full-size tablet and phone topped up through a busy week. It has enough available power to charge a typical smartphone five times or to fill a large tablet such as an iPad Air almost twice \u2014 for under $40.After her stressful day at Disneyland, Ms. Teme\u00f1a bought an external Amazon battery pack. She said the pack could fully charge her phone six times, but it wasn\u2019t ideal because of its bulk. Ultimately, she wishes her iPhone had a better battery.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why a battery wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with all the other advances they\u2019re putting into phones now,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Vegas on the Cheap? Get Off the Strip", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerExcept I wasn\u2019t on the Las Vegas Strip. I was on a mission to prove that all of the worthwhile things about Vegas could be had without touching the 4.2-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard between Sahara Avenue and Russell Road. In fact, I was hoping that getting away from the Strip would yield experiences that one wouldn\u2019t normally associate with Vegas, and I could see a side of the city most tourists miss.Things had started out on a tricky note, though: Finding a cheap room was more difficult than I\u2019d anticipated. I happened to pick a week that three of the biggest conventions of the year were in town. The fabled rock-bottom-priced opulence of Vegas I\u2019d dreamed about \u2014 $20 or $30 for a nice hotel room \u2014 would be out of reach. Lesson learned: research conventions. (There are a few websites I discovered too late, like vegasmeansbusiness.com, that would have helped.)It was Open Mic Night. \u201cThis next one is called \u2018Scattered Words,\u2019 \u201d said a young woman with an acoustic guitar, and she broke in to a plaintive tune that reminded me of Vampire Weekend. The crowd was young, impressively diverse and thoroughly entranced.My mark, so to speak, was the steak dinner, an iconic Vegas meal. The cafe at Ellis Island has a reputation for serving a particularly good one \u2014 $7.99 for a steak, vegetable, mashed potatoes or fries, and soup or salad, if you sign up for the casino\u2019s rewards program and do a little gambling (which you were planning to do anyway, right?).All casinos have rewards programs. You sign up, get a little card with a magnetic strip, and as you spend money you collect coupons for freebies and discounts. At Ellis Island, they\u2019ll give you that cheap steak dinner (normally $12.99) if you play just $5 worth of slots. But isn\u2019t that just breaking even? Well, in addition to it just being a little mindless Vegas fun, you can push it further: If you play $10 worth of slots instead of $5, not only do you get that discount on the steak dinner, Ellis Island also rewards you with bonus play money \u2014 a random amount between $10 and $500.I got my card, put $10 on it, and blew through it on a slot machine. A notification came up: I had $66 in additional slot play. I played through that and, in the process, won $30. I cashed out and claimed my coupons for the steak dinner. The casino had, in effect, paid me to gamble and eat at their restaurant \u2014 and the steak, a 10-ounce top sirloin, was delicious. It was at least an inch thick, flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. I said goodbye to Joe, who I found in the karaoke bar listening to someone mangle \u201cSweet Caroline.\u201d(Vegas, incidentally, isn\u2019t just surf-and-turf and all-you-can-eat buffets. Chinatown \u2014 well, more like China Strip Mall \u2014 is on Spring Mountain Road. I ventured there late one night and was able to score an enormous, hearty beef roll for $7.50 at Noodle Pot.)Room rates off the Strip can vary wildly. I visited five different hotels walking around one day and asked what the room rates were for that very night. Then, I asked what the room rate would be in exactly one week.An important detail for Vegas-goers: Many hotels tack on a \u201cresort fee,\u201d typically anywhere from $10 to $30 per night. So a $60 rate at the Rio might look great, until you realize you\u2019re paying closer to $90 once the fee is added.Should you rent a car? I got one because I knew I wanted to do some exploring. There\u2019s free parking at the California Hotel & Casino, and for the rate I got from Budget \u2014 about $10 a day through their website \u2014 it was a no-brainer. Around the Strip, though, it\u2019s best to use taxis or a rideshare service: Traffic is usually a nightmare.Lucas Peterson is the new Frugal Traveler columnist.Advertisement"}

But another escapee, Bac Duong, 43, objected, and the two fought inside the motel room where they were hiding on Wednesday.With all three men back in the jail from which they escaped \u2014 this time in isolation \u2014 Sheriff\u2019s Department officials on Monday laid out a timeline of the eight days they spent on the run.Planning for the escape began in July, said Capt. Jeff Hallock, a spokesman for the department, and included coordination with people both inside and outside the jail.Captain Hallock said Mr. Nayeri had developed a relationship with Nooshafarin Ravaghi, 44, who taught English as a second language to inmates. Investigators arrested Ms. Ravaghi last week and said she had provided information like Google maps that assisted in the escape. But on Monday, the district attorney, Tony Rackauckas, said that there was not enough evidence to charge Ms. Ravaghi and that she would be released.Loc Ba Nguyen, an associate of Mr. Duong\u2019s, has been charged with smuggling weapons and tools into the jail in January, before the escape. The three inmates cut metal bars to escape their cell, then rappelled from the roof using makeshift rope early on Jan. 22.Once on the outside, Mr. Nguyen picked them up about half a mile from the jail, Captain Hallock said.\u201cDuring that first day, they bounced between some residential locations\u201d in Orange County, Captain Hallock said. \u201cWe believe they obtained some money from family members or associates.\u201dAt 9:30 that night, shortly after the Sheriff\u2019s Department realized the men had escaped, the fugitives called a taxi to take them to Rosemead, east of Los Angeles. Mr. Duong stuck a gun in the cabdriver\u2019s ribs and told him that he was coming with them, and the four of them spent the night at an undisclosed location, officials said.For the next couple of days, the escapees moved around Los Angeles County, where they visited a hair salon in an effort to change their appearances, stole a white utility van and spent several nights at a hotel in Rosemead. On Monday, they drove north to the Alameda Motel in San Jose, Captain Hallock said, taking the taxi driver and his cab with them. The men remained in that motel until the fight on Wednesday, Captain Hallock said.Then, when Mr. Nayeri and Mr. Tieu went to get the windows of the stolen van tinted on Thursday, Mr. Duong and the taxi driver headed back to Rosemead, where they stayed for a night, before Mr. Duong surrendered. Meanwhile, sheriff\u2019s officials had put out an alert for the stolen van, and on Friday, after Mr. Duong\u2019s recapture, they notified the public that the men were believed to be in Northern California.On Saturday morning, a man in San Francisco spotted the van parked at a Whole Foods Market and notified two officers, who approached the vehicle. Mr. Nayeri ran and was captured after a short chase; Mr. Tieu was found hiding in the van. The two men were returned to Orange County early Sunday.Before the escape, Mr. Nayeri faced charges of kidnapping and torture in connection with the abduction of a marijuana dispensary owner in 2012. He had been held without bond since 2014.Mr. Duong is charged with attempted murder, and had been held without bond since December. Mr. Tieu is charged with murder and attempted murder, and had been held since 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Comparing Tax Software in Search of a Painless Return", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by2016 TaxesI told Siri, my iPhone\u2019s voice-activated virtual assistant, to do my taxes for me this year. She responded by asking whether I wanted to call my father.Google wants me to have a driverless car, but I\u2019d settle for a painless tax return.If my request to Siri seemed foolish, her response did point to something significant about the three tax programs. For all of their many features, the user experiences don\u2019t change that much from year to year. If you have liked one of them in the past, you will most likely be happy with this year\u2019s version.Each program\u2019s maker has staked out a place in the market where it excels. TurboTax\u2019s technology is the smoothest to use \u2014 the program rarely frustrates and offers a few features each year the competitors don\u2019t match. Block\u2019s tax help is the easiest to understand and get access to. TaxAct\u2019s offerings are the cheapest.One way in which all three have changed this year is security. At the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s request, they have provided additional safeguards to prevent identity theft and the filing of bogus returns. When you go to file, you may have to create a stronger password, provide a cellphone number or set up a series of security questions. My favorite possible question came from TaxAct: \u201cWhat was the first and last name of your first boy/girlfriend?\u201d Who knew taxes could make one nostalgic for teenage love?My experience with each of the three programs, elaborated below, may provide insight into how the security adjustments and other changes will affect your return filing this year. I opted for the online offerings, which representatives of TurboTax, Block and TaxAct say represent the bulk of the market these days. All three companies still sell downloadable programs you can use on your desktop computer. (TaxAct\u2019s downloadable version works on PCs only.)A bigger time saver is the ability to import your previous year\u2019s return and some of your financial information. TurboTax has long excelled here. If you used TurboTax last year, the program will pull in, from last year\u2019s return, all of your personal information and your previous sources of income. If you have the same sources this year, you just input the new amounts. If you used another tax program last year, TurboTax will import from a PDF copy of that return, though less information carries over.TurboTax also electronically captures W-2 and investment and interest information from more than a million companies, according to its website. For my wife and me, I could get our W-2s as well as nearly all of our investment information. But much of our interest income, from local banks and credit unions, wasn\u2019t available.Just as a test, I also tried importing my W-2 by taking a cellphone picture of it, a feature Block also offers. I\u2019m no Ansel Adams \u2014 I struggle with selfies \u2014 so I had to shoot twice. The second shot did grab all of the data.Perhaps the biggest change in all three of the programs over the last several years has been the ability to easily jump back and forth between your computer and your smartphone and tablet while working on your return. TurboTax is seamless in this regard \u2014 you really can pick up your return wherever you left off on whichever device you want. If you are a masochist, you can work on your return while waiting at the dentist or the D.M.V.The downside to TurboTax is its insistent selling. Choose one of its less expensive programs, and you will probably be urged to upgrade, as I have been in the past. Even if you start with Home and Business, you will see an offer to buy \u201ctotal peace of mind with MAX benefits.\u201d For an additional $59.99, you get representation if you are audited by the I.R.S., assistance if someone steals your identity and files a return in your name, and \u201cpriority care\u201d if you need answers to questions about your return (\u201cYou\u2019ll be our first priority when you call for answers and advice at any point throughout the year\u201d).Note to TurboTax: Could you design the program like a subscription website, where, if I agree to pay a little extra upfront, you will remove the little carnival barker hidden in your code?I have also long found Block\u2019s tax explanations the clearest of the three and its online help the easiest to understand and use. That advantage endured this year. My wife and I didn\u2019t face any unusual or particularly complex tax situations last year. But out of curiosity, I searched Block for guidance on how to handle income from the occasional rental of a room in one\u2019s house \u2014 something I suspect more people are doing, because of Airbnb.I searched \u201croom rental\u201d and, on the first page of hits, found a link to the exact guidance needed. The explanation even laid out how to calculate the deductible portion of one\u2019s overall home expenses. I couldn\u2019t find comparably clear help on TurboTax\u2019s or TaxAct\u2019s sites, though I tried several search terms.Block also changed its interview this year, and I found the section for Schedule C, where you report business income, the clearest of the three. It, for example, prompted me at the beginning with a checklist of all the types of self-employment income and expenses I might have, including the contribution to my retirement account. Somehow I had missed where I was supposed to log the retirement contribution in TurboTax.Technologically, Block seemed a half step behind TurboTax. Its tax-return import worked smoothly, but taking a picture of my W-2 vexed me. Once again, I had to do it twice \u2014 I\u2019m a slow learner \u2014 and, in the end, I couldn\u2019t get it to work. The program told me using the picture would introduce a third Social Security number to our return, which wasn\u2019t allowed. The return already contained numbers for my wife and me, and the one on the W-2 was correct. I couldn\u2019t figure out where the program was seeing a third number and had to trash the picture.I had difficulty starting our return. I decided to try TaxAct\u2019s Premium program. When I clicked on the button, the interview didn\u2019t begin. My browser, Firefox, appeared to be loading, but nothing appeared. I quit and tried again. Still nothing. I then thought to turn off an anti-tracking browser extension I use, Privacy Badger. Success.Next came the import of the previous year\u2019s return. TaxAct pulled in less of our information than TurboTax or Block had. It didn\u2019t, for example, capture any of the information from the Schedule C\u2019s that my wife and I file. The program also doesn\u2019t allow photos of W-2s, but it does electronically capture them from about 150 large companies. Inputting our wages was relatively easy. A form pops up that looks just like a W-2, so it\u2019s obvious where all the numbers go.My favorite feature of TaxAct, besides its bargain price, is when the program asks for estimated tax payments. It does so near the beginning of the interview, before you have recorded your income. That means the running tally of your bottom line starts as a big refund. If, like us, you tend to owe the I.R.S. a little money every year, you gradually whittle that refund down, as you add your sources of income. With the other programs, you provide your estimated payments toward the end. That means you watch your tax bill swell before you knock it back down with your estimated payments.Even though I know my response is irrational \u2014 you end up in the same place \u2014 I found myself fretting less about our tax bill with TaxAct\u2019s approach. And come tax time, I welcome anything that eases the anxiety.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The View From the Back Row in Paris", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 Photographers and film crews immediately swarmed a car as it glided in front of Place Vend\u00f4me on a Sunday night in late January, jostling to capture the beauty who stepped out. Bystanders craned to get a glimpse of a woman wearing a bright orange dress, cunningly engineered with provocative cutouts and bound with matching thin ropes, pulleys really, covering a few key bits. The word filtered through to the back of the hive that it was Rita Ora, the British pop star and fashion-show mainstay, and, crucially, someone clearly committed to working a dress.Ms. Ora was there for the Atelier Versace show and the start of couture week in Paris, which over the next four days would feature 25 shows on the official calendar, attracting hundreds of journalists and retailers, dozens of customers from markets as far-flung as Russia and China, tight bands of photographers cordoned off on a platform at each of the shows to record the elaborate, fantastical gowns for posterity, and a handful of celebrities to populate the front rows and satisfy the paparazzi.And me.For once, thanks to the offer to attend the shows as a neophyte and write about the experience, I would be able to witness the greatest spectacle in fashion \u2014 not just on Twitter and Instagram, but in person.Handsome young sentries, whose purpose seemed to be purely aesthetic, lined the hall of the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, the site of the Dior show. This was the first Dior show without the designer Raf Simons, and there was curiosity about the collection, of course, and speculation whether any of the regular Dior stars would show up. Paparazzi surrounded one woman. Was it Jennifer Lawrence? Charlize Theron? Natalie Portman? The sea parted: Olivia Palermo.That evening, as I headed off to Giambattista Valli, I began to panic. A longer-than-expected M\u00e9tro ride (no car and driver for me!) and then a wrong turn on the way to Le Carreau du Temple had us blocks away at the scheduled start time. No worries, my show companion told me, the shows do not begin on time, \u201cEver.\u201d (Sure enough, we sat inside for almost half an hour after arrival, marveling at the stars we still could not identify and at a woman who arrived in a gown with a long train, along with an assistant who carried that train for her until she was safely in her seat.)The Chanel clients dutifully surrendered their iconic quilted bags to the X-ray conveyor belt, while a larger utilitarian cross-body bag caused a slight commotion as the guards scurried to find a bin large enough to accommodate it.The atmosphere was decidedly familial. The Chanel-clad guests warmly greeted one another, some with plumb lips and tousled wavy hair, others of the thin, pulled-together Betsy Bloomingdale variety. One tall man with an elaborately and elegantly tied scarf told a friend: \u201cI am good. At this age, I\u2019ve decided I will be good. What else can one say?\u201dInside the Grand Palais was a heart-stopping set that would elicit heartfelt bravos at an opera, perfect for a \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d staged in Scandinavia. A large wooden structure (later described as a dollhouse or minimalist country home), surrounded by a garden (real grass) with a painted rich blue backdrop sky infused with sunlight. It was a memory of a landscape never seen.The actresses Juliette Binoche and Isabelle Huppert, as well as the Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, graced the front row. Handsome gray-haired men, immaculate in crisp shirts, expensive watches and presumably Armani suits, dotted the audience.It was surprisingly intimate. The actress Marisa Berenson, the house muse, warmly greeted the guests, embracing a woman in a kimono who was smiling and mingling. A check of her chair tag (she was to be seated next to Giancarlo Giammetti, the longtime business partner of the designer) and a quick Google search identified her as Madame Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, the widow of the artist Balthus. She was there in support of her daughter, Harumi, who designed the jewelry for the collection.Very impressive and all very chill. The only drama was confusion over the seating in the back row. Most were nervous to be caught playing musical chairs and potentially face a public humiliation. Two men took the logical action and decided to sit where there were empty seats. The show was called for 6:30 p.m., and it was approaching 7. One looked at his watch, impatiently. \u201cTell him, it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d his comrade said.Harp music cued the show\u2019s start, and models floated by in serpentine gold headpieces, barefoot, across petals, in diaphanous, airy dresses, and coats with what looked to be antique velvet, yet, of course, was not.The thousands of hours spent creating the collection, the details and the vision, combined with the ethereal impermanence of the shows, was mind-blowing. The urge to document the experience prompted me to overshare during the week with my 111 Instagram followers and 432 Facebook friends. The posts racked up likes and comments from nonfashionista friends enjoying the contact high. A last photo of the impossibly stylish front-row beauties at Valentino was captioned, \u201cC\u2019est Fini.\u201d\u201cThank God,\u201d one armchair spectator posted. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Letter on iPhone Security Draws Muted Tech Industry Response", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byThe response from other technology companies? A mix of carefully calibrated support and crickets.Asked about Apple\u2019s opposition to the court order, representatives of Microsoft and Amazon declined to comment.The range of reactions highlights the complicated set of factors influencing tech companies\u2019 responses to government demands for customer data in the era after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor, of widespread government surveillance. Some companies may be keeping their heads low to avoid becoming targets during the raucous presidential campaign, while others may fear that being too vocal will jeopardize government sales and relationships with law enforcement, privacy experts said.\u201cThe issue is of monumental importance, not only to the government and Apple but to the other technology giants as well,\u201d said Tom Rubin, a former attorney for Microsoft and the United States Department of Justice, who is now a law lecturer at Harvard University. \u201cThose companies are undoubtedly following the case intently, praying that it creates a good precedent and breathing a sigh of relief that it\u2019s not them in the spotlight.\u201dSome Silicon Valley luminaries were more direct in their support of Mr. Cook, including Jan Koum, the chief executive of WhatsApp, the mobile messaging app owned by Facebook. In a message posted to Facebook, Mr. Koum said he admired Mr. Cook\u2019s position on privacy.\u201cWe must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set,\u201d Mr. Koum wrote. \u201cToday our freedom and our liberty is at stake.\u201dBut behind the scenes, there was discomfort among some companies that have generally allied themselves with Apple on the topic of government surveillance.All of the companies involved in Reform Government Surveillance, including Apple, acknowledge that they often comply with law enforcement requests for customer data when under order from a court. Apple\u2019s stance in this case seemed overly antagonistic to some companies in the coalition, according to people privy to conversations on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.In its statement on Wednesday, Reform Government Surveillance chose its words carefully. The association\u2019s member companies, the statement said, \u201cremain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers\u2019 information.\u201dThere was also disagreement about Apple\u2019s tactics. Gunter Ollmann, chief security officer at Vectra Networks, an information security company in San Jose, Calif., argued that the government\u2019s demand that Apple help unlock the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone was in line with similar one-time requests and that Apple was creating an unnecessarily high-stakes battle by framing the unlocking as creating a universal back door.\u201cI\u2019m concerned that since Apple has attempted to deny the F.B.I. request citing use of \u2018back doors,\u2019 should they lose this legal argument, the repercussions could be extensive to the entire security industry,\u201d he said in a blog post.If Apple had instead framed the issue as more of a tech-specific matter, \u201cthe prospect of a lost appeal would be greatly limited,\u201d rather than \u201cbeing included in appeals over anti-terrorism and a specific instance of a horrific crime,\u201d Mr. Ollmann added.Privacy advocates speculated that one reason Apple was willing to stake out a bolder position against what it saw as law enforcement overreach was that it is not as eager for government business as some of its rivals. Amazon has a large deal with the Central Intelligence Agency to help run its cloud computing operations, for example.On Wednesday, Microsoft promoted a deal with the United States Department of Defense under which the department will standardize its computers on the company\u2019s Windows 10 operating system. Microsoft has also pushed back against the government on issues including a court case in New York involving an effort to get Microsoft customer data stored outside the United States.Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy advocacy group, said some tech companies \u201care a little bit uneasy doing things on the law enforcement side that might disrupt their ability to win contracts.\u201dPrivacy advocates also said that Apple was taking a stronger position on privacy matters because its business does not hinge on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data, unlike the operations of other tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cook has contrasted the privacy policies of Apple, which makes the overwhelming majority of its money by selling devices like the iPhone and Macs, with those of Internet companies that make their money from advertising.Apple\u2019s absolutist position is also seen by many as a reflection of Mr. Cook\u2019s view that privacy is a human right.\u201cThey\u2019re deeply a consumer company,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant law professor at the University of Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re less reliant on information as a business model. They sell things. I really think their C.E.O. has religion on privacy and personality matters.\u201dConor Dougherty and Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms\u2019 Online Content", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byChina is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval.The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video.The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval.China already has some of the world\u2019s most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years.Legal scholars say the new rules seem aimed at restricting any type of content that might be considered a threat to the Communist Party, or social stability, with the regulations hinting at a greater effort to bring anything published by foreign entities under Chinese law.\u201cThis is the latest in a series of legal changes that seek to restrict the influence of foreign or western ideas,\u201d said Jacques deLisle, an authority on Chinese law who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also part of a larger attempt to exercise control over the Internet and new media.\u201dThe new regulations, though, do not detail exactly what types of content and which organizations would be affected. Though the new rules, for example, might seem to apply to foreign news organizations in China, existing rules already restrict global media outlets from posting content on the Internet using servers inside China. Most global news outlets, including The New York Times, are published on servers outside China, and are unlikely to be affected by the new rules.Still, legal experts say the regulations announced this week are broad enough to pose challenges to a wide range of foreign multinationals operating in China, since many of them act as distributors of online content or services.There are also questions about how such regulations would be enforced, and what types of companies would be considered distributors of online content. As a result, they could raise market-access issues for foreign companies in China ahead of trade talks with the United States.Analysts say Chinese laws are often vague and broad, which gives regulators the ability to claim greater jurisdiction. As a result, how laws are implemented is often more important than the letter of the law.One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apple\u2019s Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.A large number of foreign games for smartphones are released through joint ventures between Chinese companies and multinationals, and it appears the new regulations could affect those partnerships.Multinational companies have long complained that the rules in China are discriminatory. Foreign firms need licenses that can be difficult to get to operate web services in China, and there are restrictions on their ability to invest in many Chinese sectors. Several big companies, including Microsoft, have also been the subject of anti-trust investigations.The regulations stipulate that anything published online should \u201cserve the people\u201d and promote socialism and do no harm to national interests, barring, for instance, the spreading of rumors or propagating evil cults.Paul Gillis, an accounting expert who teaches at Peking University in Beijing, says a lot will also be determined by the way China executes and enforces the rules, since there is tremendous variation in the way laws are enacted and enforced in the country and to whom they apply.\u201cWhat about law firms and accounting firms \u2014 are they going to be subject to these rules?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what about companies that just have an instruction manual online, are they also going to fall under this type of rule?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Robots Are Coming for Wall Street", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueHundreds of financial analysts are being replaced with software. What office jobs are next?Supported byNadler couldn\u2019t have double-checked all this analysis if he wanted to. It was based on thousands of numbers drawn from dozens of databases. He just wanted to make sure that Kensho had pulled the right number \u2014 the overall growth in American payrolls \u2014 from the employment report. It was the least he could do, given that within minutes, at 8:35 a.m., Kensho\u2019s analysis would be made available to employees at Goldman Sachs.In addition to being a customer, Goldman is also Kensho\u2019s largest investor. Nadler, who is 32, spent the rest of the morning checking in with some of the bank\u2019s most regular Kensho users \u2014 a top executive on the options-and-derivatives-trading desks, a fund manager \u2014 then took an Uber down for a lunch meeting at Goldman\u2019s glass tower just off the West Side Highway in Manhattan. While almost everyone in the building dresses in neatly pressed work attire, Nadler rarely deviates from his standard outfit: Louis Vuitton leather sandals and a casual but well-cut T-shirt and pants, both by the designer Alexander Wang. Nadler owns 10 sets of these. His austere aesthetic is informed by the summer vacations he spent in Japan while pursuing a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard, mostly visiting temples and meditating. (\u2018\u2018Kensho\u2019\u2019 is the Japanese term for one of the first states of awareness in the Zen Buddhist progression.) He also wrote a volume of poetry \u2014 imagined ancient love poems \u2014 that Farrar Straus & Giroux will publish later this year.I met with Nadler later that day in his own office, across the street from the Goldman building, on the 45th floor of 1 World Trade Center. His dozen or so employees shared a large room decked out in typical start-up style, including an aquarium and large speakers playing electronic music. Nadler has an office off to the side with little more than a large desk, made out of reclaimed telephone poles, and a large upholstered leather chair with matching ottoman. After closing the door, Nadler, who has curly dark hair and pale skin, sat on the ottoman, folded his bare feet under him and told me about the day\u2019s feedback from Goldman. This included some tips on what they wanted in the next report, and a good dose of amazement at Kensho\u2019s speed. \u2018\u2018People always tell me, \u2018I used to spend two out of five days a week doing this sort of thing,\u2019 or \u2018I used to have a guy whose job it was to do nothing other than this one thing,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Nadler said.This might sound like bragging. But Nadler was primarily recounting those reactions as a way of explaining his concern about the impact that start-ups like his are likely to have on the financial industry. Within a decade, he said, between a third and a half of the current employees in finance will lose their jobs to Kensho and other automation software. It began with the lower-paid clerks, many of whom became unnecessary when stock tickers and trading tickets went electronic. It has moved on to research and analysis, as software like Kensho has become capable of parsing enormous data sets far more quickly and reliably than humans ever could. The next \u2018\u2018tranche,\u2019\u2019 as Nadler puts it, will come from the employees who deal with clients: Soon, sophisticated interfaces will mean that clients no longer feel they need or even want to work through a human being.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m assuming that the majority of those people over a five-to-10-year horizon are not going to be replaced by other people,\u2019\u2019 he said, getting into the flow of his thoughts, which, for Nadler, meant closing his eyes and gesticulating as though he were preaching or playing the piano. \u2018\u2018In 10 years Goldman Sachs will be significantly smaller by head count than it is today.\u2019\u2019Goldman executives are reluctant to discuss the plight of their displaced financial analysts. Several managers I spoke to insisted that Kensho has not yet caused any layoffs, nor is it likely to soon. Nadler had warned me that I would hear something like that. \u2018\u2018When you start talking about automating jobs,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018everybody all of a sudden gets really quiet.\u2019\u2019Goldman employees who lose their jobs to machines are not likely to evoke much pity. But it is exactly Goldman\u2019s privileged status that makes the threat to its workers so interesting. If jobs can be displaced at Goldman, they can probably be displaced even more quickly at other, less sophisticated companies, within the financial industry as well as without.According to the Oxford paper and subsequent research, employment prospects vary significantly by industry. In health care, for example, where human interaction is vital, automation threatens fewer jobs than it does in the labor market as a whole. Taxi and truck drivers, though, face a bleak future given recent advances in self-driving cars. Among better-compensated professions, the Oxford researchers took into account software that can analyze and sort legal documents, doing the work that even well-paid lawyers often spend hours on. Journalists face start-ups like Automated Insights, which is already writing up summaries of basketball games. Finance stood out in particular: Because of the degree to which the industry is built on processing information \u2014 the stuff of digitization \u2014 the research suggested that it has more jobs at high risk of automation than any skilled industry, about 54 percent.The Oxford study received plenty of criticism \u2014 understandably, given the patina of exactness that it tried to apply to a speculative exercise. Nevertheless, the financial industry is taking automation very seriously, both as an opportunity and as a threat. It is one thing to make a few analysts redundant, but automation could put whole business models in peril. Investments in what is known as fintech, or financial technology, tripled between 2013 and 2014 to $12.2 billion, and start-ups are now taking aim at nearly every line of financial business. Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check. So-called robo-advisers create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers. Nearly every Wall Street firm has put out research reports on the tens of billions of dollars of revenue that might be lost to these upstarts in the coming years. Banks are trying to fend off the newcomers by making their own investments in start-ups like Kensho, which has raised more than $25 million so far.The skilled industries that form the bedrock of New York City\u2019s economy have so far largely avoided this sort of transformation, because the work of financial analysts, publishers and designers hasn\u2019t been easy to automate. But to look at a company like Kensho, and the sort of conversation it generates across the financial industry, is to see the degree to which these trends are now confronting industries that used to be thought exempt from this sort of disruption. Last fall, Antony Jenkins, who was dismissed a few months earlier as chief executive of Barclays, the giant British bank, gave a speech in which he said a coming series of \u2018\u2018Uber moments\u2019\u2019 would hit the financial industry.\u2018\u2018I predict that the number of branches and people employed in the financial-services sector may decline by as much as 50 percent,\u2019\u2019 Jenkins told the audience. \u2018\u2018Even in a less-harsh scenario, I expect a decline of at least 20 percent.\u2019\u2019 This process could, in at least some cases, help do away with some of the expensive bloat in the financial system, providing more transparent services with fewer hidden fees. It could also be seen as a satisfying blow against the titans of an industry that only recently almost crashed the world economy. But so far the burden of job losses is stopping just short of the executive suites, even as the gains in efficiency are worsening already troubling levels of income inequality.Some of the venture capitalists backing Kensho have told Nadler that he would be wise to stop talking about the potential job losses at the same banks he is trying to secure as customers. Nadler has told them that he needs to carry on, partly to maintain his intellectual integrity. He often connects his discussion of jobs to his political fund-raising on behalf of candidates who call for a more robust social-safety net. But he also says that his awareness of what his business is both creating and taking away sets him apart as an entrepreneur: It\u2019s his \u2018\u2018edge\u2019\u2019 in a business that is all about competing to predict the future more accurately.Now a sales representative can simply click an icon and access the Kensho interface, which consists of a simple black search bar. Nadler walked me through the process on his own laptop. Type in the word \u2018\u2018Syria,\u2019\u2019 and several groups of events related to Syria\u2019s civil war appear, in much the same way that Google recommends queries based on past searches. Here, among the top event groups, are \u2018\u2018Advances Against ISIS,\u2019\u2019 which includes 25 past events, and \u2018\u2018Major ISIS Advances and Brutal Atrocities,\u2019\u2019 with 105 events.Kensho\u2019s software is constantly tweaking and broadening these suggested search terms, all with little human intervention. In some ways, this is the most sophisticated part of the program. In the past, a trader or analyst would have to search Wikipedia or a news database using whatever keywords came to mind. Kensho\u2019s search engine automatically categorizes events according to abstract features. It has figured out, for instance, that ISIS\u2019s seizure of Palmyra and France\u2019s first airstrike in Syria were both escalations in the civil war there but also that in one of those cases, ISIS was the aggressor while in the other case, it was on the defense. The software also looks for new and unexpected relationships between events and asset prices, allowing it to recommend searches that a user might not have considered. For this feature, Nadler said, he hired one of the machine-learning whizzes who worked on Google\u2019s megacatalog of the world\u2019s libraries.Back on the trading desk, after picking out one group of events \u2014 the 27 incidents of \u2018\u2018Escalations in the Syrian civil war,\u2019\u2019 say \u2014 a sales trader can pick from a series of drop-down menus that narrow the search to a specific time period and a specific set of investments. The broadest set includes the world\u2019s 40 or so major assets, including German stocks, the Australian dollar and a few varieties of crude oil. They can then click on the green Generate Study button, and a few minutes later they\u2019ll have a new page full of charts. Nadler clicked to demonstrate. The top chart showed that the prices of natural gas and crude oil have underperformed in the weeks after past escalations in the war, while Asian stocks and the United States and Canadian dollar pair has outperformed. Scrolling down, we could also see how each event in Syria played out and begin to structure an optimal set of trades based on that history.Nadler closed his laptop. The whole process had taken just a few minutes. Generating a similar query without automation, he said, \u2018\u2018would have taken days, probably 40 man-hours, from people who were making an average of $350,000 to $500,000 a year.\u2019\u2019Kensho\u2019s main office is still in Cambridge, Mass., two floors above an old barbershop, with windows looking out onto Harvard Yard. The 30 or so employees in the large main room look like the kind of bright-eyed kids who in years past might have gone to work for Goldman Sachs. Here, though, they work at standup desks, wear jeans and enjoy the benefits of a Zen room, with pillows and tatami mats for meditation, as well as a game room with chessboards and a poker table.I visited the Cambridge office in December, shortly before Christmas. When I arrived, most of the employees were doing their Secret Santa gift exchange; their laughter frequently trickled back to the conference room where I sat with Nadler and a few of his top deputies. Curious to know how much they all talked about the larger implications of their work, I asked the deputies how quickly the topic of automation and job loss had come up in their relationship with Nadler.\u2018\u2018Pretty much the second sentence,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Taylor, the chief technology officer, who, at 38, is one of the senior citizens of the company.\u2018\u2018This was Day 1,\u2019\u2019 said Martin Camacho, Kensho\u2019s 20-year-old chief architect, who entered Harvard as a freshman when he was 15.Camacho remembered going home one night to Nadler\u2019s apartment during their first summer working on Kensho. They watched the science-fiction film \u2018\u2018Oblivion,\u2019\u2019 about a world populated by alien-generated human clones, and stayed up talking about the socioeconomic implications of the story. More recently, Nadler invited his engineering team to a dinner at one of Cambridge\u2019s nicest restaurants, Henrietta\u2019s Table, for a group conversation about the more distant implications of automation. Nadler said he anticipated some form of strong artificial intelligence, whereby computers in the far future would be smart enough to anticipate our needs and usher in an era of abundance. For the next few decades, though, he predicted a more complicated time \u2014 an interregnum in which the computers are not as smart as people but smart enough to do many of the tasks that make us money.Camacho was less pessimistic than his boss. When computer-assisted math proofs were invented a few years back, he said, it didn\u2019t lead to any decline in the number of math-research jobs. \u2018\u2018I think there will be plenty for everyone to do,\u2019\u2019 Taylor said, agreeing.When I raised the topic of automation with executives at Goldman and beyond, I often heard a similarly optimistic belief that all the new software will free up employees in the financial industry to do other, more valuable things; that it would also create new types of jobs that don\u2019t exist right now. Several executives I spoke with argued that when A.T.M.s were widely deployed, you didn\u2019t suddenly see bank branches disappearing.This is a common criticism of the Oxford report on automation: Even if 47 percent of all current jobs end up being automated, that does not mean that 47 percent of the working population will not have jobs, as many newspaper articles on the report concluded. Cars once displaced lots of coachmen and stable boys but created many more new jobs laying out highways and attending service stations. Nowadays, software that provides financial advice has automated the work of some stockbrokers, but it is also expanding the number of people getting financial advice and the demand for cheap investment products.The lead author on the Oxford paper, Carl Benedikt Frey, told me that he was aware that new technologies created jobs even as they destroyed them. But, Frey was quick to add, just because the total number of jobs stays the same doesn\u2019t mean there are no disruptions along the way. The automation of textile work may not have driven up the national unemployment rate, but vast swathes of the American South suffered all the same. When it comes to those A.T.M.s, there has, in fact, been a recent steady decline in both the number of bank branches and the number of bank tellers, even as the number of low-paid workers in remote call centers has grown.Chavez said Kensho itself was unlikely to displace many employees. The software, he said, was doing something that was previously so time-consuming that it was seldom attempted. (Some users also told me that there were still significant limitations on the sort of events the software could search.) But whatever the impact of Kensho, Chavez\u2019s larger efforts to digitize more of Goldman\u2019s operations are already changing the number and the type of employees at the firm. Over the last few years, the number of campus recruits coming to Goldman from science-and-technology majors has gone up 5 percent each year, while the total head count has barely budged. (Goldman is one of the few companies on Wall Street at which the total number of employees hasn\u2019t dropped significantly.) \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure there are going to be new jobs 10 or 20 years from now that none of us could even imagine today,\u2019\u2019 Chavez said.Stock trading, one of the earliest areas to go electronic, provides an interesting precedent for how automation can play out in an institution like Goldman. On the company\u2019s trading desks, stocks are now bought and sold by computers instead of people. Chavez says that the advent of computerized trading over the last two decades has reduced the number of Goldman employees who buy and sell American stocks the old-fashioned way \u2014 over the phone \u2014 to four from around 600, but the change in the number of traders tells only part of the story. Some of the traditional traders were replaced by programmers who design and monitor the new trading algorithms. Beyond that, there are now new jobs in the data centers where the high-speed trading takes place.Goldman doesn\u2019t provide numbers on any of this. But Paul Chou, who worked on Goldman\u2019s electronic-trading desks from 2006 to 2010, told me that he would guess that the company probably needed one programmer for every 10 of the old-school traders who lost their jobs. In one sign of the shrinking work force, Goldman moved the last trader out of one of its four Manhattan trading floors last year.The progression of Goldman\u2019s stock-trading operations also illustrates that automation is not an on-off switch. When Chou first joined Goldman, after graduating from M.I.T., part of his job involved logging onto dozens of trading systems and checking on what the algorithms were spitting out to make sure they weren\u2019t making any mistakes before the trades were executed. Chou sat near a woman who had been doing phone-based trading for years. She helped Chou and his young colleagues learn what to look for in a good trade. Over time, though, the programs proved themselves more error-proof than the humans. The woman left Goldman. And then Chou himself created a new program that logged into all the trading systems and pulled everything into a single screen. When he first got it going, he remembers his boss, a programmer himself, turning to Chou and saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even know why I show up to work anymore.\u2019\u2019The software Chou designed made it possible for him to dedicate himself to higher-level work, researching new trading strategies for the computers. This was more satisfying than all the monitoring he had been doing, but eventually it became too repetitive as well. Chou left Goldman in 2010 for Silicon Valley and now runs LedgerX, an options exchange that he founded with his wife and two others. The team he left at Goldman was smaller than it was when he arrived.Over the course of my conversations with Nadler, he backed away from the notion that Kensho will destroy jobs at Goldman itself. But he said he had no doubt that Kensho and other financial start-ups would eliminate jobs as they expanded across the industry and that the pace of the losses would be much faster outside Goldman than inside. After the end of Goldman\u2019s period of exclusivity with Kensho last summer, Nadler signed contracts to roll out the software at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.The number of jobs that these banks will support in the future will be influenced by much more than just software. Banks are currently cutting back in response to slower-than-expected economic growth and new regulations since the financial crisis. But these factors are also encouraging all the banks to look for any place where they can find a cheaper and more transparent way to do jobs that are currently being done by expensive and unreliable humans.When I asked Chavez whether the job losses were likely to continue to outpace the gains, he reacted with what seemed like genuine uncertainty. \u2018\u2018That is one of the most interesting questions of our time,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2018\u2018Technology is becoming more labor-saving and less job-creating,\u2019\u2019 Frey said.One theory for why this might be happening is that many of the recent technological advances have been in software rather than hardware. While a company like IBM or Dell needed employees to build each new computer for every new customer, software like Facebook and Kensho can be replicated endlessly, at near-zero marginal cost. When Chou came up with the software that automatically logged onto dozens of trading systems, it could essentially have been rolled out across all of Goldman\u2019s trading desks around the world the next day. This is very different from the 1970s, when Detroit would need to retrofit its car-manufacturing plants one at a time, after the robots themselves were actually built. The difference is what convinced Chou, after his time at Goldman Sachs and in Silicon Valley, that this phase of automation would play out differently from past ones.\u2018\u2018We are not coming up with new jobs as fast as we are replacing them,\u2019\u2019 Chou told me.This observation appears to be borne out by Kensho. In less than three years, Nadler\u2019s company has expanded to serve three of the world\u2019s largest banks and has needed only around 50 employees to do so, just enough to fill two relatively small offices. Recently, Nadler\u2019s New York staff moved to a bigger office in 1 World Trade Center. It has more room for desks so that Kensho can expand. But most of the additional space is taken up by a kitchen, a pool table and a putting green.The growth has made Kensho worth hundreds of millions of dollars and turned Nadler into a millionaire many times over, at least when his stake in the company is taken into account. But it\u2019s not clear how beneficial his company will be to the American labor market as a whole. Back when I first met Nadler, for a lunch last summer, he wasn\u2019t too proud to admit this. \u2018\u2018The cynical answer that another tech entrepreneur would give you is that we\u2019re creating new jobs, we\u2019re creating technology jobs,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve created, on paper at least, more than a dozen millionaires.\u2018\u2018That might help people sleep better at night,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u2018\u2018but we are creating a very small number of high-paying jobs in return for destroying a very large number of fairly high-paying jobs, and the net-net to society, absent some sort of policy intervention or new industry that no one\u2019s thought of yet to employ all those people, is a net loss.\u2019\u2019Nathaniel Popper is a financial reporter for The Times and the author of \u2018\u2018Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe in \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Data Deal, but Legal Fight May Await", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byPart of the challenge is balancing individuals\u2019 privacy concerns with national security obligations, particularly in light of mounting fears about international terrorism.Many obstacles still await the deal, which must be officially approved by the European Union\u2019s 28 member states. National data protection regulators have yet to give their support to the pact, and European privacy-rights advocates are preparing to file legal challenges seeking to overturn it.Most sensitive, perhaps, were provisions demanded by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, aimed at limiting how American intelligence agencies collect data on Europeans when companies send their personal information to the United States.All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.The American negotiators, in response, agreed to provide the annual written assurances.These guarantees, European officials said, will be reviewed each year, with American and European policy makers meeting to ensure that the strict privacy rights of Europe\u2019s more than 500 million citizens are respected by United States agencies.\u201cWe will hold the U.S. accountable on the commitments that they have made,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner who has led the negotiating team, said on Tuesday.The new deal \u201cis a major achievement for privacy and for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d Penny Pritzker, the United States Commerce secretary, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201dIt provides certainty that will help grow the digital economy.\u201dBoth sides will now spend the next two weeks completing the details of the new pact, which is to be called the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. If formally approved, it would go into effect by early April.But the deal\u2019s first hurdle comes on Wednesday, when Europe\u2019s increasingly powerful national privacy agencies plan to pass their own judgment on how data can be safely transferred outside the European Union.Many of these agencies, which can investigate and issue fines to companies that they suspect of misusing people\u2019s digital information, remain skeptical that rules protecting Europeans\u2019 data will be upheld in the United States. And some of these monitors have said that they will support further restrictions on how companies can move the data if they suspect it may be misused.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin is the chairwoman of the Pan-European body that will announce its assessment on Wednesday.The agreement drew praise on Tuesday from DigitalEurope, a group representing trade associations and multinational tech companies doing business in Europe, including Apple, Google and Microsoft.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Several consumer groups have said that they will file complaints with European privacy agencies to challenge the new agreement, while others have called on the United States to improve its own privacy laws to match those currently available in Europe.\u201cThe problem is that the U.S. remains unchanged,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.Despite these expected challenges, some European officials on Tuesday defended the new safe harbor agreement.In particular, the European Commission highlighted how the United States had proposed greater oversight on the access American intelligence agencies have to Europeans\u2019 data.The United States also agreed to establish an ombudsman in the State Department to act as a first point of contact for Europeans if they believed American government agencies had misused their data.Access granted to American intelligence agencies had become a sticking point in light of revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about that agency\u2019s surveillance of foreign citizens.During the most recent talks in Brussels, which involved officials from the United States Commerce Department and the Federal Trade Commission, among others, American negotiators had argued that United States law provided greater oversight and supervision of American intelligence agencies\u2019 use of personal data than rules now in place across the European Union, according to several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.But European Commission, which does not have the power to rule on its member states\u2019 national security practices, had demanded written guarantees.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be a one-off decision by the commission,\u201d said Ms. Jourova, the European justice commissioner. \u201cWe have achieved effective protection of Europeans\u2019 rights.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reporting on Zika When You Have Zika", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byNotebookEven before either of us had heard of the virus, we were taking all the precautions. Dengue and the also newly arrived chikungunya virus piggyback on the same Aedes aegypti mosquito; others species carry malaria. Having had dengue years ago, I had no interest in revisiting it or experiencing any of the other offerings. I slathered myself multiple times a day with DEET and wore one of those olive-drab insect-repellent bands. We slept under a Permethrin-treated bed net weighted down on the corners with history books. But Aedes are determined suckers. And once a nonfatal virus starts moving through a population with no immunity to it, especially in a place with little air-conditioning and no organized pest control, it\u2019s all but impossible not to be exposed.Reading that coverage was a strange experience. On the one hand, there was this Zika virus, out in the world, terrorizing the hemisphere, putting the White House on alert. On the other hand, there was the Zika virus inside of me, which was mostly just making me sleepy.But if I sound awfully sanguine about all this, let me assure you \u2014 I\u2019m not. Frankly, the journalist and the patient in me have been having a bit of a wrestling match the last few weeks.The patient isn\u2019t listening, because he\u2019s too busy taking his temperature for the third time in an hour and wondering if it\u2019s going to turn out that Zika causes hemorrhagic brain tumors.I think most of us have these internal battles, in one way or another, over all kinds of subjects. Whenever there is a disaster, especially for those trying to anticipate it or observing its effects from outside the zone, it\u2019s easy to get caught in a tug of war between crippling fear and the realization that it\u2019s better to take careful action. When it comes to the politics of terrorism, the kinds of measures we\u2019re willing or eager to take come down to what\u2019s stronger: the side of us that can sit and talk through actual problems and solutions, or the part that wants to scream, set everything on fire and run away.It\u2019s especially tough to balance those things when you\u2019re trying to observe them in the world and are inside of them yourself, dealing with uncertain consequences while doing your best to get out information to those who wonder what\u2019s going on.There are a lot of things we can usefully talk about when we talk about Zika. We can talk about the millions of women across the hemisphere who will not be able to avoid the infection and don\u2019t have access to contraception or safe methods of abortion. We can talk about what to do for the millions who are already pregnant and infected and who will not find out for months if their babies have been affected as well.The outbreak should also wake everyone up to the fact that we have to do something about these mosquitoes and the diseases they carry, which we knew were causing global public-health emergencies before anyone on this side of the Atlantic had even heard of the Zika virus. Half a billion people contract malaria annually, and 2.7 million of them die, according to the World Health Organization. Some 22,000 people die each year from dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is also carried by the Aedes mosquito. Hundreds of millions of people are rendered unable to work by other forms of dengue and diseases like chikungunya, which are far more painful than Zika and sometimes carry lifelong aftereffects. The danger is especially high today in the un-air-conditioned and poorly infrastructured world \u2014 and as global temperatures rise and the mosquitoes\u2019 range increases commensurately, diseases like these, and ones we don\u2019t even know about yet, will be more of a problem in the United States as well.But panic won\u2019t help us solve any of that. Which is why, even when I kept staring at my pink eyes in the mirror, silently scanning my body for warning signs of some rare, deadly complication, I had to try to keep myself from giving into fear, or from letting that fear affect my work. In the end, after a couple of days of fatigue, my wife and I seem to have recovered just fine from a mild and forgettable illness. I hope the same can be said for everyone else.Now if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m off to Google this sinus headache.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "European Privacy Regulators Want Details on \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Data Deal", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byThe move by the privacy regulators, which represent individual countries within the 28-nation European Union, indicates an unwillingness to accept the word of officials in Brussels that they can adequately safeguard citizens\u2019 personal data.The primary concern is how much access American intelligence agencies will have to European citizens\u2019 personal information.Europe\u2019s privacy regulators set a Feb. 29 deadline for receiving the new information. If the regulators then decide that the new agreement with the United States does not protect Europeans\u2019 privacy rights, the national officials would have the power to investigate \u2014 and potentially fine \u2014 companies. And because the data pact cannot take effect until all 28 European Union countries have signed off on it, the questions raised by the national data privacy officials could complicate that process.These uncertainties, legal experts say, may threaten the new data transfer deal \u2014 known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. The agreement was reached after three months of tense negotiations between American and European Union officials.Such data is the lifeblood of modern international business and digital commerce. Billions of dollars in trans-Atlantic trade hang in the balance, for online companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as for more traditional multinationals like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial company General Electric.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin\u2019s group of privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the current data transfer system would remain in place at least until the end of February. But the deadline raises questions of what would happen if the region\u2019s privacy regulators could not be reassured that the new Privacy Shield pact provided sufficient protection of personal data.\u201cI am 100 percent sure we received concrete assurances from the Americans,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner who was in charge of Europe\u2019s negotiating team, said in an interview on Wednesday.

But others \u2014 particularly officials in Britain and Ireland, where many international companies have headquarters \u2014 have said they favored the current data transfer approach.This divide, legal experts warn, could lead to some agencies pursuing investigations into companies\u2019 activities, on the behalf of citizens who believe their data may have been misused. Others, in contrast, are likely to permit companies to continue moving digital information almost unfettered between two of the world\u2019s largest economies.\u201cBusinesses will want to be cautious about signing up to Privacy Shield given the potential legal challenges,\u201d said Marc Dautlich, a data protection lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London.Wednesday\u2019s developments are the latest chapter of a bitter dispute.On one side are companies and government agencies in Europe and the United States that favor unfettered data transfers.On the other side are consumer advocacy groups in Europe, backed by some national data protection agencies, who are skeptical that Europeans\u2019 privacy rights will be upheld when their personal data is transmitted to the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a big concern about this agreement,\u201d said Estelle Mass\u00e9, a policy analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group in Brussels. \u201cWill it hold up in court?\u201dComplicating the issue are security concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about the rise of international terrorism. American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not want Europe\u2019s tough data privacy protections to prevent them, when necessary, from gaining access to the online communications of terrorism suspects, among others.This standoff is the result of a ruling last year by European judges that local citizens\u2019 digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. The judges also demanded that Europe\u2019s data protection authorities take a more active role in policing how information leaves their national borders.Even as they agreed on the broad outlines of the new accord, American and European policy makers knew they still had to fill in the details. Now, the national data regulators have given them a deadline.Victoria A. Espinel, president of the Software Alliance, a trade group in Washington, underlined the implications the deal could have.\u201cHalf a trillion dollars of trade is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still expect that cool heads will prevail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be more than $300 million.It is a deal that says much about the competition between Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to control much of the computing world over the next few years.A.W.S., Google and Microsoft\u2019s Azure business all rent access to globe-spanning cloud computing systems, each with millions of servers. All are trying to fill them with capabilities that developers can use to build products faster. The point is to get the corporate business into their clouds, and sell additional features once they are there.Scott Guthrie, the vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft, said Xamarin would continue to offer development tools to write for Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android mobile operating systems. Xamarin says it has 15,000 customers in 120 countries.Developers \u201ccan choose any cloud\u201d in which to manage and deploy their mobile applications, he said, but added \u201cyou\u2019ll see a deep integration with Azure,\u201d including features that won\u2019t be available in competing clouds.In other words, the idea is to treat everything equally, some more than others.It makes sense. In this competition, A.W.S. has an early lead and an outsize share of start-up developers. Google is vaunted for its low price and capabilities. Microsoft has the most corporate software in existing servers, and is trying to transfer those customers to the Azure cloud. To the extent Xamarin can help turn those into mobile apps, it helps with continuity.\u201cWe see enterprises that want to develop solutions to employees on mobile,\u201d Mr. Guthrie said. In addition, he said, \u201cevery enterprise wants to deliver mobile software to its own customers.\u201dThat idea underlines another trend in the current competition: With access to the cloud, mobile, sensors and large-scale data analysis, every company is becoming responsible for the entire life of its product, not just to the point of purchase, and customers are starting to demand that companies remain aware of how their products are being used.\u201cThe customers we are working with have a desire to build applications factories,\u201d said Nat Friedman, the chief executive of Xamarin, who will oversee all tools development under Mr. Guthrie. \u201cThey all want end-to-end service, and this is a way to offer that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She favors Chlo\u00e9, Marc Jacobs and Zara, and seems to have an occasional fondness for the color pink.And she is 4 years old.Her name is Harper Seven Beckham, and if you didn\u2019t already know, she is the daughter and youngest child of Victoria and David Beckham.Much like kindergarten contemporaries North West and Prince George, whose celebrity parents also command a global cult following, Harper has garnered a multimillion-strong army of admiring fans on Instagram and other social media platforms thanks to her impeccable outfits.\u201cGoodness, a full-time blog just on her, does she really?\u201d said her mother, Victoria Beckham, who was interviewed backstage after the show, with her family and well-wishers milling around. \u201cThat\u2019s quite amazing. I had no idea. And perhaps a little odd.\u201dMs. Beckham added: \u201cI suppose it says a lot about the world we are living in today. And yet it doesn\u2019t surprise me. Harper is incredibly chic \u2014 especially this morning in that coat from Christopher, and wears some incredibly sweet things. She\u2019s a very stylish little thing with her own sense of how she wants to dress. She tends to choose exactly what she wears herself.\u201dThere seems to be a booming trend for designer children\u2019s wear (some of Harper\u2019s outfits come from labels like Little Marc Jacobs and Stella McCartney Kids), making the wearers look more like mini-versions of their parents rather than rapidly developing toddlers and adolescents who will soon outgrow those expensive designer duds.The premium brands that regularly feature in the wardrobes of pint-size A-list offspring, and the retailers that sell them, are reaping the rewards. Net-a-Porter has registered the domain name Petite-a-Porter, and Harrods of London recently expanded its children\u2019s wear department to 66,000 square feet. When a figure like Harper is spotted wearing one outfit, brands say, sales can skyrocket and pieces sell out only hours after a photograph appears online.\u201cOur loyal customers are always interested in seeing who is wearing our clothes, and we do find that the clothes worn by Harper sell very quickly,\u201d said Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece, creative director of the luxury children\u2019s label Marie-Chantal in London. Pink velvet party dresses from the brand sell for around $280, while a pillar-box red coat with a bow collar costs $395.\u201cVictoria has been a great supporter over the years, and Harper has been wearing Marie-Chantal since she was a baby,\u201d the princess said. \u201cWe are so happy that Harper still loves wearing our clothes even as she gets older.\u201d (The Harper Beckham blog lists 31 times that Harper has been photographed in Marie-Chantal.)Eleanor Robinson, head of accessories and children\u2019s wear at Selfridges, said last week that best-selling designer items in recent seasons for the upmarket British department store have included a Burberry trench worn by Romeo Beckham, Pink Dr. Martens and Charlotte Olympia kitty flats seen on North West; and items by Chlo\u00e9, Bonpoint and Little Marc Jacobs that Harper has been spotted wearing.\u201cHere in the United Kingdom especially, there is this very British sense of pride with celebrities and their children, and in particular with the Beckhams and Princess Catherine and Prince William,\u201d Ms. Robinson said. \u201cThese are family role models who dress their children beautifully, and consumers aspire to replicate this personal sense of style that also reinforces positive family ideals. Children\u2019s wear has become an increasingly important part of our fashion business.\u201dThe person who runs the Harper Beckham fashion site, Anastasia Medvedeva, is a blogger based in the San Francisco Bay Area. She said the site got about 3,000 hits a day and was an \u201cunremarkable\u201d moneymaker, deriving its income from a few Google ads. \u201cI first started eight years ago with a fashion blog about Suri Cruise because I loved her style when she was little, and have been a lifelong fan of Victoria Beckham, so a focus on Harper was a natural progression,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cHarper is very popular because of who her parents are and their personal style.\u201dDespite the haute fashion pieces Harper sported supporting her mother at the Sunday show, another apparent factor behind her breakout street-style star status is the quota of items she wears that are affordable for the general public, Ms. Medvedeva wrote, making copying her looks more accessible for many parents.Though the Bonpoint and Chlo\u00e9 dresses frequently worn by Harper can range from $100 to $250, Ms. Medvedeva wrote, she can often be seen in emerging brands like Billieblush, Gardner and the Gang, and Courage & Kind, which are relatively more affordable.How aware Harper is of her style supernova status remains to be seen. She will return to school next week in London after her half-term break. But her mother said she doubted the attention would deter Harper from continuing to wear her consistently favorite item.\u201cMore than anything,\u201d Ms. Beckham said, \u201cshe loves her football jersey.\u201dCheck out our complete New York Fashion Week coverage here.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Florist-Friendly Marketplaces Help Local Flower Shops Hang On", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byEntrepreneurshipThis weekend, florists across the country will send out millions of Valentine\u2019s Day bouquets filled with roses, carnations, tulips and other blooming symbols of love. And some will lose money on almost every single sale.The recession and shoppers\u2019 changing preferences have played a role: Fresh flowers are a luxury that tends to get scrapped when money is tight. But florists say one of their biggest challenges is a behind-the-scenes margin fight that plays out every time a buyer goes online to arrange a flower delivery.That leaves the bricks-and-mortar merchants, to whom the orders are passed for fulfillment, typically collecting 70 percent or less of the sale price, fueling a sort of love-hate relationship with online merchants. While they can increase business for a florist, that business can come at a high price.The industry\u2019s current financial structure has its roots in a century-old practice. In 1910, a group of 15 American florists formed a cooperative, the Florists\u2019 Telegraph Delivery service, to exchange orders. A customer in Denver would, for example, be able to walk into a local flower shop and arrange a delivery to a friend in Boston. The originating florist transmitted the order through the florists\u2019 wire service and received a commission for the effort; the rest of the money was passed on to the fulfilling merchant.In a typical wire service transaction today, the originating merchant receives 20 percent of the sale price, and the wire service \u2014 FTD, 1-800-Flowers and Teleflora are the industry\u2019s big three \u2014 keeps 7 percent. If an order comes in directly through a wire\u2019s website, the service keeps the full 27 percent.BloomNation charges a flat 10 percent fee on the orders it processes, and it does not have a standardized product catalog. Merchants take and post photos of their own arrangements.That part particularly delights Ms. Paurus, who changes her photos daily.\u201cIf we get a double shipment of roses, within a few minutes, we can have a rose special on our website,\u201d she said.BloomNation\u2019s executives say 1,500 shops are using their marketplace. Farbod Shoraka, one of the founders, began working on the concept five years ago after hearing from his aunt, a florist, about her business\u2019s many pain points.\u201cThe consumer was frustrated, the business owner was frustrated, and the middleman was making all the money,\u201d Mr. Shoraka said. \u201cIt was a very clearly broken model, from a business standpoint.\u201dSo why do florists stick with it? Some of them say they value the sales volume that the wire services bring in and have found ways to make the orders profitable. Others point to the industry\u2019s reliance on the vendors it has worked with for decades.\u201cA lot of florists still rely on the wire services to send their outgoing orders, including many florists we have worked with for years and years,\u201d Ms. Bank said. \u201cAlthough we try to talk them into paying us directly, many are resistant. That\u2019s why we will likely continue with Teleflora, to maintain those relationships.\u201dThe wire services say they play a vital role in marketing florists\u2019 goods.\u201cWe run analytics to quantify what it costs to acquire an order,\u201d he said. \u201cMy cost across all of the platforms usually ranges from 24 to 30 percent. In the end, no matter what I use, I have to figure out how to make money on about 73 percent of the sale.\u201dBut as their industry shrinks, some flower shop owners are stepping up their efforts to change the way it operates.Recently the group requested a new feature, now in development, and it is one that sounds rather familiar.\u201cWe had the idea that we wanted to create our own florist-to-florist network,\u201d said Mr. Fiannaca, one of the group\u2019s founders. \u201cI can send an order to a member florist, and his or her products would populate on my web page.\u201dSo a century later, Real Local Florists is essentially working to recreate the kind of co-op that FTD pioneered. When asked about the similarity, Mr. Fiannaca laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s a good model,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just has to be one that helps keep local florists in business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Even the ingredient list, with its parade of unintelligible words and the promise of a full day\u2019s supply of vitamins and iron, seemed endlessly fascinating. I was rapt until the bowl was empty and his sugarcoated golden crowns had turned the milk to syrup.Now, I watch my young daughter stare at her cereal box in the morning, pondering a stalk of organic wheat or the plight of a koala. I wonder if she will ever have the sentimental pleasure of her own King Vitaman.But breakfast cereal, both as a cultural marker and a profit center, is at a crossroads. Since the late 1990s, its popularity has been slowly fading. Sales, which totaled $13.9 billion in 2000, dipped last year to about $10 billion.Younger consumers are not as attached to cold cereal for breakfast as their forebears, analysts and cereal makers agree. They either don\u2019t eat breakfast at all, or eat it somewhere other than home. And when they do eat breakfast, a bowl of cold cereal is often replaced by hot grains, smoothies, yogurt or breakfast sandwiches.Some analysts, like Euromonitor, predict that cereal will continue its slide, while others, like Packaged Facts, are forecasting a turnaround. So are the big cereal producers. This month, John A. Bryant, the Kellogg Company\u2019s chief executive, predicted that its cereal sales in the United States would actually grow by 1 or 2 percent this year.Although breakfast cereal seems simple enough, fitting the right one with the right customer has become a challenge in an age of niche preferences, when even the specific grain and where it came from are critical to shoppers.\u201cThe cereal category is certainly shifting,\u201d said Melissa Abbott, director of culinary insights for the Hartman Group, a consumer food research organization. \u201cConsumers over all are less interested in industrially processed grains as a meaningful start to their day.\u201dKellogg\u2019s, which Mr. Bryant told investors this month had not always been on top of consumer tastes, is banking on a better mix of healthful cereals. It has just introduced a Nourish line of Special K with quinoa, and is looking at ways to repackage cereal into single servings and more eco-friendly bags.The dream of all these companies is to capture the all-powerful and elusive millennial eater, who just isn\u2019t all that into cereal for breakfast. It\u2019s just too much work, for one thing. Almost 40 percent of the millennials surveyed by Mintel for its 2015 report said cereal was an inconvenient breakfast choice because they had to clean up after eating it.The cold cereals that baby boomers grew up on have been relegated to a category called \u201ccomfort brands,\u201d and Bon App\u00e9tit offers only a couple of choices on its traditional cafeteria lines. At Emory University in Atlanta, it\u2019s Raisin Bran and Lucky Charms. Cheerios are served not because everyone has loved them since childhood, but because they are gluten free. The organic offering is Kashi Sweet Potato Sunshine. (At other places on campus, the company does sell a wider array of cereals like Frosted Flakes and Golden Grahams.)Still, this generation of young people may be the ones who save cereal. But it probably won\u2019t be because they are eating it for breakfast, or because they are moved by vague claims of health, nutrition or environmental impact. Millennials are snackers, and not easily fooled by packaging or advertising, but they are as nostalgia-driven as any group of cereal eaters.\u201cI literally had three bowls of cereal for dinner last night,\u201d said Christina Tosi, the New York pastry chef who founded the Milk Bar cafes and made the milk left in the bottom of a cereal bowl a culinary phenomenon by turning it into ice cream. She is a big fan of Lucky Charms and Frosted Flakes.Ms. Tosi, 34, could be considered either a member of Generation X or a millennial. Like many people her age, she thinks of cereal more as a creative outlet or a way to dip into the past than as breakfast.Since the business began slumping in the 1990s, cereal companies have been trying to position cereal as something other than breakfast, putting it into crackers and snack bars. But Ms. Tosi, who consults for Kellogg\u2019s, said they haven\u2019t exploited all the various ways cereal is being used.\u201cThey have to embrace that people love the flavor and texture of cereal and the vintage nature, but it\u2019s not about breakfast,\u201d Ms. Tosi said.Cereal manufacturers are starting to catch on. Recently, Kellogg paid a young, culturally diverse group of chefs to create dishes using its cereals. Among them was Danny Bowien, the man behind Mission Chinese Food in New York and San Francisco, and a lifelong Corn Flakes fan. For a special breakfast menu he served in December, Mr. Bowien matched Frosted Flakes with matcha milk and green tea powder, and poured bacon-infused soy milk over Corn Pops, topping the dish with a fried egg.Fancy cocktails and cutting-edge cuisine may not do much to budge sales figures. But the chefs may lend breakfast cereal some needed cachet \u2014 and visibility \u2014 if only by eating it.Kyle Mendenhall, the executive chef of the Kitchen, a restaurant group in Boulder, Colo., likes to pour cream or whole milk over Honey Nut Cheerios, the nation\u2019s top-selling brand.\u201cEvery chef is probably a cereal guy,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause 90 percent of them go home at 2 in the morning and eat what\u2019s there because they don\u2019t want to cook anymore.\u201dRead more about the history of breakfast cereal.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

Facebook describes the program as a way to introduce the poor and the technologically unskilled to the potential of the Internet.Even with that noble aim, Facebook miscalculated in introducing the program in India. While Facebook expected to be welcomed with open arms, its message to the country focused on itself rather than the broad coalition of telecommunications firms supporting the effort, experts said. That, in turn, fostered a climate of distrust about Facebook\u2019s future intentions in the country and led to the questions from regulators.India\u2019s decision also puts Facebook in an unusual position in the debate over net neutrality, which says that Internet providers should provide equal access to all web content. In the United States, Facebook has been a proponent of net neutrality. Yet the Indian regulators\u2019 ruling, which furthers net neutrality, puts Facebook in a losing position.Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s stumble in bringing his signature project to India underscores the difficulties of widening Internet access to the world at large, which companies like Google and Xiaomi of China also are trying. While there is enormous potential upside in offering web services to hundreds of millions of people who are currently not digitally connected, regulators and local officials have proved much more difficult to navigate than these tech companies anticipated.\u201dThere has been such a great deal of spotlight on a single Internet issue,\u201d said Nikhil Pahwa, editor and publisher of MediaNama, an Indian news site, who has strongly opposed Facebook\u2019s efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t think Internet policy in India will ever again be made in a vacuum, a black box.\u201dFree Basics came out of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s program for universal Internet access, which was started in 2013 under an initiative called Internet.org. The idea was to simplify phone applications to run more efficiently and to offer these apps to users in developing countries. Half a dozen of the world\u2019s tech giants, including Samsung, Nokia, Qualcomm and Ericsson, agreed to work with Facebook as partners on the initiative.In India, where Facebook already has at least 132 million users, the company began offering Free Basics last year through Reliance Communications, a local mobile phone carrier. A Reliance spokesman could not be reached for comment.Experts said that campaign may have had an adverse effect on Indian thinking. Locals were wary of the company\u2019s unknown long-term plans for advertising or other parts of Facebook\u2019s business.\u201cThe phrase \u2018no free lunch\u2019 translates pretty well into a lot of different languages,\u201d said Josh Levy, an advocacy director for Access Now, an international digital rights organization.The issue of these Internet services has been debated in other countries, including the United States, where the Federal Communications Commission is studying whether zero-rated services comply with its own net neutrality rules.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which announced the new regulations on Monday, said in its policy document that mobile phone companies should not be allowed to \u201cshape the users\u2019 Internet experience\u201d by providing free access only to certain services.Since most Indians are not yet online, the agency noted, such programs have great power to shape a newcomer\u2019s whole view of the Internet.\u201cWhat we want is for everyone in the world to get access to the same Internet,\u201d said Mr. Pahwa of MediaNama. \u201cThe Internet is not just a collection of 130 websites. We don\u2019t want to be forced to make a choice between access and net neutrality.\u201dThe Cellular Operators Association of India said it was disappointed with the decision. The regulations \u201cconstitutes a welfare-reducing measure of high concern by blocking a possible avenue for our less advantaged citizens to move to increased economic growth and prosperity by harnessing the power of the Internet,\u201d said Rajan S. Mathews, director general of the group.In a post to his personal Facebook page on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg also pushed back. \u201cConnecting India is an important goal we won\u2019t give up on, because more than a billion people in India don\u2019t have access to the Internet,\u201d he wrote.\u201cWe know that connecting them can help lift people out of poverty, create millions of jobs and spread education opportunities. We care about these people, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so committed to connecting them,\u201d he wrote.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of countries where Free Basics is offered. It is 38, not 25.Vindu Goel reported from San Francisco and Mike Isaac from New York. Ellen Barry contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Deadpool: Meet the Prime Mover Behind the Mercenary", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byThe comic-book artist Rob Liefeld often compares himself to famous people. At conventions, when he meets fans dressed as one of his characters, Mr. Liefeld says he feels like Gianni Versace. He likens his relationship with the contemporaries Todd McFarlane and Jim Lee to the intra-band conflicts of the Eagles. To illustrate the criticism he encountered after his meteoric rise in comics in the 1990s, he cites LeBron James and Britney Spears.\u201cGive me a celebrity, I\u2019ll give you your haters,\u201d Mr. Liefeld said in a recent telephone interview from his home studio in Yorba Linda, Calif. \u201cSome people shine, and some people don\u2019t like when they shine. Ask Barack Obama, he\u2019ll tell you.\u201dThe youngest child of a Baptist minister and a part-time secretary in Anaheim, Calif., Mr. Liefeld became a sensation when, at 22, he took over the flagging Marvel series \u201cThe New Mutants,\u201d a bland junior varsity offshoot of the X-Men. With the comic nearing cancellation, Mr. Liefeld took risks: He plotted story lines packed with twists while introducing hordes of characters, including Deadpool, who made his first appearance \u2014 \u201cIntroducing the lethal Deadpool\u201d \u2014 on the cover of The New Mutants No. 98 in 1991.Mr. Liefeld\u2019s assistant at the time, the comic book artist Marat Mychaels, remembers him leaving work upset one night. \u201cHe came back the next day with a sketch of Deadpool,\u201d Mr. Mychaels said. \u201cHe goes, \u2018What do you think?\u2019 I said, \u2018He looks awesome.\u2019\u201dIn Deadpool\u2019s origin story, he shared a mythos with the X-Men\u2019s Wolverine, Mr. Liefeld\u2019s favorite character. Spider-Man inspired the costume design and red-and-black color scheme \u2014 as well as Deadpool\u2019s irreverent sense of humor \u2014 and the character became an immediate cult phenomenon. \u201cHe was so popular that we had to fast-track his story,\u201d Mr. Liefeld said.Mr. Liefeld\u2019s drawing style also rankled traditionalists: He ditched conventional four- and six-panel grids in favor of epic images that pulled inspiration from Japanese anime, manga and MTV. (He admits to watching music videos while working.)\u201cEvery figure that Rob draws has a certain energy to it, a certain excitement,\u201d Robert Kirkman, a creator of The Walking Dead comics, said in a telephone interview. \u201cEvery character Rob drew had seven knives and six guns and shoulder pads and pouches and belts and straps and ammunition. It was an aesthetic that as a kid absolutely blew me away. I idolized the guy.\u201dMr. Kirkman, a friend of Mr. Liefeld and one of his most vocal defenders, said detractors miss the point. \u201cEverything he draws is interesting, whether it\u2019s accurate or not,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people look at the way Rob draws the human body and they say, \u2018That\u2019s wrong in my eyes.\u2019 I would say that these people have no joy in their souls. It\u2019s not like Rob doesn\u2019t know what a human body looks like, I think Rob looks at a human body and goes: \u2018That\u2019s boring. I can do better.\u2019\u201dMr. Liefeld insists the criticism didn\u2019t bother him. \u201cNot one iota.\u201d Then, referring to his father\u2019s death from cancer in 1999, he added that he didn\u2019t care if people ridiculed his artwork. \u201cI\u2019ve had really hard struggles in my life.\u201dHe is prickly, though, about sharing creator credit on Deadpool with Fabian Nicieza, who wrote the script for the character\u2019s first appearance, based on Mr. Liefeld\u2019s story. As plotter, penciler and inker of The New Mutants at the time of Deadpool\u2019s inception, Mr. Liefeld said he did \u201call the heavy lifting.\u201d\u201cIf a janitor scripted New Mutants 98, he\u2019d be the co-creator \u2014 that\u2019s how it works, buddy,\u201d Mr. Liefeld said. \u201cDeadpool does not exist in any way, shape or form without me.\u201dMr. Liefeld added: \u201cI wrote the stories. Like Jim Lee and others, I worked with a scripter who helped facilitate. I chose Fabian, and he got the benefit of the Rob Liefeld lottery ticket. Those are good coattails to ride.\u201d Neither Mr. Nicieza nor his manager could be reached for comment.Mr. Liefeld said he hoped that more of his creations, like Cable, a dour soldier from the future, and his X-Force lieutenant, Domino, follow Deadpool to the big screen.

{"Headline": "Gearing Up for the Cloud, AT&T Tells Its Workers: Adapt, or Else", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 Thirty-four years ago, Kevin Stephenson got his younger brother, Randall, a job with the telephone company.Kevin, then 23, and Randall, 22, had tried selling cattle feed with their father near their home in Moore, Okla., but that didn\u2019t pan out. Kevin was hired to do accounting at a local Southwestern Bell office. Randall, who was in college, needed a bit more help. \u201cHe had trouble getting hired,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI talked to someone I knew in personnel.\u201dThe brothers had different tastes. Kevin liked to be outside, and now, at 57 years old, he works in Norman, Okla., fixing the decades-old copper lines that still connect to landline telephones in most homes as well as to modern Internet conduits like high-speed fiber optics. Randall liked numbers and stayed indoors, rising through the management ranks.Southwestern Bell became SBC Communications and took on the old AT&T name through an acquisition in 2005. By 2007, Randall was running the place.Today, Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is trying to reinvent the company so it can compete more deftly. Not that long ago it had to fight for business with other phone companies and cellular carriers. Then the Internet and cloud computing came along, and AT&T found itself in a tussle with a whole bunch of companies.AT&T\u2019s competitors are not just Verizon and Sprint, but also tech giants like Amazon and Google. For the company to survive in this environment, Mr. Stephenson needs to retrain its 280,000 employees so they can improve their coding skills, or learn them, and make quick business decisions based on a fire hose of data coming into the company.In an ambitious corporate education program that started about two years ago, he is offering to pay for classes (at least some of them) to help employees modernize their skills. But there\u2019s a catch: They have to take these classes on their own time and sometimes pay for them with their own money.To Mr. Stephenson, it should be an easy choice for most workers: Learn new skills or find your career choices are very limited.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.\u201cThere is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop,\u201d he said in a recent interview at AT&T\u2019s Dallas headquarters. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning, he added, \u201cwill obsolete themselves with the technology.\u201dKevin? He admires his younger brother, but he is among the many AT&T lifers who are not that keen to participate in this reinvention of old Ma Bell. \u201cI\u2019m riding the copper train all the way down,\u201d he said.He talks about the changes with obvious affection for both his brother and his longtime employer. In interviews, many veteran AT&T employees around the country showed a surprising amount of emotion toward a company that has been broken up, rebuilt and reinvented several times.But that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is particularly eager to rebuild and reinvent themselves for a new AT&T. Even if it means, as Randall put it, obsolescence.Companies\u2019 reinventing themselves to compete with more nimble competitors is hardly a new story. Many have tried, and a handful have even succeeded. Mr. Stephenson wants AT&T to be among those few.By 2020, Mr. Stephenson hopes AT&T will be well into its transformation into a computing company that manages all sorts of digital things: phones, satellite television and huge volumes of data, all sorted through software managed in the cloud.That can\u2019t happen unless at least some of his work force is retrained to deal with the technology. It\u2019s not a young group: The average tenure at AT&T is 12 years, or 22 years if you don\u2019t count the people working in call centers. And many employees don\u2019t have experience writing open-source software or casually analyzing terabytes of customer data.If you don\u2019t develop the new skills, you won\u2019t be fired \u2014 at least AT&T won\u2019t say as much \u2014 but you won\u2019t have much of a future. The company isn\u2019t too worried about people leaving, since executives estimate that eventually AT&T could get by with one-third fewer workers.Mr. Stephenson declined to project how many workers he might have by 2020, when the cloud-based system is supposed to be fully in place. One thing about cutting people in an aging work force, he noted, is that \u201cdemography is on our side.\u201d Other senior executives say shrinking the work force by 30 percent is not out of the question.Maybe so, but count Kevin among the skeptics of how fast AT&T\u2019s transformation will happen.\u201cI\u2019m proud of my brother,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not going to get rid of this stuff as fast as he thinks.\u201dLong ago, a phone system created wire lines between callers, and operators moved plugs in their switchboards to connect people. Over time, that was automated to become something closer to a computer, with digital fibers and wireless towers. Much of the setup, however, still needed lots of people to tend hardware that had been built for particular tasks, like feeding one neighborhood\u2019s calls into a nationwide backbone of wires, fiber and switches.Mr. Stephenson has concentrated on things related to cloud computing, a technology setup that is more like the computer guts of Google or Amazon than the circuits and switches of a phone company. This cloud system will eventually touch ventures in landline phones, wireless, high-speed online services, cable TV and now satellite, thanks to the DirecTV purchase.Analysts give him good marks but say he has a long way to go. \u201cThey want to be 75 percent done by 2020, and last year they did the first 5 percent,\u201d said Akshay Sharma, an analyst with the research firm Gartner.AT&T wants to build products and services as fast as this competition. Data from satellite TV could be analyzed for viewing habits and someday used, for example, to sell football fans a replay app for their AT&T mobile phones.In 2012, Mr. Stephenson realized, much to his dismay, that his staff was woefully unschooled for the new technology. Vision 2020, as the company calls it, is a program that combines online and classroom-based course work in subjects like digital networking and data science, as well as a look at old skills that can be transferred to new careers.Everything at AT&T is changing, from the services customers are offered to the way they are charged for them. One service called Network on Demand, for example, allows customers to increase the size of their Internet pipes without calling a technician, something that used to take weeks. And Mr. Stephenson\u2019s employees have to be able to deal with all that.\u201cIf we can\u2019t do it, mark my words, in three years we\u2019ll be managing decline,\u201d he said.Inside a glass-walled office where Mr. Stephenson meets presidential candidates and corporate titans, Mr. Thrun gave him a pitch on funding an online master\u2019s degree in engineering that Udacity proposed to teach in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Within five minutes, the two men were cross-legged on the floor, Mr. Stephenson eager to try a physics course.His first online learning began with an unexpected challenge: getting online. AT&T\u2019s own Wi-Fi was too clunky, Mr. Thrun recalled. Eventually they used Mr. Thrun\u2019s smartphone, which ran on the network of T-Mobile, a rival carrier.The building\u2019s Wi-Fi is now said to be better, and elsewhere in AT&T the first employees are getting their online Georgia Tech degrees.Eboni Bell, 24, a product manager for smartphone software in AT&T\u2019s Atlanta office, sees the Vision 2020 retraining as the chance of a lifetime. The company provided tuition assistance for much of her two-year Udacity/Georgia Tech master\u2019s degree in computer science, which it says cost $6,600. Single and childless, she doesn\u2019t mind the hours it takes.\u201cI leave the office at 7 p.m., work at home until midnight, and Saturdays and Sundays are committed to school,\u201d she said.Ms. Bell, who wants to work in software architecture and design, plans to keep taking courses. \u201cI need to know what my competitors are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself staying with one product too long \u2014 it makes me feel like I\u2019m not growing.\u201dSo far most of the people who have taken the new courses are managers, and seem interested in learning very technical skills. Among the most popular courses are web development, data analysis, introduction to programming and writing apps for the iPhone.\u201cIt\u2019s great for those who want to make the transition,\u201d said Mr. Sharma of Gartner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to change, it\u2019s a good time to retire and enjoy life.\u201dAT&T\u2019s workers receive weekly emails and video broadcasts about learning online. Vision 2020 includes an internal website where employees can enter their job titles, see what types of careers might be available in a software-driven company, and what courses they need to take to get them. Over time, their grades are logged, and depending on how they do on the schoolwork, different new courses are suggested. Eventually, performance reviews will include data on what people studied, how well they did and whether, like Ms. Bell, they are willing to keep learning.Eventually, the plan is that desire for learning will be taken into account when promotions are considered.Across the country in Orange, Calif., Patti Cunningham, a 61-year-old technician, is struggling. Ms. Cunningham, who has worked at AT&T for 43 years, has not signed up for any courses, and can barely recall receiving emails about the new plans. (An AT&T spokesman produced dozens of such messages, going back to early 2014.) Essentially, she does not see a place for herself.\u201cThis new concept of training on your own time, everything changing all the time, if you want to keep working, do more things on your own time \u2014 I guess they have to do it,\u201d she said, sitting in a run-down room at her union local. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see a need to be involved.\u201dChristopher Shelton, national head of the Communications Workers of America, said the changes were inevitable, and he believed his people would go along with them.\u201cWe realized a long time ago that you can\u2019t fight technology change and win,\u201d he said. \u201cOur contracts spell out training programs and policies to make sure that members get training to update their skills as technology changes.\u201d Still, he thinks the expectations about home study after a hard day\u2019s work are too much.AT&T will reimburse up to $8,000 a year in tuition; the amount was raised just last month. The company claims that a year into the program, over half of the work force, mostly managers, has started training, sometimes with dozens of short online courses.\u201cPeople are going to have to work hard, but it\u2019s not insane,\u201d said William Blase, who oversees personnel for all of AT&T. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an expectation that your compensation will be tied to continuing to learn. We\u2019re at a crossroads as a business \u2014 and a country \u2014 where education has to keep up with technology.\u201dIf there is one thing on which Ms. Bell and Ms. Cunningham agree, albeit with different sentiments, it is that the change is necessary. Eventually phone calls, texts, sensor data and TV shows, along with much else, will all run on fiber-optic networks and be managed largely with software.Ms. Bell works with a lot of older colleagues. \u201cOne of my co-workers has been looking at the same database for 20 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds harsh, but if she doesn\u2019t adapt, there won\u2019t be room for her.\u201dThat message has not been lost on Jacobie Davis, an 18-year employee in Richardson, Tex., who works in tech support for older-style gear. At 39, he is the youngest person in his office, and is scrambling to study both new networks and data science. \u201cI try to put in 15 hours a week,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2020, my technology will be gone.\u201dIn some ways, cloud computing is not as radical a technology shift as all the puffy language suggests. Big banks of computers still run software, as they have been doing in many industries since the 1960s. They have more power, because their chips have more transistors that enable them to do more, and they connect to more things thanks to fiber-optic cable and wireless.The big difference is something called virtualization, which amounts to software that allows many machines to operate like one piece of computer hardware. This made it possible to run software that in effect interacted with other software instead of hardware. This, in turn, means the possibility of changing functions around rapidly by typing a few lines of code.The new systems also collect more data, quickly analyze information about what people and things are doing, and react. That is how online ads are personalized for you, and increasingly how maps reflect current traffic conditions, or streetlights adjust to suit parking congestion.Now what once took a year of analysis and deployment can instead happen in days, even minutes.These concepts can be tough in some reaches of AT&T, where lives and work have not changed all that much.In Dayton, Ohio, Kirk Warrenburg came out of a job in a bowling alley and started wiring cards for telegraph systems 40 years ago. Now he works on AT&T\u2019s signaling network, which makes sure billions of calls get through.He has taken 16 courses \u2014 Udacity courses and in-house \u201cnano courses,\u201d each about two weeks long \u2014 in the last year. He doesn\u2019t see himself changing jobs, however, because the old machines still need someone to care for them. Younger workers, he thinks, won\u2019t want to be in his dead end.\u201cWriting a telegraph circuit was like writing a recipe for a field technician,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of legacy systems are still around here. I\u2019ll be long gone before they will.\u201dSome other older employees besides Kevin Stephenson think the 2020 target will come and go, but basics won\u2019t change.The 2020 effort \u201cis just a start,\u201d said Kenny Williams, 64, a testing technician and the head of Ms. Cunningham\u2019s union local in Southern California. \u201cI\u2019ve inoculated my people against worrying. They need a fiber network for this that doesn\u2019t exist out here yet. Seventy percent of my folks are safe; the other 30 have to be found jobs, or they\u2019ll take the golden handshake\u201d and retire.As he sees it, much of the urgency comes from the threat of Google. In 2015 Google Fiber, Google\u2019s high-speed Internet service, caused AT&T to do something uncommon in its history: lower its prices because of competition. \u201cIn 40 years here I hadn\u2019t seen that,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cTheir people aren\u2019t in unions \u2014 we\u2019re a lot more on AT&T\u2019s side than theirs.\u201dWhat happens next at AT&T \u2014 and how fast that will happen \u2014 is a matter of disagreement in the Stephenson family.\u201cI go out to houses away from the cities, and there\u2019s not a lot of fiber there,\u201d Kevin said. Fiber would open the way for all that new technology. He takes comfort in looking at patches linemen did on fiber systems decades ago \u2014 from both the jury-rigged craftsmanship and the way they have endured.But Randall said his brother was not necessarily like the rest of the work force because there will always be hard, outdoor tasks for people like him. \u201cThere will be people turning screws and digging trenches. I\u2019ll be long gone before that is over. But other guys I know in Oklahoma will do a skills pivot\u201d with additional training, he said.Besides, it\u2019s not just about his brother.

But a ruling in December 2014 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit threatened to upend many of those convictions.The Second Circuit said insider trading required knowledge that insiders passing along confidential tips were doing so in exchange for personal benefits that had \u201csome consequence.\u201d It overturned the convictions of two men prosecuted by Mr. Bharara, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, who traded on information they got through analysts.In October, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in that Second Circuit case, United States v. Newman. Then last month, the high court said it would review a decision by another appeals court where an insider trading conviction had been upheld.Dennis Riordan, a lawyer for Mr. Whitman, said the decision to release his client was a strong indication that another attempt to appeal the conviction would be taken seriously.\u201cWe\u2019re delighted with the court\u2019s ruling today, and we think that it bodes well for the merits of the appeal,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kamakshi Sivaramakrishnan: Finding Direction Off the Beaten Path", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byCorner OfficeQ. Tell me about your early years.There was a natural proclivity to mathematics in our family, going back for generations, with a lot of accountants and civil servants. But there is zero entrepreneurial background. I never had a lemonade stand. All I wanted to have was a stellar academic career. And that stayed true through the course of my education, including in the U.S. for my advanced degrees. The fields that I chose were some version of applied mathematics for engineers.My parents inspired me to pursue higher education, but at some point, the choices I was making appeared to them to be one challenge after another along an uncharted course. I remember my father asking, \u201cIs there a reason that you don\u2019t choose something that is considered to be normal? You\u2019re always sort of moving toward the most challenging path, and not one that has been charted by us. We are not able to help you.\u201d But it felt like a natural path to me.I became an entrepreneur probably by accident. As you pursue a Ph.D., you\u2019re an innovator, and that process is something I was constantly seeking. Being an entrepreneur is more about creating impact.Back to your father\u2019s point about your choices. Why have you always picked the more difficult path?It has always been appealing to me. I do not like the beaten path, even in the personal choices that I made. I met my husband at grad school, we fell in love, we married. But in my family, you\u2019re encouraged to follow the norms of an arranged marriage. I grew up having broken pretty much every rule in the book that I was given as a young woman or as a child.I even left a fairly comfortable position at Google to start this company. There\u2019s an innate desire in me to pursue what I feel is right for me at the time. And it doesn\u2019t come from any kind of rebellious streak as much as it comes from a sense of conviction that I believe in this and I want to pursue it.I was encouraged by my mother to not pay attention to the fact that I\u2019m a female pursuing paths that probably not many women take. Sometimes she jokes, \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t empowered you that much,\u201d because I\u2019m on this path she barely recognizes.What are some lessons you\u2019ve learned since starting your company?As an entrepreneur, you\u2019re wearing so many different hats, particularly in the early days. So the better you are at multitasking, the more comfortable you\u2019re going to be. As I was growing up, I was involved in so many different extracurricular activities, including music and fine arts. I learned the art of dabbling in multiple pursuits, and doing them semi-seriously, including playing in concerts. That has helped me in many ways with what I do today.Tell me more about your leadership style.The one thing that has remained consistent is that I\u2019ve always respected people who lead from the front. A sense of empathy is extremely crucial to being a good leader. And it comes much more naturally if you\u2019ve walked in their path.The best way to inspire respect in people is when you can do what they\u2019ve done or when you\u2019re in the trenches with them. You can\u2019t do that every minute of every day, but that is certainly something that I have respected in strong leaders.I\u2019ve also learned a lot about setting expectations. Entrepreneurs are very ambitious and can have an acute sense of the success and goals they\u2019d like to achieve. But it\u2019s a fine line between high expectations that are inspiring and high expectations that become demotivating. I\u2019ve had my team talk to me about the right kind of balancing act.Over time you learn to create a layer of insulation between your employees and the reality you feel as the leader and the pressure to deliver for investors. It is truly lonely, and I don\u2019t mean lonely in a despondent way. Not everybody around you is conditioned to handle the kind of pressure that you can as the entrepreneur, leader, C.E.O. and founder.How do you hire?I want the person coming in to have almost gone through the experience of playing the role before they come into the role. That means they\u2019ve done their homework around understanding the company, the position, their understanding of the strategy and the competitive landscape. I want to hear their proposals for some of the strategies, approaches, directions and investments from the perspective of the role for which they\u2019re interviewing.A lot of my questions are not focused on generalities. They\u2019re focused on specifics \u2014 \u201cIf you were to play this role, how would you be addressing X, Y and Z? And have you spent time thinking through those challenges before you\u2019re coming into the job?\u201dA lot of C.E.O.s tell me they are surprised by how few candidates do that kind of homework before the interview.That\u2019s absolutely the case. You\u2019re almost pleasantly surprised when you meet a candidate who has actually done their research and is having an intelligent conversation with you. I\u2019m not expecting miracles in terms of your ability to solve for a particular situation or challenge or strategy inside the company. I just want to understand your thinking process.I almost want people to play the devil\u2019s advocate in interviews, and bring some sort of contrarian view that I can debate. I want to have a debate because then it tells me that you\u2019re going to sort of have the full spectrum of thinking around an issue. And I\u2019m listening for whether the debate can be an objective discussion or does it get very quickly into the realm of personal remarks. That\u2019s my best way of understanding how somebody handles conflict.Advertisement"}

Georgia has no state laws protecting gays and lesbians against discrimination in housing or employment, but even in Atlanta, which does have such protections, the bill would allow a hospital to prohibit a gay man from visiting his sick husband based on its religious views.The bill\u2019s backers say they are trying to protect religious freedom. But they know full well that the measure is nothing more than a legal shield for discrimination. Georgians are free to believe as they choose, and to say whatever they want to whomever they want about their views on marriage. But when they enter the public sphere, and particularly when they benefit from taxpayer dollars, they are not free to ignore any law that doesn\u2019t align with their personal religious views on marriage.If Georgia\u2019s House approves this bill, which would do immeasurable harm to the state\u2019s citizens and businesses, Gov.

As one recently hired Yahoo employee put it, \u201cAren\u2019t you here to gossip?\u201dAnyone hoping for dramatic confrontations or big plot twists was sorely disappointed, however.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, clad in a jacket of white and Yahoo purple, made introductory remarks, noting that Yahoo had more than 600 million monthly users on mobile devices. She thanked the thousands of developers who had integrated Yahoo ads into their apps and were now raking in about $200 million a year in revenue from them (with Yahoo getting an extra $100 million or so on top of that).\u201cOur commitment to the developer community is stronger than ever,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cWe want you to know that you are in the right place.\u201dAs Ms. Mayer exited to modest applause, Simon Khalaf, the company\u2019s senior vice president for publisher products and the former chief of Flurry, the analytics company that Yahoo bought two years ago, took the stage.He delivered his annual report on the state of the mobile world, with his trademark array of fun facts and statistics. The number of people in the world who check their phones more than 60 times a day is now 280 million, he said \u2014 a population of mobile addicts big enough to be the fourth-largest country in the world.Americans spend an average of 4 hours 11 minutes a day on mobile phones, more time than they spend watching television. And mobile video game play was dropping because of the rise of e-sports, where spectators watch skilled players compete against one another.Next came a panel about the new trend of concierge services delivered through messaging services. Hyatt Hotels, for example, lets guests orders fresh towels via Facebook Messenger.But throughout, there was barely a mention of Yahoo or its role in the mobile world \u2014 perhaps because the company is still struggling to articulate a strategy that will help it compete with Facebook and Google, the two giants in mobile.In short, Yahoo was almost a bit character at its own show.Sitting in the audience of about 500 people, Bob Bahramipour, senior vice president for global business development at InMobi, an India-based global advertising platform, said he had mostly come to \u201cplant seeds\u201d about a possible future partnership with Yahoo.Given all the uncertainty over the company\u2019s future \u2014 will it be sold or broken up for parts? Will Ms. Mayer and her management team be forced out by disenchanted investors? \u2014 he said that InMobi was not sure that anyone at Yahoo would be in a position to close a deal anytime soon.Xinhua Liu, chief marketing officer of Cheetah Mobile, a Chinese company that makes mobile utilities and game apps with 567 million monthly users worldwide, was more upbeat. Yahoo, he said, was a great partner, supplying content, search results and native display ads \u2014 all things he couldn\u2019t get from other partners like Facebook and Google.\u201cYahoo is well positioned to serve these offers\u201d from brands, he said, complementing Cheetah\u2019s other revenue streams, such as application install ads from Facebook. Mr. Liu said that Yahoo\u2019s corporate turmoil did not worry him since the team he worked with was stable.The same could not be said of Mr. Khalaf\u2019s team, which includes Yahoo\u2019s news, finance, sports and media content. On Wednesday, Yahoo gutted its media staff and closed half of its digital magazines.In an interview after his presentation on Thursday, Mr. Khalaf said that the company would now focus more on showcasing content created by its users, concentrating on popular topics like news, sports, politics and finance.Conversations are important to driving traffic and engagement, Mr. Khalaf said. Investors, for example, don\u2019t just want to read articles about the companies in their stock portfolio, he said, \u201cthey want to brag about how their portfolio is doing.\u201dTumblr, the social network that Yahoo acquired in 2013, will be an important source of that user content, particularly for images and video. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things you can do inexpensively,\u201d Mr. Khalaf said.As for the larger soap opera that is Yahoo, he said he reminds his team, \u201cIn the Valley, one day you\u2019re the pigeon and the second day you\u2019re the statue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "President Weighs In on Data From Genes", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Thursday waded into the complex and high-stakes debate over whether patients own their genetic information, saying that he believes that his tissues and any discoveries that stem from his DNA belong to him.\u201cI would like to think that if somebody does a test on me or my genes, that that\u2019s mine, but that\u2019s not always how we define these issues,\u201d Mr. Obama said during a White House forum on a major biomedical research initiative he began last year.Many researchers and the universities and medical centers that back them regard genetic material and the results from tests they conduct on it as their intellectual property and are reluctant to share it. But consumer groups and some health advocacy organizations believe that individuals are the rightful owners of the data and the discoveries that emanate from them.Advances in genetics and cell biology and the use of electronic medical records have paved the way for more sophisticated research into genes that may increase the risk of developing certain diseases. The debate over such research has broad implications for privacy and the success of precision medicine efforts, which depend on access to troves of genetic data.Mr. Obama\u2019s comments on Thursday seemed to place him in the camp of individual patients.\u201cRight now, what happens is the best researchers and the best universities, oftentimes they\u2019re kind of hoarding their samples,\u201d Mr. Obama said, essentially for fear of losing their grants if they do not keep control of them.The president\u2019s remarks elated some health advocates who have long argued that participants in genetic testing should be partners in the research that their cells enable.\u201cThe Precision Medicine Initiative has been trying to shift the conversation toward the idea that participants should be partners,\u201d Ms. Terry said. \u201cBut this is a really, really hard issue.\u201dThe Obama administration has been working to address it. On Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services issued new guidance to clarify that patients should have access to their medical records, including genomic testing results.Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, has said participants in the Precision Medicine Initiative should be treated as \u201cpartners in research, not subjects.\u201d The program\u2019s principles include finding \u201cinnovative, responsible and consumer-friendly ways of sharing research data with participants.\u201dMr. Obama signed legislation in December providing about $200 million for the program.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s proving that we can overcome.\u201dThe event is a uniquely American tradition. Most countries determine their Olympic running teams through a committee. Since 1968, U.S.A. Track & Field has chosen its team solely through the top three finishers of the crowded, looping, egalitarian race. Tactics, patience and perseverance can help outrun even the most exceptional degrees of natural talent. \u201cOnce every four years, the top runners in America come together for a race that requires no pedigree and gives no appearance fee,\u201d said Amby Burfoot, an editor at Runner\u2019s World. \u201cEach of our runners must earn his or her bid for the Olympics \u2014 we tell them to line up, we\u2019re going to shoot the gun, and you decide for yourself. It feels very American. One athlete, one vote.\u201d It often leads to a race that is uncommonly slow, as racing tactics tend to outweigh sheer speed. \u201cWhen the gun goes, it could be poetry in motion or it could be a horror story,\u201d said Lee Troop, a coach of several entrants from Boulder, Colo. \u201cYou can\u2019t write a script for it.\u201d Top athletes calibrate their speed to what they hope is 95 percent fitness, mindful that their real race is on the global stage in Rio in August. (In 2004, neither Meb Keflezighi nor Deena Kastor won a marathon trial, but he won the silver and she won the bronze at those Olympics in Athens.) With about 375 competitors, this is the largest Olympic marathon trials field.U.S.A.T.F. changed its standards at the last minute, so many athletes found out in mid-December that they suddenly had a ticket to the most coveted event of their lives.Lauren Fog was one. A former elementary school teacher who worked as a nanny and a Starbucks barista while training in Boulder to qualify, Fog qualified on a technicality, being two seconds over the 2-hour-45-minute threshold, which qualified after the track and field group lowered the qualifying standard in December. She found out she was the last one to qualify while she was in the security line for a flight to Hawaii (and went anyway). She spoke gleefully of being mentioned in the same sentence as Shalane Flanagan, who has the top qualifying time. \u201cThat\u2019s like watching a winner on the red carpet at the Oscars and then finding yourself in the same sentence as the actress, your hero,\u201d Fog said.The race is being broadcast for the first time nationally, and athletes like Fog will be followed accordingly by a burgeoning community of distance running enthusiasts, who are organizing viewing parties and betting pools on a scale usually reserved for events like March Madness or the Super Bowl.The difference is that the runners they are cheering are a mixed gender pool of largely middle-aged amateur athletes from across the country with families and day jobs who uniformly proclaim that it is simply an honor to be there.Troop, the coach from Boulder, spoke of his athlete Curtis Begley, who has an excruciating knee injury but has postponed surgery until after the race. He will run one mile on Saturday and then will drop out to have his surgery. Sarah MacKay Robinson, the creative director for the women\u2019s running company Oiselle, said the Olympic qualifying race was the apex of her decades-long athletic career. She is 32 and has been running since she was 12. \u201cThis is bigger than money or cash prizes; the top finisher has to earn her spot as much as I do,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI\u2019ve had three knee surgeries, have broken my back, have a toddler and husband, and work over 40 hours each week. I\u2019ve thought about quitting so many times, and then I remember this race, and now I\u2019m finally here. This is my Olympics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is a shift from the company\u2019s position as recently as December.\u201cWhat I am trying to do is reassure people,\u201d Ms. Mayer said in an interview. \u201cYou could classify it as a call for patience. I am asking shareholders to understand this is a complicated situation.\u201dIn a conference call with analysts, she added: \u201cIt is going to be very busy.\u201dVery busy, and very riveting. Whether the intense, glamorous and controversial executive will get more time to fix the company promises to be one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most prominent dramas of 2016. The next move is up to activist investors, who can try to elect a new slate to the Yahoo board.Whether it is sold or survives, Yahoo is getting smaller. It said on Tuesday it would lay off about 15 percent of its 11,000 employees. By the end of the cuts, the company said its work force would be about 42 percent smaller than it was in 2012.In addition to being smaller, Ms. Mayer said, the company would be simpler. Yahoo will shed assets, cut expenses and focus on the areas of the company that are growing. When she arrived at Yahoo after working as an executive at Google, she said, \u201cWe were sitting on $5 billion in deteriorating revenue with no clear path to growth.\u201dIn essence, she said that Yahoo was no longer deteriorating and was poised for better times \u2014 not in 2016, perhaps, but 2017.Investors seemed not quite sure how to react to the news, which came with the release of Yahoo\u2019s quarterly results. Yahoo shares, which slumped for most of Tuesday as the overall market fell, at first perked up. But in after-hours trading, the stock declined slightly.\u201cThe company is open to all options,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cThere is a distinct possibility that Yahoo as an independent company no longer exists within two years.\u201d\u201cEach quarter is worse than the last,\u201d Starboard wrote in a letter, adding that requiring \u201canother year for shareholders to wait while the existing leadership continues to destroy value is not acceptable.\u201dStarboard did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. But SpringOwl Asset Management, a firm whose investors have been publicly critical of Yahoo\u2019s management, were not satisfied with the proposed changes or happy about Ms. Mayer\u2019s attitude.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.\u201cI expected defiance, and I expected a convoluted solution,\u201d said Eric Jackson of SpringOwl. \u201cMy expectations were exceeded on both counts.\u201dHe noted that Yahoo, despite supposedly being willing to entertain offers, did not mention hiring an investment firm to facilitate the process. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether this is a real shift or not,\u201d Mr. Jackson said.Ms. Mayer said in the interview that the company already had retained advisers to help with the spinoff, and they would help evaluate any offers for the core assets. The board, she said, would be \u201creceptive\u201d to offers.Yahoo\u2019s language on Tuesday is likely to formally begin what could be months of inquiries from both strategic and financial suitors. Some have been open in expressing their interest: Late last year, Verizon\u2019s chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, said at a conference that he would look at buying Yahoo if it were put up for sale.As Ms. Mayer looks to complete her fourth year as chief executive, Yahoo stubbornly remains a marginally profitable company that is not growing. That was underlined in its fourth-quarter earnings report.Revenue came in at $1.273 billion, compared with $1.253 billion in 2014. Operating earnings were 13 cents a share, in line with forecasts. Last year, Yahoo earned 30 cents a share in the quarter.Yahoo also recorded a $4.46 billion charge in the quarter for certain businesses, including its blogging site Tumblr, which it acquired for $1 billion.Mr. Jackson of SpringOwl said that Tumblr had been Ms. Mayer\u2019s signature acquisition, and that she had increased the number of employees when she began at Yahoo. \u201cShe\u2019s saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to sharpen our focus,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she do that three and a half years ago?\u201dKenneth Goldman, Yahoo\u2019s chief financial officer, said in the conference call, \u201cI do feel comfortable that we can do it this year.\u201dYahoo was a mess when Ms. Mayer arrived from Google. The executive suite was a revolving door. The company\u2019s market share in search was dropping. Yahoo Mail was an also-ran and efforts in mobile were minimal.Statistics released this week by eMarketer, a research firm, showed just how much Yahoo was struggling.In 2015, Yahoo captured $3.37 billion in digital ad revenue worldwide, or 2 percent of the market, eMarketer estimated. That is down from a 2.4 percent share in 2014. Mobile ads were equally dismal.In search, Yahoo is barely holding its own. It will capture 2.1 percent of the $94.07 billion worldwide search market this year, the same share as in 2015, eMarketer said.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was relentless during a private meeting of tech giants and President Obama\u2019s top national security officials last month. Encrypted devices like the iPhone are here to stay, he insisted. Law enforcement needs to find a way to do its job in a new world.James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch pushed back, but Mr. Cook stood firm, several participants said.\u201cWith all due respect,\u201d Mr. Cook told those around the table, including Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism chief and the heads of the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cI think there has been a lack of leadership in the White House on this.\u201dDenis R. McDonough, the president\u2019s chief of staff, took exception and said so. Law enforcement officials described him as stung by what they called Mr. Cook\u2019s \u201crant,\u201d although tech executives in the room insisted that Apple\u2019s chief executive was respectful.Either way, what started as a cordial two-hour discussion about combating Islamic extremism ended with the White House and Mr. Cook agreeing to disagree \u2014 foreshadowing a bitter battle between a president long enamored of Apple products and Silicon Valley and a tech titan who has spoken enthusiastically of Mr. Obama.Although the president and Mr. Cook are not personal friends, associates say they have developed a relationship of professional admiration and mutual self-interest. At the least, the two share similar traits: discipline, a cerebral nature and impatience with office drama. Now they find themselves in roles no one ever imagined, as the central antagonists in the raging debate between personal privacy and the nation\u2019s security.By refusing demands from Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to help unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists, Mr. Cook has become the leading voice in Silicon Valley for encryption. By voicing strong support for his F.B.I., Mr. Obama is now the effective chief prosecutor of the administration\u2019s case for allowing law enforcement to penetrate iPhones.If Apple had more of a presence in Washington, as do Google, Facebook and Microsoft, technology executives say there is a chance the dispute might have been quietly resolved. But few top Apple veterans have moved through the revolving door that has brought engineers and executives from other technology companies to the Obama White House to serve in a variety of security, technology and scientific positions. Apple\u2019s lobbying budget in Washington is far smaller than its competitors\u2019.\u201cI have not talked to the president. I will talk to the president,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview with ABC News last week, a day before his company filed legal papers opposing the government. Mr. Cook said he planned to ask Mr. Obama \u201cfor his help in getting this on a better path.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said he had no idea when such a call might happen, and White House officials offered no indication that Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook were scheduled to talk anytime soon.It is unclear when Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook first met, but in the four years since Mr. Cook succeeded Steven P. Jobs as Apple\u2019s chief executive, he has visited the White House at least a half-dozen times.In the summer of 2013, soon after Edward J. Snowden revealed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs, Mr. Cook joined 16 other technology executives and privacy advocates for a grievance session with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room. Two participants said Mr. Cook told the president that the Snowden revelations had led people to believe that Apple was helping the government spy on Americans.The exchange was an early indication of the tensions with the White House that would eventually develop.\u201cHe was concerned about the misperception in the public about the extent to which Apple was cooperating,\u201d recalled Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor and privacy activist, who was also at the meeting.Four months later, Mr. Cook attended another meeting with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room on a similar topic. The following year, in December 2014, White House visitor logs show that Mr. Cook spent two days in the West Wing, where he met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office and shared a meal in the White House mess with John D. Podesta, who was then counselor to Mr. Obama as well as the president\u2019s environmental czar.In September 2015, Mr. Cook was again at the White House, where he had a prime seat at the state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China.Current and former White House officials say Mr. Obama appreciated the attention that Mr. Cook brought to issues like immigration, gay marriage and climate change. When Mr. Obama solicited Apple and other companies to support his ConnectED program for technology in schools, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to pledge $100 million worth of iPads and MacBooks, calling it \u201can enormous commitment.\u201dThere were also tensions. White House officials were not happy about Apple\u2019s decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and have repeatedly pressed Mr. Cook to explain the company\u2019s need to build its blockbuster products in China rather than in the United States.But the encryption debate, and the government\u2019s legal action against Apple last week, are testing the relationship with the company more than any other.\u201cA company thinks very hard before it defies the government,\u201d said Nicole Wong, who was Google\u2019s lead lawyer when Google resisted a Justice Department request for user data. But if a disagreement happens, \u201cit\u2019s not bad for this policy conversation to happen transparently in a court proceeding.\u201dAt the same time, there was a growing alliance between this White House and Silicon Valley. Although other presidents have looked to the valley\u2019s innovators and venture capitalists for money, political support and ideas, this administration has wooed tech executives in far greater numbers. The president also has close ties to those in the industry who supported him early on, including Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn.Now, while Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are expected to file papers to the court in solidarity with Apple\u2019s encryption position, Mr. Cook stands relatively alone in his fight. This was evident at the meeting in January in Silicon Valley.As participants recalled it, Mr. Cook was the one who shifted the conversation to encryption \u2014 prompting nods of agreement from executives at Dropbox, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and others.Soon after, Mr. McDonough brought the meeting to an end. \u201cPut a pin in it,\u201d participants recalled that he said, making it clear that the conversation would continue.But one month later, the Justice Department moved against Apple.The White House Memo article on Saturday about a contentious standoff that pits President Obama against Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, over government efforts to force Apple to hack into a dead terrorist\u2019s iPhone misstated the nature of the Justice Department\u2019s move against Apple. Although it took legal action against the company, it did not sue.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Fights Order to Unlock San Bernardino Gunman\u2019s iPhone", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWhen the talks collapsed, a federal magistrate judge, at the Justice Department\u2019s request, ordered Apple to bypass security functions on the phone. The order set off a furious public battle on Wednesday between the Obama administration and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies in a dispute with far-reaching legal implications.\u201cThis Apple case really goes right to the heart of the encryption issue,\u201d said Ira Rubinstein, a senior fellow at the New York University Information Law Institute, \u201cand in some ways, this was a fight that was inevitable.\u201dThis is not the first time a technology company has been ordered to effectively decrypt its own product. But industry experts say it is the most significant because of Apple\u2019s global profile, the invasive steps it says are being demanded and the brutality of the San Bernardino attacks.Law enforcement officials who support the F.B.I.\u2019s position said that the impasse with Apple provided an ideal test case to move from an abstract debate over the balance between national security and privacy to a concrete one.Mr. Tariche, who is president of the agents\u2019 association, added, \u201cAs more of these devices come to market, this touches all aspects of the cases that we\u2019re working on.\u201dMr. Cook, the chief executive at Apple, responded Wednesday morning with a blistering, 1,100-word letter to Apple customers, warning of the \u201cchilling\u201d breach of privacy posed by the government\u2019s demands. He maintained that the order would effectively require it to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d to get around its own safeguards, and Apple vowed to appeal the ruling by next week.Officials have discovered a potential link between the attackers and Islamic extremism.Apple argues that the software the F.B.I. wants it to create does not exist. But technologists say the company can do it.Mr. Cook\u2019s angry tone reflected the tense discussions, conducted mostly on the telephone, between his company and the government\u2019s lawyers over the San Bernardino case. Apple executives had hoped to resolve the impasse without having to rewrite their own encryption software. They were frustrated that the Justice Department had aired its demand in public, according to an industry executive with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions.The Justice Department and the F.B.I. have the White House\u2019s \u201cfull support,\u201d the spokesman, Josh Earnest, said on Wednesday.His vote of confidence was significant because James Comey, the F.B.I. director, has at times been at odds with the White House over his aggressive advocacy of tougher decryption requirements on technology companies. While Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team was sympathetic to Mr. Comey\u2019s position, others at the White House viewed legislation as potentially perilous. Late last year, Mr. Obama refused to back any legislation requiring decryption, leaving a court fight likely.The Justice Department showed no sign of backing down Wednesday.\u201cIt is unfortunate,\u201d the department said in a statement, \u201cthat Apple continues to refuse to assist the department in obtaining access to the phone of one of the terrorists involved in a major terror attack on U.S. soil.\u201dThe dispute could initiate legislation in Congress, with Republicans and Democrats alike criticizing Apple\u2019s stance on Wednesday and calling for tougher decryption requirements. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential contender, also attacked Apple on Fox News, asking, \u201cWho do they think they are?\u201dBut Apple had many defenders of its own among privacy and consumer advocates, who praised Mr. Cook for standing up to what they saw as government overreach.Many of the company\u2019s defenders argued that the types of government surveillance operations exposed in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, have prompted technology companies to build tougher encryption safeguards in their products because of the privacy demands of their customers.\u201cApple deserves praise for standing up for its right to offer secure devices to all of its customers,\u201d said Alex Abdo, staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberty Union\u2019s privacy and technology section.Privacy advocates and others said they worried that if the F.B.I. succeeded in getting access to the software overriding Apple\u2019s encryption, it would create easy access for the government in many future investigations.\u201cThis is not the last step in the journey,\u201d said Robert Cattanach, a former Justice Department lawyer who works on privacy and tech security issues at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney. \u201cThe next thing you know, they\u2019ll be in the back door of these systems.\u201dThe Apple order is a flash point in a dispute that has been building for more than a decade.The F.B.I. began sounding alarms years ago about technology that allowed people to exchange private messages protected by encryption so strong that government agents could not break it. In fall 2010, at the behest of Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, the Obama administration began work on a law that required technology companies to provide unencrypted data to the government.Lawyers at the F.B.I., Justice Department and Commerce Department drafted bills around the idea that technology companies in the Internet age should be bound by the same rules as phone companies, which were forced during the Clinton administration to build digital networks that government agents could tap.The draft legislation would have covered app developers like WhatsApp and large companies like Google and Apple, according to current and former officials involved in the process.There is no debate that, when armed with a court order, the government can get text messages and other data stored in plain text. Far less certain was whether the government could use a court order to force a company to write software or redesign its system to decode encrypted data. A federal law would make that authority clear, they said.But the disclosures of government surveillance by Mr. Snowden changed the privacy debate, and the Obama administration decided not to move on the proposed legislation. It has not been revived.The legal issues raised by the judge\u2019s order are complicated. They involve statutory interpretation, rather than constitutional rights, and they could end up before the Supreme Court.The law lets judges \u201cissue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201dThe government says the law gives broad latitude to judges to require \u201cthird parties\u201d to execute court orders. It has cited a 1977 ruling requiring phone companies to help set up a pen register, a device that records all numbers called from a particular phone line.Apple argues that the scope of the act has strict limits. In 2005, a federal magistrate judge rejected the argument that the law could be used to compel a telecommunications provider to allow real-time tracking of a cellphone without a search warrant.Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Katie Benner from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "A New Dimension in Home Buying: Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byThe goggles were strapped to my face like a scuba mask. Only instead of fish, a studio apartment was wavering in my field of vision. I moved forward, trying to enter the bathroom. Feeling slightly seasick, I hit the wall. This was embarrassing. I tried again and smacked into the door frame.\u201cAre you teleporting?\u201d asked Jason Darcy, a data scientist and software engineer who works for Halstead Property. I\u2019d come to Halstead\u2019s Manhattan headquarters to test the virtual reality technology that the company is developing. I\u2019d already perused a 400-square-foot West Village resale using a Samsung Gear headset. \u201cWe sell based on emotion and attaching that emotion to a vision,\u201d said Matthew J. Leone, the senior vice president of digital marketing for Terra Holdings, the parent company of Halstead. \u201cImagine a buyer walking out onto the terrace and thinking: \u2018If I bought this home and was having breakfast here, this is exactly what I\u2019d see.\u2019 That\u2019s incredible. For a salesman, it\u2019s a dream come true.\u201dSo was I teleporting? I kept bumping into virtual walls because the headset was making me extremely nauseated. The Starship Enterprise this was not. Halstead says it will introduce three-dimensional displays and virtual-reality headsets to its offices this year, and the brokerage isn\u2019t alone. Greenland Forest City Partners and Douglas Elliman Real Estate are also hoping to add virtual-reality technology in the coming months, as are individual brokers looking for a competitive edge. Digital design firms charge tens of thousands of dollars to create virtual customizable spaces for high-end buyers. This technology is expected to transform the real estate industry and, some say, make house-hunting more efficient. It can help to reduce the stress of relocating to a new city or buying from abroad and also allow buyers to visualize properties in development. In some cases, the excitement of providing virtual-reality technology to clients has created an outsize sense of the technology\u2019s importance. One company was keeping its VR prototype secret, lest a competitor try to steal it. But whether the technology is ready for widespread use \u2014 and whether consumers really want it \u2014 remains an open question. \u201cImagine that you\u2019re sending a check for $30 million and you have nothing to see,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cOur work is the closest you can get without having to build it. You feel the size. You get the textures.\u201d His drones don\u2019t just take photos but also capture video. So if there\u2019s a lot of street noise, \u201cI can\u2019t lie to you,\u201d he said. Jeffrey Hummel, the chief technology officer of Douglas Elliman, said that while virtual reality has a certain \u201cwow\u201d factor, as with any new technology, there are lessons to be learned. In his previous career as a financial services executive, Mr. Hummel gave his programming team pairs of Google Glass to test. \u201cWe had an outbreak of pink eye among all those people,\u201d he said. Mr. Leone of Halstead says virtual reality could eventually eliminate the need for open houses. \u201cIf you can see the homes remotely and be more educated before you actually make a trip, you\u2019ll make the process easier,\u201d he said. At Douglas Elliman, Mr. Hummel said it would be better to put large-screen curved TVs in select offices until the headset technology \u201ccomes of age.\u201d He says the goggles might be better suited to international buyers so they can evaluate a property \u201cbefore taking an expensive plane ride.\u201d As for my test at Halstead headquarters, even after I took off the Oculus headset I was feeling a tad queasy. Meanwhile, Mr. Leone and his team discussed possible enhancements to the virtual experience. Later this year, haptic technology, or the science of touch, will let users see their own hands in the virtual world, allowing them to open closet doors and feel hot water from the faucet. Mr. Darcy said smells and tastes were also being developed.Mr. Leone added, \u201cFreshly cut lemons and baking cookies would create the same experience as you\u2019d have in a real-life home.\u201d Advertisement"}

Corbett is the associate masthead editor for standards and oversees The Times\u2019s style manual.One question last week, though, raised a philosophical issue. Is a cow a \u201cwho\u201d or a \u201cwhich\u201d?My answer (as a stylebook editor, not a philosopher): It depends.Cow Who Escaped New York Slaughterhouse Finds Sanctuary\u201cDoes The Times have a policy on the use of \u2018that\u2019 or \u2018who\u2019 for animals?\u201d Professor Singer wondered.We do, though it doesn\u2019t go as far as he would recommend. We generally use \u201cperson\u201d pronouns like \u201che,\u201d \u201cshe\u201d or \u201cwho\u201d only for animals who have been given a name, or in cases where the sex of the animal is specified. Otherwise, we stick with \u201cit\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d or \u201cwhich.\u201d Here is our stylebook entry on this point, which is in line with The Associated Press\u2019s guidelines as well:Professor Singer\u2019s use of \u201cwho\u201d for animals fits into his overall perspective on animal-rights issues. In our style guidelines, though, our goal is not to advance any particular agenda or point of view but to reflect widely accepted, familiar usage among our readers. And it seems most common for English speakers to reserve \u201che,\u201d \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cwho\u201d for animals with whom we feel a personal connection. Otherwise, \u201cit,\u201d \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cwhich\u201d seem to be the norm.In the case of the cow in Queens, in fact, it seems our editors were caught between the two impulses. \u201cFreddy,\u201d as the animal was dubbed, was elevated to \u201cwho\u201d in the headline, but remained a mere \u201cthat\u201d in the lead sentence of the story.In an exchange of emails, Professor Singer said he thought usage on this point might be gradually shifting. Google searches, he said, revealed a large number of uses of \u201cwho\u201d with nondomesticated animals, including deer and ants.The little item about the bovine runaway in Queens raised another usage question, noted by Professor Singer and some other readers: Was that animal really a cow?Oddly, despite the ubiquity of domesticated cattle, there isn\u2019t a common nongendered singular term in English for the animal. The primary sense of \u201ccow,\u201d of course, is an adult female. Freddy the runaway, like many beef cattle, was apparently a castrated male (young male and female animals are also used for meat).Advertisement"}

In an email to partners, Google said it would focus on AdWords, the company\u2019s mainstay advertising product, where \u201cinsurance\u201d is among the most lucrative search terms.When Google jumped into the insurance-selling game, it joined a long list of technology companies that have been trying to shake up the market by selling things like auto and homeowner insurance online. The idea behind their sites is to help consumers save money by showing them multiple quotes in one place.Some of these sites are just online insurance agencies. Others, like Google, work on a commission model where they send referral traffic to insurers and get a finder\u2019s fee whenever someone buys a policy.The competition has so far done little to threaten the tens of thousands of insurance agents who continue to be the backbone of the business, but Google and others are likely to keep trying.In 2013, United States insurers wrote $481 billion in premiums for property and casualty insurance, which consists of mostly auto, home and commercial insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. That would put a rough estimate of agents\u2019 commissions \u2014 including commissions to small-time agents as well as to brokers who sell large commercial policies \u2014 at around $50 billion.Insurance industry partners said Google left open the possibility of creating a new insurance product in the future.

{"Headline": "How to Reduce Crime: Stop Charging Children as Adults", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFOR the second year in a row, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has proposed raising the age of the state\u2019s Family Court jurisdiction to 18 from 16. If that legislation fails again this year, it will leave New York and North Carolina as the only states where people age 16 and older can be tried as an adult and, if incarcerated, locked up in adult prisons and jails. (In New York, children as young as 13 must be tried in adult court for certain charges, like murder.)Not only are these states trailing most of the country in this area, but they are also in danger of falling even further behind. Connecticut and Illinois \u2014 both of which recently raised the age of juvenile court jurisdiction to 18 (in 2012 and 2014, respectively) \u2014 are now considering raising the age to 21. In the 116-year history of the juvenile court, no United States system has ever gone above age 18, so two states considering it simultaneously is remarkable.Why are they doing this?Lawmakers are confronting questions over the effects and safety of the two systems. Would crime increase if more people were treated in juvenile court, where sentences are lighter? And, more parochially, would the courts and the juvenile facilities be overwhelmed? The answers from Illinois and Connecticut proved surprising.Early in the 20th century, most states established juvenile courts, virtually every one restricting the new court\u2019s age to youths under 16. A separate juvenile-justice system, which sought to rehabilitate and not just punish youthful offenders, was part of a movement by progressives to create a legally defined adolescence through the passage of child-labor and compulsory education laws and the creation of parks and open spaces. During the decades that followed, an overwhelming majority of states increased the court\u2019s jurisdictional age, arguing that 16 was too young a demarcation point.There has been a renewed effort recently to raise the age of family-court jurisdiction even further. In addition to the horrors of putting teenagers in adult prisons (where they are more prone to suicide, more likely to be sexually assaulted and less likely to succeed once they leave), a wave of new research has shown that young people are developmentally different from adults in impulsivity, future orientation, susceptibility to peer pressure and risk-taking, especially if they had suffered a traumatic brain injury, which kids in the juvenile justice system disproportionately do.Initially, these campaigns were considered liberal, but now they\u2019re increasingly bipartisan. When Connecticut raised its family court\u2019s age limit, research found that 16-year-olds tried in family court were being rearrested at a rate almost 39 percent lower than youths their same age who had been previously tried as adults.Connecticut now has its lowest number of juveniles in pretrial detention, its lowest population in juvenile correctional institutions, and the lowest number of young adult prisoners ages 18 to 21 in its adult prisons in a quarter-century \u2014 down 51 percent over the last six years.Illinois has enjoyed similar successes. The Illinois Juvenile Justice Commission concluded that its reforms enhanced public safety because adult convictions put youths at greater risk of re-offense by inhibiting education and employability. The commission also found that the juvenile justice system had gotten smaller now than it was before it included 17-year-olds. The population of Illinois\u2019 juvenile institutions has declined by 43 percent since the reforms began.Both systems built on the traditional strengths of the juvenile system, such as individualized sentences, programs to keep youths from being detained or incarcerated, and greater access to rehabilitation and counseling.There is another compelling reason both to raise the age of juvenile court jurisdiction and to rethink how readily we try juveniles as adults: the protection of the innocent. In early January, five boys, ages 14 through 18, were arrested in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and quickly charged with the rape of a girl on a playground, an incident that understandably caused outrage throughout the city. After more investigation, however, the prosecutor concluded that no sexual assault had taken place, and on Wednesday he dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning that charges cannot be reinstated.But because the boys were charged as adults, their names were made public. This incident will be the first item that appears when future employers, classmates and schools do a Google search. A family court hearing, where names of the accused are rarely released, would have at least prevented their reputations from being smeared forever.In the face of growing evidence about the benefits of juvenile courts, research into the neurological and psychological development of teenagers and the move by other jurisdictions to raise the juvenile court age, New York and North Carolina persist in trying and convicting 16-year-olds as adults. The current laws are archaic and unnecessarily punitive, and both states should raise the age of family court before they fall even further behind what science and common sense are telling us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Luck Means Now", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byModern LoveThe room where I\u2019ll spend the day, if I am lucky, is fluorescent-lit, lined with hard plastic chairs, and has a reminder on the wall concerning the importance of hand sanitizer. Though friends offered to accompany me, I am here alone.On the opposite side, a family has gathered: a man in his early 60s, like me, and four young people around the ages of my children. They are engaged in cheerful-sounding small talk about their jobs, the Red Sox. As for me, I don\u2019t feel like talking to anyone.I arrived a little after 6 a.m., after kissing my husband goodbye before they wheeled him into surgery. The surgery is expected to take 12 hours, though somewhere around Hour 3 the surgeon will have gotten to the place in Jim\u2019s abdomen where he can see the tumor, known to us only as an innocuous-looking gray area on Jim\u2019s CT scans. Sometimes this turns out to be the moment when the surgeon discovers the tumor is not operable after all, in which case they stitch everything up and say, \u201cWe tried.\u201dThe tumor in question (I haven\u2019t allowed myself to call it \u201cJim\u2019s tumor\u201d; I don\u2019t want to see him take ownership) is 2.5 centimeters in diameter and located in the head of Jim\u2019s pancreas. For my husband to survive \u2014 to have a shot at survival \u2014 this tumor must come out.The operation calls for the removal of part of Jim\u2019s pancreas, his gall bladder, his duodenum and parts of his small intestine and stomach. \u201cPicture gutting a fish,\u201d Jim, a fly fisherman, said to a friend. \u201cThat\u2019s roughly the idea.\u201dIt\u2019s odd to say of an operation like this that a person is lucky to be receiving it, but Jim and I do feel lucky. Seven months earlier, when we went to the doctor, anticipating gallstones, we learned the tumor was probably inoperable.\u201cThere\u2019s a surgery that gives you a shot,\u201d Jim\u2019s doctor told us. (A shot. Just that. But suddenly a shot was everything.) \u201cIt\u2019s called the Whipple Procedure.\u201dFrom that moment, our focus had become shrinking the tumor to where Jim could get the Whipple. And after eight rounds of chemotherapy and two of radiation, the day has come.The Whipple is brutal surgery in the best of circumstances, \u201cthe best\u201d being a strange phrase to employ when discussing a form of cancer with a two-year survival rate of around 5 percent.\u201cDon\u2019t Google it,\u201d they told us that first day, but we did.The day we learned the news, just 15 months had passed since our wedding on a New Hampshire hillside with friends and children gathered, fireworks exploding and a band backing us up as we performed a duet on a John Prine song and talked about the trips we would take, the olive trees we would plant. Each of us had been divorced almost 25 years. How lucky, everyone said, that we had found each other when we did.Now, luck means having this operation. In four hours, luck will mean getting a call from a nurse who says: \u201cThey\u2019ve reached the tumor. They\u2019re going in for it.\u201dI have a book, but I keep reading the same sentence. On the other side of the room, the father and the four young people are unwrapping sandwiches and laughing. The 20-somethings are telling funny stories about their mother. If not for the institutional d\u00e9cor, you might think they were enjoying a family reunion.My children and Jim\u2019s are nowhere near. I\u2019m 3,000 miles from home. In those terrible weeks after the diagnosis, I lived with a phone on either ear, calling hospitals and researching treatments that might offer what the first doctor had not: the possibility of a future. When a program looked promising, we got on a plane. It was in this city, at this hospital, where we found the surgeon who said, \u201cI believe I can get your husband\u2019s tumor out.\u201dNot even 18 hours earlier we marked this moment with a day game at Fenway Park, and afterward we celebrated the Red Sox win with oysters and a martini each. Jim bought a cap. Bald for many months, his hair was back. He was thin, but handsome.It was about two years before that Jim had asked me to marry him on the deck of his Oakland, Calif., home with a couple of martinis and a plate of oysters. Never a skillful liar, he had pointed me toward a particular oyster and suggested I try it. Tucked into the shell: a diamond ring.I had been single for 24 years. Just putting that ring on my finger felt odd, almost embarrassing, as later it would be difficult to say \u201cmy husband\u201d or refer to myself as Jim\u2019s wife. To me, marriage had meant trouble. Failure. Pain. Why risk that again?Only I did. We bought a house. Made big plans. Then came the diagnosis.I think it was then (not the day of our wedding) when the words \u201cwife\u201d and \u201chusband\u201d entered my vocabulary \u2014 the first time I could speak them without awkwardness. They slipped into my speech over the weeks and months I spent navigating the world of cancer treatment, searching for the bobbing scrap of hope in an ocean of trouble: drug trials, immunotherapy, extreme diets.I express-mailed our scans to facilities as far away as Germany, and when we were told the next appointment was three months out, I said, \u201cMy husband needs to see the doctor now.\u201dMy husband.At some point I realized I no longer spoke of \u201cJim\u2019s treatment\u201d or \u201cJim\u2019s scan.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on Folfirinox now,\u201d I would say. \u201cWe\u2019re getting CyberKnife radiation.\u201d And then: \u201cWe shrank the tumor by 50 percent. We\u2019re getting surgery.\u201dFor years after my divorce, I had called myself a solo operator, but I had longed for a big romance, and with Jim I found it.The summer after we met, we saw a 1982 Chrysler LeBaron convertible on Craigslist in Maine and bought it, then flew from California to pick it up. For the first time in 38 years of practicing law, Jim took the summer off. We put 4,000 miles on that convertible, mostly on New England back roads. We ate lobster rolls and danced and talked about riding Jim\u2019s motorcycle across the country.Ali MacGraw and Ryan O\u2019Neal might have made it look otherwise, but cancer is not romantic. Always a lean man, Jim dropped 30 pounds. I had admired the way he dressed, conservative but sharp. Now he wore his suit like David Byrne in the Talking Heads video of our youth. When it looked as if a recurrent C. difficile infection might kill him (he was down to 108 pounds and dropping), I persuaded him to have a fecal transplant. Donor: me.He had been, since 13, a bass player, a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll guy. (Also an Eagle Scout. I loved that about him.) Now, as the chemo ate away at him and his Triumph gathered dust, it seemed important that he keep playing, so one day I made paella for the whole band and their wives.But the morning of the party, the neuropathy kicked in from the chemo, leaving Jim\u2019s fingers numb, unable to play. That night I stood at the edge of our silent yard and dumped five pounds of seafood. No rock \u2019n\u2019 roll that day, or that season or the one that followed.In the waiting room, the family across from me has brought in food for dinner. They are just opening their Styrofoam containers when a woman approaches, bends to speak with the father, a hand on his shoulder. The daughter leans in, and the son, and the two others I realize must be their partners.Suddenly, the room is spinning. The food drops to the floor. The father just sits there, hands to his face, shaking his head, but the children are weeping, then wailing. Someone stands, staggers, drops to the floor. They all rush out, food wrappers and bags abandoned.It can happen that swiftly, the end of life as we know it. Then, too, time can creep so slowly, even a minute seems endless.It\u2019s close to midnight when the surgeon calls. \u201cThis was the toughest Whipple I ever performed,\u201d he says. They got the tumor and took 38 lymph nodes. It will be another few days before the pathology report, but things look good.In the recovery room I find the bed with Jim in it, though he is much changed from the person I met not even four years earlier, on a Match.com date at a restaurant in Marin County, Calif., where I kept waiting for him to suggest that we order something, but he never did. Later, he explained, \u201cI was just so knocked out by you, I forgot.\u201dThere are tubes coming out of him. His eyes are closed, mouth open. He looks 100 years old, but he is alive.\u201cI\u2019m his wife,\u201d I tell the nurse, and take my place by the bed.Joyce Maynard, who lives in Lafayette, Calif., is the author of many novels, most recently \u201cUnder the Influence,\u201d to be published this week.modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}

The long-absent Michael Gregson, perhaps, or the unquiet spirit of Kemal Pamuk or, heaven help us, Reanimated Isis.I mean, who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? There he lay on his ruined rug, gasping to his beloved (seriously splattered) Cora, \u201cIf this is it, just know I have loved you very, very much.\u201dSo even when Robert received the preliminary diagnosis of a burst ulcer \u2014 and not, say, extraterrestrial fertilization \u2014 I wasn\u2019t entirely sure he\u2019d live to see another morrow. In fact, as he was carted away in the ambulance, I began to wonder if the whole business wasn\u2019t some bizarre dramatization of the health care debate that\u2019s been, well, let\u2019s just say raging over the past season. Would the Earl of G die for want of some far-off York technology? Or would he be saved by the bureaucratically unencumbered prowess of a local doctor?All we can say for sure is that he\u2019s temporarily out of the woods. Although his close call has left a shadow of mortality across the Abbey. \u201cLife is short,\u201d Carson broods. \u201cDeath is sure. That is all we know.\u201dAnd an estate to run! Mary, I thought, had something of an Al Haig glint in her eye as she informed Tom that they would be taking \u201cfull responsibility\u201d of Downton from now on and would involve his lordship only in the \u201cbig decisions.\u201d\u201cLong live our own Queen Mary,\u201d crooned Tom, who seems to be carving out a new role as Mary\u2019s maiden aunt, nudging her toward romance and twinkling out maxims like \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as safe love. Real love means giving someone the power to hurt you.\u201d\u201cWhich I won\u2019t concede easily,\u201d says Mary, any more than she\u2019ll throw herself headlong at that decidedly unsafe auto racer, Henry Talbot. Mary doesn\u2019t want to \u201cmarry down,\u201d you see, or be grander or richer than her husband. Her sister Edith has the opposite problem. She\u2019s got an adorable new boyfriend who, to quote the old tune, can\u2019t give her anything but love, and she\u2019s not sure she\u2019s even worthy of that. It looks like she\u2019ll have to come clean about her \u201csordid past,\u201d and if she\u2019s looking for any pointers on that score, she might check in with her sis, who had to run the same gantlet years back with Matthew (and who is meanwhile, with agonizing slowness, piecing together the Marigold puzzle).Or maybe Edith won\u2019t have to say a blessed word. It\u2019s been that kind of start-and-stop season, and even the conspicuous bleeding at the Crawleys\u2019 dinner party can\u2019t conceal every instance of plot anemia. Consider poor Baxter, ginning up all her courage to testify against the hated Peter Coyle. (Name a character, he must appear.) And here\u2019s Sergeant Willis comparing Coyle to \u201ca nasty fish\u201d who\u2019s \u201cbound to thrash about a bit\u201d and catch Baxter in his spray, and off they go to York for the trial, and Baxter is in a \u201cvery frail frame of mind,\u201d and everything\u2019s building up to this cataclysmic confrontation of good and evil in the dock \u2026And nada.No Coyle sighting, no confrontation. The guilty man cops a plea; the trial fizzles out; everybody goes home; and even Baxter has to acknowledge that the entire experience has been \u201ca bit anticlimactic.\u201d Which we can add to a list of meta-lines that includes \u201cI have a clarity of vision that allows me to resist a housemaid\u2019s trap of sentimentality\u201d and \u201cA day of racing cars and pigs: who could better that?\u201d and \u201cDo other butlers have to contend with the police arriving every 10 minutes?\u201d (On \u201cMasterpiece Mystery,\u201d maybe.)The question, really, is not why Baxter bothered but why we did. Then again, who are we kidding? When we look back on Sunday night\u2019s episode, all we\u2019ll recall is that Banquet of Blood. Somewhere, just off screen, I see Baron Fellowes\u2019s gargoyle grin.\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d ends its six-season run on Sunday.

{"Headline": "Apple and Dr. Dre Are Said to Be Planning an Original TV Show", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is working on an original television show with Dr. Dre, the co-founder of Beats Music and an Apple executive, according to a person with knowledge of the project.The show, currently titled \u201cVital Signs,\u201d will be an Apple Music project offered through Apple TV, the company\u2019s streaming video device, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the plans because they are private.Apple has been trying to make inroads into the living room, where viewers still watch tremendous amounts of content and advertisers still jockey for screen time. But the company trails competitors. The streaming device category is dominated by smart TVs, the Roku box and Google\u2019s Chromecast, data from the research firm eMarketer shows.\u201cThere has been such a proliferation of video streaming services and hardware in the past year that the only way Apple can get a leg up in the market is to differentiate with original content,\u201d said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer.But Apple has struggled with content, while companies like Netflix and Amazon already have award-winning original shows.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services, has been trying to put together a bundle of television shows for Apple TV that would be smaller than what cable companies offer, said a person with knowledge of the plan who declined to be identified because the discussions are private. But television and cable companies have balked at a deal. Apple has also held talks with film and television executives about financing original programs to be offered exclusively through Apple TV.Creating a show with Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, would help Apple overcome some of its content difficulties. Dr. Dre joined Apple after it acquired his Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014. In addition to working with Apple Music, he produced the 2015 film \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which is based on his musical career. The television show is Dr. Dre\u2019s project and Apple is backing it, one person said.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the project, but noted that the last quarter of 2015 was the best for Apple TV sales.Apple Music recently signed its own content agreements, including a deal to stream a concert film from Taylor Swift\u2019s world tour.\u201cLike so many Apple products, Apple TV wants to be a self-sufficient ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Verna said. \u201cIf a company has to look within to find entertainment industry talent, thanks to Apple Music and the company\u2019s tremendous entertainment industry contacts, Apple is as well positioned as any company to do so.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Ben Sisario from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Watch the Super Bowl When You Don\u2019t Have Cable", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byTech FixThis year\u2019s Super Bowl, the 50th, will be the second that CBS has streamed free, though it will be the first time its streaming apps play the commercials while they are shown on television, Mr. Gerttula added.That the Super Bowl is so easily streamable should only accelerate the consumer revolt against big cable. The research firm eMarketer estimated that last year about five million American households that once paid for TV no longer did, up about 10.9 percent from the previous year. The firm estimated that by 2018, one in five American households will not subscribe to cable or satellite TV.Fret not, brave cord-cutter. I tested several other options, including digital antennas and the Slingbox, a device that can connect to a friend or family member\u2019s cable box to watch the game on a streaming device. The antennas were simple to set up, and the picture quality was excellent. The Slingbox was a bit rougher to set up and will not be an ideal method for watching the Super Bowl, but is a useful device to keep in your back pocket if you are often abroad and don\u2019t want to miss out on live national sports.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.After some experimentation, I found that sticking the antenna to a wall around the corner from my television pulled the clearest signal from CBS. I got about 40 channels, including ABC, various home shopping channels and a station that plays only Korean pop music videos.Consumers will have to do their homework before buying an antenna by looking up their proximity to nearby transmitters. Antennas Direct says that with an outdoor antenna like the 2V, you\u2019ll probably get poor reception if you\u2019re more than 70 miles from transmitters. For indoors antennas like the Eclipse, 35 miles is outside the comfort zone.If you are reasonably close to TV transmitters, the benefits of an antenna make the technology a sound investment. It\u2019s cheap, for one, and when you get a clear signal, the high-definition channels can look even better than digital cable because the image you get with an antenna is raw video broadcast over the air, unlike the compressed video sent over digital cable.\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting the raw video, it might be double or triple the quality of satellite or cable,\u201d said Richard Schneider, the founder of Antennas Direct, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more detailed picture than what you\u2019d get through paid TV.\u201dAntennas and free online streaming of the Super Bowl aren\u2019t viable options for international fans, but the Slingbox is one workaround. If you have friends or family members with a cable subscription, you can hook a Slingbox up to the back of their cable box.The Slingbox pulls in whatever is playing on the cable box, and you can watch the video live on a web browser or on a device that supports the Slingplayer app, like Apple and Android mobile devices, Roku boxes, Chromecast or Amazon\u2019s Fire TV. The Slingplayer apps also have a remote control, allowing you to change the channel on the cable box.I plugged a Slingbox M2 ($200) into a cable box and had a rough time getting the remote control to work inside the Slingplayer app. Still, as long as the cable box is set to CBS, the Slingbox is an easy method for tuning in to the game from abroad.\u201cSlingbox works anywhere in the world,\u201d said Mark Vena, a Sling Media executive. \u201cYou have a right to use it wherever you are\u201d as long as you or your family members are already paying for cable, he added.Email: brian.chen@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @bxchen Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": " PAID FOR AND POSTED BY This data tsunami promises to remake enterprises as it powers everything from predictive analytics to real-time management of supply chains, customer relations and finances. Servers, networks and software are keeping pace with the growing wave.Yet, one crucial technology component is holding back many companies from reaping the full benefits of data: Storage. These companies still save and read data from hard disks whose basic functionality hasn\u2019t changed much in 60 years. Every new bit of data that\u2019s saved and read magnifies the burden of traditional storage \u2014 its moving parts, latency and costs in time, money and space. Companies have a choice: Stick with older legacy technologies and amplify complexity or look for a simpler solution. Some of the greatest leaps forward happen when inventors, developers and engineers embrace simplicity. This often means rethinking everything, scraping away old assumptions and looking for new efficiencies and opportunities. Simplicity is powerful. It provides a framework for reconsidering the complex, like traditional hard drives, and whittling it down to its essence to develop a new approach, such as flash storage. Look no further than the smartphone, which consolidated many complex functions in a single, easy-to-use, flash-based device.The power of simplicity is in how its effects are amplified \u2014 the opposite of how complicated systems often slow everything down. The results can change the world. The pulley, the lever, the wheel. Human progress is founded on simple mechanical machines. They propelled our advances right up into the digital age. But these mechanical components use excessive amounts of energy and take up a lot of space. They break easily, too.By replacing mechanical components with solid-state elements that have no moving parts, engineers have made the things that used to depend on them more reliable and efficient. Rotary phones became smartphones; reel-to-reel film cameras were replaced by digital video cameras; and record players evolved into digital music players. Data storage is no different. For nearly 60 years, most digitized information was stored on spinning disks coated in a thin layer of ferromagnetic material. As the hard disk spins, a mechanical arm writes data by flipping the magnetic dust in one direction or another and reads it by sensing the position of those particles. It\u2019s prone to errors. It\u2019s slow. And it&##x2019;s fragile. The invention of flash memory, which encodes and reads data from transistors etched in silicon rather than a thin film of magnetic dust, is changing the game. It consumes less energy and is less prone to errors. And because data is stored in transistors etched in silicon, density, price and performance march in lockstep with microprocessors, memory chips and other integrated circuits. Moore\u2019s Law never before applied to hard drives. It does with flash. The feat of removing the complexity of moving parts makes flash-based storage more reliable. At the Red Hawk Casino near Sacramento, Calif., arrays of spinning disks were the source of constant headaches \u2014 and usually the first place engineers looked when problems were reported. That\u2019s no longer the case since the casino converted to the Pure Storage FlashArray with 99.999 percent reliability. \u201cPure has pretty much removed storage as a concern for us,\u201d says Matthew Morgan, vice president of information technology at Red Hawk. \u201cWe can spend time on other, more pressing issues.\u201d Not long ago, the telephone system was clunky and not very efficient. Few could initially afford to subscribe to the local telephone networks, managed manually by operators who connected calls via a centralized switchboard. Phone companies innovated out of this complexity, first inventing mechanical switches, and later solid-state switches to automate the manual work. The result? Networks that could support rising call volumes, triggering a wave of innovation that led to today\u2019s data networks.But nowadays, hard drives in data centers can\u2019t spin fast enough to keep up with the rising tide of data that has to be collected and stored before it can be analyzed and, most importantly, acted upon. Networks and servers aren\u2019t the bottleneck. Disks can\u2019t spin fast enough.Storage performance is measured in three areas: How long it takes for a single data transfer to start (latency); how often the device can perform the data transfer (input/output per second, or IOPS); and how quickly the data can be transferred into or out of storage (throughput). Many companies respond to the growing demands for storage by adding more spinning disks, much as the first phone companies initially hired more operators. In both cases, it\u2019s an expensive solution that\u2019s not only inefficient but also multiplies the complexity.Solid-state flash storage, like the switches in the central office, radiate simplicity. Latency is reduced to less than a millisecond, compared with tens of milliseconds for traditional drives. IOPS is improved up to three times, even when reading and writing block sizes as high as 512K. Those milliseconds and tiny bytes of data add up quickly when multiplied by the terabyte or petabytes of data created, written and read at organizations every day. The impact for organizations is real. At the research firm Nielsen Company, the switch to Pure Storage FlashArrays has resulted in a threefold reduction in latency over spinning hard drives. Now, reports that used to take six hours to generate are finished in an hour or less.\u201cData and data storage is the lifeblood of our business,\u201d says Alex Patent, Nielsen\u2019s vice president of global infrastructure architecture. Landing a spacecraft on another planet is, well, rocket science, yet even that can be simplified. For decades, NASA relied on an expensive, complicated process of using jet propulsion to gently land craft on the moon or Mars. After several expensive failures, it reimagined the process. Rather than jets, engineers encased a probe in a giant airbag that bounced on the surface until it came to a rest and deflated. It\u2019s a basic solution, but the cost savings were real. Now NASA can send more probes to other planets.Simplification weeds out inefficient designs and technologies, delivering savings in money, space, energy and time. That unlocks resources to do other things, whether exploring outer space or growing a business.Consider the early, inefficient datacenter. Some servers handled so much traffic that they couldn\u2019t keep up, while others sat idle. Engineers realized they could create a software layer to allocate computing resources while creating virtual servers that consumed those resources, which could be shared. But even as software and networking were being redefined by software, storage remained a laggard.  As companies unleashed virtualization, they realized that latency, IOPS and throughput of spinning disks created a bottleneck, limiting everything from database transactions to the performance of virtual PCs. Additional hard drives or even hybrid arrays that combined flash and spinning disks weren\u2019t enough to alleviate performance complaints. John McConnell, IT manager for the School of Engineering at the University of Texas at Dallas, saw an opportunity to save money and time with virtualization. Yet, \u201cbetween the network and the storage, we were getting a lot of latency,\u201d he says. That changed when flash replaced spinning disks. Flash saves the college money, space and electricity. It also marked the end of disruptive upgrades. \u201cWe literally have zero performance issues,\u201d McConnell says.Lamar Advertising uses Pure arrays to power internal operations and massive digital billboards on roads and highways across North America. Peter Dunn, Lamar\u2019s director of communications and services, says the technology was first intended to support a few applications, but that changed as savings multiplied across the enterprise.\u201cWhat we found was the more data we put on it, the better it performed. It was kind of a snowball rolling down a hill,\u201d he says. \u201cThe faster it went, the bigger it got. The bigger it got, the faster it went.\u201dThe savings are personal, too: Unlike spinning disks, flash storage is designed from the ground up to support maintenance and upgrades during regular business hours.\u201cWe got our weekends back,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about coming in during the early hours of the morning or giving up your Saturday mornings or Sunday mornings to do what you had to do before.\u201d The impact of simple technologies ripples beyond their basic functions. Look no further than the smartphone in practically any pocket or purse. At its core are flash memory chips that quickly store and call up the bits that make up people\u2019s lives, from emails, contacts and calendars to photos, videos and social posts. Because of this breakthrough, your world is more informed, more organized and more connected, wherever you happen to be. And because of the solid-state flash memory, this data isn\u2019t erased when the phone slips out of your hands. Flash\u2019s impact on the datacenter is even more far-reaching and elegant. Its reliability, speed and savings are enabling solutions long thought impossible, like predictive analysis of massive amounts of data, real-time financial forecasting and the optimization of supply chains. And because it follows the pattern of all other integrated circuits as predicted by Moore\u2019s Law, flash storage is less expensive than the 60-year-old hard drive technology that is holding back so many companies from achieving their digital goals.But the true power of flash\u2019s simplicity is in how it makes enterprise technology more like consumer technology while, at the same time, it helps companies meet consumer expectations. Gone is the need for forklift upgrades of storage every five years with risky data migrations. Instead, storage can be upgraded instantly and paid for as simply as renewing a magazine subscription. In addition, the systems can be monitored and maintained from a web browser.Today, speed is king. Google\u2019s research finds that people will visit a website less often if it\u2019s slower than a rival\u2019s by just 250 milliseconds \u2014 literally the blink of an eye. For LinkedIn, flash unclogged a major IO bottleneck: Queries that used to take more than 30 milliseconds now take fewer than two.\u201cI don\u2019t need to worry about that anymore,\u201d says Neil Pinto, vice president of production engineering operations at the social networking site. \u201cIt definitely helped us solve the problem of scale and that shows up in our numbers \u2013 300 million (subscribers) and growing.\u201dLinkedIn was also able to reduce its storage footprint as the same workload could be handled by fewer devices, resulting in an 8x reduction in operational costs for power, cooling and rack space. Database refreshes that used to take more than 24 hours now are performed in minutes with Purity Operating Environment. And because there was more throughput overall with faster storage, existing servers worked more efficiently.\u201cWe had about a 20 percent improvement on the server side so we didn\u2019t have to go to beefier servers and we didn\u2019t have to buy more,\u201d Pinto says. \u201cIt was a win-win on all sides.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post&aposs preparation."}

{"Headline": "Google Will Further Block Some European Search Results", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byIn its continuing game of hide-and-seek with European privacy regulators, Google is about to make more changes to how people view its search results in Europe.The companyt will soon block access to certain disputed links from all of its domains \u2014 including the main United States one, Google.com \u2014 when people in Europe use its online search engine, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. They spoke only on the condition of anonymity.The move is the latest attempt by Google to comply with a May 2014 data privacy ruling by Europe\u2019s highest court, while also trying to minimize damage to the company\u2019s vast global database of digital information. That ruling, known as the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and hailed by many national data privacy officials in Europe, forced Google to comply with the region\u2019s tough privacy rules, even when those laws were at odds with the company\u2019s goal of providing unfettered information to people worldwide.\u201cThere\u2019s a cultural gap between Europe and the United States,\u201d said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of Linklaters, a law firm. \u201cIn Europe, we have a very strong position that views privacy as a fundamental right.\u201dUntil now, Google has complied with the European court\u2019s decision to remove links to online material at the request of European residents, though it has balked at extending those privacy rights to its global domains like Google.com that would encompass its non-European users.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.Now, Google will go further, in part to forestall legal disputes and potential fines from European national privacy agencies. The search giant has told Europe\u2019s national data protection authorities that it will start blocking certain links on all of its global domains \u2014 including Google.com \u2014 when they are viewed from the European Union country where the original claim was made.As part of the change, which will take effect by March, when someone succeeds in asking Google to remove or block access to a link for legitimate privacy reasons, the company will remove the link from its European domains \u2014 like Google.es in Spain, for example \u2014 and block access to the link from all of its global sites that can be used from the country where the request was submitted.In practice, that would mean a successful request from someone in Spain would lead to the removal of the link from all of Google\u2019s European online search domains, while blocking access to it from all of its non-European domains \u2014 including Google.com \u2014 from that specific country.Search results for individuals outside the European Union, including the United States, will not be affected, and links on Google\u2019s non-European domains will still be accessible from other European countries, according to the people with knowledge of h Google\u2019s plans.The company has continually stressed that the European court ruling should apply only within the 28-member bloc. Google argues that if it agreed to alter all of its global search requests on behalf of the Europeans, other countries like China and Russia may soon demand that Google change its practices to meet their own national laws.Google has fallen afoul of Europe\u2019s privacy rules before, particularly in privacy-sensitive Germany. But several other United States tech companies have also found themselves embroiled in complicated legal disputes over how they collect, monitor and use the data from the likes of people\u2019s social media posts, online search queries and e-commerce purchases, which are fast becoming digital currency for companies\u2019 lucrative advertising operations.Yet it is Google that has often become the target of Europe\u2019s privacy concerns. That is partly because the company\u2019s activities stretch across people\u2019s daily digital activities through Google\u2019s dominant search engine, its ever-present mobile phone software known as Android and the company\u2019s other online services.Despite Google\u2019s renewed efforts to appease European privacy concerns, it remains unclear whether the company\u2019s actions will be enough to head off the continuing legal challenges by Europe\u2019s national data protection authorities.Elsa Trochet-Mac\u00e9, a spokeswoman for the French privacy authority that has already fined Google for previous privacy infractions, said on Thursday that the company informed Europe\u2019s data protection regulators last month about the coming changes to its search results, but that the French agency had not yet decided whether they meant that Google now complied with Europe\u2019s privacy rules.\u201cWe\u2019re now analyzing the new changes,\u201d Ms. Trochet-Mac\u00e9 said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, a Time-Honored Sport Looks to the Future", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOn Pro FootballSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On any given Sunday during football season, the N.F.L., a league that promotes itself as a standard-bearer of innovation, produces games that are analog at their core. The leather ball has been stitched the same way for decades, and the chain gangs hold the first-down markers like crossing guards at a busy street corner. The players smash into one another in a way a fan from a century ago would recognize.Yet the league, a $12-billion-a-year business, seems to be perpetually searching for the best and latest technology to help it deliver that analog product to its nearly 200 million fans, who are increasingly tech-savvy.The juxtaposition can be jarring.Enormous linemen push off one another in a shoving match that recalls something that could have taken place among heavyweights millenniums ago. And then those linemen head to the sideline and grab a tablet computer to scroll through high-definition photographs of their play.In a region filled with private equity titans, dreamy entrepreneurs and futurists, the N.F.L. has been eager to show off its technological chops this week.The Super Bowl host committee has also raised millions of dollars in donations from a range of technology giants, including Apple and Google, two companies not normally associated with the N.F.L. or other sports leagues.Google is paying for its shuttle buses to ferry Bay Area fans to and from the game. Apple is also running company buses to the game, and it has donated iPhones and laptops to the Super Bowl host committee. Still, neither company has pulled out the stops to throw its brand around here in the same way as many other companies.Brian Rolapp, the league\u2019s executive vice president for media, is paid to rub shoulders with the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and any other company that will deliver the N.F.L. to fans in a way that complements, but does not dilute, its principal product: the games.While the league may be eager to deliver football to its fans on whatever device they want to use, he said, it is reluctant to let that technology bleed too far into the game.\u201cA lot of that comes from the No. 1 objective, is to keep the competition pure,\u201d Rolapp said moments after attending a panel discussion that included a description of HoloLens, a headset being developed by Microsoft that will show games in \u201caugmented reality.\u201d\u201cAll the stuff we talk about from a business perspective, if the game isn\u2019t fair, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus should be on the human competition. We\u2019re very protective of that.\u201dHoloLens is in its infancy, but Microsoft was eager to demonstrate to reporters how the device works. In a faux living room with a coffee table, a sofa and football-themed pillows, company technicians showed highlights from a Seahawks-49ers game on a flat-panel television.With the HoloLens headset on, you could see additional statistics to the left and right of the screen. The entire field was in view, not just the portion of the field shown on television. And on the coffee table, a hologram of a play appeared that could be started, stopped and rotated to better analyze the players on the field.Microsoft was careful to distinguish between virtual reality, in which viewers are immersed in a digital world, and HoloLens, which they called a mixed reality, with holograms, other images and data dropped into the field of vision. This, they said, is more complementary to the game.To an older generation of fans who grew up with a few games a week on network television and perhaps a highlight show or two in between, HoloLens may seem to be a high-tech distraction from the game.But the N.F.L. is more focused on younger fans. And if those fans are watching football in new ways and on new devices, then the N.F.L. would be foolhardy not to find ways to reach them.Phil de Picciotto, the president of Octagon Worldwide, a sports marketing agency, said: \u201cFootball, as the leading sports platform, is a reflection of society, and society is more technologically dependent, so it\u2019s logical that the N.F.L. will embrace technology.\u201dInnovative technology, de Picciotto added, has been a part of the N.F.L. for decades, such as the radio headsets in the helmets of quarterbacks and the Telestrator, the device that television analysts use to diagram plays on top of video. Most of these additions did not change the game but aimed to enhance it.What technology is unlikely to do, though, is fundamentally alter the game \u2014 the collisions, the Hail Mary passes, the fist pumps and the high-fives. At least for now.Katie Benner and Conor Dougherty contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Ecuador, the Frugal Traveler Tries Luxury", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byFrugal TravelerI was not surprised when applause broke out as the pilot touched down at the Quito airport, high in the Ecuadorean Andes. In five and a half years as the Frugal Traveler columnist, I\u2019ve learned that cheering a safe arrival is a standard (and lovable) practice in some parts of the world.What struck me was how muffled the merriment sounded, through the curtains that separated their cramped quarters from my opulent perch in seat 1A. Apparently, those of us who can afford business class don\u2019t cheer. But why? That\u2019s the sort of mystery I hoped to solve on this journey.I had been separated from the thrifty throngs \u2014 my people \u2014 through the whim of an editor, who, for my final column, decided it would be entertaining to send me on a luxury trip. My counteroffer: I\u2019d do the first half high-end, and close with a frugal flourish.Then again, I\u2019m no absolutist. I\u2019ve been known to drop $30 on an entree in New York after a long solo trip gorging on greasy street food. I\u2019ll admit to sleeping better alone on a plushly appointed king-size bed than on an upper bunk in shared youth hostel quarters.So my trip to Ecuador would be an investigation: In what ways can spending more money make travel better? The country turned out to be an appropriate choice, one so cheap that even budget travelers can opt for moderate luxury.My arrival caused a commotion. One staff member cleared away the cones that protected the precious parking space at the front entrance. Another took my bag; a third came forth with a magenta welcome drink. It was an agua de frescos, brewed from 10 Andean herbs and flowers \u2014 \u201cWhat people offer to guests in southern Ecuador,\u201d I was told, though I wondered if tradition required forcing it on guests before they could even sit down.I was experiencing what I had only previously read about in press releases: a luxury hotel striving to introduce its guests to a stylized version of the local culture. The drink was as delicious as its rushed delivery was preposterous.Waiting for me in my elegant $370 room (taxes included) \u2014 which could be reached directly from the elegant garden via the elegant sitting room \u2014 was a hand-signed welcome note and, on the bedspread, a little hand-knit yarn blob that turned out to be a tropical fish. On the embossed business card next to it was scribbled a note: \u201cTo: Your Inner Child.\u201dPerhaps this is standard luxury treatment, but I found such coddling extraneous, even a bit creepy. The plate of fresh Ecuadorean fruits left by the window, however, was welcome. If only I had read the accompanying instructions before biting through the bitter skin of a tree tomato.I understand why business travelers might appreciate being spoon-fed local culture in the few minutes between meetings, counting on everyone to speak English, having their underwear cleaned for $3 a pair. (Ecuador operates on U.S. dollars.) I get it, I do. In fact, I sent my underwear out the next morning.But I was here to experience Ecuador, not strike a deal. So I took advantage of the hotel\u2019s splendid location and hit the streets, diving into the crowds that had come to the final day of Quito\u2019s annual Fiestas. I went over to La Ronda, Quito\u2019s famously narrow cobblestone street turned humble restaurant row, stopping for a $1.50 canelazo, an alcoholic cinnamon drink, from the wackily named Exquisitas Empanadas de Morocho del Ol\u00edmpico, where the young woman ladled it from a pot on a stove and spiked it. \u201cJust let me know if you need more alcohol,\u201d she said \u2014 not to me, but to a group of Ecuadoreans. Could she sniff the Casa Gangotena on me?After two deep-fried-before-your-eyes 75-cent empanadas, I returned to the hotel\u2019s restaurant for dinner. By all reports Cedr\u00f3n was an excellent place to blow some cash.That turned out to be half right. I ordered the meal-course-size version of locro, an Ecuadorean potato soup presented with avocado, fried corn, cheese, pork cracklings and six house-made salsas, all on the side. Swirling it all together, the soup was a circus of flavors and textures \u2014 a simple classic raised several levels. The service was perfect, if annoyingly deferential.Just one problem: It was a total bargain. The soup was $10, which included not just an amuse-bouche, bread and sparkling water, but also (gasp) tax and service. Just to run up the bill, I ordered a $9.50 dessert trio of alfajores, coconut panna cotta and a dollop of spiced ganache, then added an extra 10 percent to the service.The next afternoon, I met Juan Carlos Guerra, my $40-an-hour tour guide. (For Ecuador, that\u2019s a lot.) His English was polished, his knowledge of the city deep, his car comfortable. On the free walking tours I\u2019ve taken in other cities, I\u2019d tolerated lovable young balls of energy with well-practiced laugh lines but superficial knowledge. If they were student tour guides, Juan Carlos was a tenured professor.We covered precolonial volcano-worship, syncretic elements of the astonishing local churches, the Quito School\u2019s artistic traditions. At the old-fashioned Santa Clara Market, he plucked a yellowish ovoid fruit called a taxo off a fruit stand and cracked it open to reveal countless seeds enveloped in bright orange globules, like alien eggs. A relative of the passion fruit, but sweet rather than sour, it is my new favorite tropical treat.And he pointed out a lot that I would have missed on my own \u2014 candles made of animal fat that he used on his children as a treatment for raw noses, and boroj\u00f3, a fruit added to drinks as an aphrodisiac (\u201cIt\u2019s why there are so many children in Ecuador\u201d). As he took me by the stands selling medicinal herbs, he mentioned that the women working there perform \u201ccleansings\u201d for $5.My frugal instinct took over, though I knew a fancier $49 version could be arranged through my hotel. I was taken by a young woman named Laura to a rundown back area of the market, led into a narrow tile stall decorated with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe and told to strip to my underwear. Then she had at me, slapping my entire body, front and back, with a loose bouquet of herbs and plants, most notably stinging nettles. It felt as if I were running (almost) naked through a field of thorns.Afterward, she told Juan Carlos I had needed the cleansing. \u201cShe said she felt you were under a lot of stress,\u201d he said. Apparently, spending money makes me tense.Was a private guide worth it? Yes, especially at Ecuador prices. But the spoon-fed approach (almost literally in the case of that taxo fruit) was still bugging me. Stinging nettles notwithstanding, the day had felt distinctly adventure-free.We are all people, we are all equal,We were all made of the same materialsWhich is why material things cannot measure your worth.Upon arrival, I was sent to Zazu\u2019s bar to wait for my table, and ordered the most expensive cocktail on the menu, a $16 \u201cGal\u00e1pagos\u201d martini. As if to prove the rapper\u2019s point, the restaurant promptly forgot about me. Almost an hour later, I asked the bartender to check on my table. Though empty tables dotted the restaurant, I was seated without apology.The tasting menu was lovely \u2014 I especially enjoyed Zazu\u2019s replication of the Ecuadorean \u201chelado de paila\u201d process of making ice cream, using liquid nitrogen to whip up a passion fruit sorbet tableside, dolloping it on my lobster dish. But the service was, again, annoyingly deferential, and when you\u2019ve been made to wait alone at the bar for almost an hour, nothing tastes as good as it might otherwise.Hoping to explore the Avenue of the Volcanoes between Quito and Cuenca, I went with the ultimate luxury: hiring someone to take care of literally all my plans and be with me every step of the way.To avoid being further spoon-fed, I decided to seize control of Antonio\u2019s tour, telling him I\u2019d be willing to stop anywhere, endure discomfort, eat by the side of the road \u2014 and that we would be doing this all in Spanish. He acquiesced. (Of course, it was his job to acquiesce.)Our next two stops were impromptu and frugal-friendly. We stopped at a town called Latacunga and ducked into a hole-in-the-wall restaurant for chugchucaras, a local dish of deep-fried pork served with a number of side dishes \u2014 more culturally charming than culinarily compelling. Then we veered away from our route along the Pan-American Highway into Salcedo, famous for its ice-cream-on-a-stick, specifically a version in which four layers of ice cream form the shape of a volcano. The town\u2019s many ice cream shops were empty; Antonio explained that the new highway had decimated a longstanding pit stop tradition. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the traffic jams that formed, especially on weekends,\u201d he said.It had been a packed day, but by the time we pulled into our hotel, I was, curiously, not exhausted. I had sat in an air-conditioned S.U.V. all day and been driven around, told what to do. I had probably learned more about Ecuadorean ecosystems, volcanoes and flower production than I ever would have on my own, but the convenience had been isolating.The next day\u2019s highlight was the ultra-touristy but very impressive switchback train ride down near-vertical Nariz del Diablo mountain, the trickiest point in a route that in 1908 finally connected Quito with the Ecuadorean coast. The stop included an indigenous dance performance, narrated in English by a group member named Jos\u00e9, who told me afterward that he had toiled for nine years in London restaurants before returning to his village.Antonio was great, but the following day I was greatly relieved to board a rattling public bus and head (I hoped) to Cuenca\u2019s long-distance bus station for some real adventure. Relieved to be uncomfortable, relieved to be nervous I might be on the wrong bus.I took a bus to Saraguro, home to the indigenous people of the same name \u2014 which I had read was known for its community tourism efforts. Its square was out of a tourist brochure, full of flowers and well-tended bushes, with elegant U-shaped benches and a church on one end that filled for Mass with men and women in traditional black clothing \u2014 a contrast to more brightly colored shawls and skirts on women of other groups I had seen from Antonio\u2019s S.U.V.I had to bug the hostel staff several times about the homestay \u2014 they said the Saraur-ku director was away \u2014 but the next morning they finally collected $35 from me and sent me in a pickup truck (for $2 extra) to the village of \u00d1amar\u00edn and the Spanish-speaking home of Mar\u00eda Delfina Cartuche and Marcelo Cirilo Nastacuaz. On a slope in full view of Mount Puglia, their solid if haphazardly designed house of tile, brick and concrete block was set amid a little rural paradise. Trees bore oranges, peaches, tree tomatoes, greengage plums, avocados and figs; countless flowers bloomed and one purple-flowered quinoa plant shot straight up from the soil. Squawking hens wore peculiar outfits: white and blue plastic bags that, the family told me, prevented eagles from swooping down and carrying them away.A whole room of the house \u2014 really kind of a separate wing \u2014 had been set aside for visitors, furnished with rustic beds made by Marcelo and covered in thick, coffee-colored blankets made by Mar\u00eda with wool from sheep they kept up the hill behind the house. (Mar\u00eda also sells $10 wool hats and scarves, all colored with natural dyes.)A bit later, the family\u2019s youngest member, 6-year-old Genesis, handed me a leaf to sniff from plants she had picked from the garden. \u201cCedr\u00f3n,\u201d she said \u2014 lemon verbena, and, I recalled, the name of the restaurant at Casa Gangotena. \u201cIt\u2019s for my mother\u2019s horchata.\u201d I sampled the bright red herbal brew later that afternoon; it was warm and welcoming \u2014 and a more pleasant presentation than the agua de frescos I had shoved in my face at the Quito hotel.A smart, delightful couple, Mar\u00eda and Marcelo had met in Quito and moved back to \u00d1amar\u00edn to raise their four children. Their lifestyle was a curious kosher-Mormon-hipster amalgam: They do not drink alcohol or coffee, avoid dairy, don\u2019t touch pork or shellfish, refuse to buy commercial eggs and build their own furniture.But they lived in a truly traditional world. On a tour of the village, Mar\u00eda explained to me how the indigenous justice system \u2014 enshrined in the Ecuadorean constitution \u2014 worked. When issues came up, long meetings were held in the community center that could last into the early hours, as women hand-spun wool into yarn.She recounted how they had even brought down a cattle-rustling ring in the region, eventually punishing the accused with \u201ccleansings\u201d much harsher than the one I had had in Quito \u2014 \u201cwith a much stronger kind of nettle\u201d she said, and drenched in the freezing water from a large waterfall. \u201cIt\u2019s not torture,\u201d she responded, when I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the police that torture people, that hit people. We gave them a cleansing, a purification.\u201dShortly before I left, when I told her I was a writer and might write about them, she rushed to get a business card. Though she worked with Saraurku as well, \u00d1amar\u00edn had its own community tourism initiative. The nightly cost of staying there, with three meals included: $20. That\u2019s $15 less than if you book through Saraurku and, if you\u2019re keeping track, $340-something less than a night at Casa Gangotena.I returned to the Cuenca bus terminal by midafternoon on a Saturday, and tried to figure out how to get to my final destination, the obscure town of Quingeo.The one bus from the terminal to Quingeo that day had already left, I was told, but I could take a taxi to the bus stop \u201cacross from Colegio Garaicoa,\u201d and wait there. Sure enough, I was soon boarding a standing-room-only, music-blasting bus for the one-hour, 65-cent ride to Quingeo.I asked a man named Miguel, who got off the bus with me, lugging a sack of foodstuffs, whether anyone in town rented out rooms. \u201cWe\u2019ll ask the priest,\u201d he said. We walked a few blocks up a dirt road into a tiny town that, were it not for a few modern details (Internet cafe, pickup truck), could have existed a century in the past. Adobe buildings with beams and balconies surrounded the town square; a block beyond were hills and farmland.The priest was nowhere to be found, but Miguel brought me to a woman named Laura Reynoso, who looked as if she had walked out of a coffee-table book on Andean grandmothers. \u201cCould you find a bed for this gentleman?\u201d he asked her. She showed me to a room in one of the square\u2019s more beautiful homes, painted a mustardy yellow with a second-story balcony held up with chocolate brown wooden beams. I asked her what I could pay her. \u201cWhatever you think is right,\u201d she said. \u201cBut tomorrow.\u201dThe lone restaurant on the square, Pap\u00e1 Morales, was closed. But I managed to get invited by Ms. Reynoso to a dinner of pork ribs, rice and llapingachos, potato and cheese patties. Her son, Patricio \u2014 a schoolteacher in Cuenca during the week, owner of a small market on the square on weekends and a big Beatles fan \u2014 later invited me to sit outside with him to drink Zhumir, an Ecuadorean sugar cane spirit, and listen to Paul McCartney. Soon after, we adjourned to a wooden shack labeled BAR, run by his son, Lennon.The next morning, vendors set up a modest market around one half of the plaza; I stopped at one stall run by Pap\u00e1 Morales restaurant (which remained closed) and enjoyed a $2 bowl of encebollado, the restorative Ecuadorean fish soup. Soon, a competitive six-on-six soccer tournament started up, as it did every Sunday, run by Pap\u00e1 Morales\u2019s owner, Jorge Morales, who, as it turned out, I had met at the wooden shack the night before.He kept up a steady patter over a portable public address system as the teams, mostly from surrounding villages, played: \u201cRepresentatives of Barcelona and Real Madrid are here, looking for talent to contract, so get moving!\u201d And a bit later, when he found out I had tried his soup: \u201cSeth from New York is visiting the greatest soccer tournament in the world \u2014 he found it on the Internet and came just to try Pap\u00e1 Morales\u2019s encebollado!\u201dI had probably learned more about Ecuador with my guides, Juan Carlos and Antonio, and maybe even listening to a waiter at Cedr\u00f3n explain the origins of the six salsas on my table.But on my own in Saraguro and Quingeo, I had returned to my natural travel state, one in which challenges, discomfort and sometimes even stress had led (as it had, time and time again in the past) to adventures, new friends and the unmatched rush of feeling at home in a truly foreign place.Does that mean budget travel is inherently better than luxury travel, at least for those driven more by curiosity than a need to relax? To me, it does. But perhaps I simply never learned to travel luxuriously. Maybe, with another five and a half years of practice, I could learn how to incorporate fine dining, attentive guides and comfortable transport into a trip full of street food, local friends, serendipity and adventure.Would anyone like to fund that research? I\u2019m available.Quingeo can be reached by regular buses labeled \u201cQuingeo\u201d that stop across from Colegio Garaicoa (65 cents), above. Express Sigsig (593-7-226-6340) also has infrequent weekend buses to Quingeo from the Cuenca terminal. For lodging there, you\u2019re on your own, but it\u2019s certainly possible to go and come back on the same day. Buses leave Quingeo a block south of the town square.Seth Kugel has written the Frugal Traveler column since June 2010. This is his last column. His successor, Lucas Peterson, will start later this month. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet, Google\u2019s Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close In on Apple", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byDespite spending $3.6 billion a year on projects like self-driving cars that don\u2019t make much money, Alphabet\u2019s advertising business propelled the company to a strong last three months of 2015, outpacing expectations and sending the stock up in after-hours trading.Now, when Wall Street opens for business on Tuesday, Alphabet will most likely be worth more than Apple, which has been the most valuable company in the world for nearly four years. Apple is still generating enviable profits but is dealing with concerns that its franchise iPhone business is slowing down.If investors are sending any sort of signal to big tech companies, which have taken their lumps from shareholders this year, it is simply this: You are free to spend on side projects so long as your main business is not showing signs of weakness.\u201cThe main thing is the core business,\u201d said Josh Spencer, who manages T. Rowe Price\u2019s Global Technology Fund.Alphabet\u2019s total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014.The revenue rise was attributed to strong growth in mobile search and YouTube, which is significant because investors had long been looking for signs that the core search business was making a smooth transition from desktop computers to mobile phones, and that YouTube was becoming a driver of new growth.\u201cAbove all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google\u2019s range of businesses,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of the Google business, during the call.Net income was $4.9 billion versus $4.7 billion for the same period a year ago, beating Wall Street expectations. The company said its \u201cother bets\u201d category \u2014 the moonshots \u2014 had revenue of $448 million.Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Google\u2019s core business is performing.In fact, many Alphabet investors are hoping that merely disclosing new information will give the stock price an extra lift. In a recent report, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, called segment reporting \u201cthe most identifiable near-term catalyst in Internet land,\u201d which is to say that when companies give investors more information, it makes them more eager to buy in.The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere.Mr. Spencer, of T. Rowe Price, which holds Alphabet shares, said he had been happy with Alphabet\u2019s progress but wanted the company to give back more of its cash pile to investors.\u201cI would like to see more developments in terms of capital return, but not this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBaby steps with this company.\u201dOf course, the reality is that, in revenue terms, nothing about Alphabet\u2019s business has changed. Google began 2015 as a giant advertising company connected to a collection of intriguing science projects. Alphabet ended the year as a collection of intriguing science projects connected to a highly profitable advertising business.Advertising continues to account for the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising.This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Google\u2019s mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.\u201cFor a company of this size to continue to be able to grow at 20 percent a year \u2014 that\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities.What about those other bets, like the self-driving car? Right now they are just big losses. For investors, then, this report was less about the future than it was about reassuring them that the old Google is continuing to grow quickly, and that other products like YouTube are going to pick up the growth when search advertising starts to mature.If one of the moonshots should work out, then great.

Solomon Company, founded nearly 30 years ago as an independent adviser on mergers and other transactions.The deal will give the French bank a bigger presence in the United States. But it will also bring significant financial backing to Peter J. Solomon at a time when boutique investment banks \u2014 those without lending or trading arms \u2014 have grown in prominence.It will also help solve issues like succession for the firm\u2019s eponymous founder, Peter J. Solomon, a longtime deal maker who created the bank in 1989 after leaving Shearson Lehman Brothers after a clash with his then-boss, Peter Cohen.\u201cIt\u2019s a fabulous opportunity for my people and our clients,\u201d Mr. Solomon, who is 77, said in a telephone interview.Wednesday\u2019s announcement was born of a longtime friendship between Mr. Solomon and Guy de Panafieu, a French banker whom he had known since Peter J. Solomon Company formed a partnership with Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais.Last May, Mr. Panafieu offered to introduce Mr. Solomon to Natixis, describing the French bank as a \u201cterrific firm interested in getting into the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Solomon said.(Mr. Solomon also has a long history of ties to France, having worked in Paris early in his career.)In its earnings release, Natixis said that the deal \u201cwill strengthen M.&A. business in the U.S. and is consistent with the objectives of developing asset-light activities and of achieving selective growth on international platforms.\u201dMr. Solomon declined to comment on financial terms of the transaction. But he said that Peter J. Solomon would retain operating control. Moreover, he has signed a 10-year contract to remain at the firm, though he pointedly added that he did not ask for any extension.The introduction came at a propitious time for Mr. Solomon. He had been thinking about how to handle succession for the firm that bears his name and about the bank\u2019s role in the changing advisory landscape.The firm had carved out a niche as an adviser on deals in the retail and consumer sectors, working on transactions like Google\u2019s acquisition of Zagat and on the proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot. But the boutique\u2019s setup has also meant that it has missed out on some business, like advising private equity firms, because it does not have a lending arm.Mr. Solomon also emphasized that, with the help of Natixis, Peter J. Solomon can continue to evolve in other ways. Hundreds of small advisory firms have cropped up since he founded Peter J. Solomon in 1989. (One of those firms, Centerview Partners, recently hired Peter J. Solomon\u2019s former president, Ken Berliner.)Natixis\u2019 backing could help Peter J. Solomon acquire those smaller advisers.\u201cI think we can be the consolidator of some of these very good small firms,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cI have a list on my desk of 300 firms that call themselves independent investment banks. We have been talking to them.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Mr. Solomon\u2019s age. He is 77, not 76.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E-Commerce: Convenience Built on a Mountain of Cardboard", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byRuchit Garg, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, says that he worries that something isn\u2019t right with his Internet shopping habit. With each new delivery to his doorstep \u2014 sometimes several in a day \u2014 he faces the source of his guilt and frustration: another cardboard box.A handful of scientists and policy makers are circling the same question, grappling with the long-term environmental effect of an economy that runs increasingly on gotta-have-it-now gratification. This cycle leads consumers to expect that even their modest wants can be satisfied like urgent needs, and not always feel so great about it.The environmental cost can include the additional cardboard \u2014 35.4 million tons of containerboard were produced in 2014 in the United States, with e-commerce companies among the fastest-growing users \u2014 and the emissions from increasingly personalized freight services.Dr. Sperling said that consumers shared as much responsibility for the environmental cost of the deliveries as the companies that provided the speedy services.\u201cFrom a sustainability perspective, we\u2019re heading in the wrong direction,\u201d he said.But measuring the effect of the cardboard economy is more difficult.There are possible trade-offs, for example. As people shop more online, they might use their cars less. And delivery services have immense incentive to find the most efficient routes, keeping their fuel costs and emissions down. For its part, Amazon said that delivering to consumers straight from huge warehouses cuts down the need to distribute to thousands of stores.Ardeshi Faghri, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Delaware, said the increase of various emissions \u2014 which he estimated at 20 percent from 2001 to 2011 \u2014 \u201ccould be due to a multitude of reasons, but we think that online shopping and more delivery trucks are really one of the primary reasons.\u201d\u201cOnline shopping has not helped the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made it worse.\u201dOther scholars say that, at least for now, online shopping appears to be complementing brick-and-mortar shopping, not replacing it.Dr. Wang and other researchers say the demand for instant delivery, in particular, creates challenges for trucking companies trying to be efficient. Instead of taking big truckloads to single retailers they now make more scattershot deliveries.Many drivers deliver just one item. This is often the case for Postmates, which has a fleet of 15,000 freelance drivers signed up to make deliveries of whatever the customer orders \u2014 an Uber-like service, but for deliveries. The cost typically starts at $5, and a 9 percent service fee applied to the cost of the item. (The company says it also has about 5,000 deliverers who go on bike or foot in dense urban areas).And the push for speed from marketers gives shoppers little incentive to wait.Such is the case for Monica Rohleder, who admits to using Amazon Prime so much that \u201cmy husband jokes we keep Amazon in business.\u201dMs. Rohleder, who lives in Los Angeles and works at a public relations firm, said she liked overnight delivery, but \u201cwithin a couple of hours is best\u201d because she is busy with work and her two young children. So she often does not order something until it\u2019s urgent. \u201cThere\u2019s the immediate gratification of getting something and checking it off your list,\u201d she said.One afternoon she received six boxes, from Amazon and Nordstrom, for a Hawaii trip, including bathing suits, workout clothes and coloring books. Some of the clothes did not fit, so she returned them.She thinks more about the cardboard that comes into her house than the truck emissions, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d she added of her mass of weekly recycling.Amazon is aware of the cardboard issue. Since 2009, it has received 33 million comments, ratings and photographs about its packaging as part of its \u201cpackaging feedback program.\u201d Amazon said it used that feedback to make sure that cardboard box size was consistent with the size of the product. It also works with manufacturers to send some products without additional cardboard packaging, said Craig Berman, a company spokesman.\u201cAnd maybe not put a box inside a box inside a box,\u201d he saidAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Town of Colma, Where San Francisco\u2019s Dead Live", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byIn a broad valley devoted largely to the dead, the history museum in Colma \u2014 nicknamed the City of Souls \u2014 sells T-shirts that read, \u201cIt\u2019s Great to Be Alive in Colma!\u201dIt is a town of 1,600 living residents and about 1.5 million dead ones \u2014 many of whom, like the 49ers, uprooted and left San Francisco for greener pastures to the south.The road to Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl stretches about 50 miles, from San Francisco, the epicenter of festivities this week, to Santa Clara, site of the actual game. The corridor, mostly along Highway 101, is a time capsule of the Bay Area\u2019s history and its quirks \u2014 and a modern-day testament to its traffic problems.But nowhere along the way may be quirkier, or filled with more history, than Colma, a quiet town of roughly two square miles covered mostly in graves. More necropolis than metropolis, the town\u2019s worst traffic jams are caused by funeral processions; Colma residents receive warnings, by automated phone blast, whenever a big procession is expected, whether for San Francisco firefighters or an area Hell\u2019s Angel.Colma exists mostly because the deceased, like so many present-day workers in San Francisco, could no longer afford to live in the city.San Francisco banned burials in the city in 1900 because the cemeteries were out of room, considered a health hazard and \u2014 more than anything \u2014 sat on prime real estate. In 1912, San Francisco announced that it would do more than ban burials. It would kick out the dead.In the end, more than 150,000 bodies were moved from San Francisco to Colma, where farmland was turned to graveyards, the fertile soil now mostly covered in green, carpetlike grass. The number of people who die in San Francisco and spend eternity in Colma grows every day.\u201cAll the cemeteries you go through here, they\u2019re a history of San Francisco and of California,\u201d said Richard Rochetta, a Colma Historical Society board member whose father emigrated from Italy and spent 30 years as a caretaker at Olivet Memorial Park.Levi Strauss is at Home of Peace, next to Hills of Eternity, where Wyatt Earp can be found. Joe DiMaggio is at Holy Cross, where his dark marble headstone this week propped up a couple of bats and two baseballs left there by fans.A few feet behind DiMaggio is a crypt for Michael Henry de Young, founder of The San Francisco Chronicle, whose family name adorns the city\u2019s major art museum.Near the entrance to Holy Cross is a slate-black rectangular stone for Edmund G. Brown, the former California governor and father of the current one. Near the back is a small pink stone nestled in the grass for Moscone (\u201cWe love you Dad\u201d), the San Francisco mayor assassinated along with the gay-rights activist Harvey Milk in 1978.Next door, at Cypress Lawn, is a Greek-inspired marble tomb surrounded by 16 Ionic columns. It has no name on it but houses William Randolph Hearst, his parents (who built it) and other family members.Not far away, past the angel of grief embracing the grave for Jennie Roosevelt Pool (a cousin of Theodore Roosevelt), is the baseball player and manager Lefty O\u2019Doul. His marker lists his batting average and says, \u201cHe was here at a good time and had a good time while he was here.\u201dHistory, though, rests largely with thousands of the earliest San Francisco residents, buried in unmarked graves. When San Francisco flourished following the arrival of the 49ers (the gold-seekers of the 1800s, not the football team), the city had four major cemeteries near what is now the University of San Francisco.Those four cemeteries \u2014 Calvary, Laurel Hill, Masonic and Odd Fellows \u2014 were a mess by the late 1800s, untended and scavenged. They were also full, and the city was still growing. The land was too valuable for the dead.\u201cThe cemeteries had all fallen into disrepair, essentially because they relied on new plots to make money for their upkeep,\u201d said Maureen O\u2019Connor, president of the Colma Historical Association.San Francisco cemeteries bought land south of the city and established new ones. From about 1920 to 1941, the big four cemeteries moved roughly 150,000 bodies. Graves and markers of the deceased whose families paid to have them moved (generally $10) were replanted 15 miles south, sometimes after a solemn procession.But most of the dead were dug up, moved and reburied in mass graves. Many grave markers, with etched names and dates, never left San Francisco. They were used to build drain gutters at Buena Vista Park and to bolster the breakwater near St. Francis Yacht Club. Some are occasionally spotted at low tide in the sand along Ocean Beach.A monument at Holy Cross in Colma today reads: \u201cInterred here are the remains of 39,307 Catholics moved from Mt. Calvary Cemetery in 1940 and 1941 by order of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Rest in God\u2019s Loving Care.\u201dBy 1924, Colma was incorporated (first as Lawndale, reverting to Colma in 1941), and it has never had more living residents than dead ones.Always a place friendly to florists and monument makers, and a bar called Molloy\u2019s that dates to 1883, Colma began attracting car dealerships and strip malls on its western edge, near Interstate 280, in the 1970s. The train line that once carried dead bodies to Colma is now the BART line that carries living residents to neighboring cities on the Peninsula.Supported by a commercial sales tax (but not from the cemeteries, which are nonprofit), Colma is a neat and tidy town, with three small neighborhoods and 17 sprawling, manicured cemeteries, including one for pets. Residents know that it is the dead that set Colma apart from its suburban neighbors.\u201cWe are the city of souls, but we are really protecting the cemeteries,\u201d said Helen Fisicaro, Colma\u2019s vice mayor. \u201cThere is an emotional attachment to them.\u201dBut it is on the road to it, for those able to pass through without stopping forever.An earlier version of this article misstated the substance that exploded and caused a head injury to Phineas Gage in 1848.

{"Headline": "Under Steve Burke, Old-Media NBCUniversal Shows Off Some New Tricks", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut Comcast startled investors and analysts on Wednesday with earnings that suggested there was still growth potential in old media. Not only did the cable giant stem the tide of so-called cord cutters by adding video subscribers, but results from NBCUniversal were every bit as dazzling as the latest financials from Amazon or Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Universal theme park revenue jumped 39 percent for the quarter and the movie business rose 26 percent. Over all, NBCUniversal revenue rose more than 13 percent. Comcast doesn\u2019t break out earnings for NBCUniversal, but operating cash flow rose 8.7 percent.Since 2009, when Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal from its former parent General Electric (an acquisition completed five years ago), NBCUniversal\u2019s cash flow has doubled. The NBC television network, which had been in fourth place for so long (seven years) that many doubted it could be resurrected, is the leading network for the coveted 18-to-49 age group, powered by high ratings for \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Strong franchises \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d and \u201cToday\u201d have recouped the top spots in the ratings that had been threatened by scandal (Brian Williams at \u201cNightly News\u201d) and a tearful on-air departure (Ann Curry at \u201cToday\u201d).I sat down this week with Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, in his spacious, light-filled office at NBCUniversal\u2019s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Despite the pressures of running a media giant with $28.5 billion in revenue, he looks younger than his age of 57 years. In our conversation, one thing stood out about NBCUniversal, which is true of all old-media companies: It\u2019s all about the people. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s about talent. If you get that wrong, the whole enterprise goes bad very quickly.\u201dMr. Burke grew up in broadcast television \u2014 his father, Dan Burke, was a former president of CapCities ABC, and Steve Burke worked at Disney under the former chief executive Michael Eisner and then at Comcast, where he was president of the cable division, under the chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts.Today much of Mr. Burke\u2019s time seems to be spent courting, coaxing, stroking, cajoling \u2014 and in some cases ejecting \u2014 high-paid, high-profile stars and executives, many with outsize egos. In 2011, Mr. Burke had to replace the prominent NBC Sports head, Dick Ebersol, just four weeks before the rights to the Sochi Olympics were auctioned.Last year, when the NBC Nightly news anchor, Brian Williams, acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in Iraq, Mr. Burke had to put their close friendship aside and deliver an in-person ultimatum to take a six-month leave without pay. (\u201cAgonizing,\u201d Mr. Burke told me.)He flew to California and spent a weekend with Jay Leno to negotiate the delicate transition to Jimmy Fallon as host of the \u201cTonight\u201d show a year before Mr. Leno\u2019s contract was set to expire.Still, dealing with stars like Mr. Leno and Mr. Fallon can\u2019t be delegated. It was Mr. Burke who coaxed Steven Spielberg back to his production roots at Universal Studios. And some deals \u2014 NBC\u2019s multibillion-dollar, nine-year extension of \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d for example \u2014 are so big they require the presence of Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burke\u2019s boss.While Mr. Burke comes across as genial and low-key, he\u2019s a demanding boss. Of the 16 NBCUniversal executives Mr. Burke inherited from G.E., only four remain.Early in his tenure, he summoned the top 200 managers to Orlando and told them they had to do better. \u201cI had to be stern,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cPeople thought everything was fine. It wasn\u2019t. I had to paint reality. I ranked our top 10 businesses based on operating cash flow. Eight of the 10 were in the third quartile,\u201d meaning they woefully lagged their competitors. He charged them to act like owners, not renters \u2014 which means to invest for the long term, to take responsibility and to fix problems themselves \u2014 a mantra now printed on the back of every NBCUniversal business card. It\u2019s also one emphasized by Warren E. Buffett to the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr. Burke serves on the board. (Disclosure: I\u2019m a weekly contributor to CNBC, the NBCUniversal-owned business channel.)Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks & Resorts, has been at Universal for 46 years. \u201cThe previous mentality was, How can we take cash out of the business?\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cComcast encouraged, even mandated, reinvestment. We\u2019ve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers. Steve and Brian have said, \u2018Keep reinvesting.\u2019 The returns are stellar.\u201dUniversal recently acquired 51 percent ownership of Universal Studios Japan, is opening another Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood and is building a new park in Beijing.With NBCUniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders, Mr. Burke has been able to turn his attention to the digital revolution. He said he was looking to hire digital talent, had personally interviewed 25 people in the last month and would probably establish an NBCUniversal digital headquarters in Santa Monica, also known as Silicon Beach. The company has taken $200 million stakes in the digital media companies BuzzFeed and Vox Media, and has started Seeso, a digital comedy channel.\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cBig media made the transition from broadcast to cable. But we were still dealing with channels. Now we have to move to digital. Digital is different. The DNA doesn\u2019t already reside in the company.\u201dInvestors have already declared a winner in this emerging showdown: Comcast stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18; Netflix\u2019s is 324 and Amazon\u2019s is 425, meaning that investors are anticipating much higher growth at those companies.Still, as old and new media converge, and talent increasingly rivals engineering prowess in importance, it may be worth asking how much old-media DNA resides in digital media giants like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet. Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Bezos and Larry Page, their respective chief executives, aren\u2019t primarily known for their people skills, let alone the ability to cultivate Hollywood celebrities and TV stars.Mr. Burke typically shuns the spotlight, and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains NBCUniversal\u2019s recent success and momentum. He said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclical.Still, it\u2019s obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal. \u201cI\u2019m a product of my dad\u2019s influence at CapCities ABC, my time at Disney, and then at Comcast,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cI developed all these theories about how to run a big media company and I finally got an opportunity to try them.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated Mr. Burke\u2019s title at Comcast. He is senior executive vice president, not president.Advertisement"}

The city has been bruised by the failures of its professional sports teams, but smart fans accept that the Phillies\u2019 previous strategy \u2014 clinging to highly paid, fading veterans \u2014 was failing. A full-scale renovation is underway, run by MacPhail \u2014 who has helped turn around the Minnesota Twins, the Chicago Cubs and the Orioles \u2014 and the new general manager, Matt Klentak.\u201cTo understand where we want to end up, we need to understand where we are today and build the foundation appropriately,\u201d Klentak said. \u201cBut a lot of pieces of the foundation are already here.\u201dThird baseman Maikel Franco, center fielder Odubel Herrera, starter Aaron Nola and the top shortstop prospect J. P. Crawford are part of that foundation, but so is Klentak, 35, the youngest general manager in Phillies history. A former shortstop at Dartmouth, Klentak served under MacPhail as an assistant general manager for the Orioles, then spent four years in the same role for the Los Angeles Angels.In Baltimore, he helped the Orioles recover from a string of losing seasons. In Anaheim, he helped sustain a winning Angels team. He plans to experience both extremes in Philadelphia, with an ownership group that has shown it will spend to win, when the time is right.\u201cWhen players show that progress is being made,\u201d Klentak said, \u201cI have no doubt whatsoever that the resources will be there for us to add the pieces that we need.\u201dLast season, the Phillies gave 77 starts \u2014 almost half of the schedule \u2014 to Phillippe Aumont, Chad Billingsley, Kevin Correia, Aaron Harang, Dustin McGowan, Sean O\u2019Sullivan and Jerome Williams. They went a combined 13-39 with a 5.70 earned run average as starters, and have one thing in common now: not having a spot on any team\u2019s 40-man roster.To avoid a repeat, the Phillies traded for the veterans Jeremy Hellickson and Charlie Morton, who will make $15 million combined this season. (\u201cIf we wanted to lose 120 games, we wouldn\u2019t have spent that,\u201d MacPhail said.) If Hellickson and Morton pitch well, the Phillies could trade them to add to their prospect depth. For now, the two should give the team a better chance to compete, without the appearance of so-called tanking.Morton pitched for the 2010 Pirates, who went 57-105, and stayed as they won the National League\u2019s top wild-card spot in each of the last three seasons. He has lived through a disciplined reconstruction.\u201cThere\u2019s a different methodology, organization to organization,\u201d Morton said. \u201cWith the Pirates, my impression was: Save money, spend it in the draft, don\u2019t sign big-name free agents, sign the free agents you need to solidify the roster, and then develop your young guys. You have to have a core group of guys. Because when you\u2019re constantly changing rosters, I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s really tough to get any kind of consistency, even in the clubhouse, not just on the field.\u201dThe Phillies hope to coalesce around Crawford, Franco and the others, but for now the players are virtual strangers. Just 18 of the 65 Phillies invited to camp were part of the team last spring.Six came from Texas last July, when the former general manager Ruben Amaro traded starter Cole Hamels in a deal that has been widely praised. MacPhail and Klentak swapped Ken Giles, an elite reliever with five years of club control, to Houston in December for five pitchers, including the promising right-handers Vincent Velasquez and Mark Appel, a former No. 1 overall pick.\u201cWhat was explained to me,\u201d Appel said of his first conversation with Klentak, \u201cis that the Phillies are an organization with a great history, so many quality teams in the past, and what we\u2019re doing right now is building to create another quality dynasty.\u201dThe Phillies\u2019 history is actually darker \u2014 founded in 1883, they have finished last 33 times \u2014 but they strung together nine winning seasons through 2011, when they went 102-60. That season ended with the slugger Ryan Howard tearing his Achilles\u2019 tendon as he grounded out to end a playoff series against St. Louis. Then Howard began a five-year, $125 million contract extension, and a steep decline in production.After this season, though, and the expected buyouts on various contracts, the Phillies will be clear of their commitments to Howard and catcher Carlos Ruiz. That would leave only Matt Harrison \u2014 an injured starter acquired from Texas to offset some of Hamels\u2019s salary \u2014 on the payroll, freeing MacPhail and Klentak to start over.They have added a full-time analytics director from Google; an extra amateur scout in Florida; more strength and conditioning staff members; a pitching rehabilitation coordinator; high-definition cameras to help with video analysis; and software systems to enhance player fitness and measure batted-ball data.The Phillies were late to adapt to the statistical revolution, and to the need for a patient, methodical overhaul. Now that they are committed, they expect to win again before long. In a league increasingly geared toward young players and competitive balance, there is no excuse if they fail.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roadblocks on the Route From Wall Street to Washington", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byDealBookFor some at the top of Wall Street, there is only one job considered better: a top job in Washington.Every presidential election cycle, financiers jockey for position among the candidates to become their biggest fund-raisers and, more important, close advisers.The conventional view is that these investment bankers and money managers enter politics to influence policy. But that\u2019s only part of it. For Wall Street\u2019s elite bundlers and consiglieres, the endgame is a senior role in a White House administration \u2014 the most prestigious of which is secretary of the Treasury.Speculation has long been rampant that a small group of Wall Street executives, including Hamilton E. James of Blackstone Group, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock and Roger C. Altman of Evercore, would love the top Treasury post if Hillary Clinton won the election. Warren E. Buffett once suggested that Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase should be Treasury secretary.But this little parlor game has a big problem: No matter who wins the presidency this fall, chances are slim that anyone connected to Wall Street has a prayer of securing a top post in the administration.Over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether she would appoint a Wall Street executive as Treasury secretary. She did everything but say the word no.\u201cI think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury secretary,\u201d than Wall Street, she said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Chuck Todd pressed her about whether the country can \u201chave a Treasury secretary who isn\u2019t familiar with how Wall Street works,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd I say this because I think there\u2019s so much distrust right now of Wall Street.\u201d She replied, \u201cYes, there is, there is.\u201dOf course, Mrs. Clinton is battling accusations from Bernard Sanders that she is too cozy with Wall Street, citing as an example her accepting $675,000 for three speeches made to Goldman Sachs. \u201cThe business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u201d Mr. Sanders has said repeatedly on the campaign trail. If Mr. Sanders wins the election, it\u2019s hard to imagine him appointing anyone to his cabinet who has any connection to a bank beyond having a checking account.The Republican candidates, if you take their campaign rhetoric at face value, seem hardly more inclined to name a Wall Street executive to a senior finance post. Ted Cruz has spent much of his campaign criticizing the banks and trying to distance himself from his wife\u2019s job at Goldman Sachs. He has gone so far as to say that if a major financial institution like Bank of America required a government bailout to avoid collapse, he\u2019d let it fail.Even Donald J. Trump, perhaps the candidate with the closest ties to Wall Street, has adopted a populist tone during his campaign and has described a bit of a love-hate relationship with financiers.\u201cThe hedge fund guys didn\u2019t build this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said last fall, as he talked about his plan to tax them more. \u201cThese are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky. And, by the way, when the market collapses, like it is now, the market is going down, they\u2019re losing a fortune.\u201d He added, \u201cThe hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They\u2019re making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of naming his friend Carl Icahn, a hedge fund manager, to run the Treasury. Mr. Icahn\u2019s reply? \u201cNo way.\u201d When Mr. Trump mentioned Henry Kravis, the private equity billionaire, as a possible Treasury secretary, Mr. Kravis said at a conference, \u201cThat was scary when he said that.\u201dBut in recent years, Wall Street executives have either shied away from working in Washington or been impeded by lawmakers hostile to their nominations.Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and former chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley, was up for a deputy secretary position at Treasury three years ago but pulled out of the running, in part to avoid the harsh spotlight of the confirmation process. Antonio Weiss, a senior executive at the investment bank Lazard, withdrew his name after Senator Elizabeth Warren threatened to block his confirmation; he instead became a special adviser to the Treasury secretary, a job that did not require Senate confirmation.In a post-financial-crisis world, most bankers have avoided Washington either by choice or by default. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m suited to it,\u201d Mr. Dimon told me in 2012 when I asked him whether he would be a good Treasury secretary. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe a Wall Street C.E.O. could get confirmed.\u201dThat remains the prevailing view.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about the diminished possibility that a Wall Street banker will be named Treasury secretary in the next administration, erroneously attributed a distinction to Henry M. Paulson Jr. While he was the last long-serving Wall Street executive to be appointed Treasury secretary, he was not the last Wall Street executive to serve in that post. The current Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, who spent nearly his entire career as a government official in Washington, was an executive at Citigroup from 2006 to 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mark Zuckerberg Backs Apple in Its Refusal to Unlock iPhone", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg on Monday threw his support behind Apple in its bitter battle with the United States government over attempts to gain access to information protected by the company\u2019s sophisticated encryption technology.Speaking at the Mobile World Congress, an annual tech and telecommunications conference here, Mr. Zuckerberg said that Facebook would play its part in the fight against global terrorism, but that weakening the digital security of technology companies was a bad idea.\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, in reference to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook.While these companies have said they would comply, when legally obliged to, with handing over information on their users, they say they believe that creating technological back doors to their digital systems can lead to potential abuse by governments worldwide.For Facebook, which has almost 1.6 billion global users, the encryption debate is only one of the growing number of policy hurdles that the company needs to overcome as it expands its global presence.Speaking on Monday, Mr. Zuckerberg said his company wanted to offer Internet connectivity to the developing world that did not have digital access and that Facebook would look for ways to continue doing that in India and beyond.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to the mission that we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said about the recent decision in India that outlawed Free Basics. \u201cWhat works in one country may not work in another.\u201dDespite his attempts to downplay the setback, the recent decision by Indian regulators has put Facebook and its 31-year-old chief executive in an unusual position in the debate over net neutrality, which says that Internet providers should provide equal access to all web content. In the United States, Facebook has been a proponent of net neutrality.Internet giants like Facebook and Google can expect more scrutiny around the world as they continue to expand, said Pierre Louette, a deputy chief executive of Orange, the former French telecommunications monopoly. When confronted with this scrutiny, he added, tech companies may look to build bridges with traditional telecom operators that have faced similar regulatory challenges for decades.\u201cThey need more friends than before,\u201d said Mr. Louette, in reference to global tech companies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Post-Cubicle Office and Its Discontents", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueBeige partitions have given way to napping lofts, lunch gazebos and lots of open space. But are employees any happier or more productive?Supported byBut these days, to lament cubicles is to miss the point. Looking at the most sophisticated office spaces is to see that the lessons of Roethke and Bartleby \u2014 the design lessons, at any rate \u2014 have been learned. The offices of the ad agency Hi-ReS! in Berlin, designed by the German architecture firm Studio A/S, are painted garish colors \u2014 the workplace analogue of sucking on a Gobstopper \u2014 and crammed with a variety of spaces. No one sits in little cubicles: After a conference at a yellow table, you might climb a red ladder to a small loft, snuggling up against pillows while flicking through emails or furtively napping. The headquarters for the mobile-gaming company King, maker of Candy Crush Saga, is similarly brash and childlike, its employees working among brightly colored pink and green partitions and lunching under yellow-and-white gazebos. At the highest end, big-name architects treat the office like some spacecraft landed from the future. Zaha Hadid\u2019s plans for a research center for Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, explode the usual boxy building envelope in favor of a network of woozily distorted honeycomb cells.Over the last century, the office has been continually improved upon, in an attempt to make it work better and be a better place to work. But the whimsy and extravagance of the contemporary office is something new. Even when they were luxurious, the early offices of the 20th century were never wacky. Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Larkin Administration Building from 1906 contained a soaring central light court and recreation rooms for its largely female staff: amenities that were unheard-of at the time. But no one was encouraged to take naps; there were no secret doors leading to interior \u2018\u2018speakeasies,\u2019\u2019 like the one at LinkedIn\u2019s offices in New York. Early offices were designed to extract relentless productivity from workers. The prodigal offices of today are the logical endpoint of a decades-long backlash against this way of thinking.The influential American management theorist Frederick Winslow Taylor was the first to apply the principles of efficiency to office design. W. H. Leffingwell, a Taylor disciple, suggested in his treatise \u2018\u2018Scientific Office Management\u2019\u2019 (1917) that a poorly placed water fountain could lead to unnecessary miles being walked by an average worker \u2014 which, multiplied by many workers over 52 workweeks, might mean tens of thousands of miles of wasted steps. Taylorist offices consisted of serried rows of desks, perfectly arranged to facilitate the flow of bodies through space. It was a model of existence that, like a hectoring fitness app, reduced human beings to bundles of numbers.Workers, unsurprisingly, hated these spaces and in the 1930s began to voice their grievances. The first strike in book publishing took place in the 1930s, and around the same time the staff of The New Republic unionized. The workers weren\u2019t, of course, striking for better design, but it was better design that they got, along with more \u2018\u2018caring\u2019\u2019 corporate policies: pensions, company picnics and, during the postwar boom, a significant and steady increase in salaries. A reaction against the factorylike office set in among planners and designers: Rather than treat its workers like machines, an office should cater to their psychology.What followed, in the postwar decades, was the era of the glass-and-steel, air-conditioned box. Now ubiquitous and unremarkable, they were at the time considered architectural and design marvels. Descriptions of life in these companies sound conspicuously like the Googles and Facebooks of today: \u2018\u2018Imagine a sea of blond desks with tan chairs, outdoor lighting pouring in everywhere, roomy offices with individually controlled air-conditioning and area-controlled Music by Muzak coming out of the walls.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s from Alan Harrington\u2019s \u2018\u2018Life in the Crystal Palace,\u2019\u2019 a rueful account of life in a wealthy suburban corporation in the mid-1950s. \u2018\u2018At noon, enjoy movies in an auditorium the size of a small theater, visit the library, watch the World Series on color TV or play darts and table tennis in the game room.\u2019\u2019 Harrington, a quintessential and self-conscious \u2018\u2018organization man,\u2019\u2019 spends a lot of time wondering whether these initiatives sap, rather than encourage, creativity.Lennee in Talinn, Estonia, designed by Kamp Architecture.Attempts to improve the office resulted in some significant innovations, like coordinating furniture design with the architecture of a space. But there were some impressive failures, too. The most infamous was the standard cubicle: Invented by the furniture company Herman Miller in the 1960s, it quickly became a company\u2019s favorite design tool for squeezing more people into less space for as little money as possible (until they were laid off). By the 1990s, thanks above all to the comic strip \u2018\u2018Dilbert,\u2019\u2019 which debuted in 1989, it had become the classic symbol of a stymied white-collar existence \u2014 a source of the so-called cubicle rage that supposedly led to workplace shootings.The sudden efflorescence of the tech industry in the late \u201990s took us from the desert of cubicles to the milk-and-honey offices of today. Many of the dot-commers had graduated from (or, very often, dropped out of) cozy university campuses to toil in big corporations. Starting their own companies, they recreated the effortless drift between work and play that characterized their college lives. The cubicle walls came down, and in the wide, open warehouse and loft spaces they occupied, exceptionally long workdays would be punctuated by frenzied Mario Kart races or fierce Ping-Pong battles. Creating a playful office became one of the standard ways of attracting skilled employees in a competitive environment: The hope was that a talented engineer wouldn\u2019t leave a tech behemoth for the dinky start-up next door that didn\u2019t have a gym and a resistance pool. Thus has the \u2018\u2018fun office\u2019\u2019 spread throughout the world.Studio A/S, the German design firm, captures the zeitgeist in describing its aims: \u2018\u2018Generation Y\u2019\u2019 is searching for \u2018\u2018greater meaning\u2019\u2019 from office design; a new generation \u2018\u2018wants poetry, form and atmosphere\u2019\u2019 in its workplaces. The design firm Teknion uses the word \u2018\u2018ethonomics\u2019\u2019 to describe the principles that ought to apply to the contemporary office. The idea is that design \u2014 by softly coercing people into walking more and being more active, incorporating nature through bountiful plants and better lighting and creating environments that evoke many different textures and moods through the use of varied materials \u2014 can help foster the new \u2018\u2018ethical workplace.\u2019\u2019Office design concerned with employees\u2019 happiness, well-being, instincts for play \u2014 this ought to be the best of all possible worlds. There is no question that such offices look vastly more inviting than your average cubicle farm; it\u2019s not surprising that so many companies seek to emulate them. Yet the \u2018\u2018disruptive\u2019\u2019 thinking that insists a workplace ought to care not just for your average needs (supplies, potable coffee, a microwave) but for your deepest psychological ones as well has its insidious side. If the new workplace technology makes it impossible to leave work at work, the \u2018\u2018ethonomic\u2019\u2019 thinking behind new workplace design is intended to make it increasingly difficult to separate our work lives from everything else. The sociologist William Davies has dubbed this complex of ideas \u2018\u2018the happiness industry,\u2019\u2019 wherein your most private emotions and \u2014 through the introduction of \u2018\u2018wellness\u2019\u2019 programs at work \u2014 even your health are now intimate concerns of your boss. One of the most popular and cited gurus of the new workplace, Tony Hsieh, the C.E.O. of Zappos, has argued that companies ought to employ \u2018\u2018chief happiness officers\u2019\u2019 to ensure enthusiasm at the office. He has also suggested that they regularly identify the 10 percent of workers who share the least enthusiasm for the \u2018\u2018happiness agenda\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and fire them.Ultimately it\u2019s not clear whether the new offices work in the way they\u2019re advertised. Even when common spaces are covered over in beautiful, bright plywood paneling, as with Lenne in Tallinn, Estonia, the actual desks are often in open-plan setups. The move to take people out of private offices, the better to improve collaboration and productivity, has little empirical justification. Most widely cited studies of employee satisfaction tend to run against such trends in office design. A study from The Journal of Environmental Psychology in 2013 indicated that 50 percent of workers in open-plan spaces suffer from a lack of sound privacy, and 30 percent complain about a lack of visual privacy.In 1980, the futurologist Alvin Toffler predicted that with increases in telecommuting technology, offices would soon become irrelevant. Downtowns would be emptied, and everyone would be connected through \u2018\u2018electronic cottages\u2019\u2019 dispersed throughout the countryside. Digital advances in the years since have constantly threatened to make Toffler\u2019s fanciful vision a real one. It has come true in one sense: We do often work at home. But we also work at work, before going home to work more. Commuting and telecommuting exist in an unholy alliance. The office has persisted, becoming even bigger, weirder, stranger: a symbol of its outsize presence in our lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Free Tools to Keep Those Creepy Online Ads From Watching You", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byTech FixSAY you\u2019re doing a web search on something like the flu. The next thing you know, an ad for a flu remedy pops up on your web browser, or your video streaming service starts playing a commercial for Tylenol.The content of those ads is no coincidence. Digital ads are able to follow people around the Internet because advertisers often place invisible trackers on the websites you visit. Their goal is to collect details on everywhere you go on the Internet and use that data to serve targeted ads to your computer, smartphone and connected television.This global commercial surveillance of consumers is poised to become more extensive as tech companies expand into the Internet of Things, a category that includes wearable computers and connected home appliances like smart thermostats and refrigerators. Amazon, eBay, Facebook and Google can already follow users from device to device because people log in to their services with the same IDs on various gadgets.\u201cOur privacy is completely under assault with all these connected devices,\u201d said Jeremiah Grossman, the founder of WhiteHat Security, a web security firm.Here\u2019s how web tracking works: In general, targeting individuals with digital ads involves a sophisticated ecosystem of third parties \u2014 like online advertising networks, data brokers and analytics companies \u2014 that compile information on consumers.When you visit websites, these companies typically pick out your browser or phone using technologies like cookies, which contain unique alphanumeric identification tags that can enable trackers to identify your activities as you move from site to site. To sell ads delivered to certain categories of consumers, like suburban singles looking for romance, companies may sync these ID tags to pinpoint individuals.The downside is, your browsing history may contain sensitive information about your health concerns, political affiliations, family problems, religious beliefs or sexual habits.The tracker busters generally work in similar ways. You download and install an add-on for a web browser like Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. The anti-tracking companies each compile a list of known web domains that serve trackers or show patterns of tracking services. Then when someone connects to a website, the tools prevent the browser from loading any element that matches their blacklist.Scott Meyer, the chief executive of Ghostery, said this had been a deliberate design choice. When trackers are blocked, parts of websites may not function, so it is less confusing to let users experiment and decide which ones to block on their own, he said.\u201cWe block nothing by default,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s in direct contrast to other companies who are saying, \u2018We\u2019re turning everything off and let you turn whatever you want back on.\u2019 That\u2019s way too complex for users.\u201d\u201cWhen you go home, you lock the door and you may pull down the shades at night,\u201d said Abhay Edlabadkar, the chief executive of RedMorph. \u201cYou should have the same level of privacy control over your Internet activities.\u201dIn our tests, RedMorph was the most thorough with blocking trackers. It blocked 22 of them on USAToday.com, whereas Privacy Badger blocked seven, Disconnect blocked eight and Ghostery detected eight.But in the process, RedMorph caused the most collateral damage. It blocked some videos on the websites for CNN, USA Today, Bleacher Report, The New York Times and The Daily News. It also broke the recommended reading list on Business Insider and a Twitter box on BuzzFeed. For people who run into issues loading websites, the company offers an \u201cEasy Fix\u201d button to stop blocking a website\u2019s trackers, but that\u2019s hardly an ideal solution when it causes so many websites to malfunction. Mr. Edlabadkar of RedMorph said the tool was blocking some videos or recommended reading lists because they were loading only after a tracker had been loaded first.\u201cWe really focus on privacy rather than blocking ads that are done in a respectful way,\u201d said Casey Oppenheim, the chief executive of Disconnect. \u201cIt\u2019s important we have the ability for publishers to survive and make money. I think there\u2019s a middle ground.\u201dIn the end, we picked Disconnect as our favorite tool because it was the easiest to understand. It organizes the types of tracking requests it is blocking into different categories: advertising, analytics, social media and content.Mr. Grossman of WhiteHat Security also tested tracking blockers and chose Disconnect for similar reasons. He breaks his online activities into two separate web browsers to make himself more difficult to track: On one browser, he does everyday tasks like reading news articles; on the other browser he logs into accounts that are linked to his personal identity, like online banking sites and Amazon.\u201cWe\u2019re talking megabillion-dollar industries totally designed to track you online,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

DUTIES MAY INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: \u2022 Conducting estate tours of 10 people \u2014 and no more \u2014 from the small library to the big library to the drawing room to the smoking room to \u2026 you get the idea. \u2022 Positioning a servant in each room to keep peasants from walking off with \u201cthe odd first edition.\u201d\u2022 Pretending that the house in question is genuinely cozy. (At night, maybe.) \u2022 Devising new security strategies to prevent cheeky rascals from slipping upstairs and disturbing the ulcerous lord of the manor with troublesome questions about his place in the social order. \u2022 Coping with distraught grandmothers who react to their charitable disenfranchisement by screaming things like \u201cI do not wish to see her face until I am used to seeing a traitor in the family.\u201d \u2022 Pointing out to aforementioned grandmother that she might have phrased that last bit better.\u2022 Reassuring occupants of said house that they are not Belgians waiting for the invasion or monkeys in a zoo and most definitely not fat ladies in a circus.QUALIFICATIONS:\u2022 Must be able to string velvet rope across staircases in back wing. \u2022 Must have a better handle on the estate\u2019s history than its current owners. For instance, candidate must know more about the architect than \u201cHe built lots of lovely big buildings,\u201d and if the estate is called, let us say, an abbey, candidate must grasp why it is so called.TO APPLY:Please present your qualifications to Mr. Bertie Pelham, late of Brancaster. Do not \u2014 repeat, do not \u2014 approach the butler, who will tell you that you are \u201ca dangerous precedent\u201d and \u201ca guillotine in Trafalgar Square\u201d and \u201can affront to the law of property, which is the cornerstone of any\u201d \u2026 you get the idea.So it seems entirely fitting that, in the show\u2019s final episodes, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d should turn its gaze back on us.\u201cThere\u2019s a curiosity about these places,\u201d suggests the tourism impresario Tom Branson. \u201cAbout this way of life.\u201d The Crawleys, though, are baffled by the idea of opening their doors to the curious. \u201cWhy should anyone pay to see a perfectly ordinary house?\u201d wonders the dowager countess.\u201cTo charge money so people can snoop around our home,\u201d sniffs Robert. \u201cWhat a revolting suggestion.\u201d The Crawleys can\u2019t grasp that they have graduated \u2014 or devolved \u2014 from power to spectacle.And what better confirmation than that little boy (\u201cBring all the family!\u201d) blundering into the Earl\u2019s bedroom as though Lord G. were the second half of a double feature. The Grantham dynasty has become the Grantham show, and we pay our sixpence every week.And with it, we bring certain expectations, which Baron Fellowes is taking a perverse 11th-hour pleasure in flouting. Remember dear sweet Carson? Downstairs patriarch? Second father to Lady Mary? Flustered, endearing suitor of Mrs. Hughes? It seems we must now accept an alternative reality in which he is a prat and a schmuck and very possibly the worst late-in-life husband that a sensible woman could find herself saddled with.No satisfying the man! The coffee\u2019s not up to snuff. The smoked salmon doesn\u2019t have lemon or horseradish. Let\u2019s bring in a hall boy for polishing and a maid for the beds because \u201cI do like those sharp corners.\u201d (I have just the sharp corners in mind.) Oh, and let\u2019s not drink wine with dinner because \u201csomehow it feels disloyal\u201d to the master of the house. It won\u2019t be too long, I fear, before Mrs. H. explodes like one of the Earl\u2019s ulcers.The most surprising consequence of Carson\u2019s smugness and complacency is to make \u2014 and who would have imagined? \u2014 a martyr of Hissing Thomas. \u201cYou are the under-butler,\u201d declares Carson, \u201ca post that is fragrant with memories of a lost world, and no one is sorrier to say that than I am. But you\u2019re not a creature of today.\u201dThing is, Barrow is awfully sweet with little Georgie and the girls (creatures of tomorrow) and he\u2019s awfully unhappy about leaving Downton, so is it too much to ask that he become the world\u2019s first manny? Or else an English as a first language instructor for the likes of Andy? Oh, I know Barrow has sown evil in his day, but, to borrow a phrase from Jessica Rabbit, he\u2019s not bad, he\u2019s just drawn that way.As for Lady Mary, just which way is she drawn? She has made a conquest of Henry Talbot, who, under the impetus of London\u2019s most sudden rainstorm ever, admits: \u201cI know I\u2019m not what you\u2019re after. My prospects are modest at best, and you, well, you\u2019re a great catch. But you\u2019re also a woman that I happen to be falling in love with. Gosh, that sounds rather feeble doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d answers Mary. \u201cAs an argument, I think it\u2019s rather compelling.\u201dAnd in case you think that her dissertation-defense-committee response belies a heart that thrums beneath, I refer you to: 1) the look of zero-Kelvin triumph in Mary\u2019s eyes as she steers Henry T. out of that restaurant (under the chagrined gaze of Evelyn Napier); 2) the slightly incredulous \u201cI thought I was going to have to dress myself\u201d when Anna returns late from a doctor\u2019s appointment; and 3) the Vince Lombardi bark of \u201cThis is weakling talk\u201d when her mother raises the possibility of the Crawleys one day leaving the Abbey.I fully expected Cora to drop and do 50, but I\u2019m still not sure what to expect of Lady Mary. She may have found the man of her dreams, but what if she\u2019s a woman of no dreams? Is there anything in that heart but sharp corners?\u201cI\u2019ve had one career already,\u201d she says: \u201cbringing up my daughters. They don\u2019t need me now, so I\u2019m ready for the next.\u201d And when her husband resists the idea of her running the hospital, she reminds him, \u201cI\u2019m not old, Robert.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were,\u201d he remonstrates.\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d she answers.Elizabeth McGovern has made no secret of how constricting she\u2019s found the part of Cora, but I continue to believe she\u2019s essential to the show: the root note of the chord.Department of other stuff \u2026\u2022 If Edith doesn\u2019t have her own maid, who does her hair?\u2022 I didn\u2019t think I could be any more done with Daisy, and yet it seems I can. What a bee-yotch she\u2019s being to Mrs. Patmore! Slandering the good woman\u2019s name and hiding Mr. Mason\u2019s letter and doing everything she can to stand in the way of love. I pray that she will be pelted with farm-fresh vegetables.\u2022 Abbots, didn\u2019t we just stick a fork in the Peter Coyle plotline? Baxter can\u2019t really be planning to visit him in jail? The only consolation is that this case can\u2019t possibly drag out as long as Mr. Green\u2019s.\u2022 Awfully creepy moment when Lord G. suggested giving visitors a gander at Lady Mary in her bath. Even Carson was thrown for a loop. I did love the bit, though, where the Earl, reclining in the baronial splendor of his bedchamber, intones, \u201cSometimes in life sacrifices have to be made.\u201d P. G.

Presses Congress to Settle iPhone Privacy Fight", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byOther technology companies \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo \u2014 also moved to throw their weight behind Apple in court. The companies said they planned to file one or more briefs backing Apple next week in federal court in California.\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said in a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201dThe fight is an important moment in the growing tension between tech companies that have access to huge amounts of private customer data and the government, which has long sought greater access to that information. Apple has said customer data must remain accessible only to customers to protect their civil liberties. Law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey say that increasingly robust encryption technology is hurting their ability to fight criminals.The case may eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said, \u201cWe would be prepared to take this issue all the way.\u201dIn Apple\u2019s formal response to the court on Thursday, which was filed a day ahead of a Friday deadline, the company said the court should drop its order because it oversteps an existing law known as the All Writs Act, as well as Apple\u2019s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\u201cApple strongly supports, and will continue to support, the efforts of law enforcement in pursuing justice against terrorists and other criminals \u2014 just as it has in this case and many others,\u201d the company said in its filing, known as a motion to vacate. \u201cBut the unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution.\u201dApple added that the order had broad implications that would \u201cinflict significant harm \u2014 to civil liberties, society and national security \u2014 and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.\u201dA Justice Department spokeswoman said investigators had long held the power to secure court orders that compel outside parties like Apple to assist with search warrants.\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same,\u201d said Melanie Newman, the department spokeswoman. \u201cThe change has come in Apple\u2019s recent decision to reverse its longstanding cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders.\u201dApple also argued that if the government forced it to create new code to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino gunman, that would amount to \u201ccompelled speech and viewpoint discrimination,\u201d both of which are violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. The company also said the court order violated the company\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process because it deprives Apple of the right to be free from \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by government.Legal experts said it was unlikely that a judge would rely on constitutional arguments to make a decision in this early stage. \u201cBut given the likelihood that this will move to an appeals court and even further, Apple needs to include all of its arguments in the lower court if it wants to raise them again in a higher court,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.Even as Apple was preparing to formally respond to the court, other technology companies \u2014 which have until now been cautious in their support of Apple \u2014 were preparing to be more forceful in court. Earlier Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, speaking at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, said the software maker would file a brief backing Apple next week.Mr. Smith in particular took aim at the All Writs Act, which was passed in its current form in 1911, as being too antiquated to be used now in situations with modern technology. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, he placed on a table an adding machine from the early 1900s that he had purchased on eBay.\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.Press officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter confirmed that the tech companies would be filing a joint brief supporting Apple. Yahoo said it also would file a brief.\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.It is unlikely that a divided, gridlocked Congress will offer clear answers to questions about security and privacy anytime soon. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey on Thursday said that they weren\u2019t sure where to draw the line between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement.Obama administration officials had drafted legislation in 2011 that sought to address the privacy issues now being raised, but the proposals were effectively shelved after the former government contractor Edward J.

{"Headline": "U.S. Asks Tech and Entertainment Industries Help in Fighting Terrorism", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byObama administration officials met with executives of major technology and entertainment companies in Washington on Wednesday to discuss combating the activities of violent extremists online, according to industry and government officials.The meeting was called by the White House, according to a person who attended and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The session began with government officials admitting their shortcomings in tackling the explosion of activity by terrorist groups online.John P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, started the meeting by saying that federal law enforcement had struggled to reach audiences that were responding to recruitment by violent extremists, according to the participant. Nick Rasmussen, director of the national counterterrorism center, lauded some social media platforms for aggressively taking down accounts of suspected terrorists.The hourslong meeting, which took place at the Justice Department, also included speeches by Megan Smith, the national chief technology officer; and Jen Easterly, the senior director for counterterrorism.The event was another step toward coordinating government and private sector efforts on national security. After the mass shootings in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., last year, the White House and presidential candidates have pushed for Internet firms to clamp down on the use of social media by extremists to recruit new members, organize and broadcast their demands.Wednesday\u2019s gathering was attended by company executives but few, if any, chief executives. Participants included representatives from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr and Microsoft.Many of the tech companies are willing to work on ways to combat violent extremism on social media. The meeting on Wednesday, called the \u201cMadison Valleywood Project,\u201d in reference to the participation of marketing, tech and entertainment firms, focused on terrorists\u2019 use of social media to organize and recruit members for violent extremism.The subject of encryption and Apple\u2019s resistance to being ordered to break through its encrypted software for law enforcement was not on the agenda.\u201cOver the past year, organizations and companies across a range of industries have asked how they might contribute to efforts to counter radicalization and recruitment activities by ISIL and other violent extremists,\u201d said Marc Raimondi, the Justice Department\u2019s national security spokesman, using a term for the Islamic State.\u201cThe U.S. government recognizes that these private sector actors, which include N.G.O.s, social media companies and content producers, have a crucial role to play in developing creative and effective ways to undermine terrorist recruiting and counter the call to violence,\u201d Mr. Raimondi said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Still Holds the Keys to Its Cloud Service, but Reluctantly", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byIn Silicon Valley \u2014 if not Washington \u2014 Apple is being hailed for digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in gaining access to an an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.But while company executives have embraced the notion that Apple is no longer able to intervene for law enforcement when investigators want access to an iPhone, it has repeatedly cooperated with court orders for access to online services like its iCloud.That may sound like hypocrisy, but to people familiar with how Apple\u2019s products and services work, it is simply a matter of technology.ICloud is an Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices. It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement \u2014 as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed.Every few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.In its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.Apple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.But the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple\u2019s cooperation and its resistance is \u201ctechnically able.\u201dIn the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.ICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.There are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.It is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company\u2019s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.That could include iCloud, if Apple can figure out a consumer-friendly way to keep the data under lock and key \u2014 a key Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to use \u2014 without making it inconvenient for people who need to retrieve backups.That is no simple feat. Apple would have to find a way to let users retrieve their own data safely even without the company\u2019s help, while keeping out hackers and other sorts of data thieves.None of this iCloud discussion would apply to iMessage, Apple\u2019s proprietary text messaging service. It uses technology called end-to-end encryption, which means messages sent using iMessage cannot be intercepted and decrypted. Only the sender and receiver, not Apple, have the keys to read such messages. Apple retains encrypted iMessages on its servers until they are read by the user or expire after several days.For now, the best bet to protect your personal information from snoops may be to keep it off iCloud \u2014 and the many, many apps that may pass or store unencrypted information through data centers. It is safer on your device.Just try not to drop your phone in a swimming pool.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking iPhone Data, Through the Front Door", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsTHE government and Apple have chosen interesting ground on which to contest the limits of government access to data on mobile devices. The case involves an F.B.I. request for Apple\u2019s assistance in opening a phone once carried by Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife was responsible for the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., that left 14 dead and 22 wounded.On one level, this should be comfortable space for the government. First, the phone is owned by the County of San Bernardino, which issued it to Mr. Farook, an employee of its health department. The county, as Apple\u2019s customer, has no problem having its phone opened. Second, Mr. Farook and his wife were killed in a gun battle with the police early last December. Under the law, dead people have no privacy rights.But Apple is making a stand because the government wants it to create something against its will: code that would disable a feature that erases all content after 10 failed password attempts. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said that if this happens, the floodgates will open to similar law enforcement requests, putting customers\u2019 data at risk. And not just in the United States: Apple supporters have raised concerns that other countries, particularly China and Russia, are likely to follow suit.Mr. Cook\u2019s position is hyperbolic, in our view. But beyond the legal case, there is an ethics issue unfolding here.Until 17 months ago, Apple held the key that could override protections and open phones. Apple used this \u201cmaster key\u201d to comply with court orders in drug, kidnapping, murder and terrorism cases. There was no documented instance of this code getting out to hackers or to the government. So what was the problem Apple was trying to fix when it abruptly announced, in September 2014, that with its new iOS 8, \u201cApple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants\u201d?Some believe that allegations by Edward J. Snowden of mass surveillance of phone and Internet communications by the National Security Agency stoked fears among Apple\u2019s customers that the government was spying on them. Perhaps an iPhone that even Apple couldn\u2019t unlock might allay such fears, while also helping sales by offering more privacy and security.But Mr. Snowden claimed that the N.S.A. was capturing some Americans\u2019 Internet traffic from overseas, not that the agency was hacking into smartphones. Moreover, Apple\u2019s position on privacy seems at odds with its own strategy of encouraging customers to pay to store personal data on iCloud, which is also vulnerable to hackers.Apple partisans also argue that the company is trying to protect privacy in places like China, where governments could demand access to phones belonging to dissidents. But Apple could refuse those requests, or have China make them through the State Department, a means of insulating itself from unreasonable demands. That is often how the United States asks for assistance from overseas corporations in investigations.Apple and privacy advocates have framed this debate as the government wanting to \u201ccreate a back door\u201d into people\u2019s devices. But the Constitution protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. And for more than 200 years, the standard has been for law enforcement to obtain a warrant signed by a judge, based on probable cause.What the government is actually requesting here is that Apple restore a key that was available until late 2014. Complying with constitutionally legal court orders is not \u201ccreating a back door\u201d; in a democracy, that is a front door.Mr. Cook says Apple\u2019s ultimate goal is to provide customers \u201csafety\u201d from \u201cattack.\u201d But Mr. Cook does not seem to be talking about the kind of attack that took 14 lives in San Bernardino. Presumably, he means attacks from hackers or what he may view as government intrusion \u2014 even when that intrusion is legal.The phone in the San Bernardino case stopped uploading data to the cloud about six weeks before the killings. That suggests there may be information inside the device that was deliberately concealed. That could include the identities of terrorists who influenced or directed the attack; such information, if pursued, could prevent future plots. Or the iPhone might contain nothing of value. It is Apple\u2019s position that we should never know.The ramifications of this fight extend beyond San Bernardino. Brittany Mills was a 29-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered in Baton Rouge, La. Apple says it can\u2019t comply with a search warrant and open her iPhone even though the police believe the identity of the killer is contained in her device.Ms. Mills was an Apple customer. So were some of the people who died with iPhones in their pockets in the San Bernardino and Paris attacks. How is not solving a murder, or not finding the message that might stop the next terrorist attack, protecting anyone?Google, which owns the Android system, now indicates that it will follow Apple\u2019s lead. For those companies, and others like them, there is a sound argument in not wanting, even indirectly, to become an arm of the government. But when you are the two companies whose operating systems handle more than 90 percent of mobile communications worldwide, you should be accountable for more than just sales.William J. Bratton is the New York City police commissioner and John J. Miller is the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and intelligence.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Up Lessons From the Once-Again Hot Field of A.I.", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byBitsIn 2010, Kris Hammond, an experienced artificial intelligence researcher, and a few partners founded Narrative Science. The Chicago start-up\u2019s software ingests and interprets numbers for things like investment holdings, billing records and sports statistics and transforms them into written summaries or stories.From the outset, the company\u2019s technology was promising, but the timing was tricky. It opened its doors the year before IBM\u2019s Watson publicly demonstrated the potential of machine intelligence with its \u201cJeopardy!\u201d victory.\u201cAt the start, we didn\u2019t call it artificial intelligence because A.I. was still in disrepute,\u201d recalled Mr. Hammond, chief scientist for Narrative Science.Today, a start-up that can lay claim to doing artificial intelligence has increased its odds of getting attention and funding. A.I. efforts, scientists agree, are far more advanced than in past boom and bust cycles for this type of technology.Yet if the technology seems almost magical at times, success, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs say, will rely on basic business virtues like focus, flexibility, speed and resilience.That is particularly true for start-ups. \u201cBig companies like Google can make A.I. investments with a 10-year horizon, but a start-up has to release a product in a year or two,\u201d said Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.In past cycles, research advances in A.I. generated excitement but not much business. \u201cIt was a long, long way from being practical,\u201d said Forest Baskett, a computer scientist and partner at New Enterprise Associates. \u201cWhat makes it investable now is there are applications, things you can do with these tools.\u201dThe technical ingredients behind modern A.I., he noted, were vast new sources of data, machine-learning software and powerful, inexpensive computing delivered over the so-called computing cloud.When asked about investable applications in N.E.A.\u2019s portfolio, Mr. Baskett pointed to three examples that exploit data and machine-learning: DataRobot, which evaluates math models to predict which will work best on a particular kind of data; Dato, whose machine-learning tools analyze the graphs of online users\u2019 social connections; and Qbotix, which makes specialized robots for optimally tilting and maintaining the panels that absorb the sun\u2019s rays on solar farms.\u201cToday, we can measure so much more,\u201d Mr. Baskett said.His comment underlines the fact that there is no bright line separating big data analytics and A.I. In both cases, data is the fuel and machine-learning algorithms are the engine of pattern recognition and classification. Yet A.I. technology, propelled by advances in so-called deep-learning techniques, is moving up the ladder of perception, becoming far better at mimicking the humanlike tasks of seeing and hearing \u2014 image recognition and speech recognition, in computing terms.Cognitive Scale concentrates on short sprints with small teams, getting a working application up and running within 90 days. Speed to market is its product. Cognitive Scale is working first with customers in the health care, finance and retailing industries.\u201cOur approach is small bets, brought to market quickly for better decisions and better customer engagement in your industry,\u201d said Mr. Saxena, the chairman. \u201cWe bring practical A.I. into businesses.\u201dWhat the market wants has been the lesson learned at Narrative Science. Its founding team included professors from Northwestern University\u2019s computer science and journalism departments.A Pulitzer Prize is still a worthy, if more distant, goal, Mr. Hammond said recently. But Narrative Science, which is growing briskly and has 80 employees, has built its business outside the financially challenged news media industry.Its 70 customers are mainly in mainstream businesses like financial services and consulting, including Nuveen, USAA, Credit Suisse and Deloitte, which use the Narrative Science software to generate reports that explain the numbers in investment portfolios, trading records and market statistics.Advertisement"}

Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers.\u201cScience fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free,\u201d said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses.Much of the action in the book takes place inside the Oasis, a global virtual reality network. Characters in the network attend school, socialize and take part in a high-stakes treasure hunt. Through virtual reality, they can inhabit the perspectives of actors in classic movies.\u201cOne of the things I like about \u2018Ready Player One\u2019 is all of the depictions in the book are pretty feasible,\u201d Mr. Luckey said. \u201cNone of it is crazy, far-out tech.\u201dOculus gave out 3,000 copies of the book to attendees of an Oculus developer conference last year. For good measure, Oculus named the meeting rooms at its headquarters after famous fictional versions of virtual reality, including the holodeck, the Oasis and the Matrix, from the movie of the same name and, before that, William Gibson\u2019s \u201cNeuromancer.\u201dMr. Cline said he wrote \u201cReady Player One\u201d partly because he could not figure out why virtual reality had not taken off in the real world.But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace \u2014 and often someone \u2014 they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters.In an interview, Mr. Stephenson \u2014 whose title is chief futurist \u2014 declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several \u201ccontent projects\u201d underway at the company.More broadly, Mr. Stephenson said science fiction books and movies are often useful within tech companies for rallying employees around a shared vision.\u201cMy theory is that science fiction can actually have some value in that it gets everyone on the same page without the kind of expensive and tedious process of PowerPoint,\u201d he said. But the influence of the genre within tech companies is \u201csurprising and mysterious to me as well,\u201d he added.There is a regular theme in science fiction that its fans in tech talk less about, though: the dystopian aspects of virtual reality. Addiction, disconnection from relationships in the real world and alienation from the environment are often side effects in narratives about virtual reality. It\u2019s hard to make that into a selling point for the technology.\u201cEntrepreneurs are optimistic and upbeat by nature, which is why I enjoy hanging around with them,\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an admirable ability to completely ignore the more dystopian elements you\u2019re talking about and see the cool stuff and positive potential of where it might go.\u201dOf course, authors and moviemakers get to overlook details of their own \u2014 like the tough technological challenges that real tech companies face.\u201cYou never have to reboot the damned thing\u201d in sci-fi books, said Genevieve Bell, a cultural anthropologist who works at Intel and has written about the interplay between technology and science fiction. \u201cThe mechanics are less interesting to most science fiction writers than the experience.\u201dSometimes science fiction plants seeds in the minds of inventors that take years to sprout. The holographic chess game that Chewbacca played on a tabletop aboard the Millennium Falcon was pretty far-out in the 1970s, when Jeri Ellsworth saw it in the original \u201cStar Wars.\u201d It took decades for technology to catch up.In 2013, Ms. Ellsworth\u2019s start-up, CastAR, gave the first public demonstration of the company\u2019s augmented reality glasses, which overlay digital imagery on the user\u2019s view of the real world.\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been dreaming about my entire life,\u201d Ms. Ellsworth said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It\u2019s Really Like to Risk It All in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byBefore Nathalie Miller decided to walk away from Instacart, the grocery delivery start-up now worth more than $2 billion, she made a spreadsheet to analyze how much money she was leaving on the table.She had been Instacart\u2019s 20th employee, managing operations during a period of extremely rapid growth, and the sum could have been huge. She quit anyway. Like many strivers in Silicon Valley, she had a bigger plan: to start her own company that could not only make millions, but also fulfill a mission she believed in.Then, six months later, Ms. Miller discovered that she was pregnant with her first child. A baby wasn\u2019t something she and her husband, Isaak Le, had been planning quite yet, but they were excited. Still, a sliver of doubt began to undercut her confidence about starting her own company. \u201cHow high can I stack the cards against myself \u2014 a pregnant brown woman?\u201d said Ms. Miller, who is of Vietnamese and European descent.Silicon Valley can seem like the land of overnight success. College dropouts show up and become billionaires a few years later. Mark Zuckerberg was a billionaire by the time he was 23, and Facebook paid $19 billion for WhatsApp when it was just five years old.But despite their hold on the imagination, these examples aren\u2019t typical. Much more representative are the companies you never hear about because they never get off the ground.In recent months, the fund-raising atmosphere has cooled as venture capitalists react to the poor stock market performance of some public tech companies and question whether the recent fast pace of investment is sustainable. Venture capitalists are making fewer investments at lower valuations.Nonetheless, Silicon Valley keeps seducing people. For those who come, the risk is worth the potential reward \u2014 not just riches, but also the more dreamy belief that tech entrepreneurialism is a force for good. Ms. Miller was not immune.\u201cI want Doxa to exist in the world,\u201d she told me in July, \u201cbecause it will make the world a better place.\u201dMs. Miller, who turns 34 on Sunday, grew up in Berkeley, and after graduating from Harvard, moved to Vietnam. There, she started a microfinance nonprofit, expanding it to 92 employees. When she returned to the United States, she began a doctorate program in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, but was soon drawn into the tech industry.She joined Instacart in 2013, and saw some of tech\u2019s biggest challenges firsthand. In a year, the company grew to 120 employees from 20, and had 4,000 independent contractors. Hiring well at that kind of speed, she found, is hard to get right.Ms. Miller also experienced the challenges of being a woman in tech. One day, a new employee told her that he had ranked the hottest women at the company, and she was No. 1. She reported the comment to managers, and the employee was fired the next day.Though she was satisfied with Instacart\u2019s response, she knew women in many industries faced much worse, and started ruminating about how she could change workplace culture more broadly.That is when she came up with Doxa. The name comes from a Greek term that sociologists use to describe the things that people take for granted but that don\u2019t necessarily have to be that way.The idea was for a site that would collect data about the sorts of things applicants really want to know but don\u2019t ask in job interviews: Do you feel as if co-workers value your opinions? Do people actually take their vacation days? How often do you work nights and weekends? It would offer online personality tests, then use psychometric data to match candidates with employers more effectively. It would make money from companies paying for information about candidates and to post job ads, as they do on LinkedIn. Sam Meder, who had run engineering at a start-up acquired by Pinterest, agreed to start it with her.Ms. Miller thought Doxa could help by offering data that research shows is important to women \u2014 the gender pay gap and the percentage of women on the executive team \u2014 as well as factors like whether women felt they were given credit for their ideas. But first, she needed to raise money.Venture capitalists, who hold the keys to success in Silicon Valley by providing start-up money, are even more likely to be white and male than tech company employees are. Theirs is an insular business. Most investors accept pitches only from entrepreneurs who come through an introduction, and they tend to finance people who have succeeded before, or who remind them of those who did.\u201cAll she had to do before she said that was get on the phone with 10 black men or women and eight or nine would have said, \u2018This is an issue I\u2019ve had to deal with my entire life,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walker said.Ms. Herscher, who has two and a half decades of experience as a software executive, was introduced to Ms. Miller through a colleague and had agreed to become a kind of mentor. Ms. Miller had unveiled Doxa three weeks before. The site had 820 active users, and 300 companies on a waiting list to be included.Now it needed money. Ms. Miller had calculated that $2 million in venture capital would enable her to hire the people she needed and keep the company running for 18 months. But time was tight. She needed to start paying salaries.She had made her pitch to three small, mission-driven funds that wanted to invest in female and minority founders. Ms. Herscher said she should be aiming instead at well-known venture capital firms.\u201cThe thing is, no real investor is going to invest in you because of the mission,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to invest in you if they think you\u2019ll make a lot of money.\u201d\u201cThe feedback we\u2019re getting from the big guns is we\u2019re too small now,\u201d Ms. Miller told her.\u201cThey didn\u2019t wait for Google to have a prototype before they invested,\u201d Ms. Herscher said.The first time they met to discuss Doxa, Ms. Miller had worn jeans and a sleeveless shirt. The look was too unprofessional, Ms. Herscher told her. She should dress like Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer (whose uniform is crew neck, knee-length dresses with cardigans). Ms. Miller said that everyone she had worked with at tech companies wore jeans and T-shirts, and surely no venture capitalist cared if Mark Zuckerberg showed up in a hoodie. Ms. Herscher was uncompromising: Like it or not, the standard is different for women.This time, Ms. Miller wore a dark cardigan over a dark blouse.Ms. Herscher asked if she had been hit on yet by venture capitalists. She hadn\u2019t. Ms. Herscher told her own horror stories \u2014 the investor who slipped his hand under her hair and massaged her neck, the one that rubbed her knee.Ms. Miller was more worried about the investors\u2019 reaction to her pregnancy. She broke the news to Ms. Herscher.After congratulations, they plotted strategy. Wait until the second meeting to mention it, Ms. Herscher said. \u201cThen say: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant. And I\u2019m so well organized that my baby\u2019s due on Christmas Day, which will be a slow time. I don\u2019t expect it will faze me at all. I\u2019m married to a man who will be a primary caregiver, and this is no different from investing in a man whose wife is pregnant.\u2019\u201dThen her tone shifted. She wasn\u2019t talking about business anymore.\u201cHaving your first child is just physically hard, emotionally hard,\u201d said Ms. Herscher, who has two children. \u201cI would never discourage you or say you can\u2019t do it, because you absolutely can. Just be very clear why you\u2019re doing it and what price you\u2019re willing to pay, because the price is time with your baby.\u201dAfter the conversation, Ms. Miller talked with her husband, who works in advertising and was then a freelancer, about being the primary parent. He was on board. She figured she would take off a few weeks and get right back to work.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a lot more nuanced and sometimes it\u2019s subconscious,\u201d said Julia Hu, the founder and chief executive of Lark, which makes a health and weight-loss app. \u201cV.C.s are pattern matchers, and they\u2019re just used to seeing men like themselves.\u201dMany women convey confidence and leadership in a different way than men do, she said. As an Asian woman, she said, she was raised to be humble and quiet and felt uncomfortable promoting her skills. \u201cTo try to be who I thought they wanted me to be, which was another Mark Zuckerberg, was actually very difficult for me without feeling inauthentic.\u201dLater, she realized that describing business partnerships she had made, like one to preinstall Lark on new Samsung phones, was a more effective way for her to demonstrate her leadership skills than boasting about herself.People in Silicon Valley say new motherhood is particularly difficult, because competition moves at hyperspeed. Ms. Mayer, for example, felt the need to announce that she would be \u201ctaking limited time away and working throughout\u201d her leave after giving birth to twins late last year.A few weeks later, Ms. Miller was back at Ms. Herscher\u2019s office, practicing her pitch while Ms. Herscher played the part of skeptical venture capitalist.Ms. Miller had been working 70 hours a week managing Doxa, recruiting companies, trying to raise money and working nights with the engineers who had day jobs.Though her pregnancy had been relatively easy \u2014 at one point she vomited on the sidewalk after meeting an investor, and she was down to a single professional-looking dress that was loose enough to hide her growing belly \u2014 she had not told any investors that she was pregnant, though two had obliquely asked if she was planning to have children.Ms. Miller began her practice pitch to Ms. Herscher: \u201cDoxa is a platform to match qualified people to the right companies. Once this platform exists, we\u2019re going to wonder how we ever found jobs before.\u201d She talked about the team and showed a diagram of how the service worked.\u201cAt this point I have no idea if this is important,\u201d Ms. Herscher said. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me there\u2019s a problem but not if it could make money.\u201dThey ran through some more slides, including her go-to-market strategy \u2014 aiming at women in tech.\u201cI\u2019m immediately turned off and lost, because what you\u2019re telling us is you have this fantastic technology and star team, and you\u2019re going to go after this itty-bitty market and a bleeding heart cause,\u201d Ms. Herscher said.Ms. Miller finished her pitch. It needed to be crisper and more confident, Ms. Herscher said: \u201cIt\u2019s an art to speak in bullet points. It takes practice. Sit in the car and say it over and over.\u201d\u201cO.K., wear cardigans, speak in bullet points,\u201d Ms. Miller said.A week later, she met with Ms. Yuan at Cowboy Ventures. Her tone was more confident and her pitch faster, and she had broadened it beyond women in tech. \u201cThe tools can be used by anyone \u2014 the recruiting market is gigantic,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat people want is not gender-specific, it\u2019s very millennial-specific.\u201dMs. Yuan pushed back. \u201cThere\u2019s this inherent tension in the way we monetize,\u201d she said. Doxa was asking companies to pay to use the service for recruiting while at the same time the site would publish potentially negative employee comments about the companies\u2019 culture.\u201cIt enables companies to be responsive: \u2018Let\u2019s get a maternity policy because we don\u2019t want to be up on your platform without that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Miller said. Smiling, she added, \u201cI love that you\u2019re saying \u2018we.\u2019\u201dBut a few days later, both venture capitalists declined to invest. NEA said Doxa didn\u2019t show enough traction with users yet. Cowboy said it wasn\u2019t clear that Doxa\u2019s technology was different enough from that of other hiring websites.\u201cI really thought it was a good idea,\u201d Ms. Yuan said later. \u201cBut there were really well funded start-ups in this space, and it was hard to tell because it was so early.\u201dMs. Miller told Mr. Meder that she was scaling back her ambitions from raising $2 million and hiring a full team to raising $500,000 for just the two of them. But things had changed for him. He had been given more responsibility at his day job, and it didn\u2019t feel fair to leave for Doxa, with its uncertain prospects.Ms. Miller canceled her coming pitches and told potential investors that Doxa was on pause. She had talked to more than 40 venture capitalists. But without her co-founder, who was building the technology while Ms. Miller built the business, venture capitalists were unlikely to provide financing.The flip side of overnight success in Silicon Valley is overnight failure. Start-ups can be so dependent on a single investor or partnership that a turn of events can change their fates.In 2011, Jason Shen helped found a start-up called Ridejoy, for connecting people who were driving long distances. For a time, it seemed as if it had the golden touch \u2014 entry into Y Combinator, $1.3 million in venture capital and traffic pouring in from Craigslist, where it posted its services. Vanity Fair did a photo shoot with the founders, and a writer profiled them for a book.Then, Craigslist sent a cease-and-desist letter, forbidding Ridejoy to post on the site. By the time Vanity Fair came out, Ridejoy had laid off nearly all its employees and stopped working on the site.\u201cNow I see companies who raised $10 million, and I\u2019m like, did we just not have guts? Did we just not follow through? Did we just not believe in our thing enough?\u201d said Mr. Shen, who now works at Etsy. \u201cFunding is such a confidence game.\u201dHe is saving his money to try to play the game again.As her baby\u2019s Christmas due date neared and she approached a year of living off savings, Ms. Miller began to get an unfamiliar feeling: the desire for stability.A couple of months later, Code 2040 offered Ms. Miller a full-time job, as the director of partner programs. She accepted. Building a new business focused on diversity fulfilled some of the hopes she\u2019d had for Doxa. She imagined keeping Doxa alive as a side project, once she had more time.Ms. Miller\u2019s plan was to take a month off and get back to work. Then, right on time, on Christmas Day, she gave birth to a girl, Zadie Mai, and changed her mind. The baby took over her thoughts. \u201cI feel a mixture of intense love and protectiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to hang out with the baby forever. There are my real physical needs and the physical dependence of the baby, all this stuff I didn\u2019t expect to be so consuming.\u201dShe said she had an entirely new perspective on how undervalued caregivers are, and how people judge women for taking time off work for their families.She decided to take at least six months off, doing some work from home after three or four months, and Code 2040 agreed. Her husband, meanwhile, had found a full-time job in advertising.Ms. Miller said the transition from start-up founder to employee and mother had given her a new perspective on success in Silicon Valley and, more broadly, on what her generation wanted from work, something she wanted to address in her new job.\u201cI wasn\u2019t na\u00efve,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cI knew when I quit Instacart that going on this entrepreneurial journey wouldn\u2019t be like \u2018The Social Network.\u2019 \u201d\u201cBut for me, this was a lesson that it\u2019s not always a straight shot from idea to financing to taking over Silicon Valley and taking over the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe this was just a lesson that being entrepreneurial and taking risks and jumping into new things you\u2019re excited about sometimes is not linear at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What 5G Will Mean for You", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byBitsYou may soon start hearing a lot about 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless technology. This technology is expected to leap ahead of current wireless technology, known as 4G, by offering mobile Internet speeds that will let people download entire movies within seconds, and it may pave the way for new types of mobile applications.That isn\u2019t stopping operators like Verizon Wireless and telecom equipment makers like Ericsson from pushing ahead with 5G trials.A takeaway from these demo projects may be how companies are increasingly focused on three main areas that they think will underpin 5G networks whenever global standards are completed. Here\u2019s a primer on what those areas are and what 5G could mean for you.Most mobile networks are already pretty fast, often reaching download speeds of more than 15 megabits per second. That lets smartphone users stream songs from Spotify, watch videos on YouTube or quickly check Facebook messages. Under plans for 5G, carriers will most likely offer mobile Internet speeds of more than 10 gigabits per second, or roughly 100 times faster than current networks (and significantly quicker than existing broadband). That would allow you to download high-definition movies almost instantaneously, even if you\u2019re on the go.According to global tech and telecom companies that are spending billions of dollars, combined, on the new wireless technology:\u25a0 With 5G, downloading feature-length movies could take less than five seconds.\u25a0 With 4G, downloading feature-length movies could take as long as eight minutes.Such technology will not come cheap. Carriers and telecom equipment makers will have to install new hardware like cellphone towers in rural areas and tiny mobile hot spots in dense urban areas to reach the 10 gigabits per second target. They will also have to increasingly rely on sophisticated software to manage the expected exponential jump in mobile data traffic. So just as most people\u2019s cellphone bills have risen as they watch more videos and access other entertainment on their mobile devices, expect operators to charge a hefty premium for these new ultrafast services.5G is not just about speed. Companies are also preparing for millions of new wireless devices \u2014 such as smartwatches and other wearable items, as well as sensors embedded in industrial products \u2014 to be connected to the next generation of cellphone networks.These devices will not use a lot of data (a sensor built into a highway, for instance, will need to send only small amounts of digital information across the network every couple of hours). But when combined, these hundreds of millions \u2014 potentially billions \u2014 of new sensors will require almost universal connectivity, or the ability to go online no matter where they are, forcing operators to extend their networks to practically every corner of a country.These devices will potentially be an important new revenue stream for carriers worldwide. Many operators, particularly in Europe, are finding it tough to charge customers more for their increased use of mobile data. But if carriers can persuade businesses in industries like health care as well as industrial conglomerates like General Electric to sign up for new mobile Internet services that connect tiny sensors to the Internet, then operators may have stumbled onto a new way of making money.If 5G can offer ultrafast mobile Internet speeds, then why should you care about how quickly one device can communicate with another? In short, you shouldn\u2019t. And as current mobile networks offer so-called latency, or digital response times, of around 50 to 80 milliseconds (the time it takes for a web page to load on your smartphone), reducing that speed to a mere millisecond \u2014 the goal under most companies\u2019 5G plans \u2014 might not add much to users\u2019 mobile experiences.Yet that extremely fast response time will be essential for many of the new services that will most likely be offered on 5G networks. A prime example is driverless cars. These machines will have to communicate almost in real time with everything around them to avoid cyclists and other obstacles. That can happen only if carriers offer one-millisecond latency, something that may become a lifesaver if autonomous cars become a reality.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Filters That Add a Dash of Dazzle to Smartphone Photos", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byApp SmartWhen I learned about photography years ago, one of my favorite tricks with the camera was to use a filter \u2014 perhaps a color gel or a diffuser \u2014 to add a special effect to the final photograph.Now I can do the same thing on my smartphone, thanks to photo filter apps. Many of the apps are badly made, but we have sorted through some that are worth trying.Colorburn works best when you use the camera system in the app to take your photos, because doing so offers a chance to see the effect live on your camera screen and tweak it or select a different effect. The app also works on photos you\u2019ve already snapped, either with your phone\u2019s built-in camera or a different photography app.Among my favorite Colorburn features are image editing for contrast and cutout filters that let you frame your photo in a square, a heart or another shape. Extra filters and effects are available via in-app purchase for $1 or more. Controlling the individual effects is easy thanks to the app\u2019s clear editing controls.Colorburn\u2019s downside? There is so much choice in filters and effects that mastering its many menus and controls and deciding which of the 1,000-plus image options you want to use can be difficult.Infltr\u2019s quirky filter interface really influences how you use it. Because it reacts to swipes so quickly and you can\u2019t fine-tune each effect, it forces you to swipe to find a great look and to snap your photo quickly. This means you may end up trying filters that you would normally not choose in a photo app like Instagram.Some reviewers lament the lack of fine control over each special effect in Infltr. The app also specializes mainly in colored filters instead of more eye-catching ones like vignetting and color inversion. It costs $3.This app has an interface with bold, clear icons and controls. Its filters are organized into sections like \u201cartmodern,\u201d \u201ccolor\u201d and more, and each filter is previewed with a little on-screen icon. The preview helps you choose how bold the final result is with a simple slider. Unlike some rival apps, Pixlr also allows you to apply the filter over the whole image or only to particular regions that you indicate by drawing on-screen.Pixlr also has comprehensive photo editing features like red-eye removal, text overlay and more. The app is supported by ads, but if you\u2019re annoyed by e pop-ups, they can be removed by paying $2.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stylish Gym Clothes. No, Really.", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byCritical ShopperSweats are a uniquely amplifying item of clothing. Nothing on earth makes an athletic person look more athletic, and nothing on earth makes a slovenly person look more slovenly. Sweats facilitate movement almost as well as they promote inactivity. They are not very useful for anything in between those poles, but they are ideal for both.This occurred to me when thinking about the word \u201cathleisure,\u201d which has popped up as marketing shorthand for a category of clothing that has been roughly defined as \u201cstreet-appropriate gymwear.\u201dThe term itself is unfledged; if you type it into Google Trends, which tracks the popularity of search terms over time, it scarcely shows up until early 2014, with hockey stick growth igniting midway through 2015 and no signs of slowing as I type.Two stores have opened downtown in service of athleisure, both oriented toward women. One is a completist\u2019s version of something we\u2019ve seen before, and one is a near-perfect version of something we haven\u2019t. Both offer luxuriant sweatpants.Everything about Outdoor Voices strikes a balance between cheekiness and assiduity, right down to its name \u2014 a nice corrective to the term \u201cindoor voices,\u201d which is how teachers have historically reprimanded children who don\u2019t know how to govern the VOLUME of their SPEECH.\u201cWe believe that fitness doesn\u2019t have to be defined by performance,\u201d reads an introduction on the company\u2019s website, \u201cand we celebrate approaching activity with moderation, humor, and delight.\u201dDelight is everywhere at Outdoor Voices, from the store\u2019s merrily implausible soundtrack (the Shangri-Las and the Ronettes) to the Frank Stella palette of its colorblocked workout leggings ($95) to its adorable merchandising, with zines and sneakers sitting atop foam geometric shapes and tables with speckled surfaces in Ettore Sottsass colors.I palpated a slinky hoodie in ultramarine ($85) while a saleswoman straightened the racks nearby. \u201cHoly smokes, this is soft,\u201d I said, addressing her. \u201cWhat is this made out of?\u201d\u201cThe label says it\u2019s a poly and spandex blend, but I don\u2019t believe that,\u201d she replied. \u201cI believe it\u2019s made from clouds and magic.\u201dMe too.I tried on a boxy tee ($65) and a crop top ($60), each in a space-dyed black-and-white pattern that I would describe as \u201cdigital Oreo\u201d (yum). They were almost too pretty to ruin with sweaty emissions. I bought both.The prices at Outdoor Voices are a little mighty for athletic gear, but each piece is designed with a rigor that justifies the outlay: Labels are printed right onto the fabric\u2019s interior, so there are no itchy tags to snip out, and most fabrics are mildly textured \u2014 heathered, marled \u2014 to mask perspiration. This is what tech intelligence plus good design looks like. I can hear the imitators firing up their laptops.But Outdoor Voices has nothing to fear; it has found its audience. I\u2019ve never seen so many beautiful, exquisitely composed women in one space. I am hesitant to publicize this fact because I\u2019m worried that the store will attract a gawking element but \u2026 oh, well. It\u2019s too conspicuous not to point out.After 20 minutes browsing, I felt the way I do after two hours at the Met: entertained, exhilarated and ready for a brownie.Kith Women, meantime, has more-modest ambitions. The tiny storefront on Bleecker came to fruition after the founder of its brother brand, Kith, noticed women snatching up the smaller sizes of his men\u2019s wear line. The new store presents a designed-for-women line of activewear by Kith mixed in with pieces from Nike and Adidas by Stella McCartney.For such a small space (it has the dimensions of a taco stand), Kith Women offers a huge amount of stuff while still feeling minimalist. This feat is accomplished by way of crafty design decisions: A window seat doubles as a shoe try-on station; a dressing room is hidden James Bond-style behind a wall; there are white marble floors and white fluorescent accents and mirrors on both walls to reflect all that whiteness. The snow outside is dirty, but the mirrors at Kith Women are Windexed.The clothing is unassuming, with an \u201cupscale business hotel\u201d color palette: black, navy, pearl, oyster, heathered laurel and a billion shades of gray.It\u2019s a conservative range of hues borrowed from men\u2019s wear and girlified with smart little tweaks: A paneled workout top by Kith ($145) has a scoop neck where you might expect a crew neck; a sports bra from Adidas by Stella McCartney ($70) comes in foggy mauve; an Adidas Superstar shoe ($150) features a cap toe in glinting rose gold.There are at least 120 styles of shoe on display and a range of lifestyle accessories, like Sachajuan shampoo ($26), vintage Polaroid cameras ($130) and RGB nail polish in tasteful neutrals ($18).The air is mildly scented by house-branded candles with names like Den, Lounge, Study, Loft, Studio and Foyer ($40 each). After making sure that the word \u201cloft\u201d did not appear on the actual candle, I bought Loft, which features \u201cnotes of quince, blood orange, mango, frangipani, Tuscan iris powder, milk, artemisia and teakwood.\u201dYou had me at \u201cTuscan iris powder,\u201d candle.Advertisement"}

Grey Gersten, an artist and musician, had designed them to gather information he then used to compose songs about strangers; individuals filled them out for him two summers ago during rapid 20-minute song-making appointments for his project, \u201cCustom Melodies.\u201d\u201cThe form was a psychological test to see where you are at in life,\u201d he said in a phone interview.Mr. Gersten, 32, worked from an impromptu music studio inside the Mmuseumm, a peculiar contemporary museum the size of an elevator shaft in the narrow Cortlandt Alley in TriBeCa, where people handed him the papers through a window opening. The forms, posing questions personal and abstract, helped him explore a concept: Can you bottle a stranger\u2019s essence in a song? The resulting compositions were played publicly at the Chinatown Soup gallery on Friday night and varied from ambient and sonic to poppy and feverish.People wandered through the space studying the papers on the walls, but a few sought their own original forms.

Other songs echo with footsteps, motorcycle engine roars, car alarms, pedestrian chatter and various sounds of the city.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a field recording,\u201d Mr. Gersten explained in the interview. \u201cI was trying to meet them, get a feeling from them and then embody it in a song. I\u2019m not trying to tell their life story. I wanted it to be in the moment.\u201d\u201cThe passing of time has actually made it more profound,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people told me they cried.

{"Headline": "Welsh Town Leads a British Revolt Against the Tax System and Corporations", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byWales JournalCRICKHOWELL, Wales \u2014 Fifty small businesses line the cobbled streets of Crickhowell. There is a bookstore and a bakery, a salmon smokery and a pub.Then there is Steven Lewis\u2019s coffee shop, Number 18 Cafe & Brasserie, which, like a lot of the other mom-and-pop operations in Crickhowell, houses a grievance that resonates far beyond the town\u2019s borders.Mr. Lewis, 63, a broad-chested former military man, has helped turn Crickhowell into ground zero for a revolt by small-business owners in Britain against a tax system they see as rigged against them in favor of multinational corporations like Facebook, Google and Starbucks. The town, population 2,063, has become famous for being one of Britain\u2019s last holdouts against the encroachment of big retail chains.Mr. Lewis said he paid the 21 percent corporate tax rate on his profits last year, equivalent to 31,000 pounds, or $45,200. By contrast, Facebook \u2014 which is based in the United States but does business in Britain and is therefore subject to British taxes \u2014 paid just \u00a34,327, or $6,274, in corporate tax in 2014, or about one-seventh of what Mr. Lewis paid.Facebook\u2019s bill was also less than the average personal income tax payment and the national insurance contributions that individual British employees pay, which amount to about $7,800 a year for someone making the median income of $40,000.That is just one glaring example, Mr. Lewis and his fellow shopkeepers in Crickhowell said, of what amounts to multinational tax dodging on a gargantuan scale, leaving the little guy to pick up the tab. And their protest is one small case study of how economic populism is playing out around the world, rallying grass-roots support to challenge governments and corporate interests alike.Mr. Lewis, who retired from the army as a major and fought in Northern Ireland and the Middle East, is working with his regiment of shopkeepers to stoke public indignation across Britain so that consumers, and ultimately shareholders, will pressure company executives to change the way they do business. He plans to use social media and doorstep protests to \u201cname and shame\u201d corporate chiefs and those who support them, right down to their tax accountants.\u201cAlways fight on the ground of your own choosing, never on the enemy\u2019s ground,\u201d he said, reaching for a military metaphor.His most recent effort at consciousness-raising came late last year, when he tried to replicate a favored financial tactic of multinationals and have Crickhowell and its businesses incorporate in tax havens. No dice, said the British tax authorities: Towns, unlike companies, are not allowed to register offshore, and Crickhowell\u2019s small businesses did not meet the legal definitions necessary to qualify for such a move.But Mr. Lewis has pledged to fight on, drawing on what he said were the approaches he learned combating terrorists.\u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty brutal,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWe will go for the throat.\u201dBritain\u2019s tax authority, Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, said in a recent report that the amount of tax lost to Britain because of avoidance schemes was an estimated $4.3 billion in 2014, though it has fallen sharply over recent years as the government closes loopholes.But the authorities routinely come under fire for not doing enough. In the latest example, a $288 million settlement in back taxes with Google was heavily criticized because the company\u2019s sales and profits ran into the billions. Many American companies that do business in Britain benefit from corporate taxes that are much lower than in the United States, where the combined federal and state statutory corporation tax is 39.1 percent. Facebook has said that it is \u201ccompliant with U.K. tax law\u201d and has emphasized that employees residing in Britain pay income tax on their earnings.\u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d said Steven Askew, a baker in Crickhowell, as he took a break from work, his arms covered in flour. He and his wife each work 80 hours a week, he said, and paid more income tax than Facebook. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to stand up and say enough is enough. Enough with the injustice,\u201d he added.Rose Tabb, who works in a chocolate shop in Crickhowell close to the ruins of a 13th-century castle, was adamant. \u201cEither we all pay, or we don\u2019t,\u201d she said.Jo Carthew owns the Black Mountains Smokery on the outskirts of town. Multinational companies are able to reinvest what they do not pay in taxes, she said, allowing them to grow ever bigger and stronger. She has not been able to afford expanding her staff since the company started more than 10 years ago, she said. \u201cThe more I\u2019ve learned about how widespread these offshore strategies are used, the more indignant I\u2019ve become.\u201dOf course, the tax offenders are not just American. There is Caff\u00e8 Nero, the London-based coffee chain that did not pay a penny of corporate tax in Britain for a decade. Cadbury, the British confectioner bought by Mondelez International of the United States in 2010, then named Kraft, has not paid taxes for the past five years, despite making about $144 million in profits each year.Large companies, especially those that operate around the world, typically employ complex, aggressive and sometimes creative financial techniques to hold taxes to a minimum, often by offloading some of the profits from higher-tax countries to lower-tax ones. Britain\u2019s tax authority defines the practice as \u201coperating within the letter \u2014 but not the spirit \u2014 of the law.\u201dMany shops in Crickhowell already have stickers pasted on their windows that declare themselves part of a \u201cFair Tax Town,\u201d and 27 towns across Britain have signed up to that initiative, Mr. Lewis said.Another of his aims is to have the tax authorities enforce a five-star system that would rate which companies have paid the appropriate taxes and make the results public.\u201cThe multinationals want to be in an incredible haze of technical complexity because they want to hide in it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what I want to do is get a big gust of wind that blows all that away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Net Neutrality Again Puts F.C.C. General Counsel at Center Stage", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Every day for one month last fall, Jonathan Sallet, the general counsel at the Federal Communications Commission, sneaked into a small, windowless office at the agency, its location undisclosed except to senior staff.From 6 a.m. until early evening, with Bach streaming in the background, he worked mostly alone, marking up stacks of law books and standing in front of a lectern. His job: Defend in court the F.C.C.\u2019s most contentious policy \u2014 rules to classify broadband Internet providers as utilities, widely called net neutrality.\u201cI did nothing for one month but prepare,\u201d Mr. Sallet said in an interview. \u201cI talked a lot to the wall.\u201dHis arguments, though \u2014 like nearly all of his actions for the agency \u2014 have had far-reaching reverberations.In his two years as the F.C.C.\u2019s general counsel, Mr. Sallet, 63, has taken center stage in some of the most divisive debates in Washington. He helped shape and then defend the net neutrality law. His input helped kill the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger last year. In recent days, the cable industry has closely tracked his thinking about a merger between Charter and Time Warner Cable, concerned about a similar result.\u201cTypically a general counsel is like an administrator,\u201d said Reed Hundt, a former Democratic chairman of the F.C.C. \u201cBut in Jon you have an administrator who is also a policy maven and political strategist.\u201dMr. Sallet will draw more of the spotlight in coming months, a period that could shape the tech and cable landscape for years to come. The agency is set to take a position on the Charter and Time Warner Cable deal, as well as vote to open the market of set-top cable boxes to new competitors. And the decision in the net neutrality case, the one he prepared so long and hard for, is also expected.Each weekday morning, Mr. Sallet is among a small cadre of top advisers who meet at 8:45 to discuss policy and strategy with Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the F.C.C. Mr. Wheeler, a former lobbyist for the cable and wireless industries, knows firsthand how the agency\u2019s actions can be derailed by the pressure of lobbying by the powerful businesses he used to represent.\u201cHe is a multifaceted talent with the ability to see all angles of an issue and provide sage counsel,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said of Mr. Sallet.In the recent interview in his office, where the slim and soft-spoken Mr. Sallet keeps a keyboard and a guitar, he said swift changes in how people communicate and consume media have thrust the agency \u2014 and him \u2014 into the spotlight.For decades, Mr. Sallet has been an inside player in telecom policies. After graduating from law school at the University of Virginia and working as a clerk for Justice Lewis F. Powell, he spent 30 years representing companies like MCI and working on tech policy at the Commerce Department.While at the Commerce Department, he was introduced to the Mosaic web browser by Vice President Al Gore. That was in 1993, the same year Mr. Wheeler showed him a demonstration of a wireless phone.These days, Mr. Sallet said, policies related to smartphones and the Internet get such strong reactions that they require more than a broad view of economics and markets. They also require an ability to navigate pointed political criticism.That climate makes sticking to a set of principles all the more important, he said. For him, those ideas are that networks should be open for consumers and that the F.C.C. should \u201ctake actions to avoid a society of haves and have-nots.\u201dNet neutrality \u201cinvolves competition issues, the mergers are quite clearly about competition,\u201d he said.Mr. Sallet\u2019s stance has not slowed criticism. The F.C.C. recently proposed an overhaul of the TV set-top box market, a move that could open a new area of business for tech giants like Google and Amazon. Cable and media companies are fighting the plan, saying it would erode the core of their business.In addition, some academics criticized the agency\u2019s decision last spring to block Comcast\u2019s merger with Time Warner Cable, after a review led by Mr. Sallet. Critics said the companies did not compete in the same markets and would not reduce the number of options for consumers.The review of Charter\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner Cable is expected to yield a decision this spring. Though analysts are generally confident it will be approved, the agency is likely to attach several requirements that ensure the merged company doesn\u2019t use its size to keep programmers from offering content to streaming providers.The harshest criticisms have been for Mr. Sallet\u2019s role in advising and writing up net neutrality policy \u2014 with technology and telecom companies arguing that Mr. Sallet, a Democrat, has made too many decisions based on politics.In October 2014, Mr. Wheeler, also a Democrat, introduced rules that could have let cable and telecom firms carve the Internet into various high-quality and low-quality tiers, according to some legal experts and net neutrality advocates. Top officials at the agency were reluctant to create stronger rules that ban such practices by regulating Internet service providers like utilities.The pressure intensified the next month, when President Obama took the unusual step of saying that broadband service providers should be treated like utilities, subject to rules akin to those placed on phone services. Soon after, Mr. Wheeler directed Mr. Sallet to rewrite the draft rules to more aggressively regulate the Internet service providers.\u201cUltimately Jon is the lawyer and Wheeler is his client,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.To complicate the situation, the rules were almost guaranteed to face strong legal challenges. Telecom and cable companies immediately sued to overturn the regulations, and the case was handed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the same court that had struck down net neutrality rules twice before.Mr. Sallet made his arguments defending the latest rules in December, winning plaudits from all sides for his work in the courtroom. A decision is expected this spring. Other legal challenges to the policy are likely.Mr. Sallet and his supporters said his positions, and those of the F.C.C., should not come as a surprise. Mr. Sallet and top advisers have talked frequently about the agency\u2019s push to keep big telecom and cable firms \u2014 which control the video and broadband pipes into homes \u2014 from stifling new technologies.There are even echoes of this philosophy in a speech he helped write in 1994 for Mr. Gore. In the speech, at University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Gore called for an overhaul of rules for phone and cable communications to encourage the development of the coming Internet economy.\u201cWe look back now and see that was incredibly prescient,\u201d Mr. Sallet said.Advertisement"}

It said the change was mostly related to the negative impact of currency exchange rates in some markets.The company said results in North America were the driving force behind its record performance.G.M. said it earned a pretax profit of $11 billion in the region in 2015. Under the terms of the contract it signed last year with the United Automobile Workers, the results translate into profit-sharing checks of as much as $11,000 for each of its 49,000 hourly employees.The automaker had varied results in other global regions, reporting pretax losses of about $800 million in Europe and $600 million in South America, and a pretax profit of $1.4 billion in its international division that includes China.For the fourth quarter of last year, G.M. said it earned net income of $6.3 billion, which represented a significant gain over the $1.1 billion it earned in the fourth quarter a year earlier.The company posted revenue of $39.6 billion in the fourth quarter, which was about the same as the previous year.A picture caption on Thursday with an article about General Motors\u2019 annual earnings misidentified the Chevrolet model that was shown being unveiled at the event.

{"Headline": "In the Government vs. Apple, Who Wears the Black Hat?", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byOpinionTHE dispute between the Justice Department and Apple over access to the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the gunmen in the San Bernardino massacre, comes down to this question: Shouldn\u2019t the government have more legal and moral authority to weigh complicated issues of privacy and national security than a company that makes phones?It should. After all, nobody ever elected Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to public office. The legal case seems clear enough: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has a warrant, Mr. Farook is dead, and his iPhone, which he used for work, is the property of San Bernardino County, which consented to having it searched. The data on the phone could yield valuable intelligence, making its content a legitimate matter of national security.The government, not Apple, should guarantee our privacy rights. But this dispute has arisen precisely because the government hasn\u2019t done so. Instead, it squandered much of its legal and moral authority when the National Security Agency engaged in widespread surveillance of American citizens for so long. Some N.S.A. abuses targeted Silicon Valley directly.In one project, revealed in October 2013 by journalists tipped off by Edward Snowden, the N.S.A., along with its British counterpart, essentially hacked into fiber-optic cables that connected the data centers of Google and Yahoo outside the United States. Under American law, the agency already had access to some of the information, but it tapped the lines anyway.Silicon Valley companies love to celebrate the hacker spirit, but they don\u2019t like being on the receiving end. By November 2013, both Google and Yahoo announced that they were encrypting data traveling between its server centers. By the following September, Apple announced that its new phones would by default encrypt data stored on the device in such a way that even the company itself couldn\u2019t get at it.At the time, this seemed like a hopelessly geeky version of Mad magazine\u2019s \u201cSpy vs. Spy,\u201d with opponents one-upped with algorithms rather than cartoon bombs. But the fight led directly to Tuesday\u2019s ruling by a federal magistrate judge in California that Apple must help the F.B.I. unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. The laws governing online privacy are woefully out-of-date. To compel Apple to help execute a warrant, the judge cited the All Writs Act of 1789, enacted before there was electricity.In Apple\u2019s public response, the company said it was fighting the F.B.I.\u2019s demands not because it objected to the government unlocking Mr. Farook\u2019s phone but because the government could then ask Apple to undermine the security of other iPhones and because such software could potentially help criminals and repressive governments hack iPhones.By analogy, the company doesn\u2019t have a key to the phone so the government is asking it to make the lock weaker. Apple is being asked to undermine not only the security of its products but also potentially its corporate reputation and even its business. The company is especially concerned that a victory for the government would set an informal precedent for other countries to demand that Apple unlock encrypted data. It\u2019s hard to have any sympathy for Mr. Farook, but the line between terrorism and criticism of the government can be far fuzzier in other countries, like China, where Apple sold tens of millions of iPhones in the last quarter of 2015. Apple\u2019s phones are also sold in Pakistan, where homosexual acts can send people to prison, and in Saudi Arabia, where adultery is punishable by lashing or stoning and apostasy punishable by death.The United States government may have a reasonable case when it comes to Mr. Farook, but a victory here would open a Pandora\u2019s box that can\u2019t be closed in the United States or anywhere in the world. Cracking the phone open also may not help as much as we think: Would-be terrorists can use encrypted communication services that operate in other jurisdictions.What we really need is a robust public conversation around strong privacy laws that would apply to the government and private companies alike and clear limits on what should be done with data. Important choices about the future of technology and privacy should be made by the American people and their representatives, not by Silicon Valley, where even the noblest intentions are mixed with huge financial stakes. If the government wants the power to compel companies to undermine their own security systems, it should go to Congress and ask for it.Until then, we are left with Silicon Valley executives making engineering decisions that could determine what information the government can and can\u2019t have. That\u2019s both bad policy and fundamentally undemocratic.But the current choice is between a government that doesn\u2019t seem to recognize limits to its own power to access personal information and a technology company that does. It\u2019s a bad choice, but an obvious one.

And why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it happen months ago?Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz went hammer and tongs after Donald Trump at Thursday night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republican debate in Houston, questioning his ideas, ethics, business practices, and conservative credentials. Marco Rubio led the charge, grinning broadly as he lambasted Mr. Trump for hiring undocumented workers, making his Trump-branded clothing in China, and failing to release his tax returns. Scoffing at Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outsized boasts about his wealth, Mr. Rubio said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The audience erupted in laughter.Interestingly, one of the most sustained, resonant attacks was on an issue that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been out there for months: multiple lawsuits against Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump University.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Rubio called the enterprise a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfake university.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people that borrowed $36,000 to go to Trump University, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re suing now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Cruz jumped in, asking voters to consider what it would be like to have Mr. Trump as the G.O.P. nominee, testifying as a defendant in a multi-million-dollar fraud case.Google searches of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump University\u00e2\u0080\u009d went through the roof.Mr. Trump was left sputtering, with nothing to say.Pressed repeatedly on when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d release his tax returns, Mr. Trump, who has resisted doing so, found a new excuse. He is being audited, and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t release the returns until the audit is complete (which of course he could.) After the debate, he suggested that he gets audited repeatedly because of his religion. As Mr. Trump himself would say (on Twitter): Bad!Mr. Rubio even found time to ridicule Mr. Trump for repeating himself, and for his near-total lack of substance.All in all, this last debate before the crucial Super Tuesday primaries on March 1\u00c2\u00a0was a delightful, long-overdue trouncing of Mr. Trump. Whether it will cut into his substantial lead is, of course, the race\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest question.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Apple, a Search for a Moral High Ground in a Heated Debate", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byDealBookWhat does it mean to be a good corporate citizen?That\u2019s one of the questions being tested as Apple and the federal government battle over whether Apple should help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone to gain access to encrypted data that officials say is necessary for their investigation of the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings that killed 14 people.Apple initially assisted the F.B.I., but is now fighting a government order directing it to create a new piece of software to open the phone, contending that its position is meant to protect the privacy of its customers.Aside from the thicket of legal issues raised by the case, does Apple have a moral obligation to help the government learn more about the attack? Or does it have a moral obligation to protect its customers\u2019 privacy? Or how about its shareholders? And which of these should take precedence?Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has long spoken about running his company based on certain values. He has used his position to advocate gay rights, for example, and pushed the company to be more \u201cgreen,\u201d once going so far as to tell a shareholder who questioned the return on investment of taking such stances, \u201cIf you want me to do things only for R.O.I. reasons, you should get out of this stock.\u201dDuring a graduation speech last year at George Washington University, Mr. Cook said, \u201cWe believe that a company that has values and acts on them can really change the world.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is opportunity to do work that is infused with moral purpose.\u201dMr. Cook has argued that complying with the court order would threaten \u201ceveryone\u2019s civil liberties\u201d and make customers more vulnerable to digital crime. And Mr. Cook is not alone. Chiefs at several technology companies have supported his position. \u201cWe\u2019re sympathetic with Apple on this one,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s C.E.O., said on stage Monday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.Apple has come under sharp criticism from law enforcement officials. \u201cThere was once such a thing called corporate responsibility,\u201d William J. Bratton, the police commissioner of New York City, said of Apple. \u201cNow, it\u2019s corporate irresponsibility.\u201dThe debate over Apple\u2019s stance is just the latest in a series of questions about corporate patriotism. In recent years, questions have been directed at companies that renounce their United States citizenship to move to a country with a lower tax rate. Others, including Apple, have faced questions about tax strategies to shelter income abroad. And companies\u2019 social responsibility programs, say for clean energy or water efficiency, have been scrutinized.Behind Mr. Cook\u2019s worry is a separate, perhaps even more immediate threat: the possibility that if Apple were to comply with the court\u2019s order, other governments might follow suit and require Apple to give them access for their own investigative purposes. If Apple refused the request of, say, the Chinese government, it would risk being barred from doing business in China, its second-largest market after the United States.And then there\u2019s the possibility that if Apple were to build special software for the F.B.I., it could fall into the wrong hands, leading to even greater privacy and safety concerns.All of which leads back to the same question: At what point is there a moral obligation for a company to help law enforcement, regardless of the business or privacy risk, in the event of a terrorist attack, or any crime?\u201cWhat are we really doing here? We\u2019re protecting a terrorist,\u201d Michael Ramos, the San Bernardino County district attorney, told Bloomberg News, referring to Apple\u2019s position. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around that.\u201dAs principled as Mr. Cook\u2019s position may be, it still has the effect of hindering (or at least not helping) a criminal investigation that his company is uniquely situated to assist. (It is worth noting that the government already has most of the material on the phone from a previous backup.)Some business economists like Milton Friedman would most likely argue that Apple has no moral obligation to the government that isn\u2019t in the interest of maximizing its profits.The Justice Department has suggested Apple\u2019s position \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201dJames Comey, the director of the F.B.I., says that this lawsuit presents a narrow legal issue, and that what the government seeks is limited to this particular case.\u201cThe San Bernardino litigation isn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land.\u201dYet other law enforcement officials suggest that the conflict with Apple extends far beyond the San Bernardino case.\u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West of technology,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said last Thursday, citing at least 175 iPhones that his office cannot gain access to, and arguing that it should be able to do so. \u201cApple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201dUltimately, it appears that both sides have left little room for compromise. \u201cTim Cook and lawyer Ted Olson have draped their argument in one of moral absolutism \u2014 but there is a hierarchy of moral reasoning they miss,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, referring to Apple\u2019s outside lawyer, Mr. Olson.But if this broader controversy is ever going to be solved for the long term, there has to be an opportunity to reach a consensus in the middle.Maybe that means Apple should work with law enforcement to train officials so they have a better ability to rapidly retrieve information legally? (After all, law enforcement had a chance to gain access to the iPhone in question had they taken certain steps early on.) Or maybe the president should create a commission to study the issue, bringing together people from Silicon Valley and law enforcement to create agreed-upon rules of the road. Or, perhaps new legislation is required.Mr. Comey, in a statement issued Sunday night, suggested as much, citing the need to resolve the \u201ctension between two values we all treasure \u2014 privacy and safety.\u201d\u201cThat tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell stuff for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also should not be resolved by the F.B.I., which investigates for a living. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I turn on the television, and I see a land where to be a citizen means to specialize in the venting of spleen.It\u2019s the Year of the Angry Voter, and apparently it\u2019s vitriol itself, rather than any particular strategy for the future, that\u2019s propelling the electorate. \u201cOur country is being run by incompetent people,\u201d Donald J. Trump has said. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I\u2019m very, very angry.\u201d Bernie Sanders is angry, too: \u201cI am angry. The American people are angry.\u201dNo wonder they both triumphed in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Everybody is angry, from the left to the right. Everybody, that is, except me.Which is not to say that I\u2019m not upset about many things. The stagnation of wages; police murders of unarmed black youth; continuing resistance to equality for L.G.B.T. people; Google\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s slow devouring of the publishing industry. All of these are issues that I feel passionately about.I want to make the world better, for myself and for my children. But I don\u2019t want to bite any pigs.When I was young, I was taught that anger is a sin, and forgiveness a virtue. In the \u201cInferno,\u201d the Angry dwell in the fifth circle of hell. They thrash it out in the river Styx, where the wrathful struggle on the surface of the water and the sullen drown below.One thing that baffles me is that many of the angriest voters are also those associated with communities of faith. By what logic can the devout commit the sin of anger, and resist the call of its antidotes, the virtues of forgiveness and understanding?As Anne Lamott wrote, \u201cNot forgiving is like drinking rat poison and then waiting for the rat to die.\u201dAnd yet, Testaments Old and New are full of stories of vengeance and wrath. Christ himself throws something of a tantrum when he arrives in the Temple and finds it overtaken by money changers and animals. He overturns tables, lashes a whip and yells about injustice. It\u2019s not exactly \u201cGentle Jesus Meek and Mild,\u201d a hymn that for some reason I always confused with that old advertisement for Palmolive dishwashing liquid, which \u201csoftens hands while you do the dishes.\u201dBut this story used to confuse me. If Christ himself was able to express such unbridled anger, then how could anger be a sin?The Rev. Amy Butler at Riverside Church in New York suggests that there are really two kinds of anger: the kind that is the fruit of our own egos, and the other kind, that is focused outward, on the injustice of the world. In a sermon, she said, \u201cEither our instinctual response to threat is all about us \u2014 who we are, what we want, what we need \u2014 or it becomes about something bigger than ourselves.\u201dIn other words, it\u2019s one thing to be angry because you don\u2019t like one of the moderators at your debate; it\u2019s another to be angry because you think, for instance, that the entire electoral process is rigged to benefit the wealthy. The first kind lands one in the fifth circle of hell, gurgling in the Styx. The second can be a force for good, a possible first step on the road to change.Mr. Trump and others in this election have performed a sleight of hand that makes their own narcissistic anger look like a revolution. They have created an anger transmogrification machine, leading voters to misconstrue the fury of egotists for the transformative anger that helps change the world.But a movement founded upon narcissistic wrath cannot lead to a better future.What we need in the United States is not anger, but forgiveness.When I was a teenager, I decided one summer day that having a shaving-cream-pie fight would be the best use of my time, and since a shaving-cream-pie fight isn\u2019t really much fun if you\u2019re the only one having it, I invited over a large crowd to share in this activity.Things didn\u2019t end well. There were bloody noses and ruined clothes, and enough people jumped or were pushed into a neighborhood swimming pool that the profusion of sudsy froth killed the pool filter.This is what it feels like to be an American right now: a witness to a shaving-cream- pie fight that has somehow foamed out of control.I want to gather together everyone running for office and sit them down before my father, as I was seated, at the end of that long summer day. It would be good for them to hear the counsel my father gave to me, words that other fathers, and mothers, have doubtlessly said since the beginning of time: \u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d he observed. \u201cI\u2019m just terribly, terribly disappointed.\u201dJennifer Finney Boylan is a professor of English at Barnard College, the author of \u201cStuck in the Middle With You: Parenthood in Three Genders,\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vladimir Teriokhin Is Designers\u2019 Secret Knitwear Weapon", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byVladimir Teriokhin was sitting at a long work table in his 3,000-square-foot studio on 37th Street in Manhattan the other day, stapling his company ID along the top of sample blocks of a muted green yarn with complex stitches that have names like herringbone, basket weave, double chevron. Like television spec scripts being submitted to a network for development consideration, these were headed to Ralph Lauren for approval.Mr. Teriokhin \u2014 whose long neck and Allium-stalk comportment reflect his background as a ballet dancer in what was the Soviet Union \u2014 has built a business, Vlad Knit, on giving his ideas away: prototyping and producing sweaters for many of the major fashion houses showing this fashion week. For years, Oscar de la Renta hired him to prototype and produce his knitwear, and he has also collaborated with Vera Wang and Marc Jacobs, whom he\u2019s helping to develop an intricate crochet. \u201cVery much technically strong, maybe Francisco Costa competition,\u201d he texted after a recent meeting with the latter. (Mr. Costa, at Calvin Klein, is known for his knitwear.)The new guard, including Proenza Schouler, the Row and Rosie Assoulin, have also sought Mr. Teriokhin\u2019s expertise. \u201cI don\u2019t have knitting knowledge,\u201d Ms. Assoulin wrote in an email, explaining that when she decided to add knitwear for fall 2014, \u201che was our go-to guy with his experience and talent.\u201dNow he is emerging from behind the scenes. Last autumn, along with a creative partner, Allyson Spencer, he introduced a new line of sweaters, named Spencer Vladimir and retailing from $800 to $2,500 at Barneys New York, Moda Operandi and Just One Eye, a boutique housed in Howard Hughes\u2019s old Hollywood headquarters.Perhaps most coveted of these has been the Vlad: an enveloping cloud of chunky cables more elaborate than the trunk lines leading to the main Google servers, knit by Mr. Teriokhin himself. Seventy percent wool and 30 percent cashmere, it evokes Irish fisherman togs of yore, but also, in its intestinal tangle, the work of the Swiss illustrator Giger, who designed the alien in \u201cAlien.\u201dLike many of his clientele, Mr. Teriokhin, who is in his 50s, keeps an almost entirely vegan diet and works out twice a day, \u201cswimming, lifting, yoga, dance aerobics,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are performing, this is what they teach you.\u201d He knits with a precise, upright posture. His only work-related injury: cracked and dry hands from the chemicals and dust on yarn.In the studio, Mr. Teriokhin jumped up occasionally to help an Eastern European woman about a decade older knitting an elaborate section of a gray sweater. \u201cShe must have the stitch right,\u201d he said. His employees and he tend to wear mass-produced sweaters barely related to the intricate textiles quickly lengthening beneath their needle tips. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Only it must be comfortable,\u201d he said when asked the label of his plum cashmere V-neck.They were surrounded by delivery boxes, oversize skeins of yarn, walls tacked with WWD covers, an old poster for a Mir\u00f2 show, a few abstract paintings of indeterminate age and, in a corner, some large bamboo stalks jutting out of an oversize vase.Mr. Teriokhin\u2019s 18 \u201cgirls,\u201d as he calls them \u2014 who, along with several European factories help make all the sweaters he produces for other designers \u2014 hear of him by word of mouth. They include a former violin teacher at a conservatory, two professors and a symphony pianist; they can make $400 to $800 a week working for Mr. Teriokhin, sometimes from home. \u201cWe teach each other,\u201d he said.The buzzer sounded, and a sleek young man in a black suit, black glasses and knit cap came in. \u201cDid our production arrive?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you know if our care labels came in?\u201d\u201cFrom Orley,\u201d said Mr. Teriokhin, referring to the groovy young design threesome. A giraffe of a girl came in next with long, straight black hair and a single row of sequins wrapped around her forehead, announcing that she was from Marc Jacobs. \u201cIntern,\u201d Mr. Teriokhin said after she left.The density of Mr. Teriokhin\u2019s sweater designs, which gesture at (among other things) ballet, ancient armor and Mongolian herders who raise the Kashmir goats that provide the wool, reflect his own complicated history.Beginning at age 9, he trained with the Bolshoi in Moscow, one of 20 students chosen from thousands. As a young dancer he joined the company at the Mikhailovsky Opera Theater in St. Petersburg (then the Maly in Leningrad), knitting backstage as his grandmother had taught him, to pass the time.There he noticed a mysterious woman helping at rehearsals, a former ballerina named Lena Stepanenko, whose career had ended abruptly. She took him under her wing, and he became entranced with her depth of knowledge about the minute requirements of dancing \u201cGiselle\u201d and \u201cSwan Lake.\u201dAs Mr. Teriokhin talked, he sketched dance scenes from the ballets and recreated the tunes in perfect pitch (with a \u201cdum du du ba bum ba da dum\u201d) with such presence that a spotlight seemed to cut through the fluorescent shop lights and illuminated his head, framed by fifth-position arms. \u201cWe remember still, after all these years, every step, every gesture,\u201d he said.The activity of knitting seems for him no less vivid. \u201cWhen you knit, your mind goes here,\u201d Mr. Teriokhin said, his eyes rolling dramatically heavenward. \u201cYou are praying, you are meditating.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an attention to detail that\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Tomoko Ogura, the senior fashion director at Barneys, speaking of Spencer Vladimir\u2019s pieces. \u201cWhen we touched and examined each piece close up, we were drawn to the couture-like quality.\u201d Built-up layers make collars stand up, ombr\u00e9 effects radiate tones and halftones, and asymmetric shapes hug curves. Most of them also have that ultimate luxury: generous side pockets.Mr. Teriokhin began collaborating with Ms. Spencer, who was working for a bridge line of Mr. de la Renta\u2019s, after it closed. She plays the role of art director. \u201cEverything I finish I show to Ally,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a very good eye. She knows very well what she thinks, exactly what\u2019s inside her.\u201dHis eyes fill easily with tears when he describes learning that Ms. Stepanenko had been treated harshly by the KGB and afterward could not dance. The two married and moved to Estonia for five years. Then, in 1989, warned by friends in Moscow of further political difficulties, they moved to the United States, where he joined the Los Angeles Classical Ballet.He credits Harold Grimes, who worked for the International Rescue Committee to aid refugees, and Senator Chuck Schumer, a frequent dinner guest of Mr. Grimes\u2019s, with encouraging him to make a profession of his hobby. Through them, the owner of the Aviary knit company, now closed, heard about Mr. Teriokhin\u2019s skills and asked him to knit seven sweaters in 10 days. \u201cI was dancing \u2018The Nutcracker\u2019 seven days a week, making very little,\u201d Mr. Teriokhin said. \u201cSo, I perform, I have dinner, I knit. I wake up, I knit, I go to rehearsal. I finish them.\u201d One of this first batch made the Ralph Lauren Collection runway, he said.Eventually he was able get an \u201cextraordinary talent\u201d green card with supporting letters from his designer clients, and he and Ms. Stepanenko lived in Park Slope until it became vexing to get into the city quickly with samples. Miraculously, this was the one and only time he encountered the pernicious knitwear villain Tineola bisselliella, a.k.a clothes moth. \u201cVictorian house,\u201d he said with a shrug.Now, the couple rents a one-bedroom apartment on Central Park West and 100th Street, where he has mostly \u201cshut the door on a social life,\u201d he said. On his work table, there is a glossy pamphlet of black-and-white photographs of Ms. Stepanenko dancing \u201cGiselle,\u201d made, he said, in honor of her 65th birthday, by the theater. They refused to return to celebrate.\u201cNo more politics for us,\u201d he said. Only statement sweaters.Some designers, many of whom like to appear to conceive of each item of their half-dozen annual shipments while acknowledging a mysterious \u201cteam,\u201d have worried that his work for them will suffer as a result of his own label. \u201cI say, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Mr. Teriokhin said. \u201cI have so many ideas. I can knit for Spencer Vladimir, my girls can knit for you, your image, your vision.\u201d\u201cI have always stayed in the shadows, until now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "America Is Flint", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byBut lead poisoning goes far beyond Flint, and in many parts of America seems to be even worse.\u201cLead in Flint is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d notes Dr. Richard J. Jackson, former director of the National Center for Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cFlint is a teachable moment for America.\u201d\u201cWe are indeed all Flint,\u201d says Dr. Philip Landrigan, a professor of preventive medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cLead poisoning continues to be a silent epidemic in the United States.\u201dNone of this diminishes the tragedy of Flint, which is particularly horrifying because it was delivered by the government through the municipal water system even as state officials scoffed at the local outcry. In any case, data collection is poor, so we don\u2019t have a good handle on the scale of the problem either in Flint or elsewhere: Take comparisons with a grain of salt. But it\u2019s clear that this lead poisoning is not one city\u2019s catastrophe but a nation\u2019s \u2014 and the world\u2019s, since the situation is even worse in some low-income countries.Lead poisoning is an old problem: An Australian doctor, Lockhart Gibson, diagnosed the first case in 1904.Then in 1943, a doctor in Boston encountered a young boy who had tried to stab his teacher, and remembered that the same boy had suffered lead poisoning years earlier. Researchers soon found that early exposure to lead impairs brain development and is strongly associated with later violent or criminal behavior.Today the continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color.A first step is to restore funding and to improve lead poisoning screening. When a child tests positive, a public health team should be dispatched to find the source and eliminate it.\u201cEvery urban area has lead,\u201d notes Dr. Leana Wen, the health commissioner of Baltimore. Speaking of efforts to reduce lead poisoning, she said, \u201cIf there\u2019s something we can do that will result in improved educational outcomes and reduced violence in the community, why don\u2019t we do it?\u201dLet\u2019s recognize the catastrophe in Flint as a wake-up call to address not just one city\u2019s lead-poisoning tragedy, but America\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What 74 Years of Crossword History Says About the Language We Use", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "AdvertisementEDUCATED Americans consider themselves a cosmopolitan bunch. We follow the conflict in Ukraine between Donetsk and Kiev, and can probably point to them on a map. We enjoy bibimbap and paella, which we try to pronounce with an appropriate accent. Some of us can identify the work of Igor Stravinsky, Youssou N\u2019Dour and Ai Weiwei. The rest of us are going to go look them up on Wikipedia now.But we are more parochial than our grandparents\u2019 generation, according to one indicator: the New York Times crossword puzzle.With the permission of Will Shortz, the Times\u2019s crossword puzzle editor, I recently downloaded all of the newspaper\u2019s crosswords from February 1942, when the puzzle began, through the end of 2015. I created an algorithm to search all 2,092,375 pairs of clues and answers for foreign language words and place names outside the United States.The results are imperfect, since the puzzles can be tricky and there is a lot of overlap between English and foreign words. But the broad trend is clear. The puzzle today uses one-third fewer non-English clues and answers than it did at its peak in 1966, and makes two-thirds fewer international references than its peak in 1943.For many years, the puzzle expected educated Americans to know the German word for \u201cwith\u201d (mit) and the Latin word for \u201cman\u201d (vir), for example. These words have all but disappeared from the puzzle. Solvers were expected to know details about America\u2019s military operations, such as \u201cMountain battlefield\u201d in 1943 (etna) and (misleadingly, since the answer is actually Japanese) \u201cForever!: Korean battle shout\u201d in 1951 (banzai). Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, by contrast, appear in the puzzle barely more often than before the United States sent troops to each country. Since the 1990s, puzzlers were occasionally asked to recognize \u201cBurkina ____\u201d but over the last few years, they were given additional help, \u201cBurkina ____ (African land)\u201d and \u201cBurkina ____ (Niger neighbor)\u201d (the answer is \u201cFaso\u201d).Over the generations, some foreign words have grown in frequency. For example, ethnic food in the Times crossword tracks well with broader cultural trends. Tacos were first mentioned in the puzzle in 1963 (\u201cMexican sandwich\u201d). Sushi appeared in 1982 (\u201cSauce for sushi\u201d: soy), dim sum in 1985 (\u201cChinese pasta appetizer\u201d) and Thai food in 1993 (\u201cPopular cuisine\u201d: Thai). Churros were first included in the puzzle in 2011 (\u201cSpanish pastry\u201d).Other words have also tracked shifts between languages. \u201cDit\u201d used to be clued as French for \u201csaid\u201d; since 1974 it refers almost exclusively to telegraphy. \u201cHora\u201d shifted from Latin (hour) to Spanish (hour) to Hebrew (dance). Uber (a car service) is no longer clued as a German preposition (over or above).I asked Mr. Shortz about how he chooses which foreign-language words to include.\u201cI try not to be too obscure,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes less common foreign words are allowed if there are English-language cognates. For example, I had \u2018zool\u00f3gico\u2019 in a clue \u2014 the answer was oso, which is Spanish for bear, and the clue was \u2018One in a zool\u00f3gico.\u2019 \u201dI suggested the words \u201cmadar\u201d and \u201cpedar,\u201d which are cognates for mother and father in Persian. Could those words appear in the puzzle? No, he said. \u201cOn the crossword blogs, those would be sharply criticized as obscurities. Besides, solvers would hate them.\u201dSome obscure words do get included, though. Mr. Shortz gave the example of \u201cucalegon,\u201d which is Greek for a neighbor whose house is on fire. It appeared twice in the Times puzzle in the early 1960s. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to use that word, but it\u2019s interesting.\u201dWhen Margaret Farrar was hired to start the Times crossword, two months after Pearl Harbor, the puzzle was envisioned as a sort of weekly news quiz, \u201cwith a flavor of current events and general information,\u201d as the first puzzle page announced. The very first clue in the crossword \u2014 \u201cFamous one-eyed general\u201d \u2014 aligned with this mandate, referring to a British commander who fought in North Africa (Wavell).In the puzzle\u2019s first four years, more than 15 percent of the clues included international geographic references. Ms. Farrar chafed against the puzzle\u2019s focus on current events, Mr. Shortz said, and reduced these references to 8 percent by the 1960s. Small but distinct shifts in the proportion can be detected with the coming of each new puzzle editor: a slight increase under Will Weng in 1969, a slight decrease with Eugene T. Maleska in 1977, and another drop when Mr. Shortz took over in 1993. International references now appear in about 5 percent of clues. Western Europe accounts for a third of these international references, a bit lower than in earlier decades.In Ms. Farrar\u2019s day, French was still the primary language of international diplomacy. German was the most common mother tongue in the United States after English. More Americans had studied Latin in school than any other language. Today, by contrast, six times more Americans speak Spanish than French, and nine times more speak Spanish than German by my analysis. Almost nobody knows Latin. Since 1995, enrollment in college Spanish courses has been greater than enrollment for all other languages combined.Waves of immigration have brought many other languages to the United States as well. According to data from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey, the third most widespread language spoken in homes in Texas, after English and Spanish, is Vietnamese. In Virginia, it is Korean. Across the 50 states, about 14 different languages hold the second- or third-place position.A puzzle created from vintage New York Times Crossword words dating back to 1942, using as many foreign answers as would fit.So are we going to see Vietnamese or Korean in The New York Times crossword?\u201cI want the puzzle to reflect our common culture,\u201d Mr. Shortz notes, meaning that the answers and clues should have at least entered the general conversation before they appear. After a moment\u2019s reflection, Mr. Shortz noted that the puzzle did include a Vietnamese word last year. The clue was \u201cVietnamese soup\u201d (pho).\u201cThis is a word I did not know a few years ago, but it has now become embedded enough in American culture that I can expect American readers to know it. With Vietnamese restaurants in many cities, it has become mainstreamed,\u201d he said. Recently, the puzzle added \u201cVietnamese sandwich\u201d (banh mi).One clever puzzle in 1999 made foreign words its theme: tchu tzih, ghiaccio, leumi, wai hua\u2019ai, qoli, masern, akkulroalit, k\u00f6ttbullar (Mandarin orange, Italian ice, Hebrew National, Hawaiian Punch, Persian rug, German measles, Eskimo pies, Swedish meatballs). A puzzle last year included the clue \u201cLanguage in which the first six counting numbers are tasi, lua, tolu, fa, lima and ono\u201d (Samoan). A puzzle last year asked, \u201cBula : Fiji :: ___ : Hawaii\u201d (Aloha). But such clues are rare. Foreign language clues and answers peaked in the 1960s and now make up less than 4 percent.Since The Times introduced its crossword, many other aspects of American life have globalized dramatically. The international proportion of the United States economy has doubled over the past half-century. So has the percentage of foreign-born Americans. International voice calls have increased tenfold in 25 years. Sixteen million Americans use Google Translate each day. We follow world news in real-time, as it happens.But we are more likely to encounter Uma as an actress (117 answers since 1990), and not as a Hindu goddess (five answers, none since 1953). When we turn from the New York Times news pages to the puzzle page, the rest of the world fades away.Charts show a rolling average of how frequently each clue appears, beginning with the start of the daily crossword in 1951.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pittsburgh Exchanges Macy\u2019s for Mixed-Use Giant", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetPITTSBURGH \u2014 A plan to convert Pittsburgh\u2019s 12-story landmark Macy\u2019s department store into a one-million-square-foot mixed-used behemoth has become one of the latest votes of confidence in the decade-long resurgence of the city\u2019s downtown.Core Realty, based in Philadelphia, in July paid $15 million for the property just months before Macy\u2019s closed. The building, on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Smithfield Street, dates to the late 1800s and for years was the flagship of the Kaufmann\u2019s department store chain. It went through several expansions and renovations, including a heralded Art Deco interior makeover of the first floor in 1930.Randy Mineo, executive vice president of Core Realty and a Pittsburgh native, envisions a mix of retailers, restaurants and entertainment spots to complement a 155-room Even Hotel and 312 luxury apartments. Named the Grand at Fifth Avenue, the estimated $100 million project will feature an open-air atrium beginning on the fifth floor and 600 parking spaces, a sparse commodity downtown.\u201cI\u2019ve always looked at Pittsburgh as a hidden gem; it\u2019s a city that has been kind of ignored,\u201d said Mr. Mineo, who with the owner of Core Realty, Michael Samschick, began hunting for properties in the city three years ago. \u201cBut you could tell that underneath the surface, Pittsburgh was bubbling.\u201dDevelopers, corporations, educators and others have pumped about $5 billion into the city\u2019s downtown, also called the Golden Triangle, over the last decade, according to the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership.Investors have converted old office buildings into residential units, hotels and classrooms, constructed new office buildings, and built up the district\u2019s restaurant and entertainment base, even while the state has overseen the city\u2019s budget as a result of Pittsburgh\u2019s near-bankruptcy early this century.Among other projects, Millcraft Investments, a developer based in nearby Washington, Pa., which evolved from the industrialist Jack B. Piatt\u2019s business interests, converted seven historic buildings in 2010 into Market Square Place, a $42 million project that houses a Y.M.C.A., retailers and 46 loft apartments.And Millcraft is putting the final touches on its newly constructed $108 million Gardens at Market Square, a mixed-use development that offers a 197-room Hilton Garden Inn, office and retail space, and a garage for 330 cars.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much activity in Pittsburgh,\u201d said Lucas B. Piatt, president and chief operating officer of Millcraft. \u201cIt\u2019s not down on itself anymore.\u201dAbout five years ago, national office investors for the first time took notice of the market after vacancies actually fell and rental rates grew amid the financial turbulence in 2008 and 2009, said Jason T. Stewart, an executive vice president with the brokerage firm Jones Lang LaSalle in Pittsburgh.That was, in part, because of fortunate circumstances, Mr. Stewart said. The regulator-encouraged acquisition by PNC of the beleaguered National City Mortgage, as well as the merger between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial, brought thousands of workers downtown.\u201cAfter the dust settled in 2010, the fundamentals in Pittsburgh looked very favorable,\u201d he said. \u201cThen in 2011, office trades started happening.\u201dClass A office space downtown now has an average vacancy rate of about 7.5 percent, although rental rates remained relatively flat in 2015 and coming lease expirations will put more space in older buildings on the market, according to Jones Lang.Nevertheless, building conversions have cut into office supply and little new construction is underway or planned, which is fostering an environment for rent increases, said Dan Adamski, a managing director with the brokerage.Shorenstein, an office landlord based in San Francisco, made its first acquisition in Pittsburgh last month, paying $149 million for the 45-story One Oxford Centre. It plans to update the property, which is about 20 percent vacant.\u201cIn downtown Pittsburgh, 20 percent vacancy is considered high,\u201d said Matthew M. Knisely, a managing director with Shorenstein. \u201cMost Class A towers are very well leased, and we expect the same thing at One Oxford Centre.\u201dIn addition to the promising office market conditions, the decisions of Google, Uber, Apple and Oculus, owned by Facebook, to put operations in Pittsburgh grabbed Shorenstein\u2019s attention, as did the tech start-ups emerging from nearby Carnegie Mellon University, he said. Much of that activity stems from the city\u2019s longstanding strategy to build up its academic, medical and technological base.The growing population in the downtown area \u2014 up 10 percent to more than 12,300 residents since 2010 \u2014 also appealed to Shorenstein. The housing supply in the downtown area has ballooned nearly 50 percent to more than 5,300 units since 2000, and the average occupancy is about 95 percent, according to estimates by the downtown partnership group. An additional 3,875 units are under construction or planned.Conversation among developers and civic leaders is increasingly focusing on how to improve the Golden Triangle\u2019s shopping experience and whether the area population alone can support conventional retailers. Mr. Piatt, for example, doubts that suburbanites will trek downtown to frequent stores already situated close to home.Restaurants, entertainment venues and boutiques have replaced four department stores as the Golden Triangle\u2019s retail anchors, said Herky Pollock, executive vice president and northeast director of the retail services group for the brokerage company CBRE in the city. But he suggested that the bustling restaurant scene and the growing number of young workers living downtown was generating interest among a variety of operators, from discount retailers like T. J. Maxx to large fitness facilities.\u201cAs long as we add unique offerings, downtown will prosper beyond where it\u2019s ever been,\u201d Mr. Pollock said.Still, Macy\u2019s closing in September left a gaping hole along Smithfield Street, once the city\u2019s most vibrant retail corridor, and has put Core Realty\u2019s redevelopment plan under a microscope. Arthur P. Ziegler Jr., president of the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, wants to see retailing dominate Smithfield Street again.His organization led opposition to the plan by a former mayor, Thomas J. Murphy Jr., to replace 64 buildings on 4.5 acres with a mall in the 1990s. In addition to initiatives like protecting old building facades, the foundation has renovated a handful of properties to create space for apartments, clothing stores, a grocer and other shops, generally charging rental rates below the market average.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned whether people will live downtown if they have to leave downtown to shop,\u201d Mr. Ziegler said. \u201cThe Macy\u2019s project is going to be very important. We need it full of shops or that street won\u2019t come back for retail.\u201dMacy\u2019s initially wanted to take part in the renovation and stay on four floors but couldn\u2019t make it work financially, Mr. Mineo said. Instead, he is planning 100,000 square feet of shops, restaurants and entertainment on the first two floors, as well as a rooftop restaurant.The inability to substantially increase the number of entrances into the landmark will require Core Realty to woo larger users, however, and junior apparel stores, supermarkets and entertainment concepts like Lucky Strike bowling are among his targets.\u201cWe need people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think that with all the apartments that are here and those that are coming, we\u2019ll have enough to support the project.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW\u2019s Crisis Strategy: Forward, Reverse, U-Turn", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Someday, Volkswagen\u2019s emissions cheating scandal will be studied in crisis communications textbooks. And not in a good way.\u201cThere was something like a tsunami,\u201d Hans-Gerd Bode, Volkswagen\u2019s communications chief since September, said in an interview. \u201cThousands of calls and emails coming in at the same time.\u201d\u201cA crisis like this, the company was not prepared for,\u201d he said. With the company continuing to negotiate with foreign governments, \u201cWe don\u2019t know the right way out.\u201dThe automaker \u2014 known for its insular culture and a carefully scripted messaging machine \u2014 has stumbled repeatedly in explaining itself.The scale of Volkswagen\u2019s crisis makes it a particularly unusual case. Even some of the largest corporate crises in the past were focused in a single market, whether it was BP\u2019s Gulf of Mexico oil spill or Google\u2019s battle with European regulators over data privacy.VW should have known it was headed for a disaster. For more than a year, the company told American regulators that its diesels simply had a technical problem that was causing tailpipe emissions to soar on the road. Then last September, Volkswagen admitted it had created software to detect and thwart laboratory tests for pollutants that pose health hazards.Its chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, chalked it up to \u201cthe mistakes of a few people.\u201d Few believed that was true, however, considering that the scandal involves 11 million vehicles and engines developed over several years.Since then, the company\u2019s approach has often faltered. While VW has admitted cheating in the United States and is making good-will payments to customers, it has claimed that the same behavior was not illegal under European rules. So VW is not paying European customers, even though it is recalling its cars in both markets.In an interview, Mr. Bode offered a more contrite message. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that we built up things within the cars which were completely wrong and which worked against the laws,\u201d he said, when asked about VW\u2019s posture in Europe.But Volkswagen is seen as particularly brazen. The public tends to show \u201ca little more tolerance\u201d for recalls and labor issues, said Wendy Salomon, a vice president at Nielsen, which conducted the recent Harris Poll. But the polling, she said, showed respondents were \u201cleast tolerant\u201d of \u201clying and misrepresentation and intentional wrongdoing.\u201dVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.While it is not the first time American regulators have caught an automaker using a so-called defeat device \u2014 a mechanism or software used to thwart emissions tests \u2014 the Volkswagen deception takes place on a global scale, from a company that marketed itself as environmentally sensitive, and at a time when emissions regulation is being taken increasingly seriously.Some missteps have been clear. Promotion of insiders, including Mr. M\u00fcller, a trusted longtime lieutenant of Mr. Winterkorn, is not a hallmark of a fresh start. Treating customers differently in Europe and the United States is asking for trouble.Volkswagen has been scrambling to enlist help. The company has brought in three public relations firms based in three different countries \u2014 Kekst in the United States, Finsbury in Britain and Hering Schuppener in Germany \u2014 to join Edelman, an American firm already on retainer. VW has been paying Richard Gaul, the former communications chief of BMW, 20,000 euros a month, about $22,000, to work as a part-time, 60-hour-a-month consultant, according to a contract reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Bode, however, said Mr. Gaul had been advising the company on other matters.Mr. Bode accompanied Mr. M\u00fcller on his trip to the United States where he made the controversial statement. \u201cIt was my failure,\u201d Mr. Bode said. He said the questioning, around the Detroit auto show, was too chaotic, with many reporters asking questions. He said he should have organized more individual interviews to forestall confusion.\u201cIf you have situations like this where the C.E.O. is doing his first step into this market where you have the biggest problem, and there are millions of questions in the air, then you have to say, \u2018Let\u2019s do it in a more organized way,\u2019 \u201d he said.The company is also overhauling its advertising message. \u201cDas Auto,\u201d the chest-thumping old slogan, is out. The simpler tagline \u201cVolkswagen\u201d is in. Since apologizing in newspapers after the scandal broke, the company has been keeping a relatively low profile.Mr. Bode said Volkswagen was awaiting a resolution to its continuing talks with American regulators before settling on a new marketing strategy in the United States. Discussions have been contentious. The Environmental Protection Agency and regulators in California and Canada have accused the company of installing defeat device software in a set of larger vehicles that were not among those included in Volkswagen\u2019s admissions.\u201cWe have to start with this campaign when we have agreed to a solution with the authorities.\u201d Mr. Bode said. \u201cThen we have to see the overall picture.\u201dIrving Schenkler, a professor and crisis management expert at New York University, said there have been few parallels in history. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented in terms of the cross-national scope of it, the degree of the problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many different fronts.\u201dEven in Germany, the news media has hardly given the company a free pass. \u201cVW is overwhelmed,\u201d said Kayhan \u00d6zgenc, a reporter at Bild am Sonntag, a newspaper that has been particularly aggressive, adding, \u201cIt was a change from paradise directly into hell, from the most profitable carmaker to an emergency situation.\u201dMr. Bode, for his part, has been critical. \u201cWhat the German press did was call everything wrong which is and was done by the company,\u201d he said.Managing the crisis, he added, has been \u201ca step-by-step thing, learning by doing.\u201d Someday, he said, he could become a university professor and give speeches on how to manage a crisis. \u201cHundreds of speeches,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a joke.

This important legislation would update the law to reflect how people use the Internet today.Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, government agents need a warrant if they want access to email stored on the servers of companies like Google and Yahoo, but only if the messages are less than 180 days old. For older messages and other digital files, law enforcement officials can issue subpoenas to technology companies without going to a judge.Requiring search warrants will not impose a big burden on law enforcement agencies. Investigators routinely get such warrants by showing judges there is probable cause that the information they are looking for contains evidence of wrongdoing. Legal experts say it is very rare for judges to deny a warrant.As November\u2019s election approaches, expectations for congressional accomplishment will further diminish, especially when accomplishment would involve a show of bipartisanship. That is all the more reason for lawmakers to move fast and pass this worthy bill now.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Super Bowl 50 Further Divides San Francisco", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byBut these festive trappings cannot mask the tensions that have roiled San Francisco in recent years \u2014 tensions that are coming to the surface as football fans flood into town and attend over-the-top pregame events. In a city divided over gentrification, sky-high housing prices and the technology industry\u2019s influence on local government, even the nation\u2019s biggest party has become a battleground.\u201cI don\u2019t think the taxpayers should be used to subsidize a party for one of the wealthiest corporations in the world,\u201d said Jane Kim, a San Francisco supervisor. Last week, she introduced legislation to renegotiate the city\u2019s agreement to host the National Football League, noting that Santa Clara, the Silicon Valley city 40 miles to the south of here where the game itself will be played, will be largely reimbursed for its costs by the Super Bowl Host Committee.Mayor Edwin M. Lee, however, has said that the Super Bowl will bring a bounty to San Francisco and its businesses.He noted that one million people are expected to visit Super Bowl City, the 10-acre temporary village at the foot of Market Street that shows off the town\u2019s best assets: views of the bay, food by top local chefs, and exhibits straight from Silicon Valley featuring virtual reality and drones.The city will pull in far more from hotel and sales taxes than the $5 million it is spending, Mr. Lee said, and profits will fund more services for residents.\u201cIf we\u2019re not an economically strong city, we\u2019re not in a position to help anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last five years, I\u2019ve been very proud, have been economically very strong, which makes us very attractive for the Super Bowl and many other events.\u201dJeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, held a news conference here Wednesday to lay out some of the plans, saying that law enforcement was \u201cfocused on layered security, seen and unseen.\u201dHostility among rank-and-file San Franciscans, however, is palpable. One Super Bowl statue in Alamo Square, a residential neighborhood, was so relentlessly vandalized that organizers eventually removed it. The statue drew ire because the city had waived the installation fees to place it in a public park, and its defacement drew applause on social media.Jennifer Friedenbach, the executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said that police officers clearing the streets had indeed been telling people to stay away until after the big game \u2014 apparently so they will not detract from the festivities, like parties that will draw celebrities like Marshawn Lynch and Jon Bon Jovi.\u201cYou have a $5 million corporate giveaway to host this party, and that\u2019s money that could have been used to house 500 homeless people for a year,\u201d Ms. Friedenbach said. \u201cIt really puts a spotlight on the priorities of this city.\u201dTo be sure, some locals appreciate the spruce-up. Mary Ann McGregor, 52, who works for the city\u2019s retirement plan system, called the recent efforts to clean up the streets \u201ca start.\u201d\u201cI love the attention that this city is getting; I can see the big banner from my window,\u201d Ms. McGregor said, referring to one of the many large \u201cSuper Bowl 50\u201d signs that have become ubiquitous here. \u201cThe area is being cleaned up. And I love how it\u2019s bringing in all this money.\u201dThis conflict between those benefiting from the economic boom here and those who are being priced out is at the center of San Francisco\u2019s larger culture war.The so-called Google buses \u2014 private commuter buses that whisk tech workers from the city to the corporate campuses to the south \u2014 will be used to transport fans to Santa Clara on game day, which tourists may see as a treat. Although this does not seem to have caused an uproar among San Franciscans, it is perhaps symbolically significant, given that the buses have been a lightning rod for anger over the Bay Area\u2019s growing wealth disparity.Deanna Leitner, 33, a makeup artist, said the Super Bowl expenditures showed that the city had lost its way. An organizer of the city\u2019s annual Gay Pride parade, she said the city would not have waived fees for Pride as it did for the N.F.L.\u201cIn San Francisco, we\u2019re supposed to be the bastion of crazy liberals,\u201d Ms. Leitner said. \u201cInstead of raising wages for teachers so they can afford to live here, why are we spending money on a party for people who work for the N.F.L.?\u201dSuper Bowl supporters say they are incredulous that anger has extended to this event, which they see as an unadulterated win for the city.\u201cSan Francisco is a world-class city,\u201d said Jim Lazarus, a senior vice president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, predicting that the city would easily make back the money it put in. But even if it took a loss, he said, there would still be a benefit to hosting big events: \u201cThis is a worldwide event that will sell San Francisco.\u201dJust how much money the Super Bowl will bring is unclear. Sports economists have questioned the benefits, arguing that the tourists who flock to the game often just displace others who would have come instead, especially in a city like San Francisco, where hotels are almost always near capacity. The city lost more than $10 million hosting the America\u2019s Cup yacht race in 2013, a public fiasco still fresh in many minds.Lucy Ho, 45, agreed that residents should receive some benefit from hosting an event like this. But after living here for four decades, she said that life in San Francisco had only improved under Mr. Lee, with improvements to parks, libraries and other services.\u201cI get it \u2014 rent is so expensive, the buses are eyesores,\u201d Ms. Ho said. \u201cBut the folks who work for the big corporations here, they\u2019re culturally engaged. They pay taxes. And I don\u2019t see them going away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "1950 Bette Davis Film", "Date": "2016-03-01", "News": "Just kidding. This was a fairly easy puzzle to solve, but perhaps you are wondering where the theme is hiding. My first paragraph is a clue, but maybe you are just not into classic Bette Davis movies. That would be a shame, because this is one of the best films about a sociopath ever made. The 1950 film \u201cAll About Eve\u201d was before my time, but it is one of my favorites for a few reasons. The performances, the intriguing storyline, the fact that it holds the record for most Oscar nominations \u2026 all contributed to a fascination with this movie, so I have no excuse for not eventually realizing that the sprinkling of EVEs all about the grid was trying to tell me something. In addition, we\u2019ve got that revealer at 56 Across. Some of the EVEs cross each other and some do not, but the EVEs are, as constructor Freddie Cheng notes, \u201call about.\u201dIn order to get enough EVEs in his grid to make the theme work, Mr. Cheng set some tough constraints for himself in terms of filling the puzzle well. Even so, there are some Scrabbly entries, like HEXA (clued cleverly as \u201cTri and tri again?\u201d \u2014 do the math and you\u2019ll see why the answer is the prefix for \u201csix.) crossing SEX ED, ZEE crossing ZELDA and all those V\u2019s. There is not a whole lot that is new or edgy, but points to Mr. Cheng for filling the puzzle as nicely as he did under the circumstances.I confess that I only got SKIS at 12 Down by using the crossings, because I was not aware of Super G or Super giant slalom racing. I figured that \u201cSuper G\u201d had something to do with gravity, which, given the speeds at which racers fly down the mountain, probably does figure into things somewhere. Another speed bump: Hands up if you also misread 38 Down as \u201cObi-\u201d and obediently filled in WAN before discovering that the answer was something entirely different that involves tools other than light-sabers.Let\u2019s hear from Mr. Cheng:This puzzle, which I like to call \u201cEve All About,\u201d was submitted two years ago in March 2014, aiming for a Monday audience (I missed). I guess KEROGEN and KOPECK ruined it for a Monday \u00e2\u0080\u00a6The revealer /idea really just came out of the blue. With that in hand, the remaining theme entries followed quickly, though the symmetrical EVEs around the grid took some work to get a clean fill.  After finishing the fill however, an \u00e2\u0080\u009cUh-oh\u00e2\u0080\u009d moment struck me during cluing, when I realized that Americans rarely used EVEN STEVENS to mean \u00e2\u0080\u009cbalanced,\u201d but instead used EVEN STEVEN. The former is much more common in Britain, where I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m from, so it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even occur to me until then that I had a problem. Luckily, after a frantic Google search, I was rescued by the Disney television series of the same name, and in the process learned quite a bit about its etymology. As for EVEL KNIEVEL, I remember seeing him in his snazzy outfits on television when I was a kid, and thinking, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look too difficult, I can jump 20 double-decker buses easy, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big deal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the amazing thing about a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind \u2014 nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever impossible, and anything goes. Luckily for me, I only had a push-bike to experiment with \u2026About half of the clues survived the editing process and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good ratio for me. Tony HAWK, the pro skateboarder, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the cut (rightly so, since it would have made that area too difficult), but \u00e2\u0080\u009cTri and tri again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d for HEXA did.

{"Headline": "Think Like a Doctor: Drowning on Dry Land Solved", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Solve a medical mystery with Dr. Lisa Sanders.The correct diagnosis is: Eosinophilic pneumonia, caused by the antibiotic daptomycin (brand name Cubicin) The DiagnosisDaptomycin is an antibiotic used primarily to treat drug-resistant staph infections. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003. The first report suggesting a link between this antibiotic and pneumonia was made in 2007. An 87-year-old man who, like this patient, was being treated with daptomycin for an infection after knee surgery lost 15 pounds over the course of just a few weeks and became increasingly fatigued. A CT scan of his chest revealed multiple nodules, and when these nodules were biopsied, the patient was found to have a pneumonia. But it was an unusual pneumonia. Instead of finding bacteria or the usual infection-fighting white blood cells in the lungs, the sample showed a handful of eosinophils (or eos), a type of white blood cell that normally fights off parasites (like intestinal worms) but can also be seen in allergic reactions. The doctors suspected that the pneumonia was an allergic reaction to the daptomycin. They stopped the drug, and the pneumonia resolved. As a result of this case report, the F.D.A. put eosinophilic pneumonia on the list of possible adverse reactions. By 2011, 11 cases had been reported, enough to convince the F.D.A. that the link was real. Eosinophilic pneumonia is an unusual disorder and is usually caused by exposure to certain drugs or toxins or radiation therapy. The most common trigger is cigarette smoke, and the illness may occur in those who recently started or restarted smoking. More than 300 different medications have been linked to eosinophilic pneumonia; antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen are most commonly cited. How or why this pneumonia develops is not clear. Men are more likely to be affected than women. In the cases of eosinophilic pneumonia associated with daptomycin, patients were all over age 60. How the Diagnosis Was Made Dr. Robert Centor was the doctor on call when the patient was admitted to the hospital. The patient was seen by the resident on his team, who called to tell him about the 67-year-old man with the infected knee and a week-long pneumonia. Dr. Centor was intrigued. Why would a pretty healthy guy on antibiotics for one infection develop a second infection? He was getting his antibiotics through an intravenous catheter than ran from a vein in his arm into his heart. Could some type of skin bug have traveled up the catheter into his heart, and from there into his lungs? He asked the resident to make sure that the patient had a CT scan of his chest to look for tiny pieces of infection, known as septic emboli, which might be clogging up the blood vessels in his lungs. The patient got the  scan, which showed only the fluffy clouds dotted throughout his lungs.The next morning, Dr. Centor went to the radiology suite to review the chest X-ray and CT scan with the radiologist. No septic emboli were present. After confirming what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d already heard the night before, the internist headed up to see the patient with his team.\nLooking for Answers After talking to the patient and examining him, Dr. Centor was certain of two things. First, that the patient was seriously ill. Second, that he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure why. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any sense at all that this youthful 67-year-old retiree should suddenly develop a whopping double pneumonia. Certainly bad things can happen to healthy people, but Dr. Centor liked to understand why. In this case, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was completely befuddled,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr. Centor told me in his thoughtful Southern twang. We were old friends; he had been a wonderful teacher and mentor to me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut whenever I am befuddled, I just talk to other people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me.I know from my own experience that often enough, just posing a case to a colleague as a question can prompt you to see it in a different light and reveal an answer you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t considered. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really lucky, the answer comes from asking someone who has previously come across a similar case. So Dr. Centor, who was the dean of his residency program, headed to the cafeteria, where he grabbed a cup of coffee and scanned the room for familiar faces. He settled down at a table full of doctors and residents and quickly outlined the case. The Right Place, the Right TimeMohamed Raja, a resident in his second year of training, listened carefully to the case. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a matter of being in the right place at the right time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me.  Because as soon as Dr. Centor mentioned the name of the antibiotic the patient had been getting, the resident realized with a jolt that he knew the diagnosis. Well, he said to Dr. Centor, he had been reading up on Cubicin just the week before. And there was this rare complication associated with the drug that had caught his attention. It was an allergic reaction that manifests itself as a terrible and painful pneumonia, caused not by an infection but by the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own white blood cells, the eosinophils. Hearing of this unusual reaction, Dr. Centor quickly pulled out his cellphone and looked up Cubicin and eosinophilic pneumonia. Sure enough, this unusual side effect, first described just a few years earlier, seemed to fit his patient exactly. The only way to know for certain was to get a lung doctor to put a scope into the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lungs and see if these specialized cells, the eosinophils, were there. They shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be. But first he had to stop the medication. Dr. Centor called the nurses to make certain the patient didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get his next scheduled dose. Then he went upstairs to tell his team and the patient. Waiting for Watson\nIt is the nature of medical knowledge that no one knows everything. We doctors all learn the same basics, and what we add depends on the patients we see and the interests we pursue. One of the key skills all doctors must hone is how to recognize and supplement these almost inevitable gaps. The Internet has made this kind of supplementation much, much easier. For example, when Dr. Centor first told me about this case, he gave me the outline and asked what I thought was going on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a game we often play. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, but what I call \u00e2\u0080\u009ctest logic\u00e2\u0080\u009d told me that if he was telling me the name of the antibiotic, it had to be part of the answer. So I Googled the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cdaptomycin\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpneumonia\u00e2\u0080\u009d and whammo, I got the answer immediately. Last fall, IBM announced that it is developing a health care business based on its supercomputer, Watson. Using the same data-accumulating skills that allowed Watson to conquer \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in 2011, the goal is to master all medical knowledge \u00e2\u0080\u0093 new and old \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so that we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to. But until then, doctors must continue to rely on their own data accumulating skills. Dr. Centor turned first to the traditional method, the who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire option of phoning a friend, before turning to other sources. Will Watson \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or any of the other emerging databases \u00e2\u0080\u0093 fully replace human recall and thought? They haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so far. How the Patient FaredThe patient had the bronchoscopy the next day. He had eosinophils and no signs of infection. He was started on high-dose steroids to calm the allergic reaction, and the Cubicin was replaced with another antibiotic for the last weeks of treatment. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been four months since his scary pneumonia episode, and the patient tells me he feels just fine. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resigned to the fact that his knee may never be perfect. But breathing? No problem. As for his fishing camp, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closed for the winter. But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back as soon as the weather, and his knee, allow.

{"Headline": "Why a Push for Online Privacy Is Bogged Down in Washington", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byIn his introduction to the report, President Obama went further, writing that his \u201cadministration will work to advance these principles and work with Congress to put them into law.\u201dFour years later, however, the effort has produced few new data controls for consumers, even as advocates say the need is greater than ever because of the advent of Internet-connected technologies that collect data on people\u2019s sleep habits, the temperature in their houses and the like.The story of how some of the country\u2019s leading civil society advocates came to lose faith in the White House\u2019s privacy initiative does not follow the typical plot of Washington gridlock. It is a tale of clashing visions for American society and commerce. And it provides an instructive preview of looming battles among government agencies for control over industries like drones, smartphones and gadgets yet to come.The ability of companies to freely amass and analyze the personal details of consumers also provides a counterpoint to the current fight between Apple and the F.B.I., in which Apple says it wants to protect consumer information from government snoops.At issue was not the classical notion of \u201cprivacy\u201d as the right to keep out prying eyes.When people freely search and share their personal concerns online, their data footprints can leave clues about their most intimate health worries, family matters and financial difficulties. Regulators warned that companies could use those details to narrowly categorize consumers, potentially leading to inferior or unfair treatment.Separately, officials at the Commerce Department were focusing on privacy as an economic issue. They did not want consumers to lose trust in digital services and stop patronizing them, said Cameron F. Kerry, the department\u2019s general counsel at the time. Commerce officials also wanted to ensure that American technology companies could continue to innovate with data.Over the next three years, administration officials developed the privacy initiative. They titled the effort the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights to underscore the idea that, among other things, Americans had the right to expect that companies would not use their personal details for unexpected purposes.The document posited consumer privacy as a basic American right that was not dependent on the kindness of app makers.In addition to calling for consumer privacy legislation, the 2012 report proposed a parallel self-regulatory process: Under the auspices of the Commerce Department, industry and consumer groups were to work together to devise voluntary privacy practices for mobile apps, drones and other technologies.\u201cThe Obama administration released the first-ever comprehensive consumer privacy blueprint to provide a template for stakeholders from across the public and private sectors to implement policies that safeguard American consumers and innovation,\u201d Jennifer Friedman, deputy White House press secretary, said in an email.The lofty aims ran into challenges.The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a division of the Commerce Department, began to convene meetings to encourage technology companies, trade groups and consumer advocates to reach consensuses on privacy practices in various industries; the biometric industry would weigh in on facial recognition, for example.\u201cThat is a major success,\u201d said John Verdi, director of privacy initiatives at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The app notices, he said, were intended to make \u201cmore transparent to consumers what their privacy policies are, what data they collect, what data they share.\u201dThe multistakeholder talks on facial recognition technology were more contentious. Facial recognition can be used to identify unknown people by taking scans of their faces and comparing them with facial scans from a photo database of named people.\u201cThis is the single best process for moving this forward,\u201d he said.But David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the consensus process had proved to be of little benefit to consumers.\u201cIf you want to protect consumers,\u201d Mr. Vladeck said, \u201cyou don\u2019t simply allow industry to decide what to do in a way in which they don\u2019t have any incentive to compromise.\u201dThe clash continues between consumer advocates who warn that unfettered commercial data collection could chill the daily routines of Americans \u2014 where they go, what they say, how they shop \u2014 and industry advocates who warn that any restrictions on data collection could chill innovation.Administration officials say legislation is still needed.\u201cWe continue to call on Congress to advance legislation in line with the common-sense protections outlined in the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights,\u201d said Ms. Friedman, the White House spokeswoman.\u201cAn individual should have control over their information,\u201d said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, \u201cnot a Facebook, Google or Internet service provider.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He decided to make a video to generate interest.The video had a plot: A man is trying to get to an event at a bar in Manhattan. He takes a helicopter over the city. The pilot tells him that to get to the bar on time, he should put on a parachute and jump. Mr. Riddle needed to film the descent from the man\u2019s point of view, with the ground rushing toward the camera.This called for a drone. Mr. Riddle went on Amazon and bought an Ionic 6-Axis Quadcopter Drone with a camera for $69.99. He flew it in his apartment. He said he looked up laws for using drones on Google and, satisfied he was out of the forbidden zone around airports, packed the drone in a duffel bag and took the train to Midtown Manhattan.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best idea,\u201d Mr. Riddle said, \u201cbut I figured I had it in me.\u201dHe saw some police officers standing near Macy\u2019s and approached them. He told them he wanted to fly the drone straight up and let it descend. He said an officer replied, \u201cSounds O.K. to me.\u201dThus feeling empowered with a municipal seal of approval, Mr. Riddle set the drone on the ground by 350 Fifth Avenue.Mr. Riddle said his drone flew up to about the sixth story before the trouble began: \u201cThe wind takes it, and it bumps against the Empire State Building a few times.\u201dNot good.\u201cI let it drop, and it falls onto the first tier, which is like five floors up,\u201d he said. He entered the lobby, approached a security guard and asked to get his drone back.\u201cYou got some ID?\u201d the guard said.Detectives questioned him at length. They had apparently seen his Facebook page, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s BBN?\u201d in a tone, he said, that suggested they thought it might be linked to ISIS.Mr. Riddle spent several hours in the holding cell before he was arraigned and released, he said. His case is pending. His drone is evidence. He returned to the police station to collect his other property, and the officer at the desk asked his name.\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Dude,\u2019\u201d Mr. Riddle said, \u201c\u2018I\u2019m the drone guy.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons in Manhood for African-American Boys", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported by10 PhotosKevin Jennings begins his class on cultural identity for African-American boys with a daily affirmation: \u201cI am focused. I am ready to learn. Let\u2019s turn up!\u201dThe subject is how society sees black men, and the lens is the Matrix, a metaphor borrowed from the sci-fi film. Students identify the negative cultural stereotypes and expectations for black men and boys \u2014 what the Matrix wants you to think \u2014 that wreak havoc on a youngster\u2019s self-image.\u201cThe Matrix is there to mess you up,\u201d Rahsaan Smith, a live wire of a 13-year-old, pipes in. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very dark world, but you can\u2019t be afraid to be a source of light.\u201dMr. Jennings\u2019s class, at the Montera Middle School in Oakland, Calif., is part of a novel and ambitious initiative by the Oakland Unified School District to rewrite the pernicious script of racial inequality, underachievement and lack of opportunity for African-American boys.The full-credit elective, \u201cMastering Our Cultural Identity: African American Male Image\u201d (commonly referred to as the Manhood Development Program), is now in the daily curriculum at 20 schools throughout the district, tailored to age appropriateness for third to 12th graders.While lower grades focus on the stories, legacies and images of black people, high school students take a deep dive into African-American history and culture, from ancient civilizations to the civil rights movement to contemporary media. All classes are taught by black male instructors whose own experiences and perspectives provide a multidimensional understanding of the students they mentor (in Oakland, as elsewhere, more than half the teachers are white and most are women).Begun unofficially five years ago, the office kicked into high gear in 2012. That is when the district signed an agreement with the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to improve outcomes following an investigation into grossly disproportionate suspension rates of black males \u2014 42 percent annually, though they made up only 17 percent of the school population. A majority were for \u201cwillful defiance,\u201d nonviolent infractions like texting in class or using profanity with a teacher.\u201cWhen black children do what children do, the system reacts more harshly,\u201d said Christopher P. Chatmon, the executive director of the Office of African American Male Achievement and its turbo-powered guiding force. \u201cThe No. 1 strategy to reduce discipline issues is engaged instruction.\u201d In Manhood Development, he added, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about how to elevate their game academically through the lens of brotherhood.\u201dIn a city with a legacy of black political activism \u2014 where the unarmed Oscar Grant was fatally shot by a police officer in 2009 at the Fruitvale BART station and #blacklivesmatter was germinated \u2014 the initiative begins with the premise that the words \u201cblack male\u201d and \u201cachievement\u201d go together and that a college degree can be a part of their future. The philosophy might be encapsulated in a greeting scribbled on a whiteboard at Oakland High School: \u201cWelcome Kings!\u201d \u2014 the somewhat grandiose title a shorthand for holding oneself to a high standard and being responsible for others.Think of it as #blackmindsmatter.The mission of the Office of African American Male Achievement is to support all of Oakland\u2019s black male students, which it strives to do through a variety of initiatives, including peer mentoring, a student leadership council and conferences that bring together role models and students \u2014 a sort of uber school assembly that has the cacophonous energy of a revivalist meeting.In addition, two Afrocentric core courses have just been introduced \u2014 in English language arts and history \u2014 that meet the strict prerequisites for the University of California. And a career academy is in the works at Oakland High called the Khepera Pathway, which will steep African-American male students in entrepreneurship, social innovation and civic engagement, with help from a $750,000 grant from Google.While the programs are too young to be assessed, in the last two years chronic absenteeism and suspensions have dropped for black males in the district (come July, defiance will no longer be a suspension infraction). Last year, more than half the 52 students who started Manhood Development classes as freshmen \u2014 the first graduating class \u2014 headed off to college with scholarships from the local nonprofit East Bay College Fund.Perhaps most encouraging is the African American Male Achievement\u2019s honor roll for black students, male and female, with grade-point averages of 3.0 or above \u2014 an accomplishment celebrated every year at a raucous event attended by thousands at a gospel church. The percentage of young men on the roll has risen from 16 percent to 25 percent over the past three years.\u2022Each school day, Rahsaan Smith travels the city\u2019s vast economic, social and psychic divide, leaving the flatlands of East Oakland, synonymous with violence, for a middle school perched on a steep hill fragrant with eucalyptus. He is one of the few boys in Mr. Jennings\u2019s class with both a dad and a mom at home.Compared to a white child born in the Oakland Hills, a black child born in East Oakland is 21 times as likely to be poor and a third as likely to be reading at grade level in the fourth grade, according to the Alameda County Public Health Department.In a survey of 250 boys in Manhood Development classes, Vajra Watson, director of research and policy for equity at the University of California, Davis, found that half of middle school students had seen someone shot; by 10th grade, two-thirds had.More than anything, it is the deep relationships between instructors and students, many of whom grow up with no male figure at home, that hold the key to ending the soul-numbing disenfranchisement that so many young men experience at school. Teachers will often stop by to ask Manhood Development instructors for insights about particular students.\u201cYou have to have your hand on their pulse,\u201d said Earnest Jenkins III, who teaches the class at Oakland High, one of the city\u2019s most diverse schools.Mr. Jenkins has seen it all \u2014 \u201ccrack epidemic grandbabies,\u201d homeless students, the student who sells snacks at school as the family\u2019s only breadwinner, \u201cthe parent who tells her son to go out and sell this weed to pay the bills.\u201d And worst of all, \u201cthe trauma that nobody cares.\u201d\u201cYou have to erase eight or nine years of low or no expectations,\u201d Mr. Jenkins said. \u201cYou have to make them un-believe what they\u2019ve been taught to believe.\u201dShawn A. Ginwright, a professor of education in the Africana studies department at San Francisco State University, noted that in cities like Oakland, \u201cwhat shows up in the classroom is often the disinvestment outside of it.\u201d Profound, meaningful relationships with teachers \u201chelp students develop a sense of agency,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people are not going to school just to accumulate skill sets but also to broaden the vision for their lives.\u201dThat vision was nonexistent when Mr. Chatmon was in elementary school in South San Francisco in the early 1970s. The teachers \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do with my spirited energy,\u201d he recalled. In third grade, he was deemed so disruptive that the teacher moved his desk into the coat closet for two months, frequently shutting the door. In high school, he was told he \u201cdidn\u2019t have what it takes to get into college\u201d (he attended San Francisco State) and probably wouldn\u2019t graduate (he would go on to earn a master\u2019s degree in education from Brown).He vowed that, one day, he would be the best teacher ever to boys like himself rather than being \u201cundercut, demeaned and made to feel not smart.\u201dMr. Chatmon\u2019s background includes a stint as the principal of an alternative high school for formerly incarcerated and truant youth. The father of three sons, he radiates a sense of urgency beneath his signature Kangol caps. \u201cOur role is not to say, \u2018I caught you,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s to ask, \u2018What is our moral imperative and how does it show up in the education of our children?\u2019\u201dLamar Hancock, an instructor at Oakland Technical, the city\u2019s highest-ranking public high school, tries to retrieve the spark hidden within recalcitrant young men. \u201cI see students with passion burning in their brains whose parents are not academic,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for some kind of influence.\u201dHe stands outside the door of Room 141, shaking hands with each student as he enters class \u2014 a soft handshake or a lack of eye contact is a tip-off to something awry.\u201cSome teachers don\u2019t take you seriously when you raise your hand,\u201d said Morris Jackson, a junior who is active in the Black Student Union and tutors at a local elementary school. \u201cThey think you\u2019re just another ghetto black.\u201d Not so in Mr. Hancock\u2019s class. \u201cWhat drew me was the unity of African-American men,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWhen we disagree, we disagree respectfully. Coming to this class makes you want to stay and do better.\u201dA recent class discussion ricocheted from Marcus Garvey to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., James Brown and X-Men comics and a vocabulary lesson set to a jazz standard by Wayne Shorter. On \u201cbusiness excellence Thursdays,\u201d students dress the part.Manhood Development students are typically an academic mix, including high achievers and those needing extra help. Some sign up for a class year after year; some move on and then come back.Rickey Jackson, now a senior, almost failed his freshman year, burrowing into the school basement instead of attending class. At the time, his mother was in and out of the hospital with cancer. \u201cI gave up, so to speak,\u201d he said.Rickey and his siblings lived on their own, and when their mother died at age 57, Rickey called Mr. Hancock, who helped him make up nearly a year of school. He now has a 3.6 G.P.A. and recently went on an airplane for the first time to visit colleges. So far, he has gotten into six Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which reviewed his transcripts at a college fair and rendered an on-site decision. \u201cMy goal for Rickey was to hear the words \u2018I got accepted,\u2019\u2009\u201d Mr. Hancock said.Manhood Development strives to create a scaffold of resilience with a flotilla of black male professionals and college advisers who mentor high school students. It also organizes field trips to local colleges and universities.Once a week, fellows with the U.C. Berkeley Destination College Advising Corps advise the classes. A recent session for Mr. Hancock\u2019s juniors and seniors took creative license with \u201cJeopardy!\u201dOne category: \u201cMyths About Blacks in Education.\u201dFor $100: \u201cThere are more black men where than in prison?\u201d Answer: College.\u2022Work to elevate young African-American males is being done not just in Oakland but also in cities around the country. The Minneapolis Public Schools recently established its own Office of Black Male Student Achievement with a curriculum developed with the University of Minnesota. Last year, New York City, the nation\u2019s largest public school system, announced plans to hire 1,000 black, Latino and Asian male teachers (black men make up just 2 percent of the nation\u2019s teaching force).Some of the most heralded models are all-boys schools. Among them: Urban Prep Academies, a Chicago charter school with an all-black student body that famously boasts a 100 percent college acceptance rate. The school day on its three campuses runs from 8:30 to 4:30, not counting time for required extracurriculars, and students wear jackets and ties. (It\u2019s not for everyone: The school loses about a third of enrollees.)The District of Columbia Public Schools is working with Urban Prep\u2019s founder and C.E.O., Tim King, to develop a similar all-boys school as part of its $20 million Empowering Males of Color initiative. As in Oakland, the \u201csecret sauce\u201d is high expectations and paying close attention, Mr. King said.While admiring these efforts, some educators see potential pitfalls. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a lot to boost the self-esteem of these kids,\u201d said Pedro Noguera, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles. But he added: \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is for the other teachers to say, \u2018I don\u2019t have to worry about these students because the other instructor is taking care of it.\u2019\u201d Dr. Noguera would like to see a rigorous evaluation of the program. Understanding components that seem to be working would be beneficial to other districts grappling with equity issues, he said.Being embedded in a district also means students may still encounter what some researchers call \u201cthe soft bigotry of low expectations.\u201d\u201cThere has to be a focus on the cultural competence of white female teachers who work with black boys,\u201d said Shaun R. Harper, a professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough focus on, dare I say, remediating schoolteachers to effectively teach diverse students.\u201dTo Shawn Dove, head of the Campaign for Black Male Achievement, a national leadership network, the new programs are a result of America\u2019s unfinished business, centuries old. \u201cWhen you start to shift the culture, climate and language of an entire school district, you begin seeing changes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it takes time. It\u2019s not Jack-in-the-beanstalk work.\u201dAt Montera Middle School, Mr. Jennings encourages his students to set goals for themselves, whether it\u2019s straight A\u2019s or simply handing in their assignments on time. He frequently tells his students that \u201csuccess is addicting\u201d and enjoins them: \u201cSpeak loud and proud!\u201dHe writes their names on the board when they do something positive, instead of the other way around. He watches his young charges change \u201cnot just academically, but their character \u2014 what they believe about themselves and what they want people to know about them.\u201dAnthony Johnson, an Oakland Tech senior, recently won the Confidence Award at a national event for black men in Louisville, Ky. His goal is to be a pediatric nurse.\u201cThis is proof that what they teach us is not a myth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the ones who are going to set the bar.\u201dPatricia Leigh Brown is a former staff writer for The Times, and recently taught journalistic writing at Yale.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SiriusXM Fights to Dominate the Dashboard of the Connected Car", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byOn the 36th floor of a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, the actors Ice Cube and Kevin Hart joshed with fans inside a glass-walled radio studio one afternoon last month. They were in the broadcast headquarters of SiriusXM, and across the lobby, near Howard Stern\u2019s dedicated wing, Brooke Shields posed for selfies with three \u201cSesame Street\u201d puppets, while Senator Rand Paul \u2014 at that point, still a candidate for president \u2014 hovered with a small entourage. Overhead, a screen announced the imminent arrival of the thrash-metal band Anthrax.By any measure, it was an odd cross section of pop culture. Surveying the scene, Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM\u2019s chief content officer, smiled and declared, \u201cThis is how I like it \u2014 just this diverse.\u201dAt SiriusXM, the satellite-radio network, executives use terms like \u201cmosaic,\u201d \u201cbundle\u201d and, inevitably, \u201ccurated\u201d to describe the company\u2019s mix of programming. With more than 175 channels, SiriusXM has much more variety than typical AM/FM radio but a small fraction of the ads. It has channels dedicated to the Grateful Dead and the Metropolitan Opera; five feeds of thumping electronic dance music; every pro baseball, football and basketball game; and, of course, Mr. Stern\u2019s blend of raunchy humor and celebrity interviews. Around the Super Bowl, it had 162 hours of live programming related to the game that ran across 22 shows on 10 channels.Once flirting with bankruptcy, SiriusXM has quietly become a financial powerhouse at a time when other radio and digital music outlets are struggling to make a profit, and also as the behavior of so-called cord cutters \u2014 who cancel their cable TV subscriptions to pick and choose their entertainment online (and to save money) \u2014 has made Wall Street nervous about the future of bundled media. SiriusXM last year earned $510 million on $4.6 billion in revenue, and renewed major deals with Mr. Stern and the National Football League.\u201cThis has been a remarkable success story against huge odds,\u201d said Barton Crockett, a media analyst with FBR Capital Markets. \u201cMost of the investing public thought there was no way this would work, spending huge amounts of capital to launch satellites and put equipment in cars. But they were right. This is a great business.\u201dSiriusXM has hit on the formula for getting people \u2014 nearly 30 million of them \u2014 to pay for radio, a form of media that has always been free. But while the company likes to emphasize the awesomeness of its audio \u201cmosaics,\u201d there is another, more mundane, explanation for its success: cars.SiriusXM pays about $1 billion a year in subsidies and revenue splits to automakers, and according to the company, 75 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States come with satellite radio installed. (It works with every major carmaker.) Of the 29.6 million subscribers to SiriusXM at the end of last year, 24.2 million paid the $11 to $20 monthly fee themselves, with the rest covered through promotions by car companies.\u201cIf I ask myself two questions every day,\u201d James E. Meyer, SiriusXM\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview, \u201cthe first one is, \u2018What do I got to do to make sure people pay us $15?\u2019 The second one: \u2018What do I need to do to make sure that my position with the auto companies remains strong?\u2019\u201dYet cars are changing in ways that could threaten SiriusXM\u2019s position. New technologies, loosely referred to as the connected car, are bringing the Internet to the dashboard. For drivers, that means that various new audio apps \u2014 many of them free \u2014 will soon be available at a touch. For SiriusXM, that means a lot of new competition in the car, the place where consumers listen to radio the most. This process has already begun, with Apple and Google pushing for their own car media platforms, and Mr. Meyer said that he expected the technology to be in most new cars by the end of this decade. Will listeners still fork over $15 for SiriusXM if they can just as easily tune in to Spotify, Pandora or Beats 1 from Apple?\u201cThe major enemy of SiriusXM these days is Internet radio,\u201d said Jack Nerad, executive editorial director of Kelley Blue Book. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Sirius to be in automobiles, but I think that for the car companies, it\u2019s going to be just another programming source.\u201dMr. Meyer, who spent years managing the company\u2019s relationships with Detroit before he became chief executive in 2012, has been hearing this refrain for a long time. But he said that SiriusXM was well positioned for the change, with plans for a new, more interactive version of its radio system, code-named SXM17, and the advantage of knowing that car companies make changes to their machines very slowly. \u201cEven when you\u2019re Apple,\u201d Mr. Meyer said, \u201cthey will still live with the speed carmakers want to go.\u201dPhil Abram, the chief infotainment officer of General Motors, said that Pandora, as well as platforms like Apple\u2019s CarPlay and Google\u2019s Android Auto, have had no significant effect on how many of its customers subscribe to SiriusXM.\u201cPeople like to have a plethora of content,\u201d Mr. Abram said. \u201cOne day you might want to listen to music on your iPhone, the next day talk radio, and the next day you want a curated set of music from a company like SiriusXM. We want to try to make it as easy as possible for our customers to enjoy whichever they want.\u201dSatellite radio\u2019s fortunes have not always been so rosy. After years of planning and investment in the 1990s, the new medium began broadcasting in the early 2000s from two companies, Sirius and XM. For years both lost money as they competed to build their programming slates and sign multimillion-dollar deals with celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Martha Stewart.Gregory B. Maffei, Liberty\u2019s chief executive and the chairman of SiriusXM, recalled that at the time of the deal, a colleague told him, \u201cEither the world ends, or we\u2019re going to make a lot of money.\u201d They made a lot of money. SiriusXM repaid the loans in five months, and the roughly 62 percent stake that Liberty now has in the company \u2014 which is formally known as Sirius XM Holdings \u2014 is worth about $11 billion. SiriusXM\u2019s strategy for competing with free radio has been to give people a lot of the radio they like \u2014 music, sports, talk, news \u2014 and minimize what they do not, namely commercials. That means the station\u2019s programmers do not feel the ratings pressures that bedevil terrestrial radio.\u201cWhen you don\u2019t have ratings,\u201d Mr. Greenstein said, \u201cyou can be very open-minded about your belief in what might be a hit.\u201dAnother success story is \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good,\u201d an ode to monogamy by the clean-cut singer Andy Grammer that came out in late 2014. Steve Greenberg, the president of Mr. Grammer\u2019s label, S-Curve, believed the song had hit potential but was too quirky for terrestrial radio. So he pitched it to Kid Kelly, a SiriusXM programmer, who put the song into heavy rotation on Hits 1, the network\u2019s pop station.The song caught on and was soon selling 30,000 copies a week, almost entirely because of SiriusXM\u2019s exposure. But in the music business nothing happens in a vacuum, and after a few months, AM/FM stations began playing it, too. The song eventually sold about 2.5 million copies, making it one of the biggest hits of 2015.The success of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good\u201d underscores a fact that is often forgotten in the age of Spotify and YouTube: Radio remains popular and influential \u2014 according to Nielsen, 93 percent of adults tune in at least once a week \u2014 and music executives say that blanketing stations everywhere is still the most effective way to secure a hit.\u201cThere is absolutely no chance in the world that this record could have launched without the backing of Hits 1,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said of \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good.\u201d \u201cAnd there is no way it could have gone Top 10 without the backing of terrestrial radio.\u201dIf the connected car is a challenge looming in SiriusXM\u2019s future, the biggest threat in its recent past was the potential loss of Mr. Stern, perhaps the network\u2019s only indispensable star \u2014 \u201cthe heart and soul of SiriusXM,\u201d as Mr. Greenstein put it.Mr. Stern\u2019s contract was expiring at the end of last year, and speculation began to spread that he might abandon satellite radio for yet another media frontier. Don Buchwald, Mr. Stern\u2019s agent for more than 30 years, said that he met with dozens of companies, all promising to be an exciting new home for the show. Mr. Stern himself sometimes grumbled on and off the air about whether, at age 62, it was time to retire. Longtime fans have heard this one before, but Mr. Buchwald said it was genuine.\u201cPeople think it\u2019s a negotiating ploy, but I can tell you there is reality to it,\u201d said Mr. Buchwald, whose Manhattan office contains decades\u2019 worth of Howard Stern memorabilia, including an enormous cardboard theater stand for the 1997 movie \u201cPrivate Parts,\u201d released not long after Mr. Stern started calling himself \u201cking of all media.\u201d\u201cHe loved when he did the movie, he loved when he published the books, he loved the TV shows,\u201d Mr. Buchwald continued, \u201cand he\u2019s thinking, \u2018Why am I getting up at four o\u2019clock in the morning and doing the same drivel?\u2019\u201dAdding to the uncertainty about the negotiations was the fact that Mr. Buchwald was unfamiliar with Mr. Meyer, who commutes to New York each week from Indianapolis and has spent his entire career in operations \u2014 \u201cAll I ever wanted to be was a plant manager,\u201d he said \u2014 far away from the world of show business. (He took over from Mel Karmazin, who had a decades-long relationship with Mr. Stern but left SiriusXM in 2012 after battling publicly with Liberty over its plans to take over majority control.)Neither SiriusXM nor Mr. Buchwald would comment on the specific terms of the deal, but analysts say it could be worth $90 million a year, including salaries and production expenses for Mr. Stern\u2019s team.Mr. Meyer, whose New York office is mostly bare except for some landscape photos and jerseys of Indianapolis sports teams, was obviously pleased to have renewed Mr. Stern\u2019s contract, which both he and Mr. Buchwald called a particularly complex deal to negotiate.But Mr. Meyer was also proud of the broader programming surrounding Mr. Stern. He listens to SiriusXM\u2019s classic rock and outlaw country channels, he said, and hardly ever listens to terrestrial radio.\u201cToo many commercials,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The have-nots, which are the companies that are trying to raise now, are going to have to dramatically restructure their companies. The haves will thrive while the have-nots sadly may find themselves put out of business because they found themselves on the wrong side of the fund-raising cycle.\u201dDo you think Schreier is right?Here\u2019s what I think, informed by talking to people much smarter than myself: After the recession, we had a wealth of money flowing in from sources that weren\u2019t there just a few years before: sovereign wealth funds from Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Russia. You have hedge funds and other money managers whose clients want to diversify their investments. For that, they look to tech.On the other side, you have a preponderance of entrepreneurs who, for the last few years, have been able to toss out any stupid idea they wish and get at least a few million dollars thrown at them to pursue it. That behavior, according to the folks I talk to, is abnormal. There are too many start-ups on the market and too many bad ideas still limping along because the money hasn\u2019t dried up yet.So fast-forward to now. Public markets are insane. Investors are getting nervous, and the money faucets are closing off. The window for going through an initial public offering, at least in the next 12 to 18 months, seems to be much narrower than it has been over the last two years. So what does that mean?I like to think of it as \u201cThe Lion King\u201d meets \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\u201d Circle of life, and all that.Obviously, this won\u2019t be welcomed with open arms by all investors or start-ups. But the people I\u2019ve spoken with generally think this is a positive progression for the start-up environment as a whole, and a necessary cycle that will only happen over and over again. It\u2019s like nature. Death begets rebirth, ad infinitum.So things will be bad, but maybe not for everyone. That\u2019s good, right?Anyway, it started snowing again, so I guess my dog doo problem is temporarily fixed. How do people live in this city?See you soon!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Increasingly Muffled Press", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byEditorialThe Chinese media have never had much freedom to pursue muckraking stories, or even to dutifully report the facts. Now, President Xi Jinping is going to extraordinary lengths to rein the press in even further.Mr. Xi recently visited the three main newsrooms in the country to convey in unmistakable terms that journalists are expected to behave like apparatchiks. That message, which predictably received fawning coverage, came a few days after the government announced it would further restrict foreign media, too.Under rules Beijing says it will start enforcing next month, foreign companies will be barred from publishing online content \u2014 including text, videos, maps and games \u2014 in China without prior approval from the government. The regulations, which could affect major American companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, are intended to \u201cpromote core socialist values.\u201dThose stifling steps will add to the information barriers Chinese people already face. Major sites, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, which hundreds of millions of people around the globe use, are already blocked in China. The Chinese government began blocking access to the English and Chinese websites of The New York Times in 2012, in retaliation for an article that exposed the hidden wealth of relatives of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister.Mr. Xi may feel pressure to restrict the worldview of his citizens at a time when the Chinese economy is under strain. An article on Monday in the country\u2019s official English-language newspaper, China Daily, said news organizations were \u201cessential to political stability.\u201d\u201cIt is necessary for the media to restore people\u2019s trust in the party, especially as the economy has entered a new normal and suggestions that it is declining and dragging down the global economy have emerged,\u201d the article said.It is during trying times, of course, that societies benefit most from a press that is free to scrutinize questionable policies and expose ineffective leaders.Mr. Xi\u2019s new guidance is likely to make the official press even more docile than it traditionally has been. But the approach will be self-defeating for the government in the long run. In an increasingly interconnected world, it is harder to control the flow of information across borders and within countries. New mechanisms of Internet censorship are typically met with creative tools to bypass them. And each new effort to keep Chinese people ignorant about their government and the outside world will make them only more determined to learn.Advertisement"}

(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: An enthusiastic crowd is on hand here in the beautiful opera house at the Moore School of Music. Texas is the biggest prize next Tuesday, Super Tuesday, when 11 states vote, a day that will go a long way towards deciding who wins the Republican nomination.We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world. I\u2019m Wolf Blitzer. This debate is airing on CNN, CNN International, and CNN in Espanol. It\u2019s also being seen on Telemundo and heard on the Salem Radio Network. Telemundo and Salem are our partners in this debate, along with the Republican National Committee.We\u2019d also like to welcome a very special guest with us here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, the 41st president of the United States, George Herbert Walker Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush.(APPLAUSE)Everyone here is looking forward to a lively debate. I\u2019ll be your moderator tonight. Joining me in the questioning, Telemundo host Maria Celesta Arrasas, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash; and Salem Radio Network\u2019s Hugh Hewitt, who worked in the Reagan administration for six years.Tonight, there are five Republican candidates and they\u2019re ready to join us right now.Please welcome Ohio Governor John Kasich.(APPLAUSE)Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.(APPLAUSE)Businessman and real estate developer Donald Trump.(APPLAUSE)Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.(APPLAUSE)And retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson.(APPLAUSE)Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the Republican candidates for president of the United States.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Now please rise for our national anthem, performed by country music artist, Deana Carter.(THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you very much, Deana Carter. A beautiful, beautiful national anthem.The final debate before Super Tuesday begins right after this quick break. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston and the Republican presidential debate.The candidates, they are now in place. Their positions were selected based on their standing in the delegate race through Nevada, with the top candidate in the center and the others extending outward.I want to tell you how tonight\u2019s debate will work. As moderator, I will guide the discussion, asking questions and follow-ups, as will Maria Celeste, Dana Bash and Hugh Hewitt. Candidates, you\u2019ll have a minute and 15 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals. We have timing lights that are visible to the candidates. Those lights will warn you when your time is up, and as the candidates requested, a bell will sound like this.(BELL RINGS)We know you all want to jump and debate these critically important issues, but please wait until you\u2019re called on. These are the rules all of the candidates have agreed to.It\u2019s time for the candidates to introduce themselves right now. You\u2019ll each have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, you\u2019re first.CARSON: If someone had tried to describe today\u2019s America to you 30 years ago, you would have listened in disbelief. Americans know that our nation is heading off the abyss of destruction, secondary to divisiveness, fiscal irresponsibility, and failure to lead.Marco, Donald, Ted, John, we will not solve any of these problems by trying to destroy each other. What we need to do is be looking for solutions tonight. It\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s about the American people.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich?KASICH: Well, you know, on the way over here, even getting ready earlier and sitting in the green room and watching the early coverage, you know, my father carried mail on his back and his father was a coal miner and my mother\u2019s mother was an immigrant, could barely speak English. And I\u2019m standing on this stage. It\u2019s pretty remarkable. But I want to tell you, there\u2019s a lot of young people watching tonight. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. America is an amazing country, where a kid like me can grow up to run for president of the United States and be on this stage tonight. So to all the young people that are out there, your hopes, your dreams, pursue them. Shoot for the stars. America\u2019s great, and you can do it. Thank you, Wolf.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Well, thank you. This election, we have to decide the identity of America in the 2ist century, but as part of this primary, we have to find out our identity as a party and as a movement.Thirty-six years ago, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush began the Reagan Revolution. For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we\u2019re simply going to become a party that preys on people\u2019s angers and fears.I hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it\u2019s been in its story history.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: Welcome to Texas.(APPLAUSE)Here, Texas provided my family with hope. Here, my mom became the first in her family ever to go to college. Here, my dad fled Cuba and washed dishes, making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas. I graduated from high school at Second Baptist not too far away from here. CRUZ: When I ran for Senate, I promised 27 million Texans I would fight for you every day, and not for the Washington bosses.And, I\u2019ll tell you, as I travel the state, Democrats tell me I didn\u2019t vote for you, but you\u2019re doing what you said you would do. And, as president, I will do the same.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We don\u2019t win anymore as a country. We don\u2019t win with trade, we don\u2019t win with the military. ISIS, we can\u2019t even knock out ISIS, and we will, believe me. We will.We don\u2019t win in any capacity with healthcare. We have terrible health care, Obamacare is going to be repealed and replaced. We just don\u2019t win.You look at our borders, they\u2019re like swiss cheese, everybody pours in.We\u2019re going to make a great country again. We\u2019re going to start winning again. We\u2019re going to win a lot, it\u2019s going to be a big difference, believe me. It\u2019s going to be a big difference.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you very much. It\u2019s now time to begin questions. Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded, and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.Immigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So, that\u2019s where we begin.Mr. Trump, you\u2019ve called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. You\u2019ve also promised to let what you call, \u201cthe good ones\u201d, come back in. Your words, \u201cthe good ones\u201d, after they\u2019ve been deported.Senator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says that\u2019s the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty. Is it?TRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they\u2019ve been debating this every debate that we\u2019ve had.As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking, and you wouldn\u2019t have asked that as the first question if it weren\u2019t for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn\u2019t even be a big subject.But, we either have a country, or we don\u2019t have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back \u2014 some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that\u2019s very fair, and very fine.They\u2019re going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they\u2019re going to come back through a process.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, what\u2019s wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, \u201cthe good ones\u201d come back to the United States?CRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country \u2014 our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs. Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.You know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what\u2019s happened there \u2014 it was a very interesting article.Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they\u2019re spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars. And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That\u2019s who we need to be fighting for.Listen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that\u2019s why I will do the same thing as president.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, I\u2019m very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio?RUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama\u2019s. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.Are those claims correct?RUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I\u2019ve been abundantly clear on this. When I\u2019m president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border. And, that\u2019s not just the physical border with Mexico, it\u2019s Visa overstays. That\u2019s 45 percent of the problem right there.RUBIO: It also has to do \u2014 that\u2019s why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, we\u2019re not doing anything else. And then we\u2019ll see what the American people are willing to support.And Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he\u2019s now taking are new to him.In 2011, he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you\u2019ve hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.My mom and dad \u2014 my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.So I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it\u2019s an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years, but finally needs to be solved once and for all.BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that\u2019s the way I define it, is you\u2019re going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.As far as the people that I\u2019ve hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It\u2019s the up season. People didn\u2019t want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn\u2019t get.Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn\u2019t get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.RUBIO: That \u2014 my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.TRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That\u2019s what I criticize Mitt Romney \u2014 I mean, ran...RUBIO: No, he...TRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That\u2019s an election that should have been won.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Well, in fact, I agree we should have won and I wished we would have, but, in fact, you did criticize him for using the term \u201cself-deportation.\u201d I mean, that\u2019s on the record and people can look it up right now online.But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it\u2019s really important, this point. I think it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.But I also think that if you\u2019re going to claim that you\u2019re the only one that lifted this into the campaign, that you acknowledge that, for example, you\u2019re only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.You hired some workers from Poland...TRUMP: No, no, I\u2019m the only one on the stage that\u2019s hired people. You haven\u2019t hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: In fact, some of the people...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: And by the way, I\u2019ve hired \u2014 and by the way, I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You\u2019ve hired nobody.RUBIO: Yes, you\u2019ve hired a thousand from another country...TRUMP: You\u2019ve had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don\u2019t tell me about that.RUBIO: Let me just say \u2014 let me finish the statement. This is important.TRUMP: You haven\u2019t hired one person, you liar.RUBIO: He hired workers from Poland. And he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from...TRUMP: That\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s wrong. Totally wrong.RUBIO: That\u2019s a fact. People can look it up. I\u2019m sure people are Googling it right now. Look it up. \u201cTrump Polish workers,\u201d you\u2019ll see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did it.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: That happened.TRUMP: I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...RUBIO: Many from other countries instead of hiring Americans.TRUMP: Be quiet. Just be quiet.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Let me talk. I\u2019ve hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.RUBIO: You paid a million dollars.TRUMP: And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: But I\u2019ve hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?CRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That\u2019s existing law.But let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration. I can tell you, when I ran for Senate here in the state of Texas, I ran promising to lead the fight against amnesty, promising to fight to build a wall. And in 2013, when I was fight against the \u201cgang of eight\u201d amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the \u201cgang of eight,\u201d one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill. CRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans. And when you\u2019re funding open border politicians, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they fight for open borders.And I think if you want to know who actually will secure the borders and follow through, you ought to ask who has a record before they were a candidate for president of fighting to secure the borders and stop amnesty. And I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I can only say this, and I\u2019ve said it loud and clear and I\u2019ve said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now \u2014 your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they\u2019re packed with you.I\u2019ve had an amazing relationship with politicians \u2014 with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he\u2019s a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.You get along with nobody. You don\u2019t have one Republican \u2014 you don\u2019t have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don\u2019t have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don\u2019t have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz?CRUZ: You know, I actually think Donald is right. He is promising if he\u2019s elected he will go and cut deals in Washington. And he\u2019s right. He has supported \u2014 he has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be hiring illegal immigrants. Anyone who really cared about illegal immigration wouldn\u2019t be funding Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi; wouldn\u2019t be funding the Gang of Eight. And, you know, he is right. When you stand up to Washington, when you honor the promise you made to the men and women who elected you and say enough with the corruption, enough with the cronyism, let\u2019s actually stand for the working men and women of this country, Washington doesn\u2019t like it.And Donald, if you want to be liked in Washington, that\u2019s not a good attribute for a president.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Here\u2019s a man \u2014 Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn\u2019t even put that he\u2019s borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didn\u2019t talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he\u2019s going to protect the people from the big bad banks.Give me a break.BLITZER: All right. We\u2019re going to move on to Governor Kasich.Governor Kasich...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Wolf, can I respond to that attack?BLITZER: You can respond, but let me get Governor Kasich in. He\u2019s been waiting patiently.Governor Kasich, the idea \u2014 you\u2019ve said this, and I want to quote you now: \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it.\u201d Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it\u2019s not feasible to stop them?KASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem \u2014 a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked. It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.Look, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it\u2019s done, you don\u2019t have a right to come in. If you come in, we don\u2019t want any excuse. You\u2019re going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it\u2019s practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans \u2014 the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, I\u2019d make them pay a fine, some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I\u2019d give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to tear families apart. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to ride around in people\u2019s neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don\u2019t think \u2014 first of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical and I don\u2019t think it reflects America.You know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn\u2019t get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day, let\u2019s be practical. Let\u2019s start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)Dr. Carson, you\u2019ve been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don\u2019t think Mr. Trump\u2019s plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters, do you still believe that?CARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I\u2019ve already described \u2014 you know, how we can secure the border.We need to secure all the borders, because it\u2019s not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.But in terms of the people who are here already, after we \u2014 after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker, assuming that they have an acceptable record.They have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don\u2019t have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.If they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that\u2019s the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.And we have other ways of \u2014 of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don\u2019t feel the need to come over here. That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)Mr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.TRUMP: (inaudible).BLITZER: It\u2019s about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You\u2019ve said the Mexican government will pay for it.TRUMP: Correct.BLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen. In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox \u2014 he said today, and I\u2019m quoting him \u2014 he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay for that,\u201d quote, \u201ceffing wall.\u201d(LAUGHTER)So if you don\u2019t get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?TRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.(APPLAUSE)It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that \u2014 I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn\u2019t include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.We\u2019re going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it\u2019ll end up costing $200 billion.(APPLAUSE)But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 \u2014 you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago \u2014 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it\u2019s a real wall. This is a wall that\u2019s a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you\u2019re looking at. This is a wall that\u2019s going to work.Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...(BELL RINGS)... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It\u2019s a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: If the \u2014 if the Mexicans don\u2019t pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?TRUMP: Well, you know, I don\u2019t mind trade wars when we\u2019re losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We\u2019re losing so much. (APPLAUSE)We\u2019re losing so much with Mexico and China \u2014 with China, we\u2019re losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, \u201cdon\u2019t we want to trade?\u201d I don\u2019t mind trading, but I don\u2019t want to lose $500 billion. I don\u2019t want to lose $58 billion.Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They\u2019re building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.And I always say I\u2019m not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They\u2019re taking our businesses. I don\u2019t mind.BLITZER: Thank you. Senator Rubio?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: Yeah, a couple points. If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he\u2019ll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it. The second...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Such a cute sound bite.RUBIO: But it \u2014 no, it\u2019s not a sound bite. It\u2019s a fact. Again, go online and Google it. Donald Trump, Polish workers. You\u2019ll see it.The second thing, about the trade war \u2014 I don\u2019t understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in Mexico and in China. So you\u2019re gonna be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.TRUMP: All right, you know what?RUBIO: Why don\u2019t you make them in America?TRUMP: Because they devalue their currency \u2014 they devalue their currencies...RUBIO: Well, then make them in America.TRUMP: ... that makes it \u2014 well, you don\u2019t know a thing about business. You lose on everything...RUBIO: Well, make them in America. TRUMP: Let me just tell you \u2014 they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.RUBIO: Well then, make them in America.TRUMP: That makes it \u2014 well, you don\u2019t know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.RUBIO: Well, make them in America.TRUMP: Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...RUBIO: And so you make them in China and in Russia.TRUMP: But you wouldn\u2019t know anything about it because you\u2019re a lousy businessman.RUBIO: Well, I don\u2019t know anything about bankrupting four companies. You\u2019ve bankrupted..TRUMP: No, I \u2014 and you know why? You know why?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: I don\u2019t know anything about...TRUMP: You know why?RUBIO: ... starting a university, and that was a fake university.BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: First of all...BLITZER: One at a time.TRUMP: ... first of all, that\u2019s called a...RUBIO: There are people who borrowed $36,000...BLITZER: Hold on. One at a time, Mr. Trump.RUBIO: ... to go to Trump University, and they\u2019re suing now \u2014 $36,000 to go to a university...TRUMP: And by the way \u2014 and by the way...RUBIO: ... that\u2019s a fake school.TRUMP: ... and by the way...RUBIO: And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump...TRUMP: ... I\u2019ve won most of the lawsuits.RUBIO: That\u2019s what they got for $36,000.BLITZER: All right, I want to move on.TRUMP: And they actually did a very good job, but I\u2019ve won most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, Senator, I want to bring in...RUBIO: Most of the lawsuits.BLITZER: ... I want to bring in my colleague Maria Celeste.TRUMP: Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?BLITZER: You\u2019re allowed \u2014 you\u2019ve been responding.TRUMP: OK. Well let \u2014 no, I haven\u2019t. I really haven\u2019t.(LAUGHTER)RUBIO: He\u2019s talked through the whole thing.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Here\u2019s a guy \u2014 here\u2019s a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who\u2019s probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we\u2019re going to have as president.RUBIO: Here\u2019s a guy that inherited $200 million. If he hadn\u2019t inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be right now?TRUMP: No, no, no.RUBIO: Selling watches in (inaudible)(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: (Inaudible) I took...RUBIO: That\u2019s where he would be. TRUMP: That is so wrong. We\u2019ll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.RUBIO: Oh, OK. One million.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million...RUBIO: Better release your tax returns so we can see how much money he made.TRUMP: I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...RUBIO: Oh, he doesn\u2019t make that money.TRUMP: ... more than $10 billion.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. I want to bring in Maria Celeste of Telemundo. Maria?CELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama\u2019s executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.RUBIO: Correct.ARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I\u2019m going to quote you (in Spanish) which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to cancel it immediately.So Senator Rubio, what changed?RUBIO: It didn\u2019t change.ARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?RUBIO: No, it\u2019s the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will \u2014 we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not compassionate to the plight of a 2 \u2014 someone who came here when they were 2 years old. I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.The problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn\u2019t have the power to do that.(APPLAUSE)And he himself admitted that.ARRASAS: Senator, Senator...RUBIO: I\u2019m sorry, but let me finish my...ARRASAS: ... but you went \u2014 you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.RUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional. I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.Now, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can\u2019t solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English. So in what sense did he lie?RUBIO: Because it is not true that I\u2019m not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don\u2019t even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away. But I will cancel the executive order as soon as I take \u2014 as soon as I step foot into the Oval Office.TRUMP: I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.RUBIO: You lied about the Polish workers.TRUMP: Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.RUBIO: You lied to the students at Trump University.ARRASAS: Let Senator Cruz jump in.RUBIO: Oh, he lied 38 years ago. All right, I guess there\u2019s a statute of limitation on lies.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Well Maria, I would note you made the exact same point here that I made at the last debate, and you\u2019re right that Senator Rubio called me a liar for saying that. CRUZ: You know, we\u2019ve both seen at home when Washington politicians say about an illegal, or unconstitutional program. Well, it\u2019ll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.That, inevitably, is when a politician doesn\u2019t plan to end it at all.You know, I\u2019m reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists, took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.Marco\u2019s position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.RUBIO: That\u2019s not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away. I don\u2019t agree with the mandate and the program that\u2019s in place, but I think it\u2019s unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we\u2019re just going to yank it away from them.And, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is \u2014 at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply. That is the end of DACA.I am sympathetic to this cause, but once again, it cannot supersede the Constitution of the United States which this president habitually and routinely every single day ignores and violates.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Senator Cruz, you and Senator Rubio are the two candidates of hispanic descent on this stage. As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.(APPLAUSE)And yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them, that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.So, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?CRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.You know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you\u2019re liberal. That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.At the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.You know, we\u2019ve got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned, and I campaigned the same here in Houston or Dallas as I did in the Rio Grande Valley, defending conservative principles, defending judeo- Christian principals, telling my father\u2019s story.Telling my Dad\u2019s story of coming to America with $100 dollars in his underwear, not speaking English, washing dishes, having hopes and dreams for the American dream. And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community. It is not working in the hispanic community, and I...(BELL RINGING)CRUZ: ... fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the American dream.RUBIO: I\u2019m sorry I was mentioned...ARRASAS: ... Governor Kasich.RUBIO: Maria I was mentioned in that. I was mentioned in that statement.ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the...RUBIO: ... OK. I was mentioned \u2014 just because of the hispanic \u2014 and I\u2019ll be brief.A couple points, number one, I do think it\u2019s amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)And, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.Yes, it\u2019s an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I\u2019m going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That\u2019s what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos. Guidelines as to how to accomplish that were spelled out in an autopsy (ph) report that concluded, and I\u2019m going to quote it, \u201cif hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn\u2019t want them in the United States they won\u2019t pay attention to our next sentence.\u201dSo, do you think that your fellow Republican candidates get it?KASICH: Well, I\u2019m not going to talk about that. I mean, I\u2019ve got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don\u2019t like all this yelling and screaming at the debates. My mother\u2019s thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.I think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I\u2019m going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven\u2019t changed anything with it.And, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it? Common sense regulations, lower taxes for both business and individuals, and, of course, a fiscal plan that balances the budget.That gives you economic growth. I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman, negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.But here\u2019s the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.Of course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.It\u2019s what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community, I think they like me. And I appreciate that, because I want them to have the same opportunity that I and my children and my wife and the people we love have had in this country.It\u2019s time to solve problems.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Dr. Carson, concerning this recommendation of the report, are you, as a candidate, getting it?CARSON: I didn\u2019t hear the first part of the question?ARRASAS: The first part of the question is, there was a report that recommended that in order to approach Hispanics and bring them to vote for the Republican Party, certain things needed to happen.And one of them was that they shouldn\u2019t feel like they were going to get kicked out of the United States, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.CARSON: OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.And the reason that I don\u2019t fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are \u2014 that give liberty and justice to all people.And that\u2019s the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that. And I think that\u2019s the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don\u2019t pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.But real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America. When we begin to emphasize that, I think we will attract everybody.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: Mr. Trump, it is common knowledge that the Hispanic vote is very important in this race. You keep saying that Hispanics love you.TRUMP: True.(LAUGHTER)ARRASAS: And, yes, you won the Hispanic vote in Nevada.TRUMP: True.ARRASAS: But a brand new Telemundo poll says that three out of four Hispanics that vote nationwide have a negative opinion of you. They don\u2019t like you. Wouldn\u2019t that make you an unelectable...TRUMP: No.ARRASAS: ... candidate in a general election?TRUMP: First of all, I don\u2019t believe anything Telemundo says.ARRASAS: You used to say that you love...(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They\u2019re incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women.I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.They get it. They\u2019re incredible people. They\u2019re incredible workers. They get it. And I\u2019ve won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn\u2019t maybe win the Telemundo poll.But one thing I\u2019m also going to do, I\u2019m going to be getting \u2014 bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you\u2019re seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting.And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.TRUMP: We\u2019re getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one \u2014 the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.TRUMP: New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: For the record, you have said publicly that you loved Telemundo in the past. But it is not just a Telemundo poll. We have...TRUMP: I love them. I love them.(APPLAUSE)ARRASAS: All right. Well, it\u2019s not the only poll.TRUMP: They\u2019re fine. Do you know what? They\u2019re fine.ARRASAS: Just last night \u2014 let me \u2014 let me finish, please.Just last night, The Washington Post showed that 80 percent of Hispanic voters in their polls have a negative view of you. And concerning the Nevada victory, allow me to explain that the poll in Nevada was based on a tiny sample, statistically insignificant of only about 100 \u2014 let me finish please \u2014 of 100 Hispanic Republicans in the state of Nevada.TRUMP: Why did they take the poll? Why did they...(CROSSTALK)ARRASAS: I am making reference \u2014 I am making reference to Hispanic voters nationwide in a general election.TRUMP: I\u2019m just telling you, I\u2019m doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision. It was settled. We\u2019re good friends now. It was all settled up.(LAUGHTER)Very happy, very happy. Very good people.I\u2019m just telling you \u2014 I\u2019m just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I\u2019m telling you also, I\u2019m bringing people, Democrats over and I\u2019m bringing independents over, and we\u2019re building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.I want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.Hugh?HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.To me, it\u2019s the most important issue. I\u2019ll start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?CRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it \u2014 Justice Scalia\u2019s passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election. Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.Now, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this \u2014 this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I\u2019m certain if you took a survey, everyone would say they would do that.But the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.I\u2019ve spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they\u2019re asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court? I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies \u2014 all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it\u2019s repealed, it was a five-four decision, they\u2019re going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.Will you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint, not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?TRUMP: Yes, I would. And I\u2019ve been there. And I\u2019ve been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it\u2019s not anybody\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not Ted\u2019s fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way \u2014 no way that he should have approved Obamacare.Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don\u2019t want.HEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz\u2019s criticism?CRUZ: Well, listen \u2014 Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, it\u2019s true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.But I would not have nominated John Roberts. I would have nominated my former boss, Mike Luttig, who was the strongest proven conservative on the court of appeals. And I\u2019ll tell you, Hugh...(APPLAUSE)... you know, it\u2019s interesting now that Donald promises that he will appoint justices who \u2014 who will defend religious liberty, but this is a man who, for 40 years, has given money to Jimmy Carter, to Joe Biden, to Hillary Clinton, to Chuck Schumer, to Harry Reid.Nobody who supports far-left liberal Democrats who are fighting for judicial activists can possibly care about having principled constitutionalists on the court.And what Donald has told us is he will go to Washington...(BELL RINGS)... and cut a deal.HEWITT: Mr. Trump...CRUZ: So that means on Supreme Court...HEWITT: ... can I...CRUZ: ... he\u2019s going to look to cut a deal, rather than fight for someone who won\u2019t cut a deal on the Constitution, but will defend it faithfully.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Can I trust you on religious liberty?TRUMP: Well, let \u2014 let me \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted \u2014 and I respected it, but he gets nowhere \u2014 stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that\u2019s going to make deals.It\u2019s wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted\u2019s been very critical \u2014 I have a sister who\u2019s a brilliant...HEWITT: Mr. Cruz, will you make a deal about religious liberty?TRUMP: ... excuse me. She\u2019s a brilliant judge. He\u2019s been criticizing \u2014 he\u2019s been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill.So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?HEWITT: Let me \u2014 Senator.CRUZ: Let me tell you right now, Donald, I will not apologize for a minute for defending the Constitution. I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)And I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can\u2019t have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You\u2019ve got to be willing to cut a deal.And you know, there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald \u2014 Donald Trump.Why? Because Donald has supported him in the past, and he knows he can cut a deal with him.(BELL RINGS)You know what, Donald...(CROSSTALK)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.CRUZ: ... I don\u2019t want a Supreme Court justice that you cut a deal with Harry Reid to undermine religious liberty, because that same justice will also erase the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot \u2014 give me a break.HEWITT: Senator Rubio, you\u2019ve heard this exchange on religious liberty. You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?RUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here \u2014 the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.Justice Scalia \u2014 in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document \u2014 it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia \u2014 plus there may be at least two other vacancies.So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.Now, if he\u2019s changed, we\u2019re always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don\u2019t have a record there to look at and say, \u201cI feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he\u2019s going to be firmly on our side on these issues.\u201dIn fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood. He says he\u2019s not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.And so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.HEWITT: Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: Well, let \u2014 let me just say \u2014 let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative \u2014 more importantly, he was a great president. A great president.As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I\u2019m pro-life. I\u2019m totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women \u2014 cervical cancer, breast cancer \u2014 are helped by Planned Parenthood.So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn\u2019t fund it.I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don\u2019t know what percentage it is. They say it\u2019s 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I\u2019m pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Governor Kasich, back to religious liberty. You\u2019ve been a little bit less emphatic. You\u2019ve said, same-sex couple approaches a cupcake maker, sell them a cupcake. Can we trust you as much on religious liberty as the rest of these people? KASICH: Well, you know, , of course. I mean, if \u2014 look, I was involved in just being a pioneer in a new church. Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.Now, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don\u2019t favor it. I\u2019ve always favored traditional marriage, but, look, the court has ruled and I\u2019ve moved on. And what I\u2019ve said, Hugh, is that, look, where does it end?If you\u2019re in the business of selling things, if you\u2019re not going to sell to somebody you don\u2019t agree with, OK, today I\u2019m not going to sell to somebody who\u2019s gay, and tomorrow maybe I won\u2019t sell to somebody who\u2019s divorced.I mean, if you\u2019re in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That\u2019s my view. And if you don\u2019t agree with their lifestyle, say a prayer for them when they leave and hope they change their behavior.But when it comes to the religious institutions, they are in inviolate in my mind, and I would fight for those religious institutions. And look, I\u2019ve appointed over a hundred judges as governor. I even appointed adjudge to the Ohio Supreme Court.And you know what they are? They\u2019re conservatives. Go check it out. They are conservatives. They don\u2019t make the law. They interpret the law. That\u2019s all they do. And they stick by the Constitution. So I will do that.But let\u2019s just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that. I think my position is clear.HEWITT: Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you. Are their positions clear?(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Are the positions you\u2019ve heard clear about the First Amendment and the first freedom?CARSON: Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia. I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights. And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights. So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it. That\u2019s unfair.And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done. That\u2019s why we have divided government. And we\u2019re going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.And as president, I would go through and I would look at what a person\u2019s life has been. What have they done in the past? What kind of judgments have they made? What kind of associations do they have? That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.BLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let\u2019s talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it. I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.BASH: Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good. So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you\u2019re worried he won\u2019t?RUBIO: The individual mandate. He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don\u2019t believe that should be part of it. That should not remain there. I think here\u2019s what we need to replace it with.We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.And if you don\u2019t have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn\u2019t just bad for health care, it\u2019s bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people\u2019s hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate. Would you respond?TRUMP: I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We\u2019re going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I\u2019m referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.I think we need it. I think it\u2019s a modern age. And I think we have to have it.(APPLAUSE)BASH: OK, so let\u2019s talk about pre-existing conditions. What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance. Are they wrong?TRUMP: I think they\u2019re wrong 100 percent. What we need \u2014 look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. TRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got \u2014 I\u2019m not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they\u2019re part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.And, actually, the Governor too, let\u2019s just talk about these too, OK?(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Because I don\u2019t think the Governor had too much to do with this.But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there\u2019s great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.I\u2019m self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I\u2019m going to do what\u2019s right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there\u2019s serious, serious competition.BASH But, Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... And, you\u2019re going to see \u2014 excuse me. You\u2019re going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they\u2019re making a fortune.(APPLAUSE)BASH: But, just to be specific here, what you\u2019re saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...TRUMP: That\u2019s going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren\u2019t going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say \u2014 they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they\u2019re friends of mine. The top guys, they\u2019re friends of mine. I shouldn\u2019t tell you guys, you\u2019ll say it\u2019s terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They\u2019re friends of mine, there\u2019s some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He\u2019s not laughing so much anymore.Hi.(APPLAUSE)Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we\u2019ll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.RUBIO: Dana, I was mentioned in his response, so if I may about the insurance companies...BASH: ... Go ahead.RUBIO: You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don\u2019t follow this stuff very closely, but here\u2019s what happened. When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund. The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that. They\u2019re suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.Here\u2019s what you didn\u2019t hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan? I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means. This is not a game where you draw maps...TRUMP: ... And, you don\u2019t know what it means...RUBIO: ... What is your plan, Mr. Trump?(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: What is your plan on healthcare?TRUMP: You don\u2019t know.BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: ... The biggest problem...(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan...TRUMP: ... The biggest problem, I\u2019ll have you know...RUBIO: ... What\u2019s your plan... TRUMP: ... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he\u2019s got is he really doesn\u2019t know about the lines. The biggest thing we\u2019ve got, and the reason we\u2019ve got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....RUBIO: ... We already mentioned that (inaudible) plan, I know what that is, but what else is part of your plan...TRUMP: ... You don\u2019t know much...RUBIO: ... So, you\u2019re only thing is to get rid of the lines around the states. What else is part of your healthcare plan...TRUMP: ... The lines around the states...RUBIO: ... That\u2019s your only plan...TRUMP: ... and, it was almost done \u2014 not now...RUBIO: ... Alright, (inaudible)...TRUMP: ... Excuse me. Excuse me.RUBIO: ... His plan. That was the plan...TRUMP: ... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you\u2019ll have many. They\u2019ll compete, and it\u2019ll be a beautiful thing.RUBIO: Alright...(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: So, that\u2019s the only part of the plan? Just the lines?BASH: (inaudible)TRUMP: The nice part of the plan \u2014 you\u2019ll have many different plans. You\u2019ll have competition, you\u2019ll have so many different plans.RUBIO: Now he\u2019s repeating himself.TRUMP: No, no, no.(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible)RUBIO: (inaudible)(CHEERING)TRUMP: (inaudible) I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago... RUBIO: ... I just watched you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I\u2019ve never seen it in anybody...BASH: ... Let\u2019s stay focused on the subject...TRUMP: ... I thought he came out of the swimming pool...RUBIO: ... I see him repeat himself every night, he says five things, everyone\u2019s dumb, he\u2019s gonna make America great again...BASH: ... Senator Rubio...RUBIO: ... We\u2019re going to win, win win, he\u2019s winning in the polls...BASH: ... Senator Rubio, please.RUBIO: ... And the lines around the state.(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: ... Every night.BASH: Senator Rubio.(CHEERING)UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I tell the truth, I tell the truth.BASH: Senator Rubio, you will have time to respond if you would just let Mr. Trump respond to what you\u2019ve just posed to him...RUBIO: ... Yeah, he\u2019s going to give us his plan now, right? OK...BASH: ... If you could talk a little bit more about your plan. I know you talked about...TRUMP: ... We\u2019re going to have many different plans because...BASH: ... Can you be a little specific...TRUMP: ... competition...RUBIO: ... He\u2019s done it again.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies. They\u2019re going to have many, many different plans. BASH: Is there anything else you would like to add to that...TRUMP: No, there\u2019s nothing to add.(CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: What is to add?BASH: Thank you. Thank you both.RUBIO: Alright.BASH: Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve said it is, quote, \u201cUn American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition.\u201dBASH: Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?KASICH: No, I wouldn\u2019t. And \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions. You don\u2019t want any American to lose their house, everything they\u2019ve saved, because they get sick. Now, I think it is more complicated than what we\u2019ve heard here tonight. We\u2019re actually running significant health reform in my state.I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons. I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don\u2019t want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.And then we\u2019re driving towards total transparency. If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it\u2019s easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill. The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.And I\u2019ll tell you what we will do. We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices. We actually are going to make the market work.BASH: Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate. In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?KASICH: Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tenable. And we don\u2019t need to do that. Again, I\u2019m telling you that we are going to \u2014 we have a proposal, a plan that we\u2019re enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you\u2019re providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint \u2014 some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare. Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they\u2019re going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can\u2019t afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We\u2019re actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go \u2014 this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what\u2019s going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.We don\u2019t want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.Our primary care physicians need help. They need support. We\u2019re losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.BASH: Governor Kasich, thank you.KASICH: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?CARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats. And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad\u2019s $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody\u2019s going to hide his cigarettes because they\u2019re all interested in what\u2019s going on there.Also, the \u2014 your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare. So, it\u2019s like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What\u2019s the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.CARSON: But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all \u2014 they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.BLITZER: Thank you.CARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don\u2019t get to talk that much. And, you know, let\u2019s...(APPLAUSE)... you can have the money that\u2019s left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that\u2019s probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.BLITZER: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)Thank you, Dr. Carson. Let\u2019s talk about the economy. Let\u2019s talk about...CRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?BLITZER: I want to move on, but there\u2019ll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...CRUZ: It\u2019s kind of an issue I have a long history with.BLITZER: I know you do. And \u2014 all right, go ahead.(LAUGHTER)CRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.KASICH: How do you \u2014 how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You\u2019re very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.(APPLAUSE)On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far, it\u2019s killed millions of jobs, and it\u2019s hurting people\u2019s health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.What he\u2019s said is government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you\u2019re heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you\u2019re a small business owner, Donald Trump\u2019s socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you\u2019re elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it\u2019s been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don\u2019t get that hip replacement, you don\u2019t get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.I\u2019ll tell you this. As president...BLITZER: Senator...CRUZ: ... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it\u2019s going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn\u2019t work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.CRUZ: Donald, true or false, you\u2019ve said the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care.TRUMP: That\u2019s false.CRUZ: You\u2019ve never said that?TRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...CRUZ: But you\u2019ve never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.TRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.CRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you have no heart.TRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I\u2019m president.CRUZ: Have you said you\u2019re a liberal on health care?TRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...CRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.TRUMP: If people \u2014 my plan is very simple. I will not \u2014 we\u2019re going to have private \u2014 we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I\u2019m president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...CRUZ: So does the government pay for everyone\u2019s health care?TRUMP: ... I\u2019m not fine with it. We are going to take those people...CRUZ: Yes or no. Just answer the question.TRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We\u2019re going to make great deals on it, but we\u2019re not going to let them die in the streets.CRUZ: Who pays for it?RUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?BLITZER: Gentleman, please.RUBIO: Wolf, no. I want to clarify something.BLITZER: Gentlemen please. I want to move on.RUBIO: This is a Republican debate, right? Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...BLITZER: I want to talk about the economy.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentleman, gentleman. All of you have agreed \u2014 Senator Cruz...TRUMP: You know what? Call it what you want.CRUZ: It\u2019s a yes or no.TRUMP: Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.BLITZER: All of you have agreed \u2014 all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. We\u2019re talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn\u2019t saddled with even more debt? TRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We\u2019ll be dynamic again. If you look at what\u2019s going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world.It\u2019s shutting off our economy. It\u2019s shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can\u2019t get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.BLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?TRUMP: We\u2019re going to make many cuts in business. We\u2019re getting rid of \u2014 we\u2019re going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education \u2014 Common Core is out. We\u2019re going local. Have to go local.(APPLAUSE)Environmental protection \u2014 we waste all of this money. We\u2019re going to bring that back to the states. And we\u2019re going to have other (inaudible) many things. (APPLAUSE)We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.BLITZER: Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump. If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that\u2019s about $68 billion. If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that\u2019s about $8 billion. That\u2019s about $76 billion for those two agencies.The current deficit this year is $544 billion. Where are you going to come up with the money?TRUMP: Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse.(APPLAUSE)You look at what\u2019s happening with Social Security, you look \u2014 look at what\u2019s happening with every agency \u2014 waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.BLITZER: Governor Kasich.(APPLAUSE)When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had. Can Mr. Trump\u2019s plan work?KASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I\u2019ve done it. I mean, I \u2014 we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington \u2014 every single one of them \u2014 and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.And why do you do it? Because you want job growth. If you don\u2019t have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won\u2019t get there. You will never be able to do it.Now, I \u2014 I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts \u2014 the biggest of any governor in the country \u2014 and we have a fiscal plan.And it\u2019s not all \u2014 it\u2019s not always cutting. It\u2019s innovating \u2014 it\u2019s producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.And, look \u2014 I\u2019ve got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.I\u2019ve done it \u2014 I did it in Washington \u2014 four years of balanced budgets. No one could even believe it happened.(BELL RINGS)I\u2019ve done it in Ohio, we\u2019re growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity. And I will go back to Washington and do it again for the American people. I promise you that.(APPLAUSE)Within the first hundred days, we will have the plan to get this done.BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you, governor.(APPLAUSE)Speaking of taxes...TRUMP: I just want to say \u2014 and I\u2019m a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.KASICH: OK, let me \u2014 let me \u2014 let me just talk about that, because I know that \u2014 that Donald believes the energy industry is important. So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we\u2019ve created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it\u2019s early-stage.See, what we\u2019ve done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that\u2019s jobs-friendly. We have diversified our economy.We \u2014 we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon \u2014 their Cloud computing in the Midwest. You know why it\u2019s happening?(BELL RINGS)Because we\u2019re balanced budgets, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re job-friendly, we don\u2019t raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs. Jobs, jobs and jobs, period.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, yesterday, the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, called on you to release your back tax returns, and said, and I\u2019m quoting him now, \u201cthere is good reason to believe there is a bombshell in them.\u201dRomney said either you\u2019re not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven\u2019t paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven\u2019t been giving the money to veterans or disabled people. Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?TRUMP: All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form \u2014 almost 100 pages. You don\u2019t learn anything about somebody\u2019s wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements. TRUMP: I filed \u2014 which shows that I\u2019m worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn\u2019t ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.So as far as that\u2019s concerned, I filed it. And that\u2019s where you find out what kind of a company. You don\u2019t learn anything from a tax return.I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn\u2019t file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I\u2019ve been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.Nobody gets audited \u2014 I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I\u2019m being audited now for two or three years, so I can\u2019t do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.BLITZER: Hugh, go ahead.HEWITT: Mr. Trump. You told me...TRUMP: Are you going to ask anybody else that question?CARSON: Yes, amen, amen.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Every single question comes to me?HEWITT: Mr. Trump...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know I\u2019m here for the ratings, but it\u2019s a little bit ridiculous.(LAUGHTER) HEWITT: Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.TRUMP: True.HEWITT: Are you going back on your commitment?TRUMP: No, I\u2019m not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That\u2019s the good news.(LAUGHTER)TRUMP: Let me just tell you, let me just \u2014 which happens to be true. Check out the ratings.Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can\u2019t release it while I\u2019m under an audit. We\u2019re under a routine audit. I\u2019ve had it for years, I get audited.And obviously if I\u2019m being audited, I\u2019m not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.HEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns. Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released. And you said, coming out any day momentarily. When are we going to see your returns?RUBIO: Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them. And there\u2019s nothing really that interesting in them. So I have no problem releasing them. And luckily I\u2019m not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.(CROSSTALK)RUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It\u2019s a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.You cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I\u2019ve been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.And I think if we \u2014 the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis. And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is \u2014 the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.It is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.HEWITT: Thank you, Senator Rubio. But I am...(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: I\u2019m being fair to all of the candidates.Senator Cruz, Tuesday is five days away. Why haven\u2019t voters seen your 2012, 2013, and 2014 returns?CRUZ: So, I\u2019ve released five years of tax returns already. We will have two more years available tomorrow. And I would note that this question really goes \u2014 you know, Donald says he\u2019s being audited.Well, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.And listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis. The most important question is how do we win the general election in November, 2016. And roughly 65 percent of Republicans think Donald is not the right candidate to go against Hillary Clinton.Now, part of the reason in the last 10 polls...TRUMP: Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.CRUZ: ... RealClearPolitics he has lost to Hillary on eight of them. In the last 10 polls on RealClearPolitics, I either tied or beat Hillary. And this is an example.You know, the mainstream media is laying off Donald now. They\u2019re going to pick apart his taxes. They\u2019re going to pick apart his business deals.And let\u2019s take, for example, one of Hillary\u2019s great vulnerabilities, the corruption at the Clinton Foundation, the fact that she had CEOs and foreign companies giving her money while she was secretary of state.CRUZ: The next Republican nominee needs to be able to make that case against Hillary. And if Donald tried to did it, Hillary would turn to Donald and say, \u201cbut gosh, Donald, you gave $100,000 to the Clinton foundation. I even went to your wedding.\u201dHe can\u2019t prosecute the case against Hillary, and we can\u2019t risk another four years of these failed Obama policies by nominating someone who loses to Hillary Clinton in November.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I\u2019m a businessman. I have, over the years.And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he\u2019s doing well in the polls. Well, I\u2019m beating him in virtually every poll. I\u2019m tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn\u2019t be. But I think I\u2019ll do very well.(APPLAUSE)But a poll just came out \u2014 a Bloomberg poll \u2014 where I am beating him so badly that it\u2019s, like, embarrassing even for me to say I\u2019m beating him that badly.(APPLAUSE)And \u2014 and here\u2019s the thing \u2014 it was sort of funny \u2014 65 percent of the people don\u2019t like you \u2014 I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent...(BELL RINGS)... on another one. That means \u2014 and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly \u2014 that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, \u201cI can\u2019t lose South Carolina.\u201d I beat him in a landslide.Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sang (ph) about the polls. One other thing \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I \u2014 and I haven\u2019t even started at her. I only had one little interchange...(APPLAUSE)... I only had one little interchange, and that was...(BELL RINGS)... four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen.CRUZ: Hold on. He \u2014 he attacked me, Wolf. I get a response.BLITZER: I was about to say \u2014 Senator Cruz, respond.CRUZ: Thank you. Thank \u2014 thank \u2014 thank you very much.You know, it\u2019s interesting \u2014 Donald went \u2014 went on \u2014 on an extended tirade about the polls, but he didn\u2019t respond to any of the substance. He has yet to say \u2014 he can release past year\u2019s tax returns. He can do it tomorrow.He doesn\u2019t want to do it, because presumably there\u2019s something in there...TRUMP: Nothing.CRUZ: ... that is bad. If there\u2019s nothing, release them tomorrow.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: They\u2019re already prepared. The only reason he\u2019s not releasing them...TRUMP: You \u2014 you don\u2019t...CRUZ: ... is because he\u2019s afraid that he will get hit.TRUMP: I\u2019m not afraid (inaudible).CRUZ: You know, Marco made reference earlier to the litigation against Trump University. It\u2019s a fraud case. His lawyers have scheduled the trial for July.I want you to think about, if this man is the nominee, having the Republican nominee...(BELL RINGS)... on the stand in court, being cross-examined about whether he committed fraud. You don\u2019t think the mainstream media will go crazy on that?And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times, who agreed with her on foreign policy, who agrees with Bernie Sanders on health care, who agreed with Barack Obama on the Wall Street bailout?BLITZER: All right (ph)...CRUZ: If \u2014 we\u2019ve got to win this election, and we can\u2019t do it with a candidate who agrees with Hillary Clinton and can\u2019t take it to her and beat her on the debate stage and at the polls.BLITZER: Mr. Trump. Mr, \u2014 hold on. Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump...TRUMP: ... first of all, he\u2019s talking about the polls. I\u2019m beating him awfully badly in the polls.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: But you\u2019re not beating Hillary. You\u2019re not beating Hillary.TRUMP: Well, then, if I can\u2019t \u2014 if \u2014 hey, if I can\u2019t beat her, you\u2019re really going to get killed, aren\u2019t you?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: So \u2014 so let me ask you this, because you\u2019re really getting beaten badly. I know you\u2019re embarrassed \u2014 I know you\u2019re embarrassed, but keep fighting \u2014 keep swinging, man (ph). Swing for the fences.Let me just tell you \u2014 let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a \u2014 it\u2019s a civil case. It\u2019s a case where people want to try and get \u2014 it\u2019s a case that is nonsense.It\u2019s something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don\u2019t want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed \u2014 most \u2014 many \u2014 many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful.As \u2014 and believe me, I\u2019ll win that case. That\u2019s an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I\u2019m being audited. It\u2019s a very routine audit, and it\u2019s very unfair, because I\u2019ve been audited for, I think, over 12 years.Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I\u2019m being audited \u2014 which is a very large company.(BELL RINGS)BLITZER: Thank you.TRUMP: I\u2019m being audited 12 years in a row, at least.Now, until that audit\u2019s done, and I don\u2019t think anybody would blame me, I\u2019m not giving it...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: ... the years you\u2019re not being audited? Will you release those years?BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen, thank you.TRUMP: (inaudible) audited for those years.CRUZ: Which years? Which years are you being audited?BLITZER: Gentlemen...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: ... we actually have rules \u2014 we\u2019re trying to obey these rules that all of you agreed. We\u2019re going to take a quick break. We have a lot more \u2014 many more critically important issues to discuss.Our coverage of this tenth Republican presidential debate from the University of Houston continues in a moment.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BLITZER: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here at the University of Houston.Gentlemen, I want to turn our attention right now to key issues involving foreign policy and national security. And Mr. Trump, I\u2019ll begin with you.TRUMP: Shocking.(LAUGHTER)BLITZER: You said this about the ongoing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians \u2014 I\u2019m quoting you now: \u201cLet me be sort of a neutral guy. I don\u2019t want to say whose fault it is, I don\u2019t think it helps.\u201dTRUMP: Right.BLITZER: Here\u2019s the question. How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America\u2019s closest ally in the Middle East?TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think they do under President Obama because I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he\u2019s treated Israel horribly. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I\u2019ve received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.As president, however, there\u2019s nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It\u2019s probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn\u2019t help if I start saying, \u201cI am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.And I can\u2019t do that as well \u2014 as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I\u2019m taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.BLITZER: Senator Cruz?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald\u2019s word, between Israel and the Palestinians.Let me be clear. If I\u2019m president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.(APPLAUSE)And the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent. When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.Just today, Iran announced they\u2019re going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald\u2019s answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this \u2014 if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: Well, I can only say \u2014 look, I can only say I\u2019ve been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I\u2019ve received many, many awards from Israel, as I\u2019ve said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I\u2019m going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.BLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.KASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee. And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I\u2019ve been a supporter of Israel \u2014 a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn\u2019t give as much money as Donald gave, but I\u2019ve been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.And frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one \u2014 are moving because they\u2019re not sure what we will do.It\u2019s a very interesting development here within the 24 hours. We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.When we stand firm and we let the world know who we\u2019re with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: We\u2019re going to get to North Korea in a moment. But Senator Rubio, what\u2019s wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?RUBIO: Because \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if Donald realizes this. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not his intent perhaps. But the position you\u2019ve taken is an anti-Israel position. And here\u2019s why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here\u2019s what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here\u2019s what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis. The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.And so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not going to sit here and say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not on either side.\u201d I will be on a side. I will be on Israel\u2019s side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump?TRUMP: I\u2019m a negotiator. I\u2019ve done very well over the years through negotiation. It\u2019s very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I\u2019ll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s not going down \u2014 excuse me...RUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.TRUMP: ... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?RUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.TRUMP: OK, no, no, no \u2014 a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.RUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you\u2019re dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?TRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. (APPLAUSE)TRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...RUBIO: ... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it\u2019s not a real estate deal...TRUMP: ... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...BLITZER: ... Senator.TRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.BLITZER: Let\u2019s move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.Let\u2019s be clear. Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?KASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That\u2019s what it means. Even though there\u2019s so much chaos in North Korea right now, there\u2019s a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.But, look, here\u2019s what I think we ought to do \u2014 like, immediately. And, we\u2019ve been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don\u2019t know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they\u2019re not selling this material, or this technology, or giving it to someone else.Secondly, the same goes with the aircraft.Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don\u2019t have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we\u2019re now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.But, when I say regime change, I don\u2019t have to talk exactly what that means. Look, I\u2019ve been involved in national security for a long time. You don\u2019t have to spell everything out, but what I\u2019m telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we\u2019re doing is beginning to work against them.They are the key to being able to settle this situation.BLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...KASICH: ... I\u2019m very well aware of that.BLITZER: A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?KASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I\u2019ll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we\u2019re going to face this sooner or later.But, in the meantime, I\u2019m also aware of the fact that there\u2019s 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don\u2019t just run around making charges. I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.Now, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we\u2019ve got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...(BELL RINGING)KASICH: ... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: One thing I\u2019d like to add to what the Governor\u2019s saying, I think that we are now in a position \u2014 are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it\u2019s going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.You order televisions, you order almost anything, you\u2019re getting it from these countries. Whether it\u2019s a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it\u2019s an air conditioning unit. They\u2019re coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they\u2019re making less, but they\u2019re making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day.(BELL RINGING)We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...BLITZER: Dr. Carson.KASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we\u2019re all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We\u2019re all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job. There is no question about it.But, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,But, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.(BELL RINGING)We can\u2019t have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...BLITZER: ... Thank you...KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don\u2019t get time. I\u2019m going to whine because I didn\u2019t get asked about taxes, I didn\u2019t get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you\u2019re going to be fair to everybody, you didn\u2019t ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.Now...BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.(APPLAUSE)CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the whole year. And they didn\u2019t find anything, so they said let\u2019s look at the next year and the next year. They didn\u2019t find anything and they won\u2019t find anything because I\u2019m a very honest person.But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.(APPLAUSE)And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn\u2019t find a single one who didn\u2019t think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it\u2019s like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. We\u2019re going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.HEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?TRUMP: I really don\u2019t because it not working and the countries aren\u2019t agreeing to it and the rebels aren\u2019t agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It\u2019s a meaningless ceasefire.I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of \u2014 with a total cessation. But it\u2019s not working, as you know very well. It\u2019s not working. If \u2014 we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.HEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.CRUZ: Well look. We\u2019re certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there\u2019s reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama\u2019s weakness in the Middle East, weakness in Syria. And you know, as we\u2019re headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.Another example is John Kerry. John Kerry \u2014 Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State. I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we\u2019re not in a strong position to win the general election.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.TRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...CRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.TRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that\u2019s concerned. You know it and so do I.CRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.TRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. TRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, he\u2019s saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.If these politicians went to the beach and didn\u2019t do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we\u2019d be \u2014 at least they killed terrorists, all right?And I\u2019m not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it\u2019s a total mess.We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.(APPLAUSE)HEWITT: Senator Rubio.RUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn\u2019t topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?And I argued if it takes a long time, you\u2019re going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s where the term \u201clead from behind\u201d came. And that\u2019s the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn\u2019t appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.I couldn\u2019t imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)RUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we\u2019re asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he\u2019s saying these guys need to do more.South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort. And Japan contributes as well. And here\u2019s why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.They can do that very quickly. And that\u2019s what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can\u2019t walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.HEWITT: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldn\u2019t want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...RUBIO: How much?TRUMP: A lot. I\u2019ll negotiate a lot more money than you\u2019ll ever get.As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it\u2019s a disaster for Israel. I\u2019m no fan of John Kerry.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.Senator Cruz.You can see and hear the exact words from Donald\u2019s mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry\u2019s foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That\u2019s why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.And I\u2019ll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald? If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?If you care about Israel, you don\u2019t write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel. Instead you stand and support the national security of America and the alliance with Israel.(CROSSTALK)KASICH: There\u2019s a critical point that needs to be made here.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor, Governor, Governor, he attacked Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has a right to respond.TRUMP: Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you\u2019re politicians, all talk, no action.(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: I\u2019ve been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.CRUZ: Then name one specific thing you\u2019ve done.TRUMP: What I\u2019ve seen up here \u2014 I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...RUBIO: This guy always goes for...TRUMP: You have a combination of factors. He can\u2019t do it...RUBIO: This is so typical.TRUMP: ... for the obvious reason, and he can\u2019t do it because he doesn\u2019t know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: One at a time, gentlemen.Governor Kasich, you have the floor. Governor...(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: You will have a response. But I promised Governor Kasich he could respond.CARSON: Can somebody attack me, please? (LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)KASICH: There\u2019s something \u2014 I want to \u2014 I want to point out something here today that is \u2014 it\u2019s so critically important \u2014 about how the Obama administration has really done such a ridiculous, feckless job here in foreign policy.First of all, we should have been supporting the rebels long ago. They could have taken Assad out, and because we did nothing, the Russians are in, and they\u2019re sitting in the catbird seat.We should have been helping them. I\u2019m thankful that the aid trucks are finally getting into Syria. But the fact is, had we had acted, we would have solved that problem.Now, let\u2019s talk about Libya. Libya didn\u2019t go down because there was some people revolution. Hillary Clinton, Samantha Power and all these other people convinced the president to undermine Gadhafi. They undermined him, and now they have created a cesspool in Libya.And let me just say to you \u2014 we have ISIS beginning get \u2014 get a foothold in Libya. We\u2019re gonna have to deal with it. There are not many major cities in Libya. They\u2019re on the coast, which \u2014 mostly, it\u2019s desert, but it\u2019s a problem.Then we have ISIS in \u2014 in Syria, and we have ISIS in Iraq. Because this administration has not had a strong and firm foreign policy, we are going to inherit \u2014 one of us here is going to inherit a total mess...BLITZER: All right...KASICH: ... and we\u2019re going to have to work our way out of it, including...BLITZER: Let\u2019s continue.KASICH: ... the need to arm the Ukrainians. They have been ignored, and we need to help them as well...BLITZER: Let us continue.KASICH: ... and assert ourselves as America.BLITZER: Let\u2019s continue the questioning on ISIS. Maria.CRUZ: Hold on, Wolf. You said I got a response.BLITZER: You\u2019ll have a chance. Maria will pick up...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Hold on. He called me a liar. You\u2019re saying I can\u2019t respond to being called a liar?(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Go ahead and respond.CRUZ: You know, what we\u2019re seeing with Donald is actually the pattern of Washington \u2014 the pattern of Washington deal makers, which is they make promises, they break their words, and then when anyone calls them on it, they call you a liar.And so that\u2019s Donald\u2019s pattern over and over again. He said, for example, seven months ago \u2014 this is Donald speaking, quote \u2014 \u201cI, Donald Trump, was a member of the establishment.\u201dThere\u2019s a reason Harry Reid thinks he\u2019s the best Republican up here. There\u2019s a reason Jimmy Carter said he would support Donald Trump over me, because he said Donald Trump is malleable, he has no fixed set of beliefs...(BELL RINGS)... whereas Ted Cruz is not malleable. And every time anyone points at Donald\u2019s actual record...BLITZER: Thank you.CRUZ: ... what he said on national television, Donald yells \u201cliar.\u201d Let me tell you something \u2014 falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie...BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.CRUZ: ... and it\u2019s something Donald does daily.BLITZER: Go ahead, Mr. Trump.TRUMP: I watched \u2014 I watched...(APPLAUSE)TRUMP: ... the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race \u2014 he has left Iowa and he\u2019s out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful.And got a lot of votes because of that \u2014 a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it.I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, \u201cVoter Violation,\u201d and then it graded you...(BELL RINGS)... and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in politics.(BELL RINGS)To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.BLITZER: Senator Cruz...(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: I know politicians \u2014 I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it\u2019s not good.CRUZ: I believe it. No, no. I believe you know politicians much better than I do, because for 40 years, you\u2019ve been funding liberal Democratic politicians. And by the way...TRUMP: I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it?(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: ... the reason is \u2014 you\u2019re welcome to have the check back.TRUMP: I funded this guy. I gave him a check.CRUZ: Yeah, you gave me $5,000.TRUMP: I gave him a check. He never funded me.CRUZ: And \u2014 and by the way, let\u2019s be clear.(APPLAUSE)Donald claims \u2014 Donald claims to care about...TRUMP: You know why? I didn\u2019t want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Donald. Donald. Donald. I understand rules are very hard for you. They\u2019re very confusing.TRUMP: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re doing a great job. I have his book.(CROSSTALK)TRUMP: Thank you \u2014 thank you for the book. Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald, you can get back on your meds now.TRUMP: This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you.(APPLAUSE)Thank \u2014 thank you for the book. I really appreciate (ph).CRUZ: Donald \u2014 Donald, relax.TRUMP: Go ahead. I\u2019m relaxed. You\u2019re the basket case.(CROSSTALK)Go ahead.CRUZ: Donald...TRUMP: Go ahead. Don\u2019t get nervous.CRUZ: (inaudible)...TRUMP: Go ahead.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: I promise you, Donald, there\u2019s nothing about you...TRUMP: I\u2019ve seen you.CRUZ: ... that makes anyone nervous.TRUMP: You\u2019re losing so badly you \u2014 I want to...CRUZ: You know, people are actually watching this at home.TRUMP: ... I \u2014 you don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: Gentlemen, gentlemen.CRUZ: Wolf, I\u2019m going to ask my time not be deducted when he\u2019s yelling at me.BLITZER: You\u2019ve gotta stop this.(CROSSTALK)BLITZER: The latest debate \u2014 gentlemen, please.CRUZ: Hold on, I\u2019m going to get my answer. He doesn\u2019t get to yell the whole time. BLITZER: I want to move \u2014 I want to move on. These are the rules.(CROSSTALK)CRUZ: Excuse me, he called me a liar, then interrupted the whole time. Am I allowed to...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)CRUZ: Wolf, do I not get a response? Do I not get a response without being interrupted?BLITZER: You\u2019ll get \u2014 you\u2019ll get plenty of response, so stand by.CARSON: My name was mentioned.BLITZER: I want to talk \u2014 I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government \u2014 how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.BLITZER: There\u2019s a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government. The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers. And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge\u2019s order.Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.BASH: Senator Rubio, you say it\u2019s complicated, and that, quote, \u201cApple isn\u2019t necessarily wrong to refuse the court order.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t investigators have everything at their disposal?RUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing \u2014 the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago \u2014 the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer. Apple initially came out saying, \u201cWe\u2019re being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.\u201d That is not accurate.The only thing they\u2019re being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that\u2019s in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.And I think they should comply with that. If that\u2019s all they\u2019re asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.BASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.RUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.BASH: But just to be clear \u2014 just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?RUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?BASH: Correct.RUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didn\u2019t even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer\u2019s employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this. That is all they\u2019re asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn\u2019t want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?CRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence. He\u2019s now agreeing with me. And so I\u2019m glad.What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone\u2019s cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn\u2019t have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.(APPLAUSE)BASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?CARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.(APPLAUSE)You know, we have the \u2014 we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole. And that\u2019s why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.So absolutely, I would \u2014 I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don\u2019t comply with that, you\u2019re encouraging chaos in our system.BASH: Mr. Trump...(APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where\u2019s the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don\u2019t litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you\u2019re the president? You lock the door and you say you\u2019re not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.And I\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time. Because as an executive, you\u2019ve got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.ARRASAS: Thank you, Governor.(APPLAUSE)KASICH: Thank you.ARRARAS: Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat. You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn\u2019t? Isn\u2019t that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?TRUMP: First of all, you\u2019re talking about a border that\u2019s many, many times longer. You\u2019re talking about a massive border.We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts \u2014 you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn\u2019t think this beautiful place \u2014 it\u2019s beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it\u2019s such a shame to see it.They\u2019re pouring in from the Southern border, so I\u2019m talking about great security. I\u2019m talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I\u2019ll build it on time, on budget. It\u2019ll be a very high wall, a great wall. It\u2019s going to be built, it\u2019s going to be built. It\u2019s going to be paid for by Canada, by the way \u2014 maybe I\u2019ll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.The problem with Canada, you\u2019re talking about a massively long piece. You\u2019re talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we \u2014 it is not our biggest problem. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it\u2019s the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.(APPLAUSE)ARRARAS: I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto Rico\u2019s in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it\u2019s debt of $72 billion dollars. Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that \u2014 the tools to restructure the debt. That is the same debt the other 50 states have.You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection. You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it\u2019s last resort. That that\u2019s where they are now. How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?RUBIO: Sure, because bankruptcy doesn\u2019t work unless you change the way you\u2019re operating, or you\u2019re going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it\u2019s economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.They\u2019re coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it\u2019s too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.This year alone, with all the problems they\u2019re having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again. If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they\u2019ve made to future generations to make payments.So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they\u2019re asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you\u2019re going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.They\u2019re United States citizens, they\u2019re obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.Their previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...(BELL RINGING)RUBIO: ... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...BLITZER: ...

It\u2019s time now for closing statements. All of you will have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, we\u2019ll start with you.CARSON: Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.Secondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And I\u2019m asking you tonight, America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when?(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Governor Kasich.KASICH: Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I\u2019ve done it in Washington, I\u2019ve done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.But I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience, not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.I hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we won\u2019t have to spend time figuring what we\u2019re going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Well, thank you for having us tonight. You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it\u2019s narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.RUBIO: The time for games is over.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Senator Cruz.CRUZ: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.If I\u2019m elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.I will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today. I will rip to shreds the Iranian \u2014 catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.We will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump.TRUMP: Thank you.Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They\u2019re all talk, they\u2019re no action, nothing gets done. I\u2019ve watched it for years. Take a look at what\u2019s happening to our country.All of the things that I\u2019ve been talking about, whether it\u2019s trade, whether it\u2019s building up our depleted military, whether it\u2019s taking care of our vets, whether it\u2019s getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)BLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.And thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo. We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.Super Tuesday is only five days away.Right now Anderson Cooper picks up our special coverage \u2014 Anderson.COOPER: Wolf, thanks very much.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delivery Start-Ups Face Road Bumps in Quest to Capture Untapped Market", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byDoorDash, one of a multitude of start-ups with a mobile app that lets people order and get food sent to their doorsteps, relies on contract drivers like Brian Navarro to make the deliveries. The problem is that workers like Mr. Navarro don\u2019t always stick around.\u201cDrivers do jump around,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe general consensus is that drivers really only stick around for three to six months.\u201dThat churn has become expensive for DoorDash. A large number of drivers left the start-up less than a year after they joined, according to two people who have seen the company\u2019s driver data. DoorDash spends upward of $200 in recruitment and referral bonuses for some drivers, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Other delivery companies, like Postmates and Instacart, face similar retention challenges, these people said.The issue is just one headache now troubling delivery start-ups, which have been among the hottest sectors of start-up activity in recent years. Based on a belief that the companies would succeed once they grew to enormous scale, investors poured more than $730 million into delivery firms like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, up more than 1,100 percent from the same period a year and a half ago, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm.But entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to find that the economics of making a delivery service work are far from easy.The problems are rooted in the high operating costs of the start-ups, which typically act as middlemen between consumers and restaurants or grocery stores. The companies not only have to pay for large fleets of drivers, they also have big groups of employees who receive customer orders from the apps and who then manually make calls to the restaurants to order food. At the same time, to attract customers, many of the start-ups offer introductory prices and discounts, often making delivery free for first-time users.As DoorDash\u2019s experience with drivers shows, the start-ups\u2019 costs don\u2019t necessarily decline over time. For some drivers, who are paid a fee per delivery, it can be difficult to make enough deliveries in an hour to make it financially worthwhile for them. And when drivers move on, the companies must spend again to recruit replacements.\u201cEnsuring drivers have the best possible experience on the DoorDash platform is one of our top priorities,\u201d Eitan Bencuya, a DoorDash spokesman, said in a statement. He said the company has proprietary technology that helps drivers increase the amount of deliveries they can make in a single trip, increasing their commissions per hour.\u201cPrivate companies doing last-mile delivery rely on charging high consumer fees, which make the services untenably expensive for the average consumer,\u201d Dean Prissman, an Internet analyst for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note to clients in October.Some investors said the start-ups have the potential to capture a relatively untapped multibillion-dollar market, one that is also being eyed by tech behemoths like Google, Amazon and Uber. The companies see opportunity in bringing delivery to millions of retailers and restaurants that do not now offer it, all for a slice of the fees.Alfred Lin, a partner at the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in DoorDash and Instacart, said the start-ups are also amassing a very valuable asset: consumers\u2019 purchasing data. \u201cThe advent of the smartphone gives a company the ability to track all the information about your purchasing habits, and where you are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dramatic what a company can do to utilize that information.\u201dMr. Lin compared DoorDash\u2019s trajectory to those of Netflix, Amazon and Zappos, which all required huge early spending toward a bet on future growth. He added that DoorDash is seeing a lot of growth now.\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of a premium service,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike the early days of Uber, when they only had black cars.\u201dMr. Lehmann said he imagines a future in which Postmates cuts deals with 60 to 70 percent of the restaurants in its app. As Postmates grows more popular, drivers will be able to make more deliveries to more people in shorter amounts of time, eventually earning them \u2014 and the company \u2014 more money.\u201cWe can and will be profitable as a company in 2017,\u201d he said.Mr. Lehmann added that its drivers do jump to adjacent services from time to time but frequently return to working for Postmates.DoorDash is trying to keep a lid on costs another way: By paying its drivers less per delivery. According to an email from the company to drivers that was reviewed by The New York Times, DoorDash said that starting on Monday, it would change the pay per delivery in Los Angeles to $5, down from $6, excluding tips.\u201cWe know this is an important change, so we want to be transparent about why we are making this adjustment,\u201d DoorDash said in the email. The company said drivers would make up what they lose in fee cuts through an increased order volume.Mr. Navarro, the driver in Los Angeles, said he could make only about two deliveries an hour, though that has increased at peak mealtimes. While he is unhappy with the fee change, he said he plans to keep working for DoorDash and Postmates for now because it beats the alternative.\u201cI\u2019d rather do this than be driving for Lyft or Uber,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The F.C.C. Gets Ready to Unlock the Cable Box", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byEditorialEvery year, American cable-TV subscribers spend $231 on average to rent cable boxes that they should be able to buy outright, potentially saving them hundreds of dollars over several years. Consumers could soon have that option under an excellent proposal by the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.Mr. Wheeler wants the cable businesses like Comcast and Time Warner Cable and technology companies like Google and Amazon to jointly develop technical standards for cable devices. That would allow consumers to watch cable television on any device that meets those standards. Some manufacturers could build televisions that already incorporate a cable box. Or companies like Apple could refine software that will let people watch all cable TV on their phones and computers. Much of the technology needed to do this exists, and companies like Comcast and HBO are already using it to make some TV shows and movies available online.Regardless of what device people use, it would have to comply with the privacy and copyright protections that apply currently to cable boxes. This approach should make it easier for consumers to choose how they watch television, provided that the telecom and technology companies, which have had a testy relationship, can work together.Not surprisingly, the telecommunications industry is opposing Mr. Wheeler, arguing that his proposal amounts to needless government meddling that will stifle innovation. These are self-serving arguments by an industry that is, understandably, afraid of losing billions in revenue. It is important to remember that Mr. Wheeler\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t require consumers to make any changes. Anybody who is happy renting a cable box, can keep doing so.If the industry had its way, we would still be renting phones from the old Ma Bell. Allowing consumers to buy their own phones was one of the first steps the F.C.C. took in promoting new telecommunications technologies. Requiring cable-TV systems to make room for competing devices should similarly lead to a boom in new types of services and technologies.A new proposal from the F.C.C. would make easier for consumers to choose how they watch television.Advertisement"}

But on approaching the work, \u201cHomo Sacer,\u201d by the British artist and writer James Bridle, she instead issues bureaucratic sound bites. They include text from the letter that stripped the terror suspect Mohamed Sakr of his British citizenship, two years before he was killed by a United States drone strike in Somalia in 2012.\u201cI was fascinated that someone born in the United Kingdom could have their citizenship removed,\u201d Mr. Bridle said. \u201cThis work is essentially a step-by-step guide on how you can go from being a British subject to being placed in the legal position of being able to be killed.\u201d\u201cHomo Sacer,\u201d both technologically advanced and politically subversive, is typical of \u201cElectronic Superhighway: 2016-1966,\u201d a significant historical survey of digital art at the Whitechapel that runs until May 15. More than 130 exhibits explore how computers and the Internet have influenced artists since the mid-1960s.Digital art seems to be enjoying a moment of acceptance at major institutions in Britain, nearly three decades after the English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. Somerset House\u2019s \u201cBig Bang Data\u201d explores the issues surrounding data production in the digital age, and runs through March 20. Across the city, the Serpentine Gallery and the Serpentine Sackler Gallery are hosting solo outings by the painter Michael Craig-Martin and the installation artist Simon Denny, both involving marriages between art and technology, until Sunday.\u201cIncreasingly everyone will be doing more and more of these shows,\u201d said Omar Kholeif, the curator of \u201cElectronic Superhighway.\u201d\u201cIt may be that there are not shows that have titles like this; it may be shows that just have this work implicitly in it.\u201dThe Whitechapel exhibition is divided into three sections, broadly arranged in reverse chronological order: work from the past 16 years, art that is connected to the web via Internet browsers and pieces made before the turn of the 21st century.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to shove the contemporary work at the end, as traditionally you would do in an art historical show,\u201d Mr. Kholeif said. \u201cI wanted that noisiness that pervades this multiple device condition that we live in to be the first thing that assaulted you.\u201dNot far from \u201cHomo Sacer\u201d is the writer Douglas Coupland\u2019s 2015 series \u201cDeep Face,\u201d consisting of photographic portraits with faces obscured by colorful geometric shapes, created as a critique of the use of facial recognition technology, for which companies like Facebook have drawn criticism from privacy campaigners.Many of the works play with interactivity. \u201cAutonomy Cube,\u201d a 2014 collaboration between by two Americans, the artist Trevor Paglen and the journalist and hacker Jacob Appelbaum, is on the face of it a minimalist sculpture of motherboards trapped in a transparent glass cube. But the piece is also a Wi-Fi hotspot that allows viewers to connect to the Internet via Tor, the anonymous global network.\u201cHe\u2019s thinking that when we enter civic institutions we expect them to have Wi-Fi,\u201d Mr. Kholeif said. \u201cWe just hand over our data.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s trying to make that relationship very explicit, and to ask us how we engage with it,\u201d he added.Online identity is another theme of the exhibition. The Argentine artist Amalia Ulman\u2019s \u201cExcellences and Perfections\u201d series, completed in 2014 and 2015, was originally a sequence of updates on Instagram, and is presented here as mounted prints.Ms. Ulman photographed herself in assumed roles \u2014 exposing her midriff, or in a bathroom ready for an evening out \u2014 as a commentary on how women construct their identities on social networks.\u201cIt was an illustration on how femininity can be something fabricated and not biological,\u201d Ms. Ulman said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt was my first attempt to work with fiction using social media, to also demonstrate that there is no authenticity online.\u201dThe displays of works that exist \u2014 and are accessible \u2014 online raise questions about the need for a gallery at all. In one such work, \u201cGeoGoo,\u201d a 2008 hack of Google platforms including Maps by the artistic duo JODI, symbols swirl in geometric patterns across digital landscapes.\u201cA lot of these digital pieces continue to evolve after the exhibition finishes,\u201d said Hans-Ulrich Obrist, a co-director of the Serpentine Gallery and an advocate for pioneering digital art projects. To do so, he said, they might require the involvement of programmers as well as a \u201csustained infrastructure\u201d that would allow modifications.\u201cElectronic Superhighway\u201d concludes with historic pieces, including some that use now-obsolete technologies like VHS and vinyl records alongside the likes of screen-printing and 16 millimeter film depicting computer-influenced forms like grids and circuitry.Among the standout works are two pieces by the influential video artist Nam June Paik. The towering \u201cInternet Dream,\u201d from 1994, a stack of 52 monitors displaying jarring abstract images, heralds the current age of digital information saturation. The 1984 video work \u201cGood Morning, Mr. Orwell,\u201d originally a multinational broadcast, features cameos by celebrities like Laurie Anderson and George Plimpton set to music by Peter Gabriel, Philip Glass and John Cage.So why has it taken so long for such a broad survey? Mr. Kholeif said that presenting a critical mass of digital works was costly, time-consuming and had often been relegated to specialist galleries. \u201cMuseums haven\u2019t tended to do it,\u201d he said.Mr. Coupland said that many mainstream institutions tended to play down the importance of art influenced by the Internet. \u201cMany people, mostly older, don\u2019t get it and are alienated by it,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a divide out there.\u201dMr. Obrist pointed to Mr. Paik\u2019s career as a model for younger artists working in digital media. The Korean-American\u2019s first solo exhibition in 1963, in which he presented his signature modified television sets, came many years after the invention of the technology that made it possible, and his works found acceptance only slowly.\u201cMoving image was always relegated to the cinema,\u201d Mr. Obrist said, and as an art form was seen as subordinate to painting and sculpture. But, he said, curators have successfully challenged that assumption.\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting,\u201d he added, \u201cis that it always takes time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike Have a Big Story (Apple), and Some Scraps", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byBitsI\u2019m curious if the other tech giants will stick by Apple\u2019s side as the showdown with the F.B.I. gets more heated. What I mean is: I have no idea what will happen.Here\u2019s the big thing I want to get to: Kanye West. Or more specifically, what Kanye is doing for Tidal, the streaming music service that most everyone thinks is completely doomed, save for Jay-Z, who owns the service, and a handful of pop stars who support it.Kanye teased his newest album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d this week before releasing it more widely through the classic modes of distribution \u2014 namely, the music labels. Tidal got an exclusive window in which the album is only available through its service, something that other stars have pledged to do on Tidal in the future. As a result, Tidal has shot to the top of the download charts on the App Store.So does this make Tidal a viable service? Can it actually have a shot with this celebrity practice of \u201cwindowing,\u201d something that other companies like Vessel are trying as well?About Tidal: Yes, I think that it can have a shot at getting subscribers with these high-profile, short-term exclusives \u2014 but I\u2019ve got to say, I really hate it. I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the terrible future of media: Lots of different services with slightly different libraries of stuff, so that consumers have to either get several of them or just live without access to certain entertainment (or wade into the sin of torrenting).This is already the case with TV. Unbundling and cutting the cord and Internet streaming was supposed to make everything cheap and available, but in fact I probably pay more for media today than I ever have. I like the exclusives on Netflix, Amazon, HBO enough that I subscribe to all three. They\u2019re all getting better, and I don\u2019t see myself relying on any single one of them for all my TV any time soon.That\u2019s probably going to happen with music, too. The highest-profile artists will always have an incentive to offer exclusivity periods to one or two services. We listeners are either going to have subscribe to several or just do without. I really, really, really like Taylor Swift. I agonized for months about whether to go with Apple Music, which has Taylor but an annoying interface and not-great playlists, or Spotify, which has a wonderful user interface and an amazing weekly playlist tailored to a user\u2019s tastes \u2014 but no Taylor.I chose Spotify in the end. But I really miss Taylor.But there is zero indication that structure will ever go away. Even \u00e0 la carte options in the TV world add up to ultimately be much more costly than it would be to buy a cable subscription. I don\u2019t think cord-cutting is worth it, unless you\u2019re willing to go all-in on one or two networks.And that\u2019s sort of the point, right? Independent networks exist because they look for the best content and differentiate themselves based on providing that content as a service. If you find the shows \u2014 or music, or whatever \u2014 good enough, you will pay for it.That\u2019s why I think exclusives and windowing is a fair practice, even if it is a pain for me having to sign up for a new service. In this case, it\u2019s the artists essentially fighting against Spotify and the labels which, in the former case, artists claim they see too little in royalties for each song played. In the latter case, artists see little after the labels and distributors take their cut. The whole reason Tidal exists is to put some of the leverage back in the hands of the artists themselves with their own distribution platform.The big problem with that is that there are not enough artists who create huge enough albums to maintain that leverage in the long term. There is only one Lady Gaga, only one Jay-Z, and so on. And if Apple can cut a deal with Taylor, Tidal loses even more leverage when it sees other huge pop stars work with competing services.In sum, Tidal is doomed, but I do think it is a noble effort. Maybe the artists will figure out a different way to gain leverage in the wake of physical album sales falling and profits from streaming music not able to make up for that gap.Or maybe not. I won\u2019t cry for Kanye. He\u2019s famous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Public Housing, Private Donors", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byBig CityAfter the discussion, a political strategist who was in the audience suggested that any fund for public housing omit the phrase itself, because \u201cpeople hate public housing.\u201dThere are certainly precedents for private donations to public entities: The private, nonprofit Central Park Conservancy was founded in 1980, when the city\u2019s maintenance budget fell woefully short, and now supplies some 75 percent of the park\u2019s annual budget. In more recent years, charter schools have turned to philanthropists to raise money for rent and teachers. Still, the Fund for Public Housing represents an unusual grasp for private donations from a troubled city agency, the largest housing authority in the country.Ms. Olatoye and Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen had been talking about a charitable fund devoted to public housing for years, well before they held their current positions. One obstacle is that only a relatively small fraction of philanthropic dollars each year goes to poverty-related causes to begin with. Beyond that, in the absence of a personal connection to a particular mission, or the aura of social prestige, donors are often prompted to give when there is an emotional narrative to which they can respond, and drab, monolithic buildings don\u2019t easily move people.The initial goal, Ms. Olatoye says, is to tap, as a university would, into an alumni base. That base includes Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs; Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks; the former schools chancellor Joel I. Klein; the rap artist Jay Z; and the retired basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, all of whom grew up in New York City public housing.Still, there are obvious appeals to be made. \u201cWe want New Yorkers who grew up in public housing or who value New York as a diverse place \u2014 and that diversity is largely because of Nycha \u2014 to step up,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said. \u201cThe sell isn\u2019t about fixing up our buildings; it\u2019s about the fact that one in 12 New Yorkers lives in Nycha housing.\u201dWhile the need for plumbing repairs in the Farragut Houses may not stir charitable impulses, the fact that the average household income of residents in New York City public housing is $23,000 a year, or that 40 percent of adults in the projects without disabilities are unemployed, could. The fund will be used, Ms. Kirmani-Frye said, to improve the lives of residents by updating buildings in chronic disrepair, advancing job and career opportunities and connecting housing developments, which can often be isolated either geographically or psychologically from the rest of the city. One hope, she said, is to bridge the informal economies that arise in public housing \u2014 a mother selling layer cakes she bakes in her apartment, for instance \u2014 to larger commercial enterprises outside the system.The stark examples of inequality that have arisen in the city in recent years as a result of gentrification present themselves, ironically enough, as opportunity. That there are now wealthy neighborhoods abutting public housing complexes in Chelsea, for instance, or in Dumbo in Brooklyn means that well-off people at the very least now have a more intimate view of the projects. Gary Hattem, the president of the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation, who made the first donation to the Fund for Public Housing, lives in brownstone Brooklyn two blocks from public housing in Fort Greene.\u201cPublic housing isn\u2019t an obvious recipient of philanthropy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you think about what makes New York City work, public housing is just so essential to the success of families and neighborhoods, and that has too long been unrecognized.\u201dPhilanthropy often works bests when it appeals to human vanity. Is it possible that buildings might be renamed to honor the most magnanimous donors? \u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Ms. Olatoye said.Email: bigcity@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Sees Value in Its Stand to Protect Security", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byToday, China is Apple\u2019s second-largest market after the United States \u2014 Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products in the last fiscal year \u2014 and the iPhone, the company\u2019s top seller, has become both a status symbol and a form of personal security, given how difficult the device is to break into in a country where people increasingly worry about hacking and cybercrime.The company is playing the long game with its business. Privacy and security have become part of its brand, especially internationally, where it reaps almost two-thirds of its almost $234 billion a year in sales. And if it cooperates with one government, the thinking goes, it will have to cooperate with all of them.\u201cTim Cook is leveraging his personal brand and Apple\u2019s to stand on the side of consumer privacy in this environment,\u201d said Mark Bartholomew, a law professor at the University at Buffalo who studies encryption and cyberlaw. \u201cHe is taking the long view.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks in Mr. Cook\u2019s letter.Apple senior executives responded that their defiance was not a business choice. They said there had not been any business fallout and that Mr. Cook had received supportive emails from customers across the country.In fact, Apple has not made a point of advertising data security and privacy. The company has quietly built privacy features into its mobile operating system, known as iOS, over time. By late 2013, when Apple released its iOS 7 system, the company was encrypting by default all third-party data stored on customers\u2019 phones. And iOS8, which became available in 2014, made it basically impossible for the company\u2019s engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.Mr. Cook has also been vocal about how Apple is pro-privacy, a message that he discussed more widely after revelations from the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden about government surveillance. Mr. Cook argued that the company sold hardware \u2014 phones, tablets and laptops \u2014 and did not depend on the mass collection of consumer data as some Silicon Valley behemoths, such as Google and Facebook, do for their advertising-oriented businesses.For Apple, cooperating with the United States government now could quickly lead to murkier situations internationally.In China, for example, Apple \u2014 like any other foreign company selling smartphones \u2014 hands over devices for import checks by Chinese regulators. Apple also maintains server computers in China, but Apple has previously said that Beijing cannot view the data and that the keys to the servers are not stored in China. In practice and according to Chinese law, Beijing typically has access to any data stored in China.If Apple accedes to American law enforcement demands for opening the iPhone in the San Bernardino case and Beijing asks for a similar tool, it is unlikely Apple would be able to control China\u2019s use of it. Yet if Apple were to refuse Beijing, it would potentially face a battery of penalties.Analysts said Chinese officials were pushing for greater control over the encryption and security of computers and phones sold in the country, though Beijing last year backed off on some proposals that would have required foreign companies to provide encryption keys for devices sold in the country after facing pressure from foreign trade groups.\u201cPeople tend to forget the global impact of this,\u201d said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director at Access Now, a nonprofit that works for Internet freedoms. \u201cThe reality is the damage done when a democratic government does something like this is massive. It\u2019s even more negative in places where there are fewer freedoms.\u201dGovernments in Russia, Britain and Israel also have robust surveillance operations. Some governments have tried to use technology to gather intelligence on citizens at home and abroad.Apple\u2019s resistance to the United States government\u2019s demand has been polarizing. Apple supporters have held protests in cities like San Francisco in recent days to show their support of the company and have used hashtags on social media like #freeapple and #beatthecase.\u201cWe\u2019re fighting to maintain even the assumption that companies should protect us,\u201d said Evan Greer, the campaign director at Fight for the Future, a civil liberties group that is organizing protests nationwide on Tuesday to support Apple. \u201cApple is doing what every company should be doing.\u201dAround the world, people are aware of the impasse but many say it does not affect their decision to buy iPhones and the company\u2019s other products. In Rome on Friday, Simone Farelli, a 34-year-old history teacher who was browsing for a new iPhone at an Apple Store, said she \u201cdidn\u2019t see why\u201d the company\u2019s standoff with the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u201cwould change my mind about buying a new phone.\u201dIn China, the iPhone continues to hold a special place as a symbol of middle-class status.Wen Shuyue, a 35-year-old consultant, who on Friday was waiting outside the Apple Store in Beijing\u2019s upscale Sanlitun district, is one of Apple\u2019s millions of Chinese users. He said he liked the iPhone because it was simply better than models made by Chinese companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei.\u201cI\u2019ve never used Xiaomi or Huawei, because I think their designs are rough and not all that personal,\u201d he said.Apple\u2019s shareholders have so far been quiet. In the past, investors who complained that some of Apple\u2019s socially driven initiatives were superfluous to the company\u2019s core business were quickly subdued. At a 2014 shareholders\u2019 meeting, Mr. Cook told investors that if they wanted him to make decisions based only on the bottom line, \u201cthen you should get out of the stock.\u201dBut data privacy may eventually motivate investors \u2014 and ultimately more customers \u2014 to vote with their wallets because \u201cit\u2019s an issue that speaks directly to the business,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. \u201cRight now people buy phones regardless of encryption issues, but we have to wait and see how bloody this fight gets.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "To Find Cheap Flights, the Day (Kind of) Matters", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byThe GetawayIs there a best day to get the lowest price on a flight?Many travelers think the magic day is Tuesday, long lauded by travel deal sites and various publications, including this one, for its fare sales. Other travelers may have heard pundits declare Wednesday the ideal day. In December, Expedia and the Airlines Reporting Corporation, which processes ticket transactions for airlines and travel agencies, announced that weekends are the new best time.But is there really a preferred day to buy?There are too many variables at play for there to be a universally ideal day to buy an airline ticket. Price depends on a variety of factors, including the route; the level of competition on the route; surrounding holidays and events (like a convention or the Super Bowl); and the days of the week you plan to fly. During a single week in March, for example, a recent search for a round-trip flight between New York and Miami turned up ticket prices as low as $174 and as high as $314. Besides, nowadays we have fare calendars at our fingertips and websites such as Kayak and Travelzoo that alert us to low fares and sales \u2014 and those sales don\u2019t always take place on the same day of the week.Mr. Hobica pointed out, for instance, that on a recent Thursday, Virgin Atlantic lowered nonstop winter flights to Heathrow Airport in London from John F. Kennedy International Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport to about $504 round-trip. Economy fares had been running $900, Mr. Hobica said, then $800, then they went back up, and after that they dipped to around $680.Airlines (and the above example is but one of many) are perpetually tweaking prices, making predictions difficult. Expedia said as much in its report. Even though its latest research asserts that weekends have the best fares, consumers who spot a good deal on Thursday shouldn\u2019t wait until Saturday to buy it with the hope that the price will tumble even further. \u201cIf you find a fare that looks like a good deal, grab it,\u201d the report said, \u201cregardless of the day of week.\u201dIn addition to recommending the best times of the week to book, Expedia and other sites such as FareCompare publish suggestions about how far in advance of a trip to book to score the lowest fare. For instance, Expedia reported in December that the optimal time to buy an economy ticket for travel in North America is 57 days in advance, resulting in a potential savings of about 10 percent versus the average fare. Recommended lead times for travel to international destinations, including Europe and Asia-Pacific, were even longer.Think you know all the tricks for getting the lowest airfare and the most out of your miles programs? Test your knowledge, based on Stephanie Rosenbloom\u2019s weekly Getaway column.Travelers shouldn\u2019t think of predictions as rules, though. There are flights to Asia, for example, that are $500 cheaper when booked at the last minute as opposed to months in advance, Mr. Hobica said.And talking about the \u201caverage fare\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily helpful because that doesn\u2019t take into account the quality of a flight. Is it nonstop or does it have a 34-minute connection in a busy, sprawling airport like Atlanta? Is it an 18-hour layover in Dallas that will require you to spend an additional $300 in hotel bills and meals? Are you flying in an aisle seat in a Dreamliner or in the middle seat in a MD-80? And if that cheap ticket you found is on a discount airline like Spirit or Frontier, chances are you\u2019ll have to budget another $30 to $100 to check a bag. In other words, you probably don\u2019t want the average fare.If you want to sit next to your companion, be a safe distance from the bathroom, put your bag in an overhead compartment instead of the belly of the plane, and have enough time to make a connection, what you really want are good fares that may not be the absolute cheapest, but give you the experience you want.So how do you find these fares?Almost every major airline (Delta, United, JetBlue) has a good flexible date search option on its website that you can use to see which travel dates will get you the lowest prices, along with the time and comforts you need.To keep abreast of private sales and low fares (as well as hotel deals), you can search or sign up for alerts on Airfarewatchdog.com. Email alerts include low fares for a particular route that interests you, or all of the affordable round-trip flights departing from your local airport.Because prices are constantly fluctuating, keep checking airline websites and Google Flights to see the latest fares. The ticket price you see before lunch may be different a couple of hours later.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "PAID FOR AND POSTED BYTraditionally, companies have left these issues to IT to deal with. But these risks are now strategic to the business and the responsibility of the entire leadership team and the board. A single breach might not only expose the personal information of customers, leading to financial penalties, lawsuits and lost customer trust, but also reveal intellectual property and set a company\u2019s progress back by years.But even in today\u2019s threat landscape, there is reason to be optimistic. It\u2019s an opportunity for a long overdue transformation to how organizations manage and protect our public and private data \u2014 as well as the critical systems that manage, store and transmit this data. Threats cannot be contained merely by adding more outdated weapons to battle the enemy. After all, the frequency and severity of data breaches is outpacing the growth in security budgets \u2014 companies are paying more and receiving less. Like any strategic challenge, modern cybersecurity requires a new approach.The risk of cyberthreats is as dangerous as an unexpected shift in customer behavior, an economic crisis or a new competitor entering the market \u2014 threats that executives and board members are held accountable for. This new breed of risk requires a new breed of cybersecurity: having the right technology, people and processes in place to empower a company with clear line-of-sight visibility and control over their entire organization, at the speed required to get ahead of today\u2019s \u2014 and tomorrow\u2019s \u2014 threats.Despite the headlines, a minority of cyberattacks are the work of tech savants in the employ of rogue governments. Today\u2019s intruder is far more likely to be a 16-year-old using Google. And while organizations are building their arsenal of defenses, the intruders are slipping through the digital doors and windows left open by the organization. According to the 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, 99.9 percent of attacks exploited vulnerabilities that had been identified for more than a year, some of them as far back as 1999. So the vital work for most organizations is not bolstering the defenses in place. Instead it\u2019s a challenge of basic hygiene, from ensuring systems are up to date with the latest patches and software to understanding something as basic as how many computers are on the network. If you can\u2019t keep track of the devices on your network, there is no way you can effectively manage and secure them.Organizations need to go back to basics and make good security hygiene practices a critical priority. In the wake of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 2015 data breach, which impacted millions of government employees and contractors, U.S. CIO Tony Scott issued a 30-day cybersecurity sprint to agencies to shore up their systems, including a mandate to patch all known vulnerabilities. The challenge in achieving this lies in the technology used to manage, secure and control the billions of devices on corporate and government networks worldwide. Organizations need technology that was built for this new age of computing \u2014 not decades-old tools \u2014 to spot and respond to attacks as they occur, and ultimately prevent them from occurring in the first place. Scott described the outdated tools problem best: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like trying to put airbags on a \u201965 Mustang \u2014 it just wasn\u2019t designed for security, wasn\u2019t designed for safety.\u201d\u201cNetworks have gotten bigger. Environments have gotten more complicated. Security tools that are 25 years old are just not working.\u201dSource: 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations ReportIT organizations have been adding security defenses as long as they have been using computers. Unfortunately, the tools used haven\u2019t kept pace with the computing shifts of the past two decades, from virtualization to cloud computing. Most organizations still use antivirus software as a defense, a technology that has been around since the 1990s. And while there is a common understanding that antivirus is fool\u2019s gold, many organizations still spend thousands to millions of dollars on this technology, creating a false sense of security while \u201cchecking the box\u201d for compliance. In more recent years, as new threats have emerged, hundreds of security vendors have responded with offerings to address them. The result is that many organizations are left to manage an outdated, dense stack of security tools, which are either ineffective of keeping attackers out or don\u2019t provide data fast enough for an organization to actually stop an attack. According to the 2015 Verizon report, in 60 percent of security incidents, attackers broke into a system and compromised an organization within minutes, yet the majority of breaches took weeks to detect. IT and security teams desperately need a clear and timely view of the threats they face \u2014 in the moment they are happening \u2014 but they all too often must stitch together reports containing days or weeks-old data. What\u2019s worse, while they might have been defending a few thousand computers 10 years ago, they likely have 10 times as many systems now.In 2013, IDT Corporation of Newark, N.J., was grappling with a typical and unwieldy complex of legacy systems, some dating back to the 1990s. In all, the telecommunications company was running 96 different security products, many of them overlapping or not providing the coverage required. Antivirus software was detecting only 20 percent of the threats.The biggest problem was time. Like other companies, IDT was facing constant streams of attack bots probing its defenses. Yet, all too often the response to these threats involved a system administrator spotting a red light on a dashboard, and then picking up the phone or even hurrying down hallways. Golan Ben-Oni, IDT\u2019s chief information officer, estimates that it took his team four to five hours to investigate an attack. IDT found itself overmatched, says Ben-Oni. \u201cWe were bringing knives to a gunfight.\u201dSource: 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations ReportThe IDT staff saw that they needed tools to give them visibility and speed. This meant cleaning out the clutter of legacy programs, and counting on fewer programs that could handle the speed required with automatic functions. Only machines could respond quickly to machine-generated threats. This shift also led to a strategic advantage. It reduced the need to recruit in the over-tapped market for security professionals, where there are now over a million unfilled positions.In the following three years, IDT reduced its security tool arsenal from 96 to 15 systems, including Tanium. Technology platforms capable of meeting the speed and scale requirements that IDT required replaced old standalone programs. The result? Investigations that used to take four hours can now race through the system in seconds. And the company is spending less on security than it did three years ago.Companies need to see what is happening on their networks and be able to respond to cyberthreats in seconds, not days or weeks. Having 15-second visibility and control over every critical IT system is achievable with the right tools, even as the number of interconnected devices grows.The need for basic IT security hygiene, such as patching systems, hasn\u2019t changed in years. The challenge lies in knowing which systems are vulnerable and updating them quickly. This means having the right tools to effectively enforce standard configurations as part of the regular course of IT operations and systems management.Today, companies are investing in multiple point solutions, many of which are decades old, with each addressing a sliver of the cybersecurity challenge at a high operational cost. Companies should look to invest in platforms that cover a broad range of security issues with speed and resiliency to simplify the tool ecosystem and reduce management costs.Awareness and literacy about security readiness at the board level are becoming of paramount importance, as directors have the strategic and financial power to steer companies to a paradigm shift. \u201cFor a lot of board members, these are issues that didn\u2019t exist during their business careers,\u201d says Brad Peterson, Nasdaq\u2019s chief information officer. It is vital not only to educate the board, but also to ensure that executives and the board take accountability over this strategic risk.Tanium and Nasdaq jointly commissioned a study of over 1,500 C-suite officers and non-executive company directors at Global 2000 organizations across five regions to gauge the state of cybersecurity awareness and readiness. At far too many companies, directors and C-level executives are disengaged from crucial security issues. At the most vulnerable companies surveyed, one in three have never received security training and 91 percent of those directors say they struggle to make sense of a cybersecurity report. This makes it nearly impossible for them to ask tough questions about these crucial issues, much less guide smart investment strategies for security.Even those who understand the risks often lack crucial information. According to the survey, 28 percent of all respondents report concerns that their anti-malware, antivirus software and patches may not be up to date. Among the companies at greatest risk, this number skyrockets to 87 percent. Those firms combine the worst of dangers. They\u2019re vulnerable, but they often don\u2019t know where or how.Most interestingly, the study found that a widespread lack of accountability at all levels of an organization is another critical culprit. 40 percent of respondents admitted that they didn\u2019t feel responsible for cyberattacks, even though the report revealed that 90 percent of all respondents are at medium to high vulnerability to a cyberthreat.Source: Tanium/Nasdaq Reportof the respondents at the most vulnerable companies didn\u2019t feel they were up to date on the most relevant threats.Staying current on the threat landscape should be a specified role in the company, and this information needs to be communicated up to executives and the board in a timely manner.of the most vulnerable CIOs are unaware of the steps needed to take action to prevent, locate and neutralize cyberthreats.A company\u2019s cyberthreat and response plan should encompass regular and continuous processes, such as patching and updating software on IT systems, but should also be agile enough to rapidly respond to new and evolving threats.of board members at the most vulnerable companies can't interpret a cybersecurity report.If your organization\u2019s board members are not technologists or security experts, it\u2019s critical that the CIO and CISO educate the board on the fundamentals of security to create a baseline understanding and present information in a digestible format.Source: Tanium/Nasdaq ReportThe choice facing executives and corporate boards could not be simpler. Either succumb to the chaotic growth of information technology, placing the company at an existential risk, or assert control over the process.To face the growing risks, executives and board directors must identify the right battles to fight, put the right technology in place to fight them, and create accountability and awareness in the executive suite and the board.The key to success is confidence in the data used to assess risk and manage critical IT systems. Without accurate and up-to-date information, it\u2019s impossible to understand where the risk is and how to mitigate it. 20/20 clear vision across all devices on the network, and the status of each device now requires data and action in seconds, not days, weeks or months. The technologists at Tanium have invented a software platform to provide this level of visibility and control with the speed required to secure and manage every device on the network, whether it\u2019s thousands or millions of them. Now IT and security teams can detect and respond to attacks in seconds, while also helping ensure the basics of security hygiene are continuously followed.\u201cThere are a lot of people who now consider security the biggest problem in enterprise IT, and it\u2019s not just CIOs and CISOs, it\u2019s CEOs and the board who are talking about it. That\u2019s heartening to see. This is a huge problem and unless it gets the attention it deserves, it\u2019s not going to get solved.\u201d\u2013Orion Hindawi, Tanium Co-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerIt\u2019s time for a new level of accountability for cybersecurity at every level in the organization, including the entire executive suite and the board of directors. Building the awareness to address these threats and make the right decisions for the organization will require cybersecurity training so there is a baseline of cyber literacy for technologists and non-technologists alike. At the same time, executives should evaluate whether they need to recruit technology and cybersecurity savvy directors to their boards, similar to the role the audit chair plays on the board to assess and control financial risk.Facing this growing threat, after all, requires the mobilization of the entire organization and new approaches to the technology used to fight the battle. It\u2019s not an insurmountable task, but to survive in 2020, companies must get it right today.The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

People say that I\u2019m tanned, but that\u2019s my natural color.\u201dShe also spoke about the explosive arc of her career and getting Googled by Eddie Redmayne. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation:Q. It\u2019s been such a whirlwind year for you. Did you see it coming at all?Even though you voiced Ingrid Bergman in the documentary about her?Yeah, but that\u2019s kind of a dream, you know. Growing up, I remember I had a playing-card deck with film stars and I remember that Ingrid Bergman was one of those, and that\u2019s kind of how far away in dreamland that was.What you need to know about the contenders in one quick rundown.Your accent is lovely. Did you have to work on an Englishy accent?I had much more of an American accent. When I sat in the makeup trailer with Eddie, he said, \u201cAlicia, I was Googling you last night.\u201d I thought, \u2018O.K.!\u2019 [Laughs.] He said: \u201cI found a video, an interview with you four years ago. Your English is much better now, but you sound so Americanized.\u201d And I think I was, and that\u2019s because, as a Swede, you know, it\u2019s my second language and I watched a lot of films and TV.Was Gerda more challenging than Ava?They were both very challenging. The challenge with Gerda was how outwardly expressive in her emotions she is. And Ava was all about finding the subtlety, and making people believe that she might have consciousness.Did Ava have a conscience?I changed my mind a few times about that, which is quite rare, but it was because it was an endless choice that you were able to play with such depthWhat did you conclude?I haven\u2019t even told Alex [Garland, the director]. That\u2019s the beauty of it, and that\u2019s the fear or that\u2019s the thrill.And with Gerda?With Gerda, it is the choice of daring to love somebody so much. It\u2019s a tough journey she\u2019s on, but I\u2019m also a big romantic. Acknowledging the fact that you will dare to love somebody, knowing that you might end up losing somebody, but being still willing to sacrifice a lot to the person is being extremely giving. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s our society that giving so much can seem passive, but what I realized was no, it\u2019s just the biggest amount of strength, emotional strength, to be able to do that pure heartedly like she doesAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Have Fallen Faster and Further Than Broader Market", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the United States economy muddled along over the last few years, investors paid handsome sums to get in on high-flying technology companies that were among the few pockets of steady growth. Now comes the payback.As the stock market continues its 2016 slide, technology stocks are falling even further, victims of their own success as well as fears about the global economy and a slowdown in business spending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9.4 percent this year. The index\u2019s technology components are down about 12 percent, and the closely watched so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are down even further, falling 17 percent on average this year after an 83 percent rise in 2015.\u201cThey go faster on the way up, they go faster on the way down. That\u2019s about as simple as I can make it,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners.Shares of Twitter, the popular social media service, for example, are down about 40 percent so far this year. And some analysts worry it could tumble even more after the company announces quarterly results Wednesday afternoon.The overall market has been hit by a slowdown in China and a collapse in the price of oil prices and other commodities.Many technology companies continue to produce strong profits, and for the most part they have strong balance sheets with lots of cash to fund future growth. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for example, added close to $10 billion to its $73 billion cash reserve over the last year.But since these companies\u2019 shares are priced high relative to their profits \u2014 that is, because investors are willing to pay more now in hopes of getting in on future growth \u2014 they become more vulnerable when there is a broader market downturn.\u201cThe market is doing a general sell-off, everybody is looking at things,\u201d said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund. \u201cTech stocks are pretty expensive, so they are more prone to correction.\u201dTake, for instance, the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon and Facebook. P/E, as stock analysts call it, is a measurement of a company\u2019s stock price divided by earnings a share. For Amazon, that number is 388. Facebook? It\u2019s 78. But for the whole S.&P. 500, it is a more modest 17.Wage growth has been slow for years, but consumers always seemed to have enough for a new iPhone or to try out new gadgets like a FitBit, all while shifting more of their spending to online outlets like Amazon and Netflix. Businesses embraced cloud computing and bought ever more ads on Google and Facebook.No doubt, technology stocks were to some extent being lifted by the same low interest rates that had propelled the broader stock market, but they also had good stories to tell their investors, as well as the numbers to back it up.Now some investors are wondering how long they can keep it up in the face of slower growth. The economy ended last year on a whimper, expanding less than 1 percent for a number of reasons including weaker trade and falling business investment.Worried about a broader slowdown, investors have become quick to punish any company that looks as if its upward trajectory is flattening out, particularly if that company looks susceptible to the decline in businesses spending.That thinking helps explain big drops for LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, and Tableau Software, a maker of business software. Both companies have lost more than half their market value after weaker-than-expected revenue forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, the cloud software company, have been caught in the undertow and are down close to 30 percent this year.\u201cPeople are starting to anticipate a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and a slowdown in related technology spending,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.Still, with consumer spending and job growth remaining healthy, the market continues to give special consideration to consumer-focused companies that are making their numbers.Netflix also disappointed Wall Street with American subscriber growth that was lower than investors had hoped. The stock is down about 25 percent this year.What is not yet clear is how the decline in public company shares will affect the herd of tech \u201cunicorns,\u201d or private companies worth more than $1 billion, like the ride-hailing service Uber. Whatever the result, it is unlikely to be good.\u201cThat whole thing that you\u2019re going to hide out from the volatility in the public market \u2014 this is where they are going to find out that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, a technology investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

If Apple is required to help the F.B.I. in this case, courts could require it to use this software in future investigations or order it to create new software to fit new needs. It is also theoretically possible that hackers could steal the software from the company\u2019s servers.-Even if the government prevails in forcing Apple to help, that will hardly be the end of the story. Experts widely believe that technology companies will eventually build devices that cannot be unlocked by company engineers and programmers without the permission of users. Newer smartphones already have much stronger security features than the iPhone 5c Mr. Farook used.Congress would do great harm by requiring such back doors. Criminals and domestic and foreign intelligence agencies could exploit such features to conduct mass surveillance and steal national and trade secrets. There\u2019s a very good chance that such a law, intended to ease the job of law enforcement, would make private citizens, businesses and the government itself far less secure.Advertisement"}

Applicants need an employer to sponsor them for the visas, which are extremely limited: The visas are capped at 65,000 a year, with another 20,000 available for foreign students who have earned graduate degrees in the United States. Last year, 233,000 people entered the lottery for the visas, with about two-thirds of them losing out.But people working with nonprofits and institutions of higher education are exempt from the caps, and IN2NYC will use its partnerships with CUNY to help the entrepreneurs get the visas.Mr. Ryan said many New York companies had to hire employees abroad, so being able to keep talent in the city was a priority. \u201cIt\u2019s not as impactful as opening up the number of H-1B visas,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a great step forward.\u201dMaria Torres-Springer, the president of the development corporation, said the program would build on New York\u2019s history of being a welcoming place to immigrants. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing innovation hubs really beginning to blossom all over the city,\u201d she said, mentioning a clean-technology incubator she recently visited in Brooklyn, made up mostly of immigrant workers.\u201cThe program builds on the momentum, in a way where international entrepreneurs who want to relocate in the city now have a pathway to do that, as opposed to navigating what is currently a complex system.\u201dIN2NYC will work with seven campuses: Baruch College, City College, the College of Staten Island, LaGuardia Community College, Lehman College, Medgar Evers College and Queens College.Entrepreneurs will form a board of directors, most of whom will be American citizens or permanent residents, to establish the employer-employee relationship that an H-1B visa requires. Since entrepreneurs will be employed at a college for more than half their time, collaborating with professors and students, they will be exempt from the H-1B visa caps.\u201cThe impact of an immigration lawyer to help the next Elon Musk with no visa or a college student with no status has never been more significant,\u201d said Peter F. Asaad, the managing legal partner of Immigration Solutions Group, an immigration law firm in Washington that is providing counsel to New York City.Mr. Musk, the founder of SpaceX and the co-founder of Tesla Motors, was born in South Africa and came to the United States as a college student. Mr. Brin, the co-founder of Google, was born in Russia.Mr. Asaad has advised New York City on previous immigration programs involving entrepreneurs, and he thinks there will be a large pool of applicants who will already have \u201csubstantial amounts of angel investors and other sources believing in their company.\u201dThe development corporation expects that each entrepreneur will initially employ at least three people. Applications will be accepted in late spring, with the program scheduled to start in autumn.Mr. Ryan sees only an upside.\u201cEven if there are only a certain number who take advantage of this,\u201d he said, \u201cone of them will end up starting a really successful company, and that company will employ 500 people and create huge tax dollars.

Mr. Brooks fears that young Americans are forsaking the virtues of economic dynamism in their desire for greater economic security. He suggests that this is not the American way. But he doesn\u2019t grapple with why so many Americans have soured on our economic order.Too many American cities \u2014 indeed whole regions \u2014 have been devastated by mass job losses. More thriving metropolitan areas are increasingly unaffordable places to live. Real suffering accompanies our galloping inequality: Note the shocking uptick in drug- and despair-induced mortality among middle-age white Americans.Mr. Brooks wants to protect the conditions that nurture \u201cdisruptive dynamos\u201d like Walmart and Google. But as globalization and new technologies disrupt our economy, we need government to ensure that the gains aren\u2019t all going straight to the top, with American workers left behind paying the price.One need not be a Sanders-style democratic socialist to be nostalgic for the higher top marginal tax rates, more modest college costs and the broader union membership not of Denmark but of Eisenhower-era America. DANIEL TREIMANBrooklynThe writer is a student at New York University School of Law.To the Editor: David Brooks wonders why millennials are tired of American capitalism and finds it amazing that they want to \u201cmimic a continent that has been sluggish for decades\u201d and \u201cwant a country that would be a lot less vibrant.\u201dPerhaps they know that Denmark has consistently been among the countries with the highest scores on national happiness; it has the lowest corruption grade in the world, free vocational and university education, low unemployment and universal health care. Its companies actually pay taxes, and young people have no educational debt and find employment after school.How amazing that Mr. Brooks thinks that we are a vibrant, future-looking country when we cannot solve even the most basic problems. ALAN KRAUSNew Paltz, N.Y.To the Editor: It is clear to me that fear, anger and anxiety are causing so many young adults to long for Northern European stability. The simple truth is that salaries have not kept pace with the cost of living, and many young adults see their parents and others struggling.How is it that so many people work full time (both adults in a family!) and still qualify for food stamps or Medicaid? How ridiculous is it to think about saving for retirement when one can barely put food on the table?These young adults see no future for themselves. Of course they are longing for stability. It guarantees a roof over their heads, food on the table, and education in case economic conditions become more favorable.Perhaps if enough power and money were threatened to be taken from the 1 percent by democratic socialists, they might become frightened enough to actually trickle down some well-paying jobs. ADRIENNE L.

David Brooks should climb out of the bubble.Most young people I know are hindered from enjoying American vibrancy because they\u2019re a bit busy with their $9-an-hour jobs, trying to pay off their $50,000 student loan debt while hoping that they don\u2019t get sick or injured because they have no health insurance.Future American vibrancy depends on eager and educated economic participants; we cannot create them when we cling to an outdated social model that builds barriers to success.LISA CALEFPortland, Ore.To the Editor: David Brooks\u2019s column evokes the most fundamental question facing us in the election: What is the purpose of government?

Otherwise, you are most likely to be a bystander to that exhilarating vibrancy.RAYMOND B. CLAYTONStanford, Calif.To the Editor: David Brooks\u2019s column struck me as particularly tone-deaf to the realities of being a young person in America today. If he had considered that even the most well-educated millennials have come of age by entering a dismal job market of stagnating real wages with an average of more than $30,000 in student loans,then maybe Mr. Brooks wouldn\u2019t find it so \u201camazing\u201d that we young Americans look with envy to a continent of free college and a strong safety net. JACKIE GONZALESAlbanyTo the Editor: David Brooks\u2019s column is based on the faulty premise that American innovation is driven principally by the desire to make money, and that without free-rein capitalism, there would be no motivation to invent the next iPod.I believe that most Americans are driven to innovate by the restless, imaginative energy that is part of our country\u2019s daring fabric, and that Thomas Edison or Bill Gates would have invented what they did even if the United States had a high tax rate, free medical care, clean, cheap transportation and minimal poverty.I cannot imagine Alexander Graham Bell saying to his assistant: \u201cWatson, don\u2019t come in here.

But they don\u2019t all know this timepiece yet. And I can assure you, it is something they will really want to see.\u201dThe watch is the Flying Tourbillon Poin\u00e7on de Gen\u00e8ve, introduced by Louis Vuitton to great fanfare in January. It is the first timepiece made by the company to receive the Poin\u00e7on de Gen\u00e8ve, or Geneva Seal, indicating quality craftsmanship and timekeeping standards for watches made in Geneva.For Mr. Chatti, who arrived at Louis Vuitton in 2010 under strict orders to forge a world-class fine watchmaking operation for the luxury group LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the recognition is the perfect encapsulation of just how far the brand has come since it first started making timepieces in 2002.\u201cIt means a huge amount to us and a huge amount to our clients to be the best of the best and be awarded the seal,\u201d he said, adding that he thought rivals and industry insiders were shocked when the news broke. \u201cTo have been independently judged by its Geneva board, and deemed part of a coterie of the world\u2019s best artisans when it comes to in-house watch manufacturing, is a true honor, of course.\u201d\u201cBut to have been given the same approval as Swiss houses with 200 years\u2019 worth of heritage when we have only been in the business for 15 years? Now that\u2019s what makes this such an admirable achievement. I am extremely proud.\u201dRoger Dubuis, Vacheron Constantin, Chopard and Cartier also have timepieces that have earned the seal, represented by Geneva\u2019s coat of arms, which will appear on the Louis Vuitton watch\u2019s dial.Only two of the house\u2019s watchmakers work on the Flying Tourbillon, and with each capable of creating one timepiece a month, output is now capped at about 24 a year.Mr. Chatti said interest in the watches, which cost $196,000, has been very strong, with current sales on a first come, first serve basis.He also said the company opened La Fabrique du Temps, a 43,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Geneva, in October 2014. The site has not only consolidated Louis Vuitton\u2019s position in the sector, but has made it possible to significantly increase the company\u2019s capacity to make its own movements.\u201cThere is no question that having all 100 employees with their range of skills and crafts under a single roof has triggered some incredibly exciting and innovative synergies,\u201d Mr. Chatti said. \u201cWe are now viewed as a credible power player, both now and in terms of the future, in a way we perhaps haven\u2019t been before.\u201dPerhaps it is this newfound assertiveness that led Louis Vuitton to make a move this year that sent shock waves through the industry: Beginning this year, the company will no longer be showing at Baselworld, the biggest annual watch fair on the international show calendar.\u201cAt the end of the day this wasn\u2019t a very tough decision to make \u2014 look around us and how rapidly the luxury world is changing,\u201d Mr. Chatti said. \u201cThe minute a watch goes on display we get clients in stores asking to see it, which we aren\u2019t able to deliver.\u201d\u201cThen we make them wait six to eight months before they can buy it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe format of showing collections once a year no longer works for them, which means it no longer works for us.\u201dHis remarks came just days before the British fashion heavyweight Burberry announced that it would abandon its current show format in favor of selling collections straight from the catwalks, also in reaction to customer demand.\u201cThe plan now is to adopt a more modern form of presentation for our watches and to have them available to buy in stores within three weeks of them being shown to the press and online,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd because we do our manufacturing internally, and for the most part own our own retail network, for Vuitton this shift will be something that we are able to implement.\u201dOver all, the fine watch market continues to sputter. Swiss watch exports were down 8 percent in January from a year earlier, according to a report released last week, after a decline of 4 percent in December.Most retailers remained cautious going into the new year, but Mr. Chatti remained bullish on the prospects of Louis Vuitton.This month, LVMH\u2019s watch and jewelry division reported a 53 percent increase in profit last year, despite a slowdown in wholesaler spending. While it does not break out performance by brand, the announcement acknowledged the TAG Heuer Connected, the smartwatch presented in November in connection with Google and Intel; Bulgari\u2019s new Diva and Lucea collections; and Hublot\u2019s production improvements.\u201cThis will be a big year for us and I continue to feel very confident of our fortunes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bringing truly spectacular offerings to our collectors, recognized by the industry as a house able to do so, and most importantly, continue to perform well in mature markets.\u201cFor every flicker in emerging markets, we are able to counterbalance elsewhere. It is an exciting moment in the building of our legacy. I am excited for what will come next.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the opening date of the company\u2019s La Fabrique du Temps manufacturing facility.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Line in the Sand Was Over a Year in the Making", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Time and again after the introduction of the iPhone nearly a decade ago, the Justice Department asked Apple for help opening a locked phone. And nearly without fail, the company agreed.Then last fall, the company changed its mind. In a routine drug case in a Brooklyn federal court, prosecutors sought a court order demanding that Apple unlock a methamphetamine dealer\u2019s iPhone 5S running old, easy-to-unlock software. The company acknowledged that it could open the phone, as it had before. But this time, it pushed back.\u201cWe\u2019re being forced to become an agent of law enforcement,\u201d the company\u2019s lawyer, Marc Zwillinger, protested in court.That stance foreshadowed this week\u2019s showdown between the Obama administration and Apple over the locked iPhone belonging to one of the suspects in the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting rampage. By the time of Mr. Zwillinger\u2019s statement, Apple and the government had been at odds for more than a year, since the debut of Apple\u2019s new encrypted operating system, iOS 8, in late 2014.The new technology repeatedly stymied investigators \u2014 the New York authorities said on Thursday that they had been locked out of 175 iPhones in cases they were pursuing. But both sides held out hope for a compromise that would avoid the type of confrontation that occurred this week when a federal magistrate judge ordered Apple to comply with the Justice Department\u2019s request.With last October\u2019s court filing, the confrontation became all but inevitable. The company left no doubt that it would fight any effort to crack its new, encrypted phones. The only real question was what crime the government would use to press its case.Apple\u2019s stance that day in Brooklyn caught the Justice Department off guard. Despite the issue with iOS 8, the company had continued to cooperate. In the first half of 2015 alone, the company provided data in response to more than 3,000 law enforcement requests, Apple said. And company lawyers gave prosecutors no indication that the drug case against Jun Feng would be any different.Mr. Feng, 45, claimed to have forgotten his passcode, making his cooperation a moot point even if he were willing to extend it, according to a government filing. Unlike the phone in the San Bernardino case, Mr. Feng\u2019s ran iOS 7, an older version of Apple\u2019s operating system that does not automatically encrypt its data. The Justice Department figured it would have the information from Mr. Feng\u2019s phone within a day.Mr. Zwillinger said the drug case would be Apple\u2019s line in the sand. \u201cCustomer data is under siege from a variety of different directions,\u201d he said. \u201cNever has the privacy and security of customer data been as important as it is now.\u201dIt was a delicate period for the Obama administration, which was focused on finding a way to break into the new encrypted iPhones. The F.B.I., in particular, was lobbying hard to win support for that idea in the face of skepticism from Silicon Valley, Congress and the public.Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, described data privacy as a human rights issue. Backed by leading technologists, Mr. Cook argued that if the company designed a way to defeat encryption for the United States government, that tool would be exploited by hackers or foreign governments like China.Under the attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., the Justice Department was sympathetic to that point of view, even in the face of an aggressive campaign from the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey. Mr. Holder favored meeting with technology executives in the hope of finding common ground, current and former Justice Department officials said.Others in the department strongly disagreed. National security and criminal prosecutors argued that, with the introduction of the encrypted iOS 8, Apple (along with Google, which had started its own encrypted Android phone software) had made thumbing its nose at the government a business strategy. The only hope, these prosecutors argued, was a court fight or an act of Congress requiring companies to provide the government unencrypted data.Local law enforcement officials, too, were sounding alarms. \u201cThis has become, ladies and gentlemen, the Wild West in technology,\u201d Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney in Manhattan, said at a news conference Thursday, echoing complaints he and others have made for many months. \u201cApple and Google are their own sheriffs. There are no rules.\u201dWhen the attorney general Loretta E. Lynch and her deputy, Sally Q. Yates, took office last year, the F.B.I. and its law enforcement allies found more receptive ears. Ms. Yates, in particular, took up the issue, giving speeches and testifying before Congress alongside Mr. Comey.Such compromises forestalled a major court showdown, but increased the frustration at the Justice Department. Several current and former career prosecutors involved in the issue said they viewed it as hypocritical that Apple encouraged its customers to save its data to iCloud \u2014 which it would turn over to the government \u2014 but regarded the cellphone as sacrosanct.Then came the Feng case. By refusing to help, the Justice Department thought Apple was sending a clear signal. If it would no longer cooperate with requests to help unlock old phones, there was little chance it would give in and build a way to unlock the new encrypted phones running iOS 8.\u201cForcing Apple to extract data in this case, absent clear legal authority to do so, could threaten the trust between Apple and its customers and substantially tarnish the Apple brand,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said.By that time, 90 percent of Apple devices were running iOS 8 or newer versions. The F.B.I. warned that it was only a matter of time before its agents were locked out of a phone in a case with lives at stake.The San Bernardino attacks, which killed 14 people, presented the F.B.I. with a seemingly perfect test case. One of the shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, was killed by the police and left behind a locked, encrypted iPhone 5c. The F.B.I. has not been able to unlock it.Mr. Farook\u2019s phone is protected by a password that Apple says it does not keep and Apple says it cannot break the encryption without the password. The F.B.I. wants to write a program to send the phone an unlimited combination of passwords until it finds one that works.But Apple built its phones to protect against that tactic. Each wrong guess causes a short delay, which would significantly slow the F.B.I.\u2019s effort. After too many incorrect guesses, the phone will automatically erase its memory.The authorities are still interested in more than just Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. On Thursday, a team of F.B.I. agents raided the Southern California home of his brother, Syed Raheel Farook, and carted off boxes of belongings. The authorities would not say what they were searching for.But there is no telling what is on Mr. Farook\u2019s phone \u2014 maybe clues to accomplices or his inspiration, maybe nothing \u2014 but nobody in the government questioned the need for obtaining access to that data. From a public relations standpoint, Apple had been on the side of privacy advocates and civil libertarians. This case put the company on the side of a terrorist.\u201cThey need to figure that out now before there is that bigger body count. So this is as good a test case as any to have that fight,\u201d said Ron Hosko, who until 2014 led the F.B.I.\u2019s criminal division. \u201cCrack that thing for me now, Tim Cook, because it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201dThis week, the Justice Department got its wish when Apple was ordered to override its defenses, even if it meant building a tool that did not exist.Law enforcement officials cheered the ruling, though they acknowledged that the fight was not over. Apple promised to appeal. In New York, William Bratton, the police commissioner, held up a phone that he said was used by an associate of a man who shot and wounded two police officers in the Bronx recently.\u201cDespite having a court order, we cannot access this iPhone,\u201d Mr. Bratton said. \u201cJust one example, a very significant example in which two of my officers were shot, that impeding that case going forward is our inability to get into this device.\u201dThe case in Brooklyn continues, even though Mr. Feng has already pleaded guilty. While the Justice Department sees the San Bernardino incident as its ideal test case, Apple is hoping for a legal win in Brooklyn.Judge James Orenstein has given the company reason to be hopeful. In the past, he has been skeptical of the way the government uses an 18th-century law \u2014 the All Writs Act \u2014 that the Justice Department is now claiming gives it the authority to force Apple to unlock the phones. He once even described the Justice Department\u2019s use of it as a \u201cHail Mary play.\u201dBut he has yet to rule.An earlier version of this article misidentified the iPhone model of the shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. It was a 5c, not a 5s.Matt Apuzzo and Eric Lichtblau reported from Washington, and Joseph Goldstein from New York. Al Baker contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Poke Reaches the Shores of Manhattan", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byHungry City12 PhotosIn the late 1990s, the only place in New York City where I could find Hawaiian-style poke (poh-kay) was a fishmonger, now shuttered, on the Upper West Side.The guy behind the counter had a girlfriend who worked the Continental Airlines route from Newark to Honolulu. This blessed woman, whose name I never learned, brought back inamona, a paste made from the roasted, crushed hearts of kukui nuts, and poke mix: careful proportions of alaea salt (stained red by volcanic clay), dried limu (seaweed native to the islands) and chile.Then, a few years back, poke started appearing on stray restaurant menus, sometimes identified as Hawaiian crudo or ceviche. (In Hawaiian, poke means \u201cto cut crosswise in pieces.\u201d) Now, almost all at once, Manhattan is home to three restaurants devoted to poke, in addition to a chef dealing poke out of a coffee shop that doubles as a karaoke bar.The fish (ahi or salmon) is beautifully fresh and well cut, in hunks large enough to give a sense of plushness on the tongue. These may arrive under a gloss of shoyu (Japanese soy sauce) and sesame oil, with tracks of alaea salt and hijiki (seaweed), subtle and as essential as ligatures. Or a chile aioli whose slow-burn heat hums in the mouth without igniting it.Elsewhere in town, poke is typically heaped on a stark bed of rice. Here, each bowl ($7.50 to $10.75) is a terrarium of mesclun greens and seaweed salad, offsetting the richness of the fish, with a humbler cushion of rice half-hidden below. Elsewhere, I also found the white rice too clumpy, the brown rice too dry; at Sons of Thunder, both are commendably fluffy. Extras like crispy shards of garlic or a tinsel of nori add textural interest, but you don\u2019t need them.There is tako (octopus) poke, too, tender with just a touch of chewiness, as well as versions made with tofu or golden beets, which I thought sacrilegious until I tasted them. I still do not understand the miracle.Then again, James Kim, who shares duties in the kitchen with his younger brother, John, was once a pastor. (The restaurant\u2019s name comes from the troublemaker apostles James and John, whom Jesus called \u201csons of thunder.\u201d) The Kims are from Queens but have roots in Hawaii; their grandparents emigrated there from South Korea.The surfboard on the wall is James\u2019s, on leave from Lido Beach on Long Island. In the back is a dining room with a pretty skylight and little adornment beyond two large prints by the surf photographer Brian Bielmann, of tow-in boats at Teahupoo, in Tahiti, one of the world\u2019s great breaks, and of tiny riders in a long peel of blue.The menu ($10.50 to $12.95) is divided between house-composed \u201csignature works\u201d and a vertiginous list of build-it-yourself options, not all self-explanatory. This may exacerbate the discouraging line, which at peak lunch hour coils inside the narrow space and tumbles outside, almost rivaling the one at the nearby Chick-fil-A.The only place to sit is squashed on a stool at a brief counter, with customers-in-waiting breathing down your neck. Still, it is a relief in Midtown to be able to eat a light, healthy lunch that has genuine flavor and texture and doesn\u2019t feel like a sacrifice.Kevin Hsu, one of the owners and a native Californian, was inspired by the poke he ate on trips to Hawaii. But the recipes here go further afield, including chicken cooked sous-vide and slurred with a ginger-scallion sauce, a nod to Hainanese chicken; tofu dashed with Korean gochujang; and poke burritos.I don\u2019t like my poke too crowded. So I preferred the Umami Classic, a straightforward sum of ahi, sesame oil and shoyu bolstered by a house-made dashi stock, over rice.The room is too skinny to comfortably fit the poke pilgrims already thronging here, but it\u2019s lovely, more personal in feel than franchisable, outfitted in exposed brick, mosaic tile and a communal table with a stripe of succulents down the center. Bowl options ($7.95 to $13.95) include a demure snack size, which makes sense to me, since in Hawaii poke is often an appetizer or side dish.I tried all the \u201chouse favorites\u201d on the menu, tosses of ahi, salmon or tofu with different sauces and toppings, assembled to order with remarkable good cheer; the owners, Drew Crane and Bryan Cowan, have got the aloha spirit part right. I wished for a little less rice and a little more fish, and some oomph. But the Hawaii Style, ahi shining with shoyu and sesame oil, earned its name.He makes fine, honest poke, without too many complications: bowls ($12) of ahi steeped in shoyu, sesame oil, alaea salt and wakame or sriracha aioli. A staccato of black and white sesame seeds goes on top; below, sticky rice laced with rice vinegar and crushed pineapple (but not too much).At the bottom of the menu is Spam musubi, the blushing pink canned-meat product pressed between slabs of rice. In Hawaii, this, too, is beloved. I\u2019m still waiting for it to hit the big time.Advertisement"}

In recent years, iQiyi\u2019s executives have said repeatedly that they are planning to list the company in the United States in the next few years. Listing the video site, which Baidu acquired in 2012, allows it to retain talent by offering new stock incentives and greater independence to the company\u2019s leaders.Baidu competes with its Chinese rivals Alibaba and Tencent to invest in online-to-offline services, the sorts of businesses where the Chinese use smartphones to order things as diverse as meals and massages brought to their homes. This has been an expensive undertaking, with Baidu operating profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30 falling by more than a third from a year ago in part because of rising costs.The buyers would expect that Qiyi would remain a strategic partner after the transaction and enter into cooperation agreements with Baidu if the deal were consummated, Baidu said.\u201cThere can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made, that any legally binding agreement will be executed or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated,\u201d Baidu added.Such a transaction by a management-involved group for iQiyi would lighten Baidu\u2019s burden in another expensive area: streaming video. Baidu competes with Alibaba, Tencent and other Chinese companies to create or buy movies and television shows \u2014 both foreign and domestic, with iQiyi showing a range of programs from Chinese costume dramas to American shows like \u201cHomeland\u201d \u2014 that Chinese viewers stream through their smartphones, tablets and computers. Baidu has told investors it expects the costs of buying and producing content to continue to rise as a percentage of its income.Baidu said its board had formed a special committee of three independent directors to evaluate the transaction.

{"Headline": "Obama Administration Set to Expand Sharing of Data That N.S.A. Intercepts", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is on the verge of permitting the National Security Agency to share more of the private communications it intercepts with other American intelligence agencies without first applying any privacy protections to them, according to officials familiar with the deliberations.The change would relax longstanding restrictions on access to the contents of the phone calls and email the security agency vacuums up around the world, including bulk collection of satellite transmissions, communications between foreigners as they cross network switches in the United States, and messages acquired overseas or provided by allies.The idea is to let more experts across American intelligence gain direct access to unprocessed information, increasing the chances that they will recognize any possible nuggets of value. That also means more officials will be looking at private messages \u2014 not only foreigners\u2019 phone calls and emails that have not yet had irrelevant personal information screened out, but also communications to, from, or about Americans that the N.S.A.\u2019s foreign intelligence programs swept in incidentally.Civil liberties advocates criticized the change, arguing that it will weaken privacy protections. They said the government should disclose how much American content the N.S.A. collects incidentally \u2014 which agency officials have said is hard to measure \u2014 and let the public debate what the rules should be for handling that information.\u201cBefore we allow them to spread that information further in the government, we need to have a serious conversation about how to protect Americans\u2019 information,\u201d said Alexander Abdo, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer.Robert S. Litt, the general counsel in the office of the Director of National Intelligence, said that the administration had developed and was fine-tuning what is now a 21-page draft set of procedures to permit the sharing.The goal for the final rules, Brian P. Hale, a spokesman for the office, said in a statement, is \u201cto ensure that they protect privacy, civil liberties and constitutional rights while enabling the sharing of information that is important to protect national security.\u201dUntil now, National Security Agency analysts have filtered the surveillance information for the rest of the government. They search and evaluate the information and pass only the portions of phone calls or email that they decide is pertinent on to colleagues at the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies. And before doing so, the N.S.A. takes steps to mask the names and any irrelevant information about innocent Americans.The new system would permit analysts at other intelligence agencies to obtain direct access to raw information from the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance to evaluate for themselves. If they pull out phone calls or email to use for their own agency\u2019s work, they would apply the privacy protections masking innocent Americans\u2019 information \u2014 a process known as \u201cminimization\u201d \u2014 at that stage, Mr. Litt said.Executive branch officials have been developing the new framework and system for years. President George W. Bush set the change in motion through a little-noticed line in a 2008 executive order, and the Obama administration has been quietly developing a framework for how to carry it out since taking office in 2009.The executive branch can change its own rules without going to Congress or a judge for permission because the data comes from surveillance methods that lawmakers did not include in the main law that governs national security wiretapping, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA.Mr. Litt declined to make available a copy of the current draft of the proposed procedures.\u201cOnce these procedures are final and approved, they will be made public to the extent consistent with national security,\u201d Mr. Hale said. \u201cIt would be premature to draw conclusions about what the procedures will provide or authorize until they are finalized.\u201dAmong the things they would not address is what the draft rules say about searching the raw data using names or keywords intended to bring up Americans\u2019 phone calls or email that the security agency gathered \u201cincidentally\u201d under the 12333 surveillance programs \u2014 including whether F.B.I. agents may do so when working on ordinary criminal investigations.Under current rules for data gathered under a parallel program \u2014 the no-warrant surveillance program governed by the FISA Amendments Act \u2014 N.S.A. and C.I.A. officials may search for Americans\u2019 information only if their purpose is to find foreign intelligence, but F.B.I. agents may conduct such a search for intelligence or law enforcement purposes. Some lawmakers have proposed requiring the government to obtain a warrant before conducting such a search.That collection occurred under 12333 rules, which had long prohibited the N.S.A. from sharing raw information gathered from the surveillance it governed with other members of the intelligence community before minimization. The same rule had also long applied to sharing information gathered with FISA wiretaps.But after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration began an effort to tear down barriers that impeded different parts of the government from working closely and sharing information, especially about terrorism.\u201cWe would like it to be completed sooner rather than later,\u201d Mr. Litt said. \u201cOur expectation is months rather than weeks or years.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe Fail to Meet Deadline for Data Transfer Deal", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byAmerican and European officials failed on Sunday to reach an agreement over how digital data \u2014 including financial information and social media posts \u2014 could be transferred between the two regions. Despite last-minute talks, the two sides remained far apart on specific details required to approve a comprehensive deal. Without an agreement, companies that regularly move data, including tech giants like Google and nontech companies like General Electric, could find themselves in murky legal waters.European and American officials had until Sunday evening to meet a deadline set by Europe\u2019s national privacy agencies, some of which have promised aggressive legal action if the current negotiations founder. Those agencies will publish their own judgment on how data can be moved safely between the two regions on Wednesday.With time ticking down, the two sides are now hoping to agree to a broad deal before European national regulators act on Wednesday, according to several officials with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Still, negotiators said sticking points remained \u2014 including over how Europeans\u2019 data would be protected from surveillance by the American government and how Europeans could seek legal remedies in American courts \u2014 and neither side could guarantee the final outcome.The rules governing the transfer of online data have become a vital issue for many businesses. Facebook and Google, for example, use the information to help tailor the advertisements that are central to their businesses. Many nontech companies, like G.E., move data related to their customers and employees, as well as on how their products are used.No big American company is expected to change how it does business immediately. But many have gathered teams of lawyers to protect themselves in case no deal emerges.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, global head of privacy and data protection at the Brussels office of the Linklaters law firm, who represents companies that may become tangled up in the standoff. \u201cWe need a solution. Global business relies on transferring data. You cannot stop that.\u201dAll the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.With the talks increasingly stalled, Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, was expected to call Vera Jourova, the European commissioner of justice, on Sunday in the hopes of brokering a deal.European and American negotiators had been talking for years about a new deal, but the court\u2019s decision \u2014 which went into effect immediately \u2014 made action increasingly urgent.In recent weeks, American officials have offered a number of concessions to their European counterparts. They include increased oversight over American intelligence agencies\u2019 access to European data, according to several officials involved in the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.American officials have also proposed the creation of a so-called data ombudsman within the State Department. That office, according to officials, would give Europeans a direct point of contact in the United States if they believed government agencies had misused their data. Europeans also may seek arbitration directly with American companies that they accuse of unlawfully using their digital information.European officials, though, have expressed doubts that those moves would hold up if challenged in European courts. They have asked the Americans to provide specific details about how the current proposals would work in practice, according to two officials. In particular, Europeans want more information on the limits to American intelligence agencies\u2019 access to European data, and on how Europeans can file legal claims in the United States.American officials have argued that their proposals will stand up to European legal challenges. They also believe the United States has levels of data protection comparable to those in the European Union, where privacy is valued as highly as freedom of expression.\u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to make major changes,\u201d Bruce H. Andrews, the deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, said on Jan. 15. \u201cThe U.S. takes individuals\u2019 privacy very seriously.\u201dAny company \u2014 large or small \u2014 that transfers information between the two regions may face legal challenges. But the most likely targets for litigation, privacy advocates say, are large American tech giants like Google and Facebook that rely so heavily on people\u2019s data.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.But if a new pact is not approved \u2014 or does not meet national regulators\u2019 standards \u2014 some European privacy watchdogs may demand new limits on the movement of data.Several consumer groups plan to file complaints about how companies transfer data as soon as Monday, arguing that people\u2019s rights are not upheld when information is moved to the United States.\u201cThese issues are going to end up back in court,\u201d said Peter Swire, a law professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who helped negotiate the original safe harbor agreement while working for the Clinton administration.The importance of the deal to the companies and privacy groups has crystallized in recent weeks, as American executives and government officials made it a top priority.At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, for instance, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of the social network Facebook, held high-level discussions with a number of European and American politicians to voice the company\u2019s concerns about the pending deadline, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.Secretary Pritzker also met with Andrus Ansip, the European official in charge of the region\u2019s digital agenda, among other local policy makers, at Davos to discuss the new pact.On their way to negotiations in Brussels, a delegation of American officials made a stop in Paris last week, sitting down with a group of European national regulators to address concerns over how their citizens\u2019 data was used in the United States.In Brussels, several trade groups regularly shuttled between meetings with senior European officials last week. The groups representing the tech industry came armed with a series of legal opinions from leading data protection experts that played down the differences in the way privacy was handled in the two regions.The legal arguments included details about why current United States rules were on par with those of Europe \u2014 a view that critics of America\u2019s position jumped on almost immediately.\u201cThat assessment just isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician who has called for stronger data protection rules. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive difference over how this issue is treated in Europe compared to the U.S.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Super Bowl Pressure, for Advertisers as Well as Teams", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported by10 PhotosOn a recent Sunday morning, the actor Eugene Levy crouched next to an industrial fan at a sound stage in Queens. A nearby smoke machine cloaked Mr. Levy and everyone else on the set in a gray haze.\u201cHow many shots do they need to blow some air up a dress?\u201d Mr. Levy asked, peering at the actress standing on a platform above him.The line was among those Mr. Levy was trying out as part of the script, but it was also the question many on the production team were most likely asking themselves, as the director ordered take after take to make sure every detail was just right.The average cost of a 30-second Super Bowl ad has increased roughly 50 percent in the last decade when adjusted for inflation, according to data provided by WPP\u2019s Kantar Media. And this year is more expensive than ever, putting blockbuster-level pressure on brands to produce ads that justify the hefty price tag.Advertisers are reticent about how much they spend to produce Super Bowl ads, but an average commercial during the game costs more than $160,000 a second for the commercial time alone. In a loose comparison, \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d cost roughly $25,000 a second to produce.Advertisers have sought for years to milk more attention from their Super Bowl spots, releasing online teasers and creating contests on social media, among assorted bells and whistles. But with the media landscape undergoing constant change and becoming ever more varied, there is also an underlying anxiety about how best to reach people.Even as advertising dollars shift online, television commercials \u2014 particularly during live events like the Super Bowl that draw huge audiences\u2014 are still in many ways the surest way to get in front of the most eyeballs at once. The Super Bowl also appeals to advertisers because many viewers are just as eager to watch the commercials as they are to watch the game.But it also comes with a big risk: If the ads flop \u2014 or worse, create backlash \u2014 they can be an embarrassment and a big waste of money. A commercial for Nationwide insurance during last year\u2019s Super Bowl that showed a young boy lamenting the things he would never be able to do \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll never learn to ride a bike. I won\u2019t get cooties.\u201d \u2014 because he had died from a preventable accident was quickly derided for being too morose. The executive who oversaw the spot has since left the company.The high cost of Super Bowl ads also comes at a time when many brands are looking to cut their overall advertising budgets. So the decision to hand over millions of dollars for a single commercial is not one advertisers take lightly.\u201cObviously, everyone takes a look at the cost of the Super Bowl investment,\u201d said Matt Montei, senior marketing director for Wrigley confections, which includes Skittles.To justify that spending, many brands are now looking for more ways to hold consumers\u2019 attention once the commercials go off the air. Nearly every brand has a social media strategy. Google and Facebook both introduced new Super Bowl-related offerings in recent weeks to help advertisers further infiltrate viewers\u2019 second screens.\u201cWe have a whole war room set up at the agency,\u201d said Dean Evans, the chief marketing officer for Hyundai Motor America, which will run two 30-second spots during the game and two 60-second spots before the game.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to use TV and the Super Bowl to get our name out there,\u201d said Phil Bienert, the chief marketing officer of GoDaddy. He said that advertising during the Super Bowl was like \u201cplaying Powerball\u201d because there are so many ads that it is difficult to stand out. Last year, 39 companies, some with multiple brands, ran ads during the Super Bowl. Snickers, however, is willing to play the lottery. At the Queens soundstage, the actor Willem Dafoe \u2014 playing the part of a cranky, hungry Marilyn Monroe \u2014 wore a white dress and heels, which gave him some difficulty as he stood on the subway grate reading his lines. At one point, he yelled that someone in his line of sight was distracting him, sending the production team scrambling to remove the offender so that shooting, which was scheduled to take all day, could resume.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d said Peter Kain, executive creative director at BBDO New York, the ad agency working with Snickers. \u201cThey spend so much money on it, and they want their money\u2019s worth.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Love With Food\u2019s revenue last year was about $5 million, year-over-year sales are up 15 percent and the cost of acquiring a customer is down 30 percent.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean these smaller players don\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just means they haven\u2019t been able to find each other.\u201dFameBit allows a small business like Love With Food to advertise opportunities for small to midsize influencers to feature its product or service in videos. These influencers are not great YouTube stars but have sizable, loyal followings. They are also entrepreneurs, whose revenue comes from ads and corporate sponsors whose products or services they feature.Influencers with at least 5,000 subscribers on YouTube, Instagram, Vine, Twitter, Tumblr or Facebook can use FameBit.FameBit recently teamed up with the e-commerce platform Shopify to enable FameBit\u2019s influencers to open online stores. Likewise, brands using Shopify can search for influencers on FameBit to promote their products.High-priced influencers with millions of subscribers are generally out of reach for small businesses and are often part of multichannel networks, which function like talent agencies. The networks aggregate YouTube videos around niche topics like beauty, fashion or food and sell ads against it, while providing the YouTube stars they represent with production, promotion and marketing services. In exchange, the networks take a fairly substantial cut of the ad revenue, Mr. Verna said.Although influencer marketing got its start on YouTube, it has expanded in the last year to encompass other video platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Periscope. That is because video creators are increasingly seen as the best way to reach young consumers.Most entities that offer to connect YouTube talent with brands function as a kind of middleman, facilitating the connection. FameBit\u2019s marketplace is different, allowing influencers and brands to connect directly with one another, in real time. Brands can sign up free, and when an influencer is hired, payment is held until the content is created, approved and published. FameBit takes a 10 percent fee from both sides of the transaction. Its revenue now is about $1 million a month. The company, which is profitable, raised $1.5 million a year ago.\u201cIt enables brands to still get their messages across,\u201d said Mr. Verna at eMarketer.Most brands on FameBit pay influencers $500 to $2,000 to feature a product or service. More than 23,000 influencers \u2014 largely video creators \u2014 use the platform now, Ms. Kozera said, as do more than 3,500 brands, from smaller start-ups like Dollar Shave Club to much bigger names like Adidas and L\u2019Oreal.Although she was a part of the multichannel network StyleHaul before using FameBit, Ms. Lane\u2019s first opportunities to work with brands came through FameBit. She gets offers for brand partnerships through StyleHaul, but says those opportunities are presented to her at StyleHaul\u2019s discretion; she doesn\u2019t get to pitch herself directly to brands.\u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t getting those offers when I was smaller and first starting out,\u201d she said. \u201cFameBit was where I got my start with brand partnerships.\u201dWhen her video channel first started, Ms. Lane earned about 5 percent of her revenue from integrating brands into videos and the rest came from Google ads.\u201cAs my influence went up I was able to ask for more money, because my platform had a bigger reach,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, even though every video I do isn\u2019t sponsored, a solid 50 percent of my income is from sponsored content.\u201dShe is very careful about the products and brands with which she works. \u201cI only work with those I really like, otherwise it could negatively affect both my credibility and the brand\u2019s.\u201d Ms. Lane always discloses if a video is sponsored by a particular brand. She now earns between four and five figures a month, depending on the time of year and industries she is covering.Engagement is what is believable to consumers, not celebrity, Mr. Curtis said. \u201cIf the influencer is considered an expert in a particular area and their subscribers follow them because of that, those subscribers will also listen to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Commute of the Future? Ford Is Working on It", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byOn a brisk October day in Chicago, a few employees from the design firm Ideo left their office and headed to Knife & Tine, a restaurant about four miles away. The goal, besides lunch, was to complete the journey within 45 minutes, on a budget of just $10 for the whole group, all while carrying bulky shopping bags.This was not a party game, but the kind of immersive research that defines the work of Ideo, a global design firm whose clients have included Samsung, 3M, Anheuser-Busch and, on this day, Ford.Ideo has worked for Ford since 2005, developing software for its hybrid vehicles and designing the console of the Ford Fusion. Now, anticipating a future when Ford will have to do much more to survive than sell cars, the company asked Ideo to develop products focused on \u201cmultimodal transportation\u201d \u2014 jargon for everything that isn\u2019t driving, as in buses, subways, bike shares, water taxis, ride hailing apps and walking. By getting themselves to lunch without a car, the Ideo designers were hoping to gain firsthand insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the city\u2019s transportation options.Led by Iain Roberts, an Ideo partner who has worked with Ford for a decade, the three Ideo employees left the office at 11:45 a.m. with energetic optimism.Mr. Roberts, who once designed vacuum cleaners alongside James Dyson, is originally from London but lived in Chicago for 12 years and knows the city well. The weather was pleasant, and Mr. Roberts led the team to a nearby dock for Divvy, the city\u2019s bike sharing program. But Divvy charges first-time users $10 for a day pass \u2014 too expensive for the group of three. Checking Uber, Mr. Roberts reported that the trip would cost about $12 and take about 20 minutes. It was the fastest option, but still over budget. The subway was just $2.25 per person. If all went well, they could get to the restaurant in 44 minutes, on time and under budget.After a short walk to a nearby subway stop, tickets were procured. After that, nothing went well. They had just missed a train. There were no screens showing when the next train would arrive. At one point, two maintenance workers ominously strolled down the middle of the tracks.Ten minutes later, a train arrived, hot and rank with body odor. There was no cellphone service underground, meaning Mr. Roberts could neither distract himself by surfing the web, nor notify the friends he was meeting for lunch that he\u2019d probably be late. At one station, the train stalled for five minutes with the doors open. On the platform, a police unit patrolled with a bomb-sniffing German shepherd.The train began moving again, and after 40 minutes Mr. Roberts and his team emerged from a station less than a mile from Knife & Tine. The journey had frayed nerves, and rather than take the bus or walk to the restaurant, they decided to hop in a cab for a quick five-minute ride. The extra $10 blew the budget, but the team was only 10 minutes late.To the Ideo designers, the arduousness of their simple crosstown journey illustrated just how fraught the \u201cmultimodal\u201d terrain was. There was clearly room for improvement. The question was, could Ford be part of it?\u201cThis is a complicated, gnarly problem with a complex ecosystem of stakeholders,\u201d Mr. Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to use the word \u2018multimodal,\u2019 but when you sit in Chicago or Shanghai and experience it, it\u2019s difficult.\u201dFord is once again trying to anticipate the future. For a century, personal transportation has remained relatively unchanged \u2014 Americans rely largely on cars, and on public transportation to a lesser degree \u2014 but technology is allowing a new generation of companies to reimagine how people get around.Car-sharing services like Zipcar allow urbanites to opt out of owning a car. Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft do the same. Trip-planning apps like Google Maps and Moovit make public transportation easier to use. And the prospect of self-driving cars, under development by both carmakers and technology giants, led Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s co-founder, to speak openly of his hope that the technology would \u201creduce the need for individual car ownership.\u201d\u201cCars are expensive. There are all these new travel options. More things are getting delivered,\u201d said David King, a professor of urban studies at Columbia University. \u201cAll of this adds up to a dramatically changing relationship with travel.\u201dIndividual car ownership isn\u2019t going to stall overnight. The big carmakers are reporting record sales and profits. But to be competitive for the next hundred years, Ford will have to do much more than just make cars, said Will Farrelly, who works on Ford\u2019s \u201csmart mobility\u201d team in London. \u201cWe see these not as threats but as opportunities for our businesses,\u201d he said.Precisely what kinds of opportunities, however, aren\u2019t yet clear. And when companies like Ford need to outsource their creativity, they hire Ideo. Best known for helping Apple design the computer mouse in 1980, Ideo today churns out websites, industrial products and even voting systems for companies and governments around the globe. Ideo helped Ikea reimagine the kitchen and the North Face redefine its apparel brand. The privately held firm, which has 10 offices and more than 600 employees, this month sold a minority stake to Hakuhodo DY Holdings, a Japanese conglomerate.Ford is usually working with Ideo on one or two projects, and last summer executives at the carmaker decided to take on multimodal transportation. Ford had already dabbled in this area, experimenting with electric bike shares and car-pooling services. In April, the company will introduce FordPass, an app that offers a suite of services including car sharing and electronic payments for parking.Starting in September, a Ford team led by Mr. Farrelly began working with Mr. Roberts and a handful of Ideo designers, with the loose goal of bringing a new product to market in 2016. There was no mandate to design a specific new app or service. Instead, the project started with questions.\u201cHow to activate insights around latent mobility or multimodal needs?\u201d Mr. Roberts said, in full business-speak mode. \u201cHow can Ford participate in that future opportunity space? Our goal is to provide ideas and solutions that future-proof Ford\u2019s place in the market. This is by no means a blue-sky project.\u201dIn other words, what can Ford create that isn\u2019t out there already, and that will make money for years to come?Research began in earnest in October, when teams of Ideo researchers set up shop in London, Shanghai and Chicago. In Chicago, along with Mr. Roberts, there was an artist, a data scientist and an interaction designer. These cross-disciplinary teams are a hallmark of Ideo, which takes a liberal arts approach to commercial product design.The Ideo team connected with a half-dozen Chicagoans from diverse backgrounds. Among them was a 38-year-old whose short commute to her title insurance job involved a mix of driving, public transportation, walking and cabs. There was a 36-year-old doorman who relied on public transportation and walking for his 45-minute commute. And there was a 55-year-old who got to his job in the airline industry using public transit, cabs and his car.For weeks, the Ideo team followed these people as they went about their lives, visiting their homes, taking pictures of what they carried in their pockets, tagging along during their commutes, and pestering them with questions like why they decided to take the bus rather than the subway. Similar work was being done in London and Shanghai, all with the aim of better understanding people\u2019s behaviors and devising ways to improve their commutes.When the Ideo team wasn\u2019t following commuters, it was interviewing city planners and academics steeped in traffic data. And for good measure, the designers tried every conceivable mode of transportation in Chicago, even when going to lunch.After strawberry salads and sweet potato gnocchi at Knife & Tine, the Ideo team set off to do some sightseeing. Its destination: \u201cCloud Gate,\u201d the mirrored bean-shaped sculpture in Millennium Park, about five miles away on the lakefront.For this leg of the journey, the goal was speed, with no financial constraints. Lazy after a heavy lunch, the team chose to take an Uber.Two minutes after Mr. Roberts pulled out his phone, a black Lincoln MKC pulled up. It was a car Mr. Roberts knew well \u2014 Lincoln is owned by Ford, and Ideo had helped design the car\u2019s touch-screen software. Admiring Chicago\u2019s majestic lakeside architecture from the comfort of the S.U.V.\u2019s black leather seats, Mr. Roberts was far more contented than he had been on the subway. But the fare was a steep $32.Between excursions and visits with the local residents, the Ideo team reconvened at the office and tried to make sense of its data. Snapshots of the locals\u2019 lives were taped to the walls of a dedicated project room. During brainstorming sessions, the designers wrote key words and phrases on color-coded neon Post-it notes with black Sharpie pens, a signature aesthetic component of the Ideo design process.On the morning before it went to Knife & Tine, the team reviewed what it had heard from the subjects. The airline industry worker had told the Ideo team how much he hated being stuck on a bus. If a bus hit traffic within striking distance of his destination, he would often persuade the driver to open the door, and he would walk. It might take longer, but he hated feeling stuck.\u201cWaiting time is wasting life,\u201d said Enrica Masi, an interaction designer.Arianna McClain, a design researcher, riffed on this. \u201cMost commutes take the same amount of time, but some people just want to be moving,\u201d she said.Finally, Mr. Roberts tried to sum it all up.\u201cThere is a difference between the most direct journey, and the journey that meets my needs,\u201d he said.Over weeks of these sorts of conversations, the Ideo team developed a working theory that there were three archetypal commuters: Time Trumpers, for whom the only thing that mattered was the speed of the journey, regardless of comfort; Everyday Improvers, who looked for little ways to make a familiar commute more efficient or enjoyable; and Experience Seekers, adventurous spirits who might decide to try a new route and explore a new neighborhood, or walk if the weather was nice.With these archetypes in mind, the Ideo team came up with a handful of conceptual services and presented them to the research subjects. What if a there were one pass that paid for all modes of transportation? What if trains and buses could text you when they were running late, and you could reply? What if an app gave you instant alternatives when your usual method of commuting was delayed?The designs weren\u2019t meant to represent actual products that Ford would develop. Rather, Ideo was looking for clues in the Chicagoans\u2019 reactions that might inform more sketches, more concepts and perhaps, eventually, a prototype. \u201cThey\u2019re intended to be almost sacrificial,\u201d Mr. Roberts said of these early ideas.By the end of October, it still wasn\u2019t clear what Ideo would have to show for its months of intensive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 work. But some ideas were ruled out. It was clear that another route-planning app wouldn\u2019t suffice. In fact, the answer might not be one product, but three different ones.After they had snapped a few selfies under the warped mirror of Cloud Gate, it was time for the Ideo team to return to the office, about a mile and a half away. This time, the mandate was to do whatever was most enjoyable. The weather was still nice, so they decided to use Divvy, the bike-share service.The user interface on the Divvy docking station was confusing and slow. For a quick one-way ride, the $10 fee felt steep, and the bikes were dirty and hard to maneuver. But riding across the bridges of downtown Chicago in the afternoon light was the most exhilarating part of the day.The Ideo team\u2019s trips that day seemed to confirm some of their hunches. The subway might have worked for Everyday Improvers, if only the trains had been on time. Uber was clearly best for Time Trumpers. Riding a bike was great for Experience Seekers.In the months that followed, the firm developed three illustrative applications, one for each personality archetype. They weren\u2019t functional, but they suggested what might be possible.The app for Time Trumpers gave alternate routes if a user was stuck. A text-message-based app for Everyday Improvers informed users how the weather might affect their commute. And the Experience Seeker app allowed users to choose routes based on factors like \u201cconnect with nature,\u201d \u201cwindow shopping,\u201d and \u201cget your 10K steps.\u201dSome 800 test subjects around the world noodled with these ideas, playing with the dummy apps and providing Ideo with feedback. Like the earlier concepts, these were most likely \u201csacrificial.\u201d But they were closer to something that Ford might one day bring to market.In mid-January, Mr. Roberts and the team traveled to Dearborn, Mich., to present its findings at Ford headquarters. Both Ideo and its client were tight-lipped about what exactly happened during the workshop, but evidently the higher-ups at Ford were intrigued enough to push ahead: Ideo has developed more polished versions of some of its concepts, and is testing them with transportation authorities in London and Chicago. When functional versions are ready, the goal is to integrate them into FordPass.Ford is working hard to avoid being undone by new technologies. Besides its existing experiments with ride sharing and FordPass, there are reports that Ford is working with Google on self-driving cars. Most other big carmakers are experimenting in similar ways.Whatever Ideo cooks up for Ford will be a tiny part of the carmaker\u2019s broader strategy. It almost certainly won\u2019t generate the billions of dollars Ford will need to replace lost revenues whenever car sales do decline. But by trying to understand the hearts and minds of commuters who rely on buses, subways and their own feet, Ford hopes to at least be relevant in a more complex future, perhaps one with fewer cars.\u201cWith the original Model T, we opened up the highways to all mankind,\u201d Mr. Farrelly said. \u201cWe are at the same point again, about to reach a new audience. But we don\u2019t claim to have all the answers yet.\u201dAn article last Sunday about the design firm Ideo, which is helping Ford Motor Company in multimodal product design, misstated the year Model T\u2019s starting rolling off the assembly line. It was 1913 \u2014 not 1908, which was when the car was introduced but before Ford Motor started the integrated moving assembly line.Advertisement"}

Facebook isn\u2019t offering the full, open Internet. The company is offering a set of services that it thinks people should have, including free data access to Facebook. The assumption, by some, is that Facebook knows what is best, and that Indians should listen to and happily accept what the benevolent corporation has to offer.So, in essence, I have no idea what Facebook\u2019s recourse is from here, legally or strategically speaking. I\u2019m not even sure if the company knows. What do you think?

{"Headline": "Justice Department Calls Apple\u2019s Refusal to Unlock iPhone a \u2018Marketing Strategy\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department, frustrated by its inability to unlock the iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino killings, demanded on Friday that a judge immediately order Apple to give it the technical tools to get inside the phone.Apple\u2019s refusal \u201cappears to be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy\u201d rather than a legal rationale, prosecutors said in a court filing that further escalated the confrontation between the Obama administration and Apple.\u201cThis is not the end of privacy,\u201d the Justice Department declared, a mocking reference to Apple\u2019s rationale for contesting the court order prosecutors obtained from a judge directing Apple to help them break into the phone.The sharply worded, 25-page motion to compel Apple\u2019s cooperation seemed aimed as much at swaying public opinion as influencing the federal magistrate judge in Riverside, Calif., who issued the order to Apple.A blistering open letter this week from Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, had rallied many privacy advocates behind the company, and law enforcement officials said that the latest volley from the Justice Department on Friday was meant largely to rebut Mr. Cook\u2019s arguments and buttress the government\u2019s own case.Apple executives, speaking with reporters after the filing on the condition that they not be identified by name, said they were puzzled by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to rush back into court before the company even had a chance to respond to this week\u2019s court order.They reiterated their concerns that the government\u2019s novel demands would endanger the privacy and security of all of their iPhone customers in the future, and said they remained determined to fight the government\u2019s demands.Apple has until next week to respond to an order by a California magistrate this week compelling it to provide the technical assistance that the F.B.I. says it needs to get into the phone.But the Justice Department sought to pre-empt Apple\u2019s response with its own filing on Friday, saying Apple has already made its opposition publicly known and that the \u201curgency of this investigation\u201d demands faster action.\u201cRather than assist the effort to fully investigate a deadly terrorist attack by obeying this court\u2019s order,\u201d prosecutors wrote, \u201cApple has responded by publicly repudiating that order.\u201dThey went on to accuse Apple of exaggerating how difficult it would be for the company\u2019s computer engineers to come up with a way to get into the phone and to disable an \u201cauto-erase\u201d feature that permanently deletes the data inside after 10 failed password attempts.The Justice Department filed this motion on Friday asking a federal judge to immediately force Apple to help open an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers.\u201cAt no point has Apple ever said that it does not have the technical ability to comply with the order or that the order asks Apple to undertake an unreasonably challenging software development task,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cOn this point, Apple\u2019s silence speaks volumes.\u201dThe Justice Department wants to force Apple to write software that would allow the government to try millions of random password combinations to get into the phone.Apple has described this as an unprecedented demand, one that would require the company\u2019s engineers to build a new operating system from scratch and effectively hack into its own phone.The Justice Department said that was a significant overstatement. Prosecutors said the technology was no more difficult than passing a new software update to the phone \u2014 something the company does regularly.Apple executives acknowledged on Friday that it was technically possible but said it was still unwarranted for the government to demand it to create something that did not exist.In his 1,100-word letter to his customers early Wednesday, Mr. Cook said what prosecutors were demanding amounted to forcing Apple to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its own security protocols, and he vowed a fight. He accused the Justice Department of mounting a \u201cchilling\u201d attack on privacy and Internet security.Apple has taken a strong stand on privacy not only because of Mr. Cook\u2019s strong personal beliefs on the issue, but also because the company\u2019s business model encourages a bolder stance. Unlike other Silicon Valley tech giants, Apple\u2019s business has a straightforward hardware model that hinges on selling physical devices like iPhones, iPads and Macs. Other tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, depend more on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data for their digital advertising-oriented businesses.With this week\u2019s dispute generating wide attention on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to Apple and the F.B.I. on inviting their executives to testify publicly on the issue at a hearing.The lawmakers wrote in a joint letter that the public debate over encryption and its impact on law enforcement investigations \u201chas now come to a critical juncture\u201d with this week\u2019s order regarding the iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook in an attack in December that resulted in 14 deaths.The Justice Department\u2019s latest filing on Friday also offered new details about the unsuccessful negotiations between Apple and the government to resolve the encryption on their own before the dispute became public this week.Among other steps, the two sides discussed options that included using data backed up to the iCloud, other backup computers, separately held toll records or other databases to capture the information held in the cellphone. But for a variety of reasons, the F.B.I concluded, none of those options would work. Among other problems, the default system that backed up the phone on the iCloud had been disabled \u2014 apparently by Mr. Farook \u2014 in October, six weeks before the shootings.In its filing, the Justice Department suggested repeatedly that Apple has put its \u201cmarketing concerns\u201d above its corporate responsibility to comply with a lawful order to assist law enforcement.\u201cApple is not above the law in that regard,\u201d the filing said.Katie Benner contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueNew research reveals surprising truths about why some work groups thrive and others falter.Supported byWhen Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Study groups have become a rite of passage at M.B.A. programs, a way for students to practice working in teams and a reflection of the increasing demand for employees who can adroitly navigate group dynamics. A worker today might start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms. These shared experiences, Rozovsky hoped, would make it easy for them to work well together. But it didn\u2019t turn out that way. \u2018\u2018There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018It wasn\u2019t like that for me.\u2019\u2019Instead, Rozovsky\u2019s study group was a source of stress. \u2018\u2018I always felt like I had to prove myself,\u2019\u2019 she said. The team\u2019s dynamics could put her on edge. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another\u2019s ideas. There were conflicts over who was in charge and who got to represent the group in class. \u2018\u2018People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018I always felt like I had to be careful not to make mistakes around them.\u2019\u2019So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join. A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together teams for \u2018\u2018case competitions,\u2019\u2019 contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. The competitions were voluntary, but the work wasn\u2019t all that different from what Rozovsky did with her study group: conducting lots of research and financial analyses, writing reports and giving presentations. The members of her case-competition team had a variety of professional experiences: Army officer, researcher at a think tank, director of a health-education nonprofit organization and consultant to a refugee program. Despite their disparate backgrounds, however, everyone clicked. They emailed one another dumb jokes and usually spent the first 10 minutes of each meeting chatting. When it came time to brainstorm, \u2018\u2018we had lots of crazy ideas,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said.One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale\u2019s campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but \u2018\u2018we all felt like we could say anything to each other,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.\u2019\u2019 Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a micro\u00adgym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. They won the competition. (The micro\u00adgym \u2014 with two stationary bicycles and three treadmills \u2014 still exists.)Rozovsky\u2019s study group dissolved in her second semester (it was up to the students whether they wanted to continue). Her case team, however, stuck together for the two years she was at Yale.It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. Each was composed of people who were bright and outgoing. When she talked one on one with members of her study group, the exchanges were friendly and warm. It was only when they gathered as a team that things became fraught. By contrast, her case-competition team was always fun and easygoing. In some ways, the team\u2019s members got along better as a group than as individual friends.\u2018\u2018I couldn\u2019t figure out why things had turned out so different,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018It didn\u2019t seem like it had to happen that way.\u2019\u2019Five years ago, Google \u2014 one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity \u2014 became focused on building the perfect team. In the last decade, the tech giant has spent untold millions of dollars measuring nearly every aspect of its employees\u2019 lives. Google\u2019s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical; more shocking, this was news to many Google managers).The company\u2019s top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like \u2018\u2018It\u2019s better to put introverts together,\u2019\u2019 said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google\u2019s People Analytics division, or \u2018\u2018Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.\u2019\u2019 But, Dubey went on, \u2018\u2018it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true.\u2019\u2019In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative \u2014 code-named Project Aristotle \u2014 to study hundreds of Google\u2019s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared. Dubey, a leader of the project, gathered some of the company\u2019s best statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists and engineers. He also needed researchers. Rozovsky, by then, had decided that what she wanted to do with her life was study people\u2019s habits and tendencies. After graduating from Yale, she was hired by Google and was soon assigned to Project Aristotle.No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns \u2014 or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. \u2018\u2018We looked at 180 teams from all over the company,\u2019\u2019 Dubey said. \u2018\u2018We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The \u2018who\u2019 part of the equation didn\u2019t seem to matter.\u2019\u2019Some groups that were ranked among Google\u2019s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. \u2018\u2018At Google, we\u2019re good at finding patterns,\u2019\u2019 Dubey said. \u2018\u2018There weren\u2019t strong patterns here.\u2019\u2019As they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as \u2018\u2018group norms.\u2019\u2019 Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate; another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink. Norms can be unspoken or openly acknowledged, but their influence is often profound. Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals \u2014 they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently \u2014 but when they gather, the group\u2019s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.Project Aristotle\u2019s researchers began searching through the data they had collected, looking for norms. They looked for instances when team members described a particular behavior as an \u2018\u2018unwritten rule\u2019\u2019 or when they explained certain things as part of the \u2018\u2018team\u2019s culture.\u2019\u2019 Some groups said that teammates interrupted one another constantly and that team leaders reinforced that behavior by interrupting others themselves. On other teams, leaders enforced conversational order, and when someone cut off a teammate, group members would politely ask everyone to wait his or her turn. Some teams celebrated birthdays and began each meeting with informal chitchat about weekend plans. Other groups got right to business and discouraged gossip. There were teams that contained outsize personalities who hewed to their group\u2019s sedate norms, and others in which introverts came out of their shells as soon as meetings began.After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google\u2019s teams. But Rozovsky, now a lead researcher, needed to figure out which norms mattered most. Google\u2019s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. Was it better to let everyone speak as much as they wanted, or should strong leaders end meandering debates? Was it more effective for people to openly disagree with one another, or should conflicts be played down? The data didn\u2019t offer clear verdicts. In fact, the data sometimes pointed in opposite directions. The only thing worse than not finding a pattern is finding too many of them. Which norms, Rozovsky and her colleagues wondered, were the ones that successful teams shared?Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful. When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.Team B is different. It\u2019s evenly divided between successful executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments. Teammates jump in and out of discussions. People interject and complete one another\u2019s thoughts. When a team member abruptly changes the topic, the rest of the group follows him off the agenda. At the end of the meeting, the meeting doesn\u2019t actually end: Everyone sits around to gossip and talk about their lives.Which group would you rather join?To accomplish this, the researchers recruited 699 people, divided them into small groups and gave each a series of assignments that required different kinds of cooperation. One assignment, for instance, asked participants to brainstorm possible uses for a brick. Some teams came up with dozens of clever uses; others kept describing the same ideas in different words. Another had the groups plan a shopping trip and gave each teammate a different list of groceries. The only way to maximize the group\u2019s score was for each person to sacrifice an item they really wanted for something the team needed. Some groups easily divvied up the buying; others couldn\u2019t fill their shopping carts because no one was willing to compromise.What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group\u2019s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.But what was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. \u2018\u2018Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly,\u2019\u2019 said Anita Woolley, the study\u2019s lead author. \u2018\u2018Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone\u2019s relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role.\u2019\u2019As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as \u2018\u2018equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.\u2019\u2019 On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. \u2018\u2018As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well,\u2019\u2019 Woolley said. \u2018\u2018But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.\u2019\u2019Second, the good teams all had high \u2018\u2018average social sensitivity\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people\u2019s eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling \u2014 an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley\u2019s experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.In other words, if you are given a choice between the serious-minded Team A or the free-flowing Team B, you should probably opt for Team B. Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group\u2019s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid. There\u2019s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there\u2019s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.In contrast, on Team B, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another\u2019s moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.When Rozovsky and her Google colleagues encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. One engineer, for instance, had told researchers that his team leader was \u2018\u2018direct and straightforward, which creates a safe space for you to take risks.\u2019\u2019 That team, researchers estimated, was among Google\u2019s accomplished groups. By contrast, another engineer had told the researchers that his \u2018\u2018team leader has poor emotional control.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u2018\u2018He panics over small issues and keeps trying to grab control. I would hate to be driving with him being in the passenger seat, because he would keep trying to grab the steering wheel and crash the car.\u2019\u2019 That team, researchers presumed, did not perform well.Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. \u2018\u2018And that made a lot of sense to me, maybe because of my experiences at Yale,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d been on some teams that left me feeling totally exhausted and others where I got so much energy from the group.\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky\u2019s study group at Yale was draining because the norms \u2014 the fights over leadership, the tendency to critique \u2014 put her on guard. Whereas the norms of her case-competition team \u2014 enthusiasm for one another\u2019s ideas, joking around and having fun \u2014 allowed everyone to feel relaxed and energized.For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well \u2014 like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google\u2019s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.\u2018\u2018We had to get people to establish psychologically safe environments,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. But it wasn\u2019t clear how to do that. \u2018\u2018People here are really busy,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018We needed clear guidelines.\u2019\u2019However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement. You can tell people to take turns during a conversation and to listen to one another more. You can instruct employees to be sensitive to how their colleagues feel and to notice when someone seems upset. But the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.Rozovsky and her colleagues had figured out which norms were most critical. Now they had to find a way to make communication and empathy \u2014 the building blocks of forging real connections \u2014 into an algorithm they could easily scale.After Rozovsky gave one presentation, a trim, athletic man named Matt Sakaguchi approached the Project Aristotle researchers. Sakaguchi had an unusual background for a Google employee. Twenty years earlier, he was a member of a SWAT team in Walnut Creek, Calif., but left to become an electronics salesman and eventually landed at Google as a midlevel manager, where he has overseen teams of engineers who respond when the company\u2019s websites or servers go down.\u2018\u2018I might be the luckiest individual on earth,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi told me. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not really an engineer. I didn\u2019t study computers in college. Everyone who works for me is much smarter than I am.\u2019\u2019 But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result, Sakaguchi has thrived at Google. He and his wife, a teacher, have a home in San Francisco and a weekend house in the Sonoma Valley wine country. \u2018\u2018Most days, I feel like I\u2019ve won the lottery,\u2019\u2019 he said.Sakaguchi was particularly interested in Project Aristotle because the team he previously oversaw at Google hadn\u2019t jelled particularly well. \u2018\u2018There was one senior engineer who would just talk and talk, and everyone was scared to disagree with him,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi said. \u2018\u2018The hardest part was that everyone liked this guy outside the group setting, but whenever they got together as a team, something happened that made the culture go wrong.\u2019\u2019Sakaguchi had recently become the manager of a new team, and he wanted to make sure things went better this time. So he asked researchers at Project Aristotle if they could help. They provided him with a survey to gauge the group\u2019s norms.When Sakaguchi asked his new team to participate, he was greeted with skepticism. \u2018\u2018It seemed like a total waste of time,\u2019\u2019 said Sean Laurent, an engineer. \u2018\u2018But Matt was our new boss, and he was really into this questionnaire, and so we said, Sure, we\u2019ll do it, whatever.\u2019\u2019The team completed the survey, and a few weeks later, Sakaguchi received the results. He was surprised by what they revealed. He thought of the team as a strong unit. But the results indicated there were weaknesses: When asked to rate whether the role of the team was clearly understood and whether their work had impact, members of the team gave middling to poor scores. These responses troubled Sakaguchi, because he hadn\u2019t picked up on this discontent. He wanted everyone to feel fulfilled by their work. He asked the team to gather, off site, to discuss the survey\u2019s results. He began by asking everyone to share something personal about themselves. He went first.\u2018\u2018I think one of the things most people don\u2019t know about me,\u2019\u2019 he told the group, \u2018\u2018is that I have Stage 4 cancer.\u2019\u2019 In 2001, he said, a doctor discovered a tumor in his kidney. By the time the cancer was detected, it had spread to his spine. For nearly half a decade, it had grown slowly as he underwent treatment while working at Google. Recently, however, doctors had found a new, worrisome spot on a scan of his liver. That was far more serious, he explained.No one knew what to say. The team had been working with Sakaguchi for 10 months. They all liked him, just as they all liked one another. No one suspected that he was dealing with anything like this.\u2018\u2018To have Matt stand there and tell us that he\u2019s sick and he\u2019s not going to get better and, you know, what that means,\u2019\u2019 Laurent said. \u2018\u2018It was a really hard, really special moment.\u2019\u2019After Sakaguchi spoke, another teammate stood and described some health issues of her own. Then another discussed a difficult breakup. Eventually, the team shifted its focus to the survey. They found it easier to speak honestly about the things that had been bothering them, their small frictions and everyday annoyances. They agreed to adopt some new norms: From now on, Sakaguchi would make an extra effort to let the team members know how their work fit into Google\u2019s larger mission; they agreed to try harder to notice when someone on the team was feeling excluded or down.There was nothing in the survey that instructed Sakaguchi to share his illness with the group. There was nothing in Project Aristotle\u2019s research that said that getting people to open up about their struggles was critical to discussing a group\u2019s norms. But to Sakaguchi, it made sense that psychological safety and emotional conversations were related. The behaviors that create psychological safety \u2014 conversational turn-taking and empathy \u2014 are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.\u2018\u2018I think, until the off-site, I had separated things in my head into work life and life life,\u2019\u2019 Laurent told me. \u2018\u2018But the thing is, my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends I know through work. If I can\u2019t be open and honest at work, then I\u2019m not really living, am I?\u2019\u2019What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a \u2018\u2018work face\u2019\u2019 when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel \u2018\u2018psychologically safe,\u2019\u2019 we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can\u2019t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.Which isn\u2019t to say that a team needs an ailing manager to come together. Any group can become Team B. Sakaguchi\u2019s experiences underscore a core lesson of Google\u2019s research into teamwork: By adopting the data-driven approach of Silicon Valley, Project Aristotle has encouraged emotional conversations and discussions of norms among people who might otherwise be uncomfortable talking about how they feel. \u2018\u2018Googlers love data,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi told me. But it\u2019s not only Google that loves numbers, or Silicon Valley that shies away from emotional conversations. Most work\u00adplaces do. \u2018\u2018By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it makes them easier to talk about,\u2019\u2019 Sakaguchi told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number.\u2019\u2019Sakaguchi knows that the spread of his cancer means he may not have much time left. His wife has asked him why he doesn\u2019t quit Google. At some point, he probably will. But right now, helping his team succeed \u2018\u2018is the most meaningful work I\u2019ve ever done,\u2019\u2019 he told me. He encourages the group to think about the way work and life mesh. Part of that, he says, is recognizing how fulfilling work can be. Project Aristotle \u2018\u2018proves how much a great team matters,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Why would I walk away from that? Why wouldn\u2019t I spend time with people who care about me?\u2019\u2019The paradox, of course, is that Google\u2019s intense data collection and number crunching have led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.The fact that these insights aren\u2019t wholly original doesn\u2019t mean Google\u2019s contributions aren\u2019t valuable. In fact, in some ways, the \u2018\u2018employee performance optimization\u2019\u2019 movement has given us a method for talking about our insecurities, fears and aspirations in more constructive ways. It also has given us the tools to quickly teach lessons that once took managers decades to absorb. Google, in other words, in its race to build the perfect team, has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefulness of imperfection and done what Silicon Valley does best: figure out how to create psychological safety faster, better and in more productive ways.\u2018\u2018Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.\u2019\u2019Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it\u2019s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences \u2014 like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel \u2014 that can\u2019t really be optimized. Rozovsky herself was reminded of this midway through her work with the Project Aristotle team. \u2018\u2018We were in a meeting where I made a mistake,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky told me. She sent out a note afterward explaining how she was going to remedy the problem. \u2018\u2018I got an email back from a team member that said, \u2018Ouch,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 she recalled. \u2018\u2018It was like a punch to the gut. I was already upset about making this mistake, and this note totally played on my insecurities.\u2019\u2019If this had happened earlier in Rozovsky\u2019s life \u2014 if it had occurred while she was at Yale, for instance, in her study group \u2014 she probably wouldn\u2019t have known how to deal with those feelings. The email wasn\u2019t a big enough affront to justify a response. But all the same, it really bothered her. It was something she felt she needed to address.And thanks to Project Aristotle, she now had a vocabulary for explaining to herself what she was feeling and why it was important. She had graphs and charts telling her that she shouldn\u2019t just let it go. And so she typed a quick response: \u2018\u2018Nothing like a good \u2018Ouch!\u2019 to destroy psych safety in the morning.\u2019\u2019 Her teammate replied: \u2018\u2018Just testing your resilience.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018That could have been the wrong thing to say to someone else, but he knew it was exactly what I needed to hear,\u2019\u2019 Rozovsky said. \u2018\u2018With one 30-second interaction, we defused the tension.\u2019\u2019 She wanted to be listened to. She wanted her teammate to be sensitive to what she was feeling. \u2018\u2018And I had research telling me that it was O.K. to follow my gut,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018So that\u2019s what I did. The data helped me feel safe enough to do what I thought was right.\u2019\u2019Charles Duhigg is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times and the paper\u2019s senior editor of live journalism.

{"Headline": "Palau vs. the Poachers", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "FeatureThe island nation has mounted an aggressive response to illegal fishing in their waters. How they protect themselves may help the rest of the world save all of the oceans.Supported byCaught fishing in a marine sanctuary, the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 was fleeing to Indonesian waters, beyond Palau\u2019s jurisdiction. Once across the boundary, the crew could easily unload its catch at a local wharf and disappear among the thousands of small Filipino or Indonesian islands of the western Pacific. Determined not to let that happen, the Remeliik\u2019s skipper, running on Bergman\u2019s coordinates, was pushing 15 knots \u2014 a pace that worried its engineer. But the police were desperate to keep up. In the previous six months, they had spotted but failed to capture nearly a dozen other pirate fishing ships. If the Remeliik\u2019s officers miscalculated their heading by even a small fraction of a degree, they would miss their target.Bergman had been tracking the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 for weeks, and emailed an alert about possible illegal fishing two days earlier. Before moving to West Virginia to work for SkyTruth, he spent three years working as a marine ob\u00adserver on Alaskan fishing boats, logging the details of the daily catch, as required by federal and state fishery authorities. At SkyTruth, Bergman did his surveillance work from a far greater remove, monitoring ships by satellite. For months, he had been studying a satellite feed from above Palau. He knew its squiggles and slashes by memory. A passenger boat out of Pitcairn Island appeared every few weeks; a United States Navy ship from Diego Garcia conducted regular maneuvers; a Chinese research vessel was doing a survey of some sort in a grid pattern; a Taiwanese ship that never seemed to fish made repeated trips out to meet other long-line fishing vessels. The Shin Jyi Chyuu 33 stood out, however. Switching among registries of fishing permits, regional tuna licenses and blacklisted vessels, he could tell it had no license to fish in Palau\u2019s waters, even though its zigzag trajectory indicated it was doing just that.In response to Bergman\u2019s alert, an international team gathered into the cramped, second-floor police command center on Koror, Palau\u2019s most populous island. There were three local police officers, an adviser from the Pew Charitable Trusts and two Australian Navy officers, on loan to Palau to advise on everything from running the Remeliik (which the Australians had also donated) to using satellite-data analysis software. Working through the night and the following day, the team radioed the information they received from West Virginia to Allison Baiei, a Palauan marine police officer, aboard the Remeliik.Police efforts like these, coordinated and international in scope, are a rarity when it comes to enforcing the law at sea, but the alternative is usually no enforcement at all. More than two-thirds of the planet is covered by water, and much of that liquid expanse is ungoverned and potentially ungovernable. Criminal enterprise has flourished in the breach. The global black market for seafood is worth more than $20 billion, and approximately one in every five fish consumed globally is caught illegally.After a 51-hour push, much of it through heavy seas, the Remeliik\u2019s unrelenting pace finally paid off: It caught up with the Taiwanese ship just a few miles before the boundary with Indonesian waters. The officers escorted the ship back to port in Palau, and when they inspected the hold, Baiei told me, they found an especially grim haul. Inside, among the stacks of tuna, were hundreds of severed shark fins. The officers piled the contraband onto the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33\u2019s deck and, when they ran out of room there, piled the rest into a bloody heap on the dock. They counted, measured and photographed the fins to use for the eventual prosecution, then dumped them into the sea. \u2018\u2018Disgusting,\u2019\u2019 was all Baiei would say about the scene.In the face of this challenge, Palau has mounted an aggressive response. In 2006, it was among the first nations to ban bottom trawling \u2014 a practice not unlike strip mining in which fishing boats drag large weighted nets across the ocean floor to catch the fish in the waters just above, killing virtually everything else in their path. In 2009, it prohibited commercial shark fishing in its waters, creating the world\u2019s first shark sanctuary. In 2015, it announced plans to require observers aboard all its tuna longliners. (Elsewhere in the region, observers are aboard just one in 50 tuna longliners.) Palau has also teamed up with Greenpeace, which helped patrol its territorial waters, and it started a campaign on Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform, raising more than $50,000 to support its conservation work. Palau\u2019s most radical move, though, was creating a \u2018\u2018no take\u2019\u2019 reserve in 2015. Within this zone, which encompasses 193,000 square miles, all export fishing (along with any drilling or mining) will be strictly prohibited.From one perspective, Palau\u2019s work suggests a hopeful future. It offers a model for successful ad hoc collaboration among countries, companies and nongovernmental organizations. Palau has also emerged as a testing ground for some of the technology \u2014 including drones, satellite monitoring and military-grade radar \u2014 that might finally empower countries to spot and arrest the pirates, poachers, polluters, traffickers and other scofflaws who prowl the seas with impunity.But Palau\u2019s conservation efforts are really motivated by a more immediate sense of self-preservation. In September, I sat down with Palau\u2019s president, Tommy Remengesau Jr., in his cluttered, wood-paneled office in Koror. A sturdy man with an intense stare, Remengesau explained to me that more than half of Palau\u2019s gross domestic product comes from tourism, mostly people visiting to dive on Palau\u2019s reefs, which house more fish, coral and other invertebrates per square mile than virtually anywhere else on Earth. Remengesau boiled the problem down to simple economics, noting that sharks were an especially big draw for undersea sightseers. Alive, an individual shark is worth more than $170,000 annually in tourism dollars, he said, or nearly $2 million over its lifetime. Dead, each can go for a hundred dollars \u2014 and usually, he added, that money winds up in the pockets of a foreign poacher.The poachers calculate differently, of course. More than a dozen countries, including Palau and Taiwan, have banned shark-finning. But demand for the fins, especially in Asia, remains high. Shark-fin soup, which can cost more than $100 a bowl, has for centuries signified wealth and status, and it became especially popular in the late 1980s as a status item for China\u2019s rapidly expanding middle and upper classes. Ship captains often allow their crew members to supplement their income by keeping the fins for themselves to sell at port. Shark carcasses take up valuable hold space in smaller ships, and as they decompose, they produce ammonia that contaminates the other catch. Deckhands usually cut off the fins, which can sell for 100 times the cost of the rest of the meat. They then throw the rest of the shark back into the water. It\u2019s a slow death: The sharks sink to the sea floor, where they starve, drown or are eaten by other fish.In a given year, Palau faces 50 to 100 incursions by pirate vessels. Fish ignore borders \u2014 and, it turns out, so do many of the people pursuing them. While port inspections, wheel-room cameras, locational transponders and onboard observers are essential to better monitoring the oceans, policing is the only thing that will make Palau\u2019s new reserve, and others like it elsewhere in the world, more than just lines drawn on the water.The oceans belong to everyone and no one, and the general perception is that they are too big to need protection. We also tend to think of fish as an ever-regenerating crop, there forever for our taking. But roughly 90 percent of the world\u2019s ocean stocks are depleted or overexploited; one study predicts that by 2050, the sea could contain more plastic waste than fish. Though most governments have neither the inclination nor the resources to patrol the oceans, Palau is trying a different approach, and whether it succeeds or fails may have consequences for the entire planet.The plan was to patrol the waters near Kayangel, an atoll in the country\u2019s far north, an area popular for sea-cucumber and coral-fish poachers. A tiny, rugged fleck of land, roughly half a square mile, Kayangel has perhaps 60 year-round residents; there is no airstrip, and power and cell service are erratic. Local fishermen had spotted poachers near the atoll, and our patrol was meant to show a police presence in the area.For any given patrol, the chief of the marine police weighs a list of variables \u2014 credible threat, distance to target, available crew, sufficient fuel, weather \u2014 and decides if it\u2019s worth dispatching the Remeliik. Today, we would head out instead on one of the department\u2019s two much smaller fiberglass boats, which they use in shallow waters closer to shore. When we pulled out of port, the sea was glass-flat, but as the land behind us fell beneath the horizon, we began rolling in 10-foot swells \u2014 it was clear why this smaller boat was ill-suited to chasing poachers into deeper water.Baiei said the turning point for Palau, the moment when the nation realized that it needed help, was March 29, 2012. The other officers shook their heads at the mere mention of the date. The agonizing story began earlier that month, when two Chinese poacher boats were spotted near the atoll for several days in a row. They kept escaping: Each was equipped with three 60-horsepower outboard motors, while the local wildlife rangers had only a Zodiac with one outboard motor.Around 7 a.m. on March 29, the Palauan rangers saw one of the Chinese boats again. This time they got close enough to try to shoot out its engines, Baiei said. They hit an engine, but they also hit a Chinese deckhand, Lu Yong. (Palauan rangers say they were not aiming for him; the bullets ricocheted off the engines.) The rangers called for help to rush Lu, 35, to a nearby island where a nurse lived, but he bled to death before they got there. He had a 9-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter in mainland China. But the day would only get more tragic from there.Boarding the Chinese boat and interrogating the rest of the crew, the Palauan rangers soon learned that there was a larger \u2018\u2018mother ship\u2019\u2019 farther at sea, orchestrating the poaching raids. This was too far for the small Zodiac to travel, so two Palauan policemen, Willie Mays Towai and Earlee Decherong, along with an American pilot, Frank Ohlinger, were dispatched in a rented single-engine Cessna to find the ship and call in its coordinates.As night fell, the pilot got lost, and the plane vanished. Meanwhile, about 35 miles from shore, another team, aboard the Remeliik, finally discovered the 80-foot mother ship, which immediately bolted, ignoring several warning shots fired across its bow. After several hours of running, though, the mother ship drifted to a halt. It was soon engulfed in flames, most likely from an intentional fire set to hide any evidence of poaching. The pirate crew scrambled into a lifeboat just before the ship sank, and they were arrested shortly thereafter.The Cessna pilot and the two policemen were still lost, wandering somewhere above the Pacific. The authorities on land came up with an idea: If they could illuminate the islands brightly enough, the pilot might see them and find his way back home. The public safety director ordered all emergency vehicles to drive to the highest points in Koror and turn on their flashing lights. \u2018\u2018Aim spotlights upward,\u2019\u2019 yachters were instructed. The stadium lights at Palau\u2019s Asahi baseball field were switched on. Residents were asked to turn on all household lights. Some stood in the streets waving flashlights. Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, who happened to be vacationing in Palau, provided the two helicopters on his 414-foot mega-yacht, the Octopus, for search and rescue. Allen\u2019s crew was instructed to fire 49 flares, one per minute, into the air. An official in Angaur, an island on the nation\u2019s southern tip, suggested setting some of the outer-atoll wooded areas on fire \u2014 a plan that was quickly dismissed.Back at the command center on Koror, several police officers were trying in vain to contact the plane. Its radio was malfunctioning. They could hear Ohlinger, but he could not hear them. For nearly five hours, culminating in a mayday call at 8:16 p.m., they listened to his growing panic, his rage at the plane\u2019s broken GPS unit and compass and, ultimately, his request that someone alert his next of kin. \u2018\u2018On a good glide slope, heading north,\u2019\u2019 Ohlinger said, as he explained that he and his two passengers planned to crash-land into the sea. \u2018\u2018We are at 6,000 feet, doing 65 knots, out of fuel,\u2019\u2019 were his last words. The wreckage was never found.The major innovation, the one that in the 1930s helped transform fishing from hunting to something more akin to industrial mining, was the giant-scale purse seiner \u2014 a ship that surrounds an entire school of fish with a curtain of netting, sometimes nearly a mile around, then cinches it like a laundry bag. But more innovations followed. World War II gave incentive to the creation of lighter, faster, more durable ships that could travel farther on less fuel. Submarine combat drove improvements in sonar, which turned the ocean top into a glass table, making visible the unseen fathoms below. Subzero onboard freezers freed fishermen from their race against melting refrigerator ice. Innovations in plastics and monofilaments lengthened fishing lines from feet to miles. Lightweight polymer-based nets enabled supertrawlers to rake the ocean even more brutally.But, as the Palauans and their allies are discovering, technology can also be deployed for conservation. Just as authorities can use tracking devices and satellite data to monitor the activities of people on land, they are increasingly able to do so at sea. Since the 1990s, ships have deployed the Automatic Identification System, or A.I.S., a once-voluntary collision-avoidance system whereby onboard VHF transmitters convey their position, identity and speed continuously to other ships and to satellites. In 2002, the United Nations\u2019 maritime organization mandated A.I.S. for nearly all passenger ships regardless of size, and commercial ships, fishing vessels included, with a gross tonnage of more than 300 (typically, that\u2019s a 130-foot long vessel) in international waters.A.I.S. has its shortcomings. Captains are allowed to turn the transponders off when they perceive a credible danger of being tracked by pirates \u2014 a gaping loophole for poachers. The system can be hacked to give false locations. Many of the ships involved in the worst crimes, like the Shin Jyi Chyuu 33, are smaller than 300 tonnes and thus exempt from the system entirely. Partly as a response to the deficiencies of A.I.S., many countries now also require fishing vessels to carry an additional device called a vessel-monitoring system, or V.M.S. Typically, this takes the form of a cone-shaped antenna on the roof of the wheelhouse, wired to a locked transceiver and the ship\u2019s control panel, that transmits their location and other data to local fishery authorities at all times.More sea-traffic data may become available soon as countries consider deploying devices in the water \u2014 sonar and camera buoys, as well as low-cost floating hydrophones \u2014 to catch ships approaching restricted areas. Even storm clouds, which long concealed many crimes at sea, no longer pose as much of an obstacle. Satellites armed with syn\u00adthetic-aperture radar can detect a vessel\u2019s position regardless of weather conditions. All this data becomes especially useful when coupled with sophisticated software whose algorithms can trigger alerts \u2014 if, for instance, a vessel goes \u2018\u2018dark\u2019\u2019 by turning off its transponder, if it zigzags in certain formations that indicate that it\u2019s fishing or if it enters a forbidden area. Now, instead of blindly patrolling broad swaths of ocean, the police can target their efforts.Still, the most reliable form of ocean law enforcement continues to be real-time direct surveillance, which is neither easy nor cheap. Generating close-in imagery from the sky depends predominantly on military-grade drones. Ordering up high-resolution photographs from space is still extremely costly, sometimes more than $3,500 per picture, and the company or government that operates the satellite often requires the request for the image to be made days in advance, so operators can aim the lens at the right location on its next trip hurtling around the Earth. Palau experimented with smaller, commercially available drones in 2013, in a project funded by an Australian mining magnate, Andrew Forrest. But the drones proved to be too expensive and hard to fly, and the cameras mounted on the drones gave too tightly circumscribed a view of the waters below.The eventual dream is to create systems that pull all the antipoaching intelligence together in real time, giving the police and their helpers a God\u2019s-eye view of their adversaries. In 2014, SkyTruth joined with Google and the nonprofit group Oceana to build Global Fishing Watch, a website that will allow an army of would-be Bjorn Bergmans to track A.I.S. data on roughly 80,000 vessels worldwide. Last year, Pew teamed up with a British company called Satellite Applications Catapult to create a virtual \u2018\u2018watch room\u2019\u2019 program that, drawing on live satellite tracking data, displays a map of the world traversed by lighted dots, each one a fishing vessel. Even as the vastness of the oceans makes it easy for poachers to escape, technology is also making it harder for them to hide.Many valuable fish species \u2014 including tuna, blue marlin and mahi-mahi \u2014 huddle near floating objects for protection and mating. FADs take advantage of this instinct, attracting fish in spectacularly dense schools that fishermen quickly scoop up. \u2018\u2018Drifting\u2019\u2019 FADs are unanchored: Fishermen track them by following the currents. \u2018\u2018Moored\u2019\u2019 FADs are tethered to the ocean floor, typically with concrete blocks. Increasingly, fishing companies are deploying \u2018\u2018smart\u2019\u2019 FADs equipped with sonar and GPS, enabling operators to sit back and wait for an alert when it\u2019s time to retrieve their haul.The global popularity of FADs is, at least in part, an unintended consequence of the movement to save dolphins. Commercial fishing fleets once found tuna by looking for dolphins, which follow tuna schools and swim near the surface above them. In the 1980s and 1990s, the push for \u2018\u2018dolphin free\u2019\u2019 tuna drove many of these fishermen from the Eastern Tropical Pacific, near Baja, to the Central and Western Pacific Ocean, near Palau, where the dolphins typically don\u2019t follow tuna. In making this move, many of these ships turned to FADs as their new tactic \u2014 even though the devices are widely criticized for further industrializing the harvest of fast-disappearing species like sharks, sea turtles and tuna.On one patrol with Baiei, we stopped at a FAD so that I could dive in for a closer look. Bathwater-warm, the ocean was translucent turquoise, the current as strong as a river. The FAD was low-tech and anchored, just a plastic buoy attached to a thick, mollusk-coated rope tethered to the ocean floor more than 500 feet below. Large bamboo leaves ran down the first 50 feet of the rope, flapping like fuzzy moth wings. Hundreds of tiny silver fish darted under the shade of the leaves. Not one fish was more than a foot long.We visited three more FADs during the patrol that day, traversing more than 100 miles. All were barren. The fish, Baiei explained, were all being taken before they could even come to the reserve. Tuna, like many large ocean fish, are migratory. Even if their natural path might take them to the safety of Palau\u2019s asylum, they can be picked off beforehand in any number of ways \u2014 including by being netted at one of the more than 50,000 floating FADs in the Western and Central Pacific, most of which are perfectly legal.In recent years, a handful of countries have tried to slow the ocean plunder. They have limited trawling, put caps on FAD numbers and imposed rules to limit \u2018\u2018bycatch,\u2019\u2019 the unwanted species caught in the hunt for prized fish. Perhaps the most promising tactic has been to create more no-take reserves like Palau\u2019s. In 2014, the Obama administration added 400,000 square miles of similarly protected territory to United States waters. In 2015, the British government announced its intent to establish the world\u2019s largest continuous marine reserve (322,000 square miles) around the Pitcairn Islands. But these reserves work only if they are well policed. Otherwise, they become magnets for poachers who see them as robust and competition-free zones. And, as we saw at our own little FAD, even a well-policed reserve is not enough to protect the fish who freely swim outside their safe zones. Presently such reserves cover around 2 percent of the world\u2019s seas, but many oceanographers say we need to cover at least 10 percent to make a substantial difference.As the sun set, one marine officer said he wanted to check a final FAD near an islet called Orak, this time in hopes of landing a few fish for dinner. After dragging their longline in circles around it for an hour, they gave up, empty-handed. Docking instead at a nearby island, the officers bought some chicken stew from the local market.I wanted a better view, but as I started to climb onto an upper deck, one of the Indonesian crewmen lunged forward and grabbed my wrist. My hand was inches away from touching an electrified steel cable that the fishermen use to stun catch that flop wildly when first pulled on deck. The crewman pointed to a six-inch black burn mark on a shipmate\u2019s arm, warning me of what the cable could do.As the officers questioned the ship\u2019s captain, I wandered to the back of the ship. A ladder down a hatch led to a four-foot high tunnel, where crawling on hands and knees was the only option. Running the length of the vessel, the tunnel was lined with a dozen six-foot-long cubbies, each with wadded-up clothing at one end serving as pillows. The trip from Taiwan to these waters (about 1,400 miles) takes a little over a week. In high seas and heavy weather, staying on deck is out of the question. The farther I crawled, the darker and muggier it got and the heavier the flow of fumes, heat and noise. A rat scurried ahead. A rancid-smelling liquid dripped from above. The captain later told me that this was runoff from the upper-deck cutting tables.At the deepest end of the tunnel, I came to the ship\u2019s huge diesel engine, churning furiously. I sat in that tight space for a couple of minutes to take in the scene. It dawned on me that the passageway I had just descended was not just the men\u2019s sleeping quarters. It was also the engine\u2019s main exhaust pipe.Back on the Remeliik, I passed the time reading a confidential investigation report about the 2012 Cessna incident, which had been leaked to me by a Palauan official. It in\u00ad\u00adcluded transcripts of interviews with the 25 fishermen from the illegal Chinese boats, who had been arrested and held in the Koror jail for 17 days. Most of the men had never been to sea before, nor did they know the name of their ship, the fishing company or even their captain. Most had handed their identity cards over to the fishing company, which had hired them only several months earlier. Many claimed that they fled that day because they thought the Palauans, who were not in uniform, were planning to rob them. \u2018\u2018He claims that he does not know about any fishing permits,\u2019\u2019 a police investigator said of one deckhand. \u2018\u2018They only follow what the captain tells them.\u2019\u2019The crew members pleaded guilty and were fined $1,000 each. Their small fast boat was destroyed, their gear confiscated. They were then flown home, with their slain colleague, Yong Lu, in a coffin, on a charter flight sent by the Chinese government. One line in the investigation report struck me. It said that in several days of poaching, the Chinese crew caught fewer than a dozen fish, primarily lapu lapu, and several large clams, most of which they later threw overboard as they fled the authorities. It seemed a tragically small yield.In the wheel room of the Remeliik that night, the officers did a post mortem about the day\u2019s boarding, and the discussion turned to the crews that work on these poacher ships. \u2018\u2018Aren\u2019t they the enemy?\u2019\u2019 I asked. Several officers shook their heads to say no. Once the authorities take the foreign crews to shore, there is no guarantee that Palau will have the translators to communicate with them, jail space to hold them or even the laws to effectively prosecute them. Many of the poachers they arrest are from family-owned businesses and are unable to pay the $500,000 fine Palau has the option to levy. The government can seize the ship, but the cost to feed, house and repatriate the crew is often more than its resale value.Near the end of our patrol, Baiei asked me if I had ever seen a diver with the bends. I said I hadn\u2019t. He explained that many of the poachers they chase are Vietnamese, young divers who target sea cucumbers, which live on the ocean floor and look like giant, leather-skinned slugs. The Vietnamese crewmen hold rubber hoses in their mouths attached to an onboard air compressor, strap lead weights around their waists, then dive, often deeper than a hundred feet. During an arrest last year, Baiei said, one of these divers shot to the surface too quickly, causing excruciating bubbles to form in his joints and elsewhere. They took him to a hospital to recover. \u2018\u2018He just kept moaning for days,\u2019\u2019 Baiei said.One of the other officers, who had been listening to the conversation quietly, looked up from his inspection logs. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re the real bycatch,\u2019\u2019 he said. For Palau\u2019s police, the catch \u2014 the far more elusive target \u2014 was the fishing companies who send these desperate men to sea to flout the law. But in a sense, even those bosses are bycatch, too, in a worldwide fishing economy where sanctioned corporations, far more than poachers, are stripping the oceans of life. To save Palau\u2019s fish, and the world\u2019s, the law and its enforcers need to bring an entire industrial system to heel: a mission that requires a level of international cooperation and political will that has yet to materialize.An article on Feb. 21 about the efforts taken by Palau to stop illegal fishing in its waters referred incorrectly to the percentage of illegally caught fish that is consumed. One in every five fish consumed globally \u2014 not in the United States \u2014 is caught illegally.Ian Urbina is an investigative reporter who has been on the staff at The New York Times since 2003.Advertisement"}

Snowden in 2013 that the government both cozied up to certain tech companies and hacked into others to gain access to private data on an enormous scale, tech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor.But if the confrontation has crystallized in this latest battle, it may already be heading toward a predictable conclusion: In the long run, the tech companies are destined to emerge victorious.There will probably be months of legal tussling, and it is not at all clear which side will prevail in court, nor in the battle for public opinion and legislative favor.Yet underlying all of this is a simple dynamic: Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies hold most of the cards in this confrontation. They have our data, and their businesses depend on the global public\u2019s collective belief that they will do everything they can to protect that data.Any crack in that front could be fatal for tech companies that must operate worldwide. If Apple is forced to open up an iPhone for an American law enforcement investigation, what\u2019s to prevent it from doing so for a request from the Chinese or the Iranians? If Apple is forced to write code that lets the F.B.I. get into the iPhone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?Apple\u2019s stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption to limit access to people\u2019s data. More than that, Apple \u2014 and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft \u2014 have made their opposition to the government\u2019s claims a point of corporate pride.Apple and other tech companies hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. Note that Apple\u2019s public opposition to the government\u2019s request is itself a hindrance to mass government intrusion. And to get at the contents of a single iPhone, the government says it needs a court order and Apple\u2019s help to write new code; in earlier versions of the iPhone, ones that were created before Apple found religion on privacy, the F.B.I. may have been able to break into the device by itself.You can expect that noose to continue to tighten. Experts said that whether or not Apple loses this specific case, measures that it could put into place in the future will almost certainly be able to further limit the government\u2019s reach.That\u2019s not to say that the outcome of the San Bernardino case is insignificant. As Apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the F.B.I. access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.Once armed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively, before a suspected terrorist attack \u2014 leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare.\u201cThis is a brand new salvo in the war against encryption,\u201d Mr. Opsahl said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run around that \u2014 here they come with an order to create that backdoor.\u201dOne relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the F.B.I. wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone \u2014 a user would have to consent to it.\u201cNothing is 100 percent hacker-proof,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge\u2019s order in this case required Apple to provide \u201creasonable security assistance\u201d to unlock Mr. Farook\u2019s phone. If Apple alters the security model of future iPhones so that even its own engineers\u2019 \u201creasonable assistance\u201d will not be able to crack a given device when compelled by the government, a precedent set in this case might lose its lasting force.In other words, even if the F.B.I. wins this case, in the long run, it loses.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes\u00ad.com; Twitter:@fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Meet Is Murder", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueThey\u2019re boring. They\u2019re useless. Everyone hates them. So why can\u2019t we stop having meetings?Supported bySpecifically, he wanted to talk about meetings as thieves: of joy, of productivity, of mental freedom. Citing a distinction first made by Paul Graham, the prominent venture capitalist, Costache told the room that some people thrive on meetings. These he called Managers, people who require a weekly calendar splotched to saturation with hourly changes of venue and cohort. But there are Makers, too \u2014 poetic souls whose well-being can be shattered by an ill-timed \u2018\u2018sync,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018brand lab\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018share-out\u2019\u2019 in a conference room. Makers can\u2019t live like Managers. They require \u2018\u2018Maker hours\u2019\u2019 \u2014 long, unspoiled afternoons to muse, contemplate the verities, build digital things and play stress-relieving games of Carcassonne. They need rich, solitary, germinative time. In Graham\u2019s formula, Makers flourish in four-hour stretches, which absolutely must \u2014 on pain of inhibiting a company\u2019s growth \u2014 be kept unblemished by meetings.To illustrate Graham\u2019s idea of \u2018\u2018Manager\u2019s schedule,\u2019\u2019 Costache put a riotously mosaicked Google Calendar week on the monitor. Then, as he described the needs of Makers, he summoned to his screen a stunning new Google Calendar week, awash in puffy clouds of white space. It looked like heaven.The room was enthusiastic. Maker hours blend childhood summer-day vagueness with a thick coat of artistic entitlement. But by the time the team dispersed, we\u2019d faced facts: We were Managers or Managers\u2019 minions, most of us, ineligible for stretches of solitude, destined for lives of video conferences and call-in codes. And indeed, only the product, design and engineering teams at Spring \u2014 today\u2019s nobility \u2014 were now slated to enjoy one full day a week of Maker time. The Maker\u2019s schedule was the privilege of the elite builders of code and apps, and the scope of makable things was not going to include casseroles, movies and corn-husk dolls anytime soon. We were to return to days chopped, like hot dogs for toddlers, into meetings.\u2018\u2018Meetings\u2019\u2019: The very word is enervating. With the freedom to peaceably assemble so high up on America\u2019s founding priority list, you\u2019d think that the workers of the free world would gather with more patriotic vigor, just as we speak, bear arms and pursue trials by jury. Instead, the spirit in which we come together, almost hourly in some professions, is something closer to despondency. Fifteen percent of an organization\u2019s time is spent in meetings, and every day, the transcontinental conference room known as the white-collar United States plays host to 11 million meetings, according to research collated by Fuze, the telecommunications company (which might have a stake in publicizing research designed to stoke meeting fatigue). One study mysteriously calculates that the nation wastes more than $37 billion in \u2018\u2018unproductive meetings.\u2019\u2019 The statistics seemed borne out by the several meeting-besotted companies I\u2019ve advised, and I began to wonder if the Manager\u2019s schedule suited anyone but tireless extroverts and PowerPoint connoisseurs.And yet we persist. Meetings must be scratching some kind of itch, if only for fellowship and a reprieve from deskbound loneliness. And what an itch: Meetings are not just considered indispensable to many professions; they are almost coextensive with them. You can make a whole career of planning, holding and attending meetings and never dare contemplate the possibility of your being exempt. They can\u2019t be avoided, but maybe they can be made bearable. I set out to see if anyone had a bright idea.I asked Graham, by email, if he still believed in the split between Managers and Makers that he outlined seven years ago. \u2018\u2018Of course I stand behind it,\u2019\u2019 he wrote back, in brisk, English-accented prose. \u2018\u2018I wrote that essay.\u2019\u2019 Graham then described his ideal meeting, conjuring a congenial fantasy. \u2018\u2018There are no more than four or five participants, and they know and trust one another. They go rapidly through a list of open questions while doing something else, like eating lunch. There are no presentations. No one is trying to impress anyone. They are all eager to leave and get back to work.\u2019\u2019Graham\u2019s minimalist approach to meetings stands in stark contrast to the one taken by Brian Robertson, the author of the notorious management method known as Holacracy, which convenes intense, expressive meetings that encourage every manner of human interaction except maybe professional ones. Robertson, who calls himself a \u2018\u2018recovering C.E.O.,\u2019\u2019 created \u2018\u2018the Holacracy Constitution\u2019\u2019 in 2009, just as skepticism about corporate structures, like the ones at the failed big banks, had turned to fever.The Holacratic system is grounded in small cells of people called Circles. Each Circle holds a weekly or biweekly \u2018\u2018tactical meeting\u2019\u2019 for progress updates and a biweekly or monthly \u2018\u2018governance meeting.\u2019\u2019 A governance meeting starts with a Check-In, or rather (according to Holacracy literature) \u2018\u2018a space for every participant to call out any distraction and get present for the meeting.\u2019\u2019 Everyone speaks, round-robin style.Now presumably present, people \u2018\u2018triage any administrative and logistical issues,\u2019\u2019 or yell out arbitrary personal concerns. Holacracy gives this example: \u2018\u2018Joe needs to leave early.\u2019\u2019 (Abstractions are common in meeting-reform discourse, so Joe\u2019s scheduling constraints are a usefully concrete example of the actual content of modern meetings.)Next, anyone can propose a Tension, which is anything that concerns her. Participants are then free to ask Clarifying Questions, but these in no way can cross into Reactions (because they\u2019re next). A Facilitator has the unenviable job of policing the fine line between pure-hearted questions and bloviation disguised as interrogatives.At last everyone in a Holacratic meeting can yammer freely, without a referee, on their sundry reactions. \u2018\u2018Any type of reaction is welcome, from intellectual critiques to emotional outbursts.\u2019\u2019 Then comes an Amend and Clarify round, and, lest any clarification stand unmuddied for even a heartbeat, a rousing Objection round follows hard upon it. An Integration round comes next, and yet another Objection round, to address any new objections to the Clarification of the Tension and the Reactions to it that have surfaced during the Integration. Finally comes the Closing round, during which each and every person present is invited to share a closing reflection about how to improve the next meeting. After this, there is, explicitly, \u2018\u2018no discussion.\u2019\u2019 Presumably, those with still more to say should be tested for Adderall poisoning.Paul Graham\u2019s idea of tracking workers into separate spheres (vocational and liberal arts?) would seem the precise opposite of Holacracy, which purports to raze hierarchies. But in giving the right of way to special employees \u2014 either those who assert themselves as Makers, or those who feel entitled to florid self-expression in the workplace \u2014 the two approaches have something in common. Both favor artistic and even capricious temperaments. These artist-first systems end up building a new form of social stratification that is every bit as forbidding as the old one.As Butterfield told me through a company representative, \u2018\u2018Slack allows teams to have both asynchronous and synchronous communication across physical locations, allowing more time for thoughtful communication than a typical meeting scenario.\u2019\u2019 With \u2018\u2018asynchronous and synchronous,\u2019\u2019 Butterfield tacitly aimed to correct the widespread impression that Slack replaces email (asynchronous communication) rather than meetings (which are synchronous \u2014 participants respond to one another in real time). The full archiving of meetings on Slack, which requires a fee for some companies, also means that everyone (even Joe, leaving early) can bear witness to a meeting, as questions and decisions are recorded for all to see. Slack\u2019s tagline is \u2018\u2018Be less busy.\u2019\u2019With the firm support of Slack, Under Armour, the athletic apparel company, has opted to turn to the software for meetings, abolishing virtu\u00adally all in-person gatherings. This appeals to Vijay Raghunathan, vice president for engineering at Under Armour, who says that for companies with small offices and spread-out work forces, Slack is a godsend, an elastic virtual room. At the same time, when team members go too far astray into gags or wordplay during a meeting, they\u2019re directed to recreational channels. Sending people to other channels when they go off-topic is called \u2018\u2018raccooning,\u2019\u2019 and being raccooned is like being sent to supremely cool detention: Dedicated channels exist for puns, parenting, puppies and dozens more special interests.So, I asked, what do we do about meetings? Just ban them?Costache thought for a minute. He aspires to turn Spring, with his partners David and Alan Tisch, into a billion-dollar business \u2014 and then return to Romania as a \u2018\u2018benevolent dictator.\u2019\u2019 You can see him pulling it off.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m not that radical,\u2019\u2019 he said, at last. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s too much value to an in-person meeting. When my engineering team has to decide what they want to build in the next two weeks, this is hard to do without meetings. Say it\u2019s me and three other senior engineers discussing an architectural choice about our Python code base. We start to discuss what that looked like, and give one person feedback. .\u2009.\u2009. \u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s so much volume of information \u2014 it\u2019s like a river of information. If it\u2019s a valuable meeting, we all pour this information. Someone\u2019s distraction, another person\u2019s incomprehension. I have this image of a giant pipe, so much richness. It couldn\u2019t go on Slack.\u2019\u2019Meetings sounded like luxury goods in Costache\u2019s telling. Arid conference rooms started to fade from memory, as I pictured the Hudson, the Ganges.Aiming for Costache\u2019s idiom, I asked: Is it like high-bandwidth information versus a file that\u2019s compressed and thinned out?\u2018\u2018No. You\u2019re trying to be digital. I\u2019m going the other way. The rivers. The trickle of water. I like analog analogies. Maybe Slack is like Morse code versus in-person meetings, which are like written words. They say much more.\u2019\u2019Such consequential meetings were nonetheless the preoccupation of Henry Martyn Robert. Robert, the original meeting hacker, was prompted to renovate meetings in the 1860s, when a discussion of abolitionist politics at a Baptist church in New Bedford, Mass., devolved into chaos. Robert, an Army engineer, was supposed to be in charge. In his private, handwritten business blog, Robert wrote: \u2018\u2018One can scarcely have had much experience in deliberative meetings of Christians without realizing that the best of men, having wills of their own, are liable to attempt to carry out their own views without paying sufficient respect to the rights of their opponents.\u2019\u2019Determined to rule with more authority, Robert researched and wrote the \u2018\u2018Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies,\u2019\u2019 loosely based on the practices of the United States House of Representatives. A speaker takes the Floor; an all-powerful Chairman or Chairwoman recognizes him or her; Motions are made, and then denied or sustained; Resolutions are voted on, or tabled. Hierarchies don\u2019t just creep back in, as in Holacracy. Instead, they\u2019re explicitly enforced. The 11th edition of Robert\u2019s Rules of Order, as it\u2019s now called, appeared in 2011.A meeting run by Robert\u2019s Rules can be a joy to behold \u2014 though it\u2019s clotted by as much jargon as a Holacratic meeting. That Robert\u2019s Rules crystallized in wartime may explain their frank hostility to the chaos of human emotions \u2014 the very emotions that, at tech companies, enjoy full flower. Each participant in Robert\u2019s Rules becomes a binary element: a switch, only ever on or off, pro or con. All the minds in the room, having accepted their role as machine code, come together to approximate an algorithmic organism. No Makers, no rock stars, no special snowflakes of any kind are allowed creative expression, any more than they\u2019d be allowed creativity on an election ballot. Robert\u2019s Rules \u2014 still in use in volunteer firehouses, City Councils, school boards and elsewhere \u2014 win strong partisans for the way participants fall in line, don\u2019t filibuster and work single-mindedly and democratically toward a common goal.Order is a noble aspiration, but I still wanted permission to be alone. I went back to Paul Graham\u2019s email, still seeking a guru who, under any pretext at all, would abolish from the workweek all but friendly gatherings and urgent meetings (to be run by Robert\u2019s Rules) in favor of long, fertile hours of solitude. Though it seemed unlikely that I\u2019d be one of the lucky few who could test out of Manager time, I was just trying to merit a spare four hours to make some brownies. \u2018\u2018For the purposes of the essay,\u2019\u2019 Graham had clarified, \u2018\u2018Makers are people who need big chunks of time to do their work, and Managers are everyone else.\u2019\u2019Of course, liberation from \u2018\u2018connection\u2019\u2019 is a fantasy that predates Wi-Fi. What\u2019s so bad about meetings, after all? At bottom, they are nothing but time with your fellows. Which suggests that hating meetings might be akin to hating traffic, families or parties \u2014 just another way to express our deep ambivalence about that hard fact of existence: other people.Virginia Heffernan is a frequent contributor to the magazine.

{"Headline": "5G Is a New Frontier for Mobile Carriers and Tech Companies", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byGUILDFORD, England \u2014 On the outskirts of this sleepy commuter town just south of London, plans are underway to build the fastest cellphone network in the world.The work is being done at the University of Surrey, where a leafy campus is dotted with rundown Brutalist-style buildings. Here, researchers and some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies, including Samsung and Fujitsu, are collaborating to offer mobile Internet speeds more than 100 times faster than anything now available.\u201cEveryone is rushing to demonstrate they are a leading player for 5G,\u201d said Bengt Nordstrom, co-founder of Northstream, a telecom consulting firm, in Stockholm.\u201cIf we miss the chance to make our networks relevant, it will be a disaster,\u201d said Ulf Ewaldsson, Ericsson\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThe billion-dollar question is what will a 5G network look like?\u201dDespite companies\u2019 efforts to outspend each other, that question remains unanswered.A global standard for 5G wireless technology will not be finished before 2019, at the earliest. Companies worldwide must agree on how their networks talk to each other, so users\u2019 mobile connections do not become patchy when traveling overseas. That involves lengthy negotiations over what type of radio waves the new technology should use, among other complicated global agreements, which can take years.As a result, carriers, telecom equipment makers and tech companies are lobbying global-standard bodies and national lawmakers to promote their own technologies over rivals\u2019, according to industry executives and telecom analysts. Because of this jockeying, a widespread rollout of 5G networks is not expected until well into the next decade.\u201cA lot of this is about carriers and equipment makers looking for new ways to make money,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research in Paris. \u201cConsumers shouldn\u2019t expect great things until after 2020.\u201dThese challenges have not stopped companies from staking a claim in hopes of being at the forefront of 5G.That is particularly true ahead of major global sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup, at which carriers and national governments want to promote their technological know-how. At the 2018 World Cup, which will be held in Russia, for instance, the local operators MegaFon and MTS are expected to test 5G-style services, including ultrafast mobile Internet, even without global standards in place.The Korean mobile operator KT also plans to offer its own version of 5G technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and NTT DoCoMo has said it will have similar trials ready for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.United States carriers have also jumped on the 5G bandwagon, partly to offer people new services as current mobile speeds have become relatively interchangeable between major operators nationwide.For Dr. Tafazolli, of the University of Surrey, whose team started working on 5G in late 2011, these battles have led to an increasing number of companies offering support \u2014 including the use of high-speed computer servers, costly radio antennas and millions of dollars of financing to research and build the next-generation wireless network on his college campus, he said. Their primary goal: to test their latest technology in a real-world setting.\u201cIn the race to 5G, everyone wants to be first,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Blind Hiring the Best Hiring?", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueMost companies say they want to attract a diverse workforce, but few deliver. The only solution may be a radical one: anonymity.Supported byGapJumpers was already working from the insight that, like musicians, coders created something that could easily be evaluated by their peers. But Iyer realized from the study that employers didn\u2019t need to see prospective employees\u2019 faces, or even learn their names. Eventually, they would have to meet, but by keeping the process blind for as long as possible, Iyer figured he could help reduce bias. And, besides, he was already working with the best tool for masking identity in the history of humankind: software.Google likes to hire people who possess something it calls Googleyness, an amorphous measure of how well they will fit in. It\u2019s not easily defined, but it includes things like enjoying fun and \u2014 appropriately \u2014 coping well with ambiguity. This emphasis on \u2018\u2018culture fit\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t unique to Google; it seems to have spread across industries as work hours have lengthened and eaten into our leisure time, and as offices, especially in the valley, have further blurred the distinction between work and leisure. What a candidate might be like in a conference room at 10 a.m. has become almost as important as what he\u2019d be like playing Ping-Pong after a few beers from the office kegerator.\u2018\u2018The pipeline argument can be wiped out with basic statistics,\u2019\u2019 Beasley says. \u2018\u2018The number of people graduating from top schools is just enormous, so you have to think, What could these companies do wrong to not get them?\u2019\u2019One answer is that companies rely too much on flawed human judgment when they recruit. Despite the digitization of job listings, human-resources departments have not changed much from the analog days. And, according to decades of research on the topic, humans just aren\u2019t that good at hiring. A study of top banking, law and consulting firms found that similarities in things like leisure activities and personality were the most important factor in their evaluation of candidates. Hiring now resembles choosing a romantic partner more than an employee, says Lauren Rivera, an associate professor of management and sociology at Northwestern and the author of the study.To try to combat these biases, Iyer and his co-founder Petar Vujosevic devised a way to screen job applicants without showing employers any biographical information. GapJumpers and its client create a list of skills required for the job, then design a relevant test that the applicant completes online. The first piece of information the hiring company sees is applicants\u2019 scores, and, based on those, it selects candidates to interview. Only then does it see their names and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.GapJumpers has conducted more than 1,400 auditions for companies like Bloomberg and Dolby Laboratories. According to the company\u2019s numbers, using conventional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screening, about a fifth of applicants who were not white, male, able-bodied people from elite schools made it to a first-round interview. Using blind auditions, 60 percent did. \u2018\u2018Employers say, \u2018If you can show me your skills in this role, I am willing to interview you, regardless of where you come from, what you look like or who you are,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Iyer says. A new study from Harvard Business School backs up this line of reasoning. It found that when service-sector employers used a job test, they hired workers who tended to stay at the job longer \u2014 indicating that they were a better match. When employers overruled the test results to hire someone for more subjective reasons, the employees were significantly more likely to quit or be fired.GapJumpers is just one of a handful of Silicon Valley start-ups peddling technological fixes for hiring practices. Gild, for example, has proprietary software that finds candidates based on code they have published online and strips out biographical information before recommending them to employers. Textio, a start-up with clients that include Starbucks and Microsoft, scans job listings and highlights language that data have shown to turn off certain candidates. For example, saying a job requires a \u2018\u2018rock star\u2019\u2019 will draw more men than women; saying it requires a \u2018\u2018passion for learning\u2019\u2019 attracts more women than men. Textio\u2019s research has found that while most people dislike corporate jargon \u2014 \u2018\u2018synergy,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018push the envelope\u2019\u2019 and so on \u2014 applicants who are not white dislike it even more and are less likely to respond to job listings that use that sort of language.At Google, interviewers now use standardized questions, mostly abandoning the brainteasers, according to Laszlo Bock, its head of people operations \u2014 the Google term for H.R. They stopped asking for SAT scores, a practice that research has shown underestimates the college performance of women and minority students. They have tried to build diversity into the definition of \u2018\u2018Googleyness,\u2019\u2019 like whether someone has taken an interesting life path or solves problems in a different way. Google says it is hiring more black and Latino employees these days, but this increase has yet to affect its diversity numbers.Silicon Valley is in many ways an odd place to be at the forefront of the solution to the problem of corporate homogeneity. Its work force is strikingly uniform: The diversity numbers from Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Yahoo and other companies look no better than Google\u2019s. But it\u2019s also one of the few industries in which even the biggest companies are young and nimble enough to quickly change the way they do business, and one that desperately needs more qualified workers.Workplace practices that start in Silicon Valley often spread to other industries \u2014 like open office arrangements, and yoga classes. Despite its reputation today, the tech industry could one day become a model for other industries. If so, the American workplace could soon look less like the people who are doing the hiring and more like the people graduating with the skills to join it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New Dream Jobs", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "The Work IssueWhat a survey of millennials might tell us about the workplaces of the future.Supported byHowever scattershot, the survey offers a glimpse into the ambitions of the millennial generation, which already makes up more than a third of the work force. By 2020, it will make up half. Survey after survey shows that millennials want to work for companies that place a premium on employee welfare, offer flexible scheduling and, above all, bestow a sense of purpose. These priorities are well known and frequently mocked, providing grist for the oft-repeated claim that millennials are lazy, entitled job-hoppers.But it\u2019s important to remember that this generation was shaped by a recession, an unprecedented crush of student debt and a broad decline in the credibility of all kinds of institutions. Stability is an abstract concept to these young workers, so they instead tend to focus on creating a rich, textured life now, rather than planning for a future obscured by uncertainty. How these desires map onto companies like Google and Facebook is clear, given their strong roots in philanthropy and innovation. But the high ranking of national-security employers also speaks, just as clearly, to millennials\u2019 hope to make a difference in the world.Companies that want to attract the best young workers are already finding that they need to accommodate these wishes. The question is whether, when millennials are running things, they will abandon these priorities as youthful indiscretions \u2014 or establish them as the norm.

{"Headline": "Social Media: Destroyer or Creator?", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOver the last few years we\u2019ve been treated to a number of \u201cFacebook revolutions,\u201d from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to the squares of Istanbul, Kiev and Hong Kong, all fueled by social media. But once the smoke cleared, most of these revolutions failed to build any sustainable new political order, in part because as so many voices got amplified, consensus-building became impossible.Question: Does it turn out that social media is better at breaking things than at making things?Recently, an important voice answered this question with a big \u201c yes.\u201d That voice was Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian Google employee whose anonymous Facebook page helped to launch the Tahrir Square revolution in early 2011 that toppled President Hosni Mubarak \u2014 but then failed to give birth to a true democratic alternative.In the early 2000s, Arabs were flocking to the web, Ghonim explained: \u201cThirsty for knowledge, for opportunities, for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe, we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual, alternative life.\u201dAnd then in June 2010, he noted, the \u201cInternet changed my life forever. While browsing Facebook, I saw a photo \u2026 of a tortured, dead body of a young Egyptian guy. His name was Khaled Said. Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police. I saw myself in his picture. \u2026 I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it \u2018We Are All Khaled Said.\u2019 In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people, fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern.\u201dSoon Ghonim and his friends used Facebook to crowd-source ideas, and \u201cthe page became the most followed page in the Arab world. \u2026 Social media was crucial for this campaign. It helped a decentralized movement arise. It made people realize that they were not alone. And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it.\u201dGhonim was eventually tracked down in Cairo by Egyptian security services, beaten and then held incommunicado for 11 days. But three days after he was freed, the millions of protesters his Facebook posts helped to galvanize brought down Mubarak\u2019s regime.Alas, the euphoria soon faded, said Ghonim, because \u201cwe failed to build consensus, and the political struggle led to intense polarization.\u201d Social media, he noted, \u201conly amplified\u201d the polarization \u201cby facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors, echo chambers and hate speech. The environment was purely toxic. My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.\u201dSupporters of the army and the Islamists used social media to smear each other, while the democratic center, which Ghonim and so many others occupied, was marginalized. Their revolution was stolen by the Muslim Brotherhood and, when it failed, by the army, which then arrested many of the secular youths who first powered the revolution. The army has its own Facebook page to defend itself.\u201cIt was a moment of defeat,\u201d said Ghonim. \u201cI stayed silent for more than two years, and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened.\u201dHere is what he concluded about social media today: \u201cFirst, we don\u2019t know how to deal with rumors. Rumors that confirm people\u2019s biases are now believed and spread among millions of people.\u201d Second, \u201cWe tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else. Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs. \u2026 It\u2019s as if we forget that the people behind screens are actually real people and not just avatars.\u201cAnd fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions. Because of the speed and brevity of social media, we are forced to jump to conclusions and write sharp opinions in 140 characters about complex world affairs. And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet.\u201dFifth, and most crucial, he said, \u201ctoday, our social media experiences are designed in a way that favors broadcasting over engagements, posts over discussions, shallow comments over deep conversations. \u2026 It\u2019s as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other.\u201d\u201cFive years ago,\u201d concluded Ghonim, \u201cI said, \u2018If you want to liberate society, all you need is the Internet.\u2019 Today I believe if we want to liberate society, we first need to liberate the Internet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Joins Race to Speed Up Mobile Delivery of News Articles", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When you conduct a Google search on your smartphone for a newsy topic \u2014 say, \u201cDonald Trump\u201d \u2014 the results starting on Wednesday will include a horizontal carousel of news articles, each with a little lightning bolt icon and the letters AMP at the bottom. Click on any one of the articles, and it will come up immediately, with no wait.The sluggishness is due in part to how websites tend to be built \u2014 old and new technologies are often mixed together on a page.But it is also because publishers have filled their pages with more and more widgets that deliver advertising and collect data on their users as media companies try to find ways to make money in a world where ad revenue is quickly shrinking.Google\u2019s approach, called AMP, or Accelerated Mobile Pages, strips out much of that invisible bloat while preserving the look of the web page and most of the ads.Both Internet companies see fast-loading, high-quality content as important to keeping people searching the web and scrolling through their social news feeds.\u201cWe have said for a long time, speed matters,\u201d said Richard Gingras, who heads news products at Google. \u201cThere is very powerful common cause between Google and publishers. It\u2019s crucial to have a healthy, open web.\u201dFor publishers, which are dependent on Google and Facebook for much of their traffic, working with the companies could hold the key to their future customers. Major media companies, including The Atlantic, The Washington Post, Vox Media, BuzzFeed, The Guardian and The New York Times, are participating in both projects as they try to figure out how best to increase traffic and find new loyal readers, while also bringing in revenue from the new formats.\u201cWe want to be where our readers are,\u201d said Kimberly Lau, vice president and general manager of The Atlantic\u2019s digital properties.But Facebook has not shared enough information about the Instant Articles viewership for her to have determined if it was worth giving up the extra ads that are forbidden with Instant Articles.\u201cThe assumption is that the better user experience will deliver more for us. But the jury is still out,\u201d she said.Ms. Lau and other publishing executives have high hopes for Google\u2019s approach, which is more open than Facebook\u2019s and allows for more types of ads and more data collection about users.Google worked for months with content publishers, advertising companies and other partners to develop a new open standard for creating mobile web pages that use as little as one-tenth the data of traditional pages and load up to four times faster.From the start, preserving the ads while speeding them up was a priority. That meant bringing in advertising technology companies and pushing them to improve their load times.Outbrain, which offers an ad product used by many news sites that refers readers to articles by other publications, was blocked by Instant Articles, but the company jumped at the chance to retool its technology so it would work with AMP.\u201cGoogle has definitely done a good job of skinnying up the page,\u201d said Matt Crenshaw, Outbrain\u2019s vice president for product marketing.Publishers have generally praised Google\u2019s open approach, and many said the company was responsive to their particular concerns.The Times, for example, relies heavily on digital subscriptions, with close to 1.1 million digital-only subscribers, and has a corporate goal of doubling its digital revenue by 2020. Google worked closely with The Times to track how many articles visitors were viewing and to prompt them to subscribe when they hit their monthly limit of free articles.\u201cThe way that the meter works is really similar to our current mobile experience,\u201d said Kate Harris, The Times\u2019s director of product who oversees mobile platforms and heads the AMP project. \u201cIt\u2019s truly been a company-to-company collaboration. They flew in a bunch of engineers last week, and we were in a room for many hours,\u201d working on final details.Facebook has been working on a subscription option for months, but still has not offered a solution to publishers that rely on that model.Will Cathcart, the Facebook vice president for product management who oversees Instant Articles, said that hundreds of publishers were participating in the project.\u201cWe\u2019ve been really pleased with how it\u2019s going,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing consumers read more, and they are more likely to share articles they read with their friends.\u201dHe said Facebook was working with publishers to solve specific problems like subscriptions and to share more data while also protecting the privacy of its users.Melissa Bell, vice president of growth and analytics at Vox Media, which is using Instant Articles and AMP, said Vox is overhauling the mobile performance of all its sites, which include Vox.com, SB Nation and Curbed.Interactive graphics, for example, can weigh down a page. \u201cWould it be better to have three graphics that are side by side?\u201d Ms. Bell said. \u201cYou have to think about this with every story you create.\u201dJulia Beizer, director of product at The Washington Post, said that her publication was an eager participant in all of the experiments, including the nascent News app from Apple, which highlights articles from various publishers on the company\u2019s iPhones and iPads.She said Apple News had sent The Post an unexpected surge of new readers to its science, health and food articles. She credits Instant Articles with sending The Post more repeat visitors. And AMP has cut the time it takes to load a Post mobile web page from three seconds or four seconds to just over half a second.Not all of The Post\u2019s ads transfer properly to the other platforms, she said, and each project takes up valuable time and resources. But right now, publishers need to try it all.\u201cOur interest in going so aggressively at these platforms is learning as much as we can,\u201d Ms. Beizer said. \u201cAnd we have something to offer those companies as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Narrow Focus May Aid F.B.I. in Apple Case", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byInstead, the F.B.I. took the industry by surprise and cleverly stopped short of expectations. The bureau asked Apple for something very specific: that it create an alternative operating system for just one phone that would help the government break into the device. The limited nature of the request has helped the government portray this case as a one-time demand, without ramifications beyond the case at hand.While the F.B.I. is pursuing a narrow focus, Apple is arguing its side as broadly as possible.The company has repeatedly said this case is about much more than the iPhone of one of the attackers from a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., which killed 14. The company has framed the government\u2019s request as a larger discussion of privacy and civil liberties, and a slippery slope that could open the way to similar demands in the future.The differing approaches are set to be the core of each side\u2019s arguments as Apple and the United States government dig in for an extended period of legal wrangling. Both are betting that their narrow-versus-broad lines of reasoning will help them win both in court and in the court of public opinion.For now, while civil liberties groups and many tech companies say they side with Apple, the government may have carved out an advantage by proffering its narrow argument.\u201cBy making its request so targeted, Apple has fewer grounds to argue their side than had the government asked it to permanently change its code,\u201d said Jason Healey, a former White House security policy director and a research scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks that Mr. Cook had made.The greatest fear among many privacy and computer security advocates was that the government would try to force Apple to give up the security keys it uses to digitally sign its code, keys that would let government programmers disable Apple\u2019s security.Instead, the F.B.I. understood that Apple can cleanly install new software on broken phones, without replacing them, and asked the company to make a similar tool that would let investigators break into a work phone issued to Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.The bureau has taken pains to note that it did not ask Apple to break the password, and that this solution would not work on newer phones.On Sunday, Mr. Comey\u2019s statement to defend why the agency needed to break into the iPhone said that the court order \u201cisn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind of message. It is about the victims and justice.\u201dF.B.I. technical specialists have been working with companies to figure out how to extract data from phones for years.A government official said on Monday that investigators quickly realized that in the San Bernardino case, a technical solution was available. \u201cThis was just the logical extension to what we were already doing,\u201d one senior government official said.\u201cI think Apple was hoping that the request that came was more outrageous,\u201d said Dan Guido, the founder of the security firm Trail of Bits. \u201cThe F.B.I. was very adroit. They waited for the perfect situation where they had all these factors aligned so the request looks pretty straightforward.\u201dTo that point, the New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., criticized Apple after it refused to comply with the court order and said that they currently possessed 175 iPhones that they could not unlock.Charlie Rose recently interviewed Mr. Vance and asked if he would want access to all phones that were part of a criminal proceeding should the government prevail in the San Bernardino case.Mr. Vance responded: \u201cAbsolutely right.\u201dEven people who oppose the Justice Department\u2019s request concede the government made a smart first move, one that could establish precedent to justify more invasive tactics.\u201cThey\u2019ll come up with a reason why for every single phone,\u201d said Chris Finan, a former White House security adviser who, while in government, said he opposed this tactic. But as a strategic matter, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s tactically brilliant.\u201dSome citizens and politicians have attacked Apple\u2019s decision, like the families of the San Bernardino victims, Tom Ridge, the former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Senators Richard Burr, Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins.To gird for the fight, Apple has hired Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. and Theodore B. Olson, partners at Gibson Dunn, as outside counsel. Both men have a long history of pushing the courts and the public to see the bigger picture on heated issues including gay marriage.But privately, there is talk among these companies that Apple may have overplayed its hand by taking the issue public in an all-out defiant assault against the F.B.I., according to two people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. These people fear the public may eventually sympathize with the F.B.I.\u2019s argument, especially considering the heinous nature of the crimes.Apple proposed in its statement that federal prosecutors de-escalate the situation by withdrawing their demands, and \u201cas some in Congress have proposed, form a commission or other panel of experts on intelligence, technology and civil liberties to discuss the implications for law enforcement, national security, privacy and personal freedoms.\u201dAn article on Tuesday about the government\u2019s strategy in seeking to force Apple to help it open a terrorist\u2019s iPhone misspelled the surname of one of Apple\u2019s outside lawyers. He is Theodore B. Olson, not Olsen.Katie Benner reported from San Francisco and Matt Apuzzo from Washington. Mike Isaac contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Group Bids $1.2 Billion for Company Behind Opera Web Browser", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 A group of Chinese investors sees $1.2 billion worth of potential in the world\u2019s sixth-place Internet browser.The group, which includes a Chinese private equity firm and two upstart Chinese technology companies, said on Wednesday that it had offered to acquire the Norwegian company behind the Opera web browser. The deal would give the buyers a name that has faded amid intense competition from Google\u2019s Chrome and other browsers but still has a following in the developing world.Opera, a Norwegian browser developed in the 1990s, gained prominence a decade ago with a browser designed specifically for mobile phones that used compression technology to speed download times. But others have caught up, and Opera \u2014 with a 5.5 percent market share \u2014 is now the sixth most-used browser behind Chrome, Apple\u2019s Safari, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer, Firefox and Alibaba\u2019s UCWeb, according to the Internet metrics firm StatCounter.Still, Opera has pockets of strength in some fast-growing Internet markets. It is the top browser in Africa, according to StatCounter, and it is the third most popular in Russia and India and the fourth in Indonesia.Opera Software, the browser\u2019s parent company, said in August last year that it was undertaking a strategic review. It has reported annual losses over the past two years, and its growth prospects have disappointed investors. Even after takeover rumors drove up its shares in recent days, they are still down about one-quarter from a year ago.The group has offered 71 Norwegian kroner, or $8.31, a share, a premium of about 56 percent, based on the average share price over the past 30 days.Opera said that the agreement would give Opera access to Kunlun and Qihoo\u2019s Internet users in China, as well as funding. Kunlun and Qihoo will also be able to sell their products to Opera users and use its mobile advertising platform.Qihoo runs its own mobile browser, which it could combine with Opera\u2019s, and it also could benefit from the company\u2019s advertising network. Kunlun, which makes and licenses games, could use Opera\u2019s apps as a way to broaden the distribution of those games.Opera\u2019s board has unanimously decided to recommend that shareholders accept the offer.The deal is still conditional on Kunlun\u2019s getting approval at its general meeting in March to participate in the consortium.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Technologies Give Government Ample Means to Track Suspects, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For more than two years the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies have warned that encrypted communications are creating a \u201cgoing dark\u201d crisis that will keep them from tracking terrorists and kidnappers.Now, a study in which current and former intelligence officials participated concludes that the warning is wildly overblown, and that a raft of new technologies \u2014 like television sets with microphones and web-connected cars \u2014 are creating ample opportunities for the government to track suspects, many of them worrying.\u201c\u00a0\u2018Going dark\u2019 does not aptly describe the long-term landscape for government surveillance,\u201d concludes the study, to be published Monday by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.The study argues that the phrase ignores the flood of new technologies \u201cbeing packed with sensors and wireless connectivity\u201d that are expected to become the subject of court orders and subpoenas, and are already the target of the National Security Agency as it places \u201cimplants\u201d into networks around the world to monitor communications abroad.The products, ranging from \u201ctoasters to bedsheets, light bulbs, cameras, toothbrushes, door locks, cars, watches and other wearables,\u201d will give the government increasing opportunities to track suspects and in many cases reconstruct communications and meetings.Over the past year, they have repeatedly told Congress that the move by Apple to automatically encrypt data on its iPhone, and similar steps by Google and Microsoft, are choking off critical abilities to track suspects, even with a court order.President Obama, however, concluded last fall that any effort to legislate a government \u201cback door\u201d into encrypted communications would probably create a pathway for hackers \u2014 including those working for foreign governments like Russia, China and Iran \u2014 to gain access as well, and create a precedent for authoritarian governments demanding similar access.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has led the charge on the other side. He recently told a group of White House officials seeking technology companies\u2019 voluntary help to counter the Islamic State that the government\u2019s efforts to get the keys to encrypted communications would be a boon for hackers and put legitimate business transactions, financial data and personal communications at greater risk.The Harvard study, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, was unusual because it involved technical experts, civil libertarians and officials who are, or have been, on the forefront of counterterrorism. Larry Kramer, the former dean of Stanford Law School, who heads the foundation, noted Friday that until now \u201cthe policy debate has been impeded by gaps in trust \u2014 chasms, really \u2014 between academia, civil society, the private sector and the intelligence community\u201d that have impeded the evolution of a \u201csafe, open and resilient Internet.\u201dAmong the chief authors of the report is Matthew G. Olsen, who was a director of the National Counterterrorism Center under Mr. Obama and a general counsel of the National Security Agency.Two current senior officials of the N.S.A. \u2014 John DeLong, the head of the agency\u2019s Commercial Solutions Center, and Anne Neuberger, the agency\u2019s chief risk officer \u2014 are described in the report as \u201ccore members\u201d of the group, but did not sign the report because they could not act on behalf of the agency or the United States government in endorsing its conclusions, government officials said.\u201cEncryption is a real problem, and the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies are right to raise it,\u201d Mr. Olsen said Sunday. But he noted that in their testimony officials had not described the other technological breaks that are falling their way, nor had they highlighted cases in which they were able to exploit mistakes made by suspects in applying encryption to their messages.He noted that in the current stalemate there was little discussion of the \u201cever-expanding \u2018Internet of things,\u2019 where telemetry from teakettles, televisions and light bulbs might prove surprisingly, and worryingly, amenable to subpoena from governments around the world.\u201dThose technologies are already being exploited: The government frequently seeks location data from devices like cellphones and EZ Passes to track suspects.The study notes that such opportunities are expanding rapidly. A Samsung \u201csmart\u201d television contains a microphone meant to relay back to Samsung voice instructions to the TV \u2014 \u201cI want to see the last three \u2018Star Wars\u2019 movies\u201d \u2014 and a Hello, Barbie brought out by Mattel last year records children\u2019s conversations with the doll, processes them over the Internet and sends back a response.The history of technology shows that what is invented for convenience can soon become a target of surveillance. \u201cLaw enforcement or intelligence agencies may start to seek orders compelling Samsung, Google, Mattel, Nest or vendors of other networked devices to push an update or flip a digital switch to intercept the ambient communications of a target,\u201d the report said.These communications, too, may one day be encrypted. But Google\u2019s business model depends on picking out key words from emails to tailor advertisements for specific users of Gmail, the popular email service. Apple users routinely back up the contents of their phones to iCloud \u2014 a service that is not encrypted and now is almost a routine target for investigators or intelligence agencies. So are the tracking and mapping systems for cars that rely on transmitted global positioning data.\u201cI think what this report shows is that the world today is like living in a big field that is more illuminated than ever before,\u201d said Joseph Nye, a Harvard government professor and former head of the National Intelligence Council. \u201cThere will be dark spots \u2014 there always will be. But it\u2019s easy to forget that there is far more data available to governments now than ever before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Why are they controversial in any respect, let alone an overblown controversy? Touchdowns are fun \u2014 players should celebrate!Here is a shocking insider revelation: It doesn\u2019t matter who wins N.F.L. games. The point of the contests is entertainment, plus shared civic spirit. Players, fans, everybody who likes the scoring team should get up and do a little dance when a touchdown is recorded.Football\u2019s puritanical opposition to the touchdown celebration seems rooted in the illusion that it actually matters who wins the game, thus the contest should be conducted in a somber manner. Sports can be a learning experience for athletes, but for audiences, the games are strictly entertainment. Should Cam Newton score a touchdown in the Super Bowl, here\u2019s hoping he dances up a storm.Teams that run a fumble back for a touchdown in the Super Bowl are 2-2. But so far in every case, a Super Bowl team that takes an interception to the house stands in confetti and lugs home a trophy.So if the Broncos or the Panthers return an interception for a touchdown Sunday, confidently turn to your friends and declare that team will win. This statement comes with the Tuesday Morning Quarterback guarantee: All Predictions Wrong or Your Money Back.See my Super Bowl preview and prediction below. And last week I promised to reveal an incredible formula that allows anyone to predict N.F.L. outcomes without even knowing who\u2019s playing. It\u2019s below, too.T.M.Q. feels that to wear the mantle of \u201cmost valuable,\u201d a player must create a lot of value. Thus my award is restricted to those who reach that Super Bowl thing you might have heard about. Runners-up:Winner:\u25a0 The Tuesday Morning Quarterback Non-Quarterback Non-Running Back N.F.L. M.V.P. is Von Miller of Denver. For the 2015 season, he was the defender who kept offensive coordinators up at night. An injury prevented Miller from dressing for Denver\u2019s Super Bowl loss to Seattle. If he makes up for that missed opportunity, Carolina could have problems.It\u2019s not just that Peyton Manning is 1-2 as a Super Bowl starter, and that his 13-13 postseason record enfolds the most playoff losses of any N.F.L. quarterback. It\u2019s not just that little brother Eli is 2-0 in the Super Bowl \u2014 surely, at the Manning family Thanksgiving table, Eli gets to speak first. How many more Super Bowls can Peyton realistically expect to reach? Should he end the day a 1-3 loser in the Super Bowl and a 13-14 loser in the postseason, there will be a large asterisk on his career.And it\u2019s not just that the Broncos were blown off the field in the Super Bowl two years ago. It\u2019s not just that Denver has laid more Super Bowl eggs than any other N.F.L. team, losing by 55-10, 43-8, 42-10 and 39-20. It\u2019s that Denver, 2-5 in the ultimate contest, has the most Super Bowl defeats. Should the Broncos pull up short again Sunday, they will have blown the Super Bowl twice in three years, while falling to 2-6 in the finale game.The Super Bowl pressure differential seems to reflect in the faces of the quarterbacks. Cam Newton is exuberant, joyful; he\u2019s not just a fabulous athlete but a fabulous entertainer, projecting happiness to the crowd. Manning is dour, seeming to wince more often than he smiles. Manning has endured so many bummer postseason postgame news conferences that he must dread the next one. Often, he wears the expression of a child who just broke something valuable but hasn\u2019t told the grown-ups yet.When Newton does scramble, his Greek-god physique comes into play. Newton is 6-foot-5, 248 pounds, once the size of an offensive tackle. He\u2019s about as big or bigger than all four linebackers who will try to contain him: 6-4, 258-pound DeMarcus Ware; 6-3, 250-pound Von Miller; 6-1, 250-pound Brandon Marshall; and 6-1, 237-pound Danny Trevathan.Newton has the most size-strength edge over defenders since Bears quarterback Bobby Douglass, who in 1972 rushed for 968 yards in a 14-game season. Douglass played at 6-4, 225 pounds at a time when that was a typical linebacker size. Newton is Douglass plus speed and passing ability.Some quarterbacks who are effective runners are speed merchants, such as Michael Vick. Some use lightning reflexes: Randall Cunningham and Tyrod Taylor. Some understand how to \u201cleverage\u201d defenders in the race to get out of bounds before being hit: Russell Wilson and Steve Young. A few are big and strong, such as Douglass. Newton has all these qualities, plus throws reasonably well, and has finally learned to \u201csee the field.\u201d He could become football\u2019s Michael Jordan.Measuring athletes down to hundredths of seconds might be realistic in track or swimming; is it realistic in the pocket? Leading up to the A.F.C. title contest, ESPN\u2019s \u201cSportsCenter\u201d said Tom Brady releases the ball in an average of \u201c2.13 seconds,\u201d while Fox Sports said \u201c2.17 seconds\u201d per Brady throw, and Comcast SportsNet said \u201c1.94 seconds.\u201d The lowest is one-fifth of a second different from the highest. This is setting aside whether any of the numbers are accurate to the claimed hundredths of seconds.IMDb considers the Navy secretary an actor because he has appeared as himself in the Taylor Kitsch-Rihanna sci-fi flick \u201cBattleship,\u201d and on the TNT apocalyptic series \u201cThe Last Ship.\u201d In the former, super-advanced space aliens invading the Earth are stopped by a mothballed World War II battlewagon crewed by Kitsch, Rihanna and some geezers; in the latter, a bioengineered virus kills most of humanity as the United States Navy\u2019s sole remaining active ship tries to locate the cure. Perhaps Mabus thinks lending the U.S.N. imprimatur to such big-budget nonsense is good for recruiting. Or maybe he\u2019s trying get his Actors Equity card.Phillips bonus #1: He has held the title \u201cinterim head coach\u201d in New Orleans, Atlanta and Houston, and was fired from all three interim positions. Phillips bonus #2: Sixteen years ago, Buffalo fired Phillips despite a 29-19 record and two playoff appearances in his three seasons. The Bills have not had a winning-record coach, nor reached the postseason, since.John Frainetti of Calgary, Alberta, suggested, \u201cLove means never having to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d Dilan Esper of Los Angeles proposed, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\u201d Many readers, including Geaux Meaux of Oklahoma City, suggested, \u201cYou can\u2019t have your cake and eat it, too.\u201dAt any rate, what happened afterward? The sports world, including commentators on the league\u2019s house channel, NFL Network, castigated Belichick for going for it. Because he\u2019s the league\u2019s most secure head coach, Belichick ignores sportsyak. But most N.F.L. coaches are ever on the hot seat, and would have sent in the place-kicker to avoid criticism.Use this simple formula: Best Record Wins, or if Records Equal, Home Team Wins. I\u2019ve tracked this metric for a decade, and in that time it has outperformed The Experts in all but one season.My standard for The Experts is the picks published by ESPN.com, forecasts that come from guys who do nothing year-round but football. Last season the formula went 191-75-1, or 72 percent correct. The best ESPN predictor, the former Pro Bowl linebacker Tom Jackson, called 183 outcomes correctly \u2014 none too shabby, but not as good as my generic off-price formula.So don\u2019t bother pondering who will win the Super Bowl: My off-price generic metric says the Carolina Panthers. I\u2019ll forecast Carolina 20, Denver 17, because 20-17 is the most common N.F.L. final score, happening 248 times in league annals. Even if I\u2019m wrong and Denver prevails, the formula has already outdone The Experts.An earlier version of this article misstated the starting time of Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, as expressed in Roman numerals. The game will start around 6:30 p.m. Eastern (VI:XXX), not 11:30 (XI:XXX).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rome, a Grand Welcome for 2 Long-Deceased Saints", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Along the broad boulevard leading to St. Peter\u2019s Square, the faithful pressed forward. Nuns pointed cellphone cameras. Others stood on tiptoes, trying to catch a glimpse. Squadrons of police officers restrained the crowds and blocked traffic, as motorists could do little except step out of their cars and watch the show.The ancient heart of Rome, a national capital as well as one of the world\u2019s most fabled cities, ground to a halt late on Friday afternoon as the sun fell slowly over the Tiber River.The reason?\u201cWe are devoted to Padre Pio,\u201d said Anna Oppedisano, who had come from northern Italy to see his remains. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s not just an event. It has a religious meaning. Seeing him go through the streets of Rome is important to us, for what it represents. It has a highly historical and symbolic value.\u201dFrancis has always championed the ways that some Catholics, including large numbers of poor people, sometimes express their Catholic faith through \u201cpopular devotions.\u201d And venerating relics \u2014 objects or even bone fragments believed to come from saints \u2014 is deeply ingrained in Catholic tradition.Not everyone is so thrilled. On his talk radio program Friday morning, Oscar Giannino, teasingly mocked the whole event while his guest, Massimo Fini, a writer and self-described honest pagan, questioned why more than 1,000 Italian police officers were handling security (rather than Vatican security such as the Swiss Guards) at cost to ordinary citizens.\u201cThe Swiss Guards should protect him, or he should protect himself, given that he is a saint,\u201d Mr. Fini joked.Robert Mickens, a longtime Vatican analyst, said venerating saints or praying at the tombs of martyrs is a time-honored Catholic practice, but he questioned the decision to display the remains of the two saints. \u201cWhat I find so distasteful, wrongheaded and sort of bizarre is parading these things under glass boxes,\u201d said Mr. Mickens, the editor of Global Pulse magazine. \u201cThis is like Lenin\u2019s Tomb, for God\u2019s sake.\u201dThe Vatican did not always embrace Padre Pio, either. It initiated numerous investigations against him, beginning in the 1920s, after his devotees said he had supernatural powers and carried the stigmata, the markings of the crucifixion wounds of Christ. But the Vatican later reversed course, and Pope John Paul II named him a saint in 2002.A major part of Padre Pio\u2019s wide appeal \u2014 and perhaps one reason Pope Francis is using him as the symbol of his year of mercy \u2014 is his reputation for listening to confessions day in and day out during his lifetime, including from John Paul ll, before he became pope. Lore has it that Padre Pio heard two million confessions.Today, Padre Pio\u2019s image is still widely displayed across Italy, and millions of pilgrims have visited his sanctuary in the hilltop town of San Giovanni Rotondo, in the southern Italian region of Puglia. In 2008, his body was exhumed, treated with chemicals, adorned with a silicone replica of his face and placed inside an oxygen-free glass box so that pilgrims could see him.For this week\u2019s trip north to the Vatican, the glass box was placed in a second, protective glass box, loaded into a windowed hearse and driven up the highway in a caravan of Capuchin friars. At one point, the entourage pulled into one of Italy\u2019s familiar highway rest stops, the Autogrill, which are usually teeming with travelers queuing for espressos and sandwiches. Out popped a dozen or so brown-robed friars, an archbishop and a coterie of police officers.Given the widespread news coverage, it did not take long for people to figure out who had pulled in.\u201cWaiters and bartenders left their positions to go touch the hearse,\u201d said Stefano Campanella, director of Teleradio Padre Pio, a television and radio network dedicated to the Italian saint. \u201cThere were even people on the highway overpasses who took pictures.\u201dThe caravan arrived in Rome on Wednesday evening, stopping first at St. Lawrence Outside the Walls, an ancient church where thousands of faithful lined up for hours to see Padre Pio. On Thursday, the corpse was moved to San Salvatore in Lauro, a church just across the Tiber River from the Vatican. There, the local priest, Father Pietro Bongiovanni, was busily preparing for round-the-clock Masses before the procession moved to the Vatican on Friday afternoon.Father Bongiovanni is one of the local caretakers of the Padre Pio movement. Devotees of the saint regularly meet in his church, which houses several Padre Pio relics, including one of his garments, a cloth stained with his blood and one of his gloves. In 2000, Father Bongiovanni took the relics on a two-week tour of Argentina at the invitation of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires \u2014 who is now Pope Francis.\u201cHe had us start with the poorest of all,\u201d Father Bongiovanni recalled of a tour that began in the slums as Francis hoped seeing the relics might lift public spirits with Argentina then mired in economic crisis.On Friday, Father Bongiovanni walked with the procession to the Vatican, smiling and singing. He was possibly a bit relieved. A day earlier, as he awaited the arrival of Padre Pio at his church, the phone in his office was ringing off the hook.\u201cIt has been ringing every minute for a month!\u201d he said, chuckling.An article on Feb. 6 about a procession in Rome in which the bodies of two long-dead Roman Catholic saints, Padre Pio and Padre Leopoldo, were carried to the Vatican as part of its Jubilee celebration misidentified the substance used for the facial replica of Padre Pio and referred incorrectly to Padre Leopoldo\u2019s corpse. Padre Pio\u2019s face mask is made of silicone, the rubberlike polymer, not silicon, the semi-metallic element. Padre Leopoldo\u2019s mask is made of plastic; his corpse is not \u201cenhanced\u201d with silicon.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}

She helps clients like Kraft Foods, PepsiCo, Nestl\u00e9, Whole Foods Market and Google better understand how people think about and consume food so they can repackage products and design new ones, find novel distribution methods or keep their own employees productive and well fed. After all her conversations, note taking and analysis, Lee summarizes her findings like this: \u2018\u2018The way people eat at work is pretty sad.\u2019\u2019Amy BloomProducer, Practical Magic, Sun Valley, Calif.Pepperoni pizza.In the 1987 movie \u2018\u2018Wall Street,\u2019\u2019 Gordon Gekko famously remarks, \u2018\u2018Lunch is for wimps.\u2019\u2019 It has proved to be a prescient line in the American workplace, where taking time off for lunch has increasingly become a sign of idleness. Breaking for a midday meal might have made more sense when laborers toiled with their bodies on tasks \u2014 building, planting, harvesting, manufacturing \u2014 that required rest and refueling. But in an economy where the standard task is sitting in front of a computer, lunch is less intuitive and far more optional.Now some 62 percent of professionals say they typically eat lunch at their desks, a phenomenon that social scientists have begun calling \u2018\u2018desktop dining.\u2019\u2019 Eating takes a back seat to meetings, catching up on to-dos or responding to email. Roughly half of American adults eat lunch alone. In research from the Hartman Group, many so-called millennial wage earners said they actually preferred eating solo. A quarter of those surveyed agreed with the statement \u2018\u2018I eat alone to multitask better.\u2019\u2019There is a possible health benefit to all of this: Our unaccompanied lunches are probably smaller. Studies on pigs, rats, puppies, chickens, gerbils and other animals dating back to the 1920s show a phenomenon researchers call \u2018\u2018social facilitation,\u2019\u2019 in which the presence of others makes an individual eat more. For years, scientists believed humans were different. Animals feed, they thought; humans dine. In subsequent research, it turned out that humans feed, too. Simply eating with one other person increases the average amount ingested by 44 percent. In fact, the more people present, the more people eat. One study showed that with seven or more, subjects ate 96 percent more than they would have alone.But with the clearly delineated lunch on the decline, workers end up snacking. In a study of 122 employees, people on average cached 476 calories\u2019 worth of food in their desks. One person squirreled away 3,000 calories, including Cheetos, candy bars and five cans of pop-top tuna fish. In addition to the personal food stashes, there are those areas in an office where food accumulates like driftwood \u2014 the leftover sandwiches from a catered lunch; the remains of a birthday cake; banana bread someone baked at home; the bottomless candy dish. When researchers interviewed administrative staff members at the University of California, Davis, one respondent called these common stockpiles \u2018\u2018food altars.\u2019\u2019Sometimes these collective food repositories become fraught, and in the case of shared workplace refrigerators, even hazardous. In a survey of more than 2,100 full-time professionals, nearly all had access to refrigerators. When asked about cleanliness, a full 40 percent were unaware of fridge cleaning or knew it to be rare or nonexistent. Navigating around a colleague\u2019s forgotten bag of slimy baby carrots might be gross, but the bigger danger in a fridge is the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Unlike other pathogens like E. coli, listeria can thrive at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the recommended temperature for refrigerators. Even in the Seattle law office of Bill Marler, the most prominent food-safety lawyer in the country, the fridge was, until recently, a mess of expired food, rotting salad and long-abandoned deli meat. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s embarrassing,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018Like an insurance salesman not having insurance.\u2019\u2019Beyond any health risks, the desk lunch detracts from our sense of the office as a collaborative, innovative, sociable space. It is hard to foster that feeling when workers eat single-serving yogurt alone, faces lit in the monochrome blue of their computer screens. Brian Wansink, a professor and the director of Cornell University\u2019s Food and Brand Lab, points out that desktop dining isn\u2019t even a sign of industriousness anymore; these days, a desk luncher is as likely as not to be scrolling through Facebook. Wansink and other researchers did a survey of fire-department captains and lieutenants in a major American city. They found significant positive correlations between work performance and eating and cooking as a team. Firehouses where firefighters ate together reported more cooperative behavior; they were better at their jobs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul Aiken, Who Championed Authors in Digital Era, Dies at 56", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byPaul Aiken, who as executive director of the Authors Guild began parrying digital-era challenges to copyrights and royalties nearly two decades ago, died on Jan. 29 at his home in Manhattan. He would have been 57 two days later.The cause was complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, his wife, Stefanie Rosenfeld, said.In 1993, even before Amazon went online or Google was incorporated, Mr. Aiken, as a dispirited lawyer producing a baseball trivia calendar on the side, joined the Guild and started generating news releases that presaged the portents of electronic publishing.First he criticized a publisher for agreeing to pay authors only 5 percent of proceeds for digital rights. Then he warned facetiously that a page-turning copying machine would take \u201cthe drudgery out of copyright infringement.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s funny,\u201d Mr. Aiken recalled last year in the Authors Guild Bulletin, \u201cis that these two news releases brought up topics that we would revisit again and again over the next 20 years: publishers being cheap and unfair in paying for digital rights, and technology, particularly scanning technology, threatening to undermine the entire book market.\u201dIn 2005, the Guild joined in a suit against Google for scanning copyrighted books without permission, but a proposed $125 million settlement was overturned by a federal judge, who ruled in Manhattan that the scanning constituted fair use under the law.The author Scott Turow, one of seven Guild presidents under whom Mr. Aiken served, said Mr. Aiken \u201cbelieved passionately, like the Framers, that copyright was the key to maintaining the class of independent authors who are essential in a democracy, and he fought with fervor and imagination to bolster writers\u2019 livelihoods and to defend them from the many who scheme to reduce the value of the written word.\u201dIn every case, Mr. Aiken rebutted the argument that copyright impeded progress and defended the principle that creative artists should be rewarded for their works.During Mr. Aiken\u2019s tenure, the Guild also embraced his suggestion to compile an Authors Registry to find authors of so-called orphaned works that publishers and producers sought to mine or reissue.\u201cI can tell you what all authors like,\u201d he said in 2008. \u201cThey like their books to be read, and except for the most financially perverse of authors, they like a good royalty check.\u201dPaul Daymond Aiken was born in Chicago on Jan. 31, 1959. His father, Daymond, was a mathematics professor. His mother, the former Marion Kuebler, taught English. She survives him.Besides his wife and mother, he is survived by his children, Melanie, Wil and Andrew John; his brothers, Greg and Judd; and his sisters, Amy-Jo Zdroik and Deeda Aiken.Mr. Aiken earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in science from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., in 1981, graduated from Cornell University Law School, and worked at Kornstein, Veisz & Wexler in New York, where he met Robin Davis Miller, who recruited him in 1993 after she became the Authors Guild\u2019s executive director.Mr. Aiken succeeded her in 1995.

{"Headline": "Dear Google, Is There a Shrink for That?", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byCultural StudiesWhat does it take to feel understood?This is arguably the single question helping to reshape the modern psychotherapeutic landscape.Call it boutique therapy: a swirl of contemporary tastes and consumer expectations that has yielded a collection of psychotherapeutic options specially designed for almost any circumstance in which humans could find themselves.Forget the old distinctions between therapists who specialize in mood disorders versus those who do marriage counseling. The new niche market is exponentially more refined.Perhaps nowhere is this phenomenon more evident than in the realm of psychotherapies designed for people who identify as L.G.B.T. Therapists, both gay and straight, have increasingly started practices geared specifically toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and, most recently, transgendered patients. (Not to mention those patients who prefer not to identify with any one category.)For Matthew Silverstein, a psychologist in West Hollywood, Calif., this development springs from dire necessity. \u201cThere\u2019s a tortured history of practices that have been called psychotherapy,\u201d Dr. Silverstein said, referring to notorious techniques like \u201cconversion therapy\u201d that purport to change patients from gay to straight and that continue to be practiced to this day. \u201cThere\u2019s still a vulnerability that many L.G.B.T. patients feel when coming into a psychological treatment,\u201d he said.For Dr. Silverstein and others, the advent of specialization has created \u201csafe refuges\u201d for patients who for so long were without recourse to anything of the kind. \u201cUntil the 1970s, we simply didn\u2019t have the tools,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an understanding of gay identity, or of gayness as a cultural or developmental process.\u201dFor the psychologist Douglas Sadownick, a colleague at Antioch University in Culver City, Calif., there is an added layer of emphasis. \u201cWe work on the assumption that gay people have their own psychology, they have their own blueprints,\u201d he said.For Dr. Sadownick, the essential qualities of an L.G.B.T. affirming therapist come down to two fundamental capabilities: to be able to identify one\u2019s own \u201cinternalized homophobia,\u201d often operating outside of conscious awareness, and \u201cto treasure being gay, as good for society, good for evolution,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be aware that this idea of being L.G.B.T. may have a lot more potential than we\u2019ve given it.\u201dUndoubtedly, the Internet has contributed to the shifting therapeutic landscape. Where before, word of mouth was crucial to the search for a therapist, prospective patients are now likely to take to the web, and faced with thousands of anonymous possibilities, look for some way in which to determine who may be the best fit, whose boxes check their own boxes.It\u2019s not unlike how one may proceed through OkCupid, seeking potential mates who share a taste for George Orwell, Judaism and taco trucks, in the hope that these commonalities actually mean something.And many therapists, in turn, feel the pressure to fold themselves into recognizable categories. For Rachel Sussman, a psychologist in New York who self-describes as a \u201crelationship specialist\u201d (from first date to breakup), it seemed necessary to carefully brand herself to build a practice.\u201cI have a marketing background,\u201d she said. \u201cI became a therapist as a second career. And I knew I had to hit the ground running. Once upon a time, you would just hang a shingle and wait for people to come to you. I don\u2019t think that happens anymore.\u201dLike so much to do with psychotherapy itself, the new specialization is largely an urban phenomenon. Take Jocelyn Charnas, known as \u201cthe wedding doctor\u201d in certain New York circles, who came to her specialty through personal experience.A practicing psychologist, she had recently gotten married and was aware that there was all too little conversation revolving around the psychological challenges of the experience. \u201cWhen you get engaged, it\u2019s the ring, the venue, the flowers, which is all wonderful and interesting, but nobody seemed to be talking about the universal experience that this is also difficult,\u201d she said.For Dr. Charnas, weddings are not just weddings, but rather pressure-cooker moments that contain layer upon layer of psychologically fraught material. \u201cTypically, it\u2019s really not whether you\u2019re having roses or lilies that is keeping you up at night,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile that may be the manifest content of it, the underlying content could be a number of things, like fears of disappointing your mother, or disappointing yourself. There are so many latent emotions.\u201dThus, for Dr. Charnas, within weddings lies the very fullness of human experience. This is what makes every case different, every stressed-out bride-to-be distinct from the last.In Los Altos, Calif., the psychologist Howard Scott Warshaw has developed his own brand as \u201cThe Silicon Valley Therapist,\u201d specializing in everything that he says makes Silicon Valley unique: the particular personality type that is suited for computer programming but less adept at parsing human ambiguity, the environment that seems to expect nothing less than extraordinary achievement.\u201cSome of these engineers, they love the software world, because it provides a metaphor of looking at life that really makes sense and facilitates their entire worldview,\u201d Mr. Warshaw said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to deal with someone like that and you can\u2019t speak that language, there\u2019s going to be a real communication problem.\u201dAnd because Mr. Warshaw was a computer engineer before he became a therapist, he believes he has the necessary knowledge to communicate with his clientele. \u201cI\u2019ve done the job they\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the pressures they\u2019ve been in. I really understand what it is to go through a software development cycle. So I can hear them in a way that some therapists without this background simply can\u2019t.\u201dDr. Garfinkle is often asked by prospective patients, \u201cDo you have a specialty?\u201dThis is how he likes to respond: \u201cMy youngest patient is 9, my oldest patient is 82. My patient who\u2019s most well is mildly anxious, my most severely ill patient, so to speak, is someone who has been in and out of hospitals with schizophrenia for most of his life.\u201d\u201cIt can be limiting because you may end up with someone with a narrower perspective,\u201d Dr. Shubert said. \u201cJust because someone understands what it\u2019s like to work with a Hasidic Jew, doesn\u2019t mean that they understand what it\u2019s like to have two sisters, or to be depressed.\u201dOne may also wonder: Where is the line between Mr. Warshaw\u2019s kind of highly targeted Silicon Valley therapy and the less explicitly psychological work of a life coach? For Mr. Warshaw, the distinction is clear. \u201cIn coaching I\u2019m working to maximize your performance in a specific activity right now,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cIn therapy I\u2019m working to maximize your potential and who you are, then you can take that to any endeavor you care to.\u201dHis perception is hardly newfangled. Freud himself had something to say on this subject. In a letter to Carl Jung, written in 1906, he put it thus: \u201cPsychoanalysis is, in essence, a cure through love.\u201dCasey Schwartz is the author of \u2018\u2018In the Mind Fields: Exploring the New Science of Neuropsychoanalysis.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And a trail that looks an awful lot like blood.Some of it was Mary\u2019s. For roughly four-fifths of tonight\u2019s episode, she was adamant that her world had no room in it for a car mechanic. Under pressure from her pathologically meddlesome brother-in-law, she once more cycled through her reasons: Henry lacks money, he lacks position, they\u2019re not right for each other, etc. It was up to Granny to tease out the real deal-breaker: \u201cI can\u2019t be a crash widow again!

That new title could widen his matrimonial field to include every eligible woman in England, but Bertie only wants to double down. It\u2019s Edith or nobody.\u201cWon\u2019t you send me to bed happy?\u201d he asks. Which does indeed sound like an indecent proposal, but Edith sort of says yes, and it\u2019s pretty clear she relishes the chance to outrank her sis in the peerage hierarchy \u2014 until Mary, in a truly chilling act of sabotage, blurts out the news about Marigold.Bertie\u2019s plenty bummed, all right: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I could spend my life with someone I didn\u2019t trust, that didn\u2019t trust me.\u201d He leaves on the next train, and Edith\u2019s wedding dress goes right back into mothballs.At any rate, Barrow doesn\u2019t actually die, thanks to the quick thinking of Baxter, although his near-end does usefully shake the ground beneath Downton\u2019s two most complacent citizens: the Earl, who regarded Barrow\u2019s dismissal as merely \u201ca useful saving,\u201d and Carson, who assumed his underbutler was \u201ca man without a heart.\u201dIf anything, the title of Most Heartless Man has now passed to Carson himself.

It\u2019s not enough to make them champions.\u201d Then note his truly churlish treatment of Mrs. Patmore, whose B & B has been mistaken for Ye Olde House of Strumpetry. (Isn\u2019t there some part of you that wishes she would rise to the challenge and become Yorkshire\u2019s wealthiest madam?)Upstairs and down alike have a good deal of not very becoming fun at Mrs. P\u2019s expense, but Carson is the one who can\u2019t stop needling the poor woman. \u201cI did wonder about the whole idea from the beginning,\u201d he says with a sniff.

I got your tawdry local brouhaha right here.Here\u2019s the problem: We only have one more episode left to salvage our butler, and I\u2019m not sure it can be done \u2014 no, not even by Mrs. H\u2019s referring to him dotingly as \u201cmy curmudgeon.\u201d (And, Mrs. H, I hope for your sake he\u2019s tearing it up in the bedroom.)\u201cWell,\u201d says Miss C in her airiest manner, \u201cyou know men.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure I do, as it happens,\u201d answers the cool-as-a-cucumber Isobel. \u201cTell me about them.\u201dDepartment of other stuff. \u2026** The agony aunt Cassandra Jones is really Septimus Spratt!

{"Headline": "A New Breed of Trader on Wall Street: Coders With a Ph.D.", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byHOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 The mood in the markets may be getting grimmer, but in the booming world of exchange-traded funds, people just want to party.It was an invitation-only party (crabs, cocktails and a D.J. on a moonlit dock) thrown by Jane Street, a secretive E.T.F. trading firm that, after years of minting money in the shadows of Wall Street, is now pitching itself to some of the largest institutional investors in the world.And the message was clear: Jane Street, which barely existed 15 years ago and now trades more than $1 trillion a year, was ready to take on the big boys.Much of what Jane Street, which occupies two floors of an office building at the southern tip of Manhattan, does is not known. That is by design, as the firm deploys specialized trading strategies to capture arbitrage profits by buying and selling (using its own capital) large amounts of E.T.F. shares.It\u2019s a risky business.And in many cases, some of the most popular E.T.F.s track hard-to-trade securities like junk bonds, emerging-market stocks and a variety of derivative products, adding an extra layer of risk.These dangers were brought home last August, when markets were rattled by China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency; some of the largest E.T.F.s sank by 50 percent or more.While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable what they can do,\u201d said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. \u201cIf you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, it\u2019s fewer and fewer firms.\u201dIt is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion.And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader \u2014 one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firm\u2019s capital.In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop.Here is a small sample of Jane Street\u2019s main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (master\u2019s in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (master\u2019s in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelor\u2019s in computer science, Carnegie Mellon).For large asset management firms like BlackRock, Vanguard and Invesco, the business of rolling out one E.T.F. after another has become a major profit center. But in many ways, the real money is being made by the trading firms that specialize in making a market in these securities.For example, Jane Street, which is privately held, has increased its shareholder\u2019s equity, or net worth, to more than $1 billion today from $228 million in 2007.That cash cushion handily surpasses what such established investment banks as Evercore, Moelis and Greenhill have (as of 2014) as well as that at money management firms like Eaton Vance.Moreover, it supports just 450 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business.Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level.Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firm\u2019s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading.A star trader for the company, he also oversees its hiring process.Jane Street has acquired a reputation for being perhaps the toughest interview in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.This is in part because the firm hires only a handful of new employees each year. To survive, candidates have to ace brain-twisting math riddles and game theory tests.But as Mr. Lehoczky has said when asked what he is looking for in an E.T.F. trader, the ideal candidate possesses what he calls second-order knowledge \u2014 a form of intellectual humility in which really smart people can accept being wrong and own up to mistakes.In that vein, a prospect might be fed a math problem that cannot be answered, just to gauge reaction to failure.Because Jane Street finds itself competing more with Facebook and Google for talent than with, say, Goldman Sachs, the firm lays on the perks. These include a catered breakfast and lunch, a substantial gym right off the trading floor, generous child care benefits and an in-house speaker series that has featured the likes of Salman Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens and Garry Kasparov.As for compensation, how much Jane Street\u2019s rocket scientists get paid is as closely guarded a secret as its trading formulas. Still, it is apparently quite a bit.\u201cAs a trader, if you do well, you will retire before you turn 30,\u201d said one employee on an industry message board.A number of larger banks, Goldman in particular, have been involved in exchange-traded funds for some time now, but the rest of the Wall Street banks are seeking to recruit their own E.T.F. hotshots.One such trader is Monish Shah, a 31-year-old native of Mumbai, who was hired by the Japanese bank Mizuho to build a trading desk in its New York office.Mr. Shah fits the profile of the up-and-coming E.T.F. trader: He is young, has a master\u2019s degree in quantitative finance at Georgia Tech and is as much a writer of code as he is a trader.On an old-school trading desk of mostly white men in their 50s buying and selling common stock, Mr. Shah stands out.Ensconced at the far end of the firm\u2019s equity desk, his four computer screens flash an array of color-coded execution cues, and he is a frequent target of good-natured trading-room banter, sending up his supersize console, his youth and even his Indian accent.As stocks tumbled yet again on a Friday this month, curses rang out up and down the desk. An E.T.F. that Mr. Shah had been eyeing was down more than 3 percent, and now his color-coded signals were flashing green for buy \u2014 which is what he did, just as the market bell rang at 4 p.m.Within a half-hour, the desk was empty as his colleagues rushed to catch the early train home. But Mr. Shah was not going anywhere; he had a business to build.\u201cThere are so many moving parts; if just one thing goes wrong, you get killed,\u201d Mr. Shah said, letting out a slow sigh. \u201cSo yes, it is stressful \u2014 but it is also my passion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Promise of Artificial Intelligence Unfolds in Small Steps", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byWhen IBM\u2019s Watson computer triumphed over human champions in the quiz show \u201cJeopardy!\u201d it was a stunning achievement that suggested limitless horizons for artificial intelligence.Soon after, IBM\u2019s leaders moved to convert Watson from a celebrated science project into a moneymaking business, starting with health care.Yet the next few years after its game show win proved humbling for Watson. Today, IBM executives candidly admit that medicine proved far more difficult than they anticipated. Costs and frustration mounted on Watson\u2019s early projects. They were scaled back, refocused and occasionally shelved.IBM\u2019s early struggles with Watson point to the sobering fact that commercializing new technology, however promising, typically comes in short steps rather than giant leaps.Despite IBM\u2019s own challenges, Watson\u2019s TV victory \u2014 five years ago this month \u2014 has helped fuel interest in A.I. from the public and the rest of the tech industry. Venture capital investors have poured money into A.I. start-ups, and large corporations like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple have been buying fledgling A.I. companies. That investment reached $8.5 billion last year, more than three and a half times the level in 2010, according to Quid, a data analysis firm.And software engineers with A.I. skills are treated like star athletes, prompting bidding wars for their services.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely at a peak of excitement now,\u201d said Jerry Kaplan, a computer scientist, entrepreneur and author, who was a co-founder of a long-forgotten A.I. start-up in the 1980s. \u201cExpectations are way ahead of reality.\u201dThe term A.I. has long been a staple of science fiction \u2014 as machines that think for themselves and help humankind or as ungrateful creations that try to wipe us out. Or so the thinking at the movies goes.The reality, however, is a little less dramatic. The automated voice on your smartphone that tries to answer your questions? That\u2019s a type of A.I. So are features of Google\u2019s search engine. The technology is also being applied to complex business problems like finding trends in cancer research.The field of artificial intelligence goes back to the beginning of the computer age and it has rolled through cycles of optimism and disillusion ever since, encouraged by a few movie robots and one very successful game show contestant.The history of tech tells A.I. backers to hang in there. Silicon Valley veterans argue that people routinely overestimate what can be done with new technology in three years, yet underestimate what can be done in 10 years.Predictions made in the \u201990s about how the new World Wide Web would shake the foundations of the media, advertising and retailing industries did prove to be true, for example. But it happened a decade later, years after the dot-com bust.Today\u2019s A.I., even optimists say, is early in that cycle.\u201cI think future generations are going to look back on the A.I. revolution and compare its impact to the steam engine or electricity,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cBut, of course, it is going to take decades for this technology to really come to fruition.\u201dThere are reasons for enthusiasm. Computers continue to get cheaper even as they get more powerful, making it easier than ever to crunch vast amounts of data in an instant. Also, sensors, smartphones and other tech devices are all over the place, feeding more and more information into computers that are learning more and more about us.Just in the last year or two, researchers have made rapid gains using a machine-learning technique called deep learning to improve the performance of software that recognizes images, translates languages and understands speech. That work has been done at start-ups and at big companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft, as well as at universities and private research centers like the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\u201cThere\u2019s been surprising progress in the problems of perception, seeing, hearing and language,\u201d said Peter Lee, corporate vice president for Microsoft Research.At Enlitic, a start-up in San Francisco, Jeremy Howard, the founder and chief executive, believes that A.I. can transform the huge industry of health care, saving lives and money \u2014 an ambition similar to IBM\u2019s. \u201cBut that\u2019s a 25-year project,\u201d he said.Enlitic is concentrating first on radiology. Medical images are nearly all in digital form, Mr. Howard notes, and the tireless scanning for telltale signs of abnormal tissue is a task for which deep-learning image recognition technology is well suited.Enlitic has tested its software against a database of 6,000 lung cancer diagnoses, both positive and negative, made by professional radiologists. In research soon to be published, its algorithm was 50 percent more accurate than human radiologists, Enlitic said.\u201cYou have to take technology that works and apply it to a known problem,\u201d Mr. Howard said. \u201cInnovation alone is a mistake.\u201dNo company has made as big or as broad a bid to commercialize its A.I. technology as IBM has with Watson. It set up Watson as its own business in 2014, and invested billions to accelerate the development and adoption of the technology, including buying several companies. The Watson unit now has 7,000 employees.The Watson technology has been totally revamped. In its \u201cJeopardy!\u201d days, Watson was a room-size computer. Today, it is so-called cloud software, delivered over the Internet from remote data centers. The Watson software itself has been carved up into dozens of separate A.I. components including a language classifier, text-to-speech translation and image recognition.IBM is trying to position Watson as the equivalent of an A.I. operating system, a software platform others use to build applications. Nearly 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software. IBM now has more than 500 industry partners, from big companies to start-ups, in industries including health care, financial services, retailing, consumer products and legal services.At IBM, Watson\u2019s early struggles in health care are viewed as a learning experience. The IBM teams, the executives say, underestimated the difficulty of grappling with messy data like faxes and handwritten notes and failed to understand how physicians make decisions.\u201cThere were a lot of challenges with the early customers,\u201d said John Kelly, the senior vice president who oversees Watson, adding that the business was \u201ctaking off\u201d now.IBM does not break out financial results for Watson. It describes the business as \u201clarge and growing,\u201d contributing to the company\u2019s $18 billion a year in revenue from business analytics.At the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Watson technology is one ingredient in an automated expert adviser for cancer care. The University of Texas health system is also using Watson in software to help diabetes patients and caregivers manage the disease, in a project that is expected to be introduced by the end of this year.\u201cIt was a lot harder than we thought,\u201d said Dr. Lynda Chin, the chief innovation officer for the university health system. \u201cBut our experience has convinced me that we can build an A.I. engine that improves care.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With that, the results were announced: \u201cYou got \u2014 Tina Fey.\u201dWhat\u2019s it like to have Tina Fey play you? As of December, my book had sold fewer than 11,000 copies in almost five years. In its first month, the movie trailer garnered millions of views on YouTube. Search for my picture on Google and find Fey creeping in. I\u2019m now doing photo shoots and interviews, answering questions like \u201cWhat was it like being a woman in Afghanistan?\u201d (It opened more doors than you might think.) Or \u201cDo you miss it?\u201d (Every day.)As I write this essay, I\u2019m getting ready for the press junket. I will have an assigned groomer. I will be on the other side of the notebook. I have mixed feelings about all of this. My lack of control over the movie is both liberating and frightening. I did not write the script, although the screenwriter met many times with me and others who were in Afghanistan. Nor did I read the script \u2014 a copy was sent to me once it was finished, with the caveat that I couldn\u2019t make any changes. Why read what I couldn\u2019t edit? This was Hollywood\u2019s show, I figured.Fey and I first met in the late summer of 2014, for lunch in Midtown Manhattan. I know we talked about specific things, although I was so full of adrenaline and a desire to be funny, I could hardly remember anything afterward. I know we both complained about high heels. I know she asked me about Afghanistan. We made no future plans; I had no certainty that this movie would actually happen. It felt like an awesome first date that went nowhere.The movie didn\u2019t seem real until I visited the film set in New Mexico for two days last spring. The first morning, a van drove a few of us on a bumpy dirt road for several minutes, until popping over a hill. The scene below looked like Afghanistan, with its beige terrain, onslaught of dust and scrubby gray vegetation. Then there was a military Humvee, with men dressed as Marines hanging out nearby. I sucked in my breath. My handler asked if I had PTSD or flashbacks. Not exactly, especially once I caught sight of the extras playing Taliban members. They seemed to be mostly of Mexican heritage, their turbans were tied like Christmas bows and they were eating Kind bars. This was definitely not Ghazni Province.What I did have was PMSD, Pre-Movie Stress Disorder, because this was actually happening. One fear loomed: What if the movie about my life stank? In early February, I sat down in a screening room, between my brother and my publicist. One thought repeated itself as I watched the film for the first time: \u201cPlease let it be over.\u201d I could barely breathe. I worried about all the things I had no control over \u2014 that my character would look stupid, that the filmmakers were going to fictionalize the book too much. I felt responsible for whether the film was good or bad. My story was my story, after all.Creative liberties were certainly taken. In the movie, my name is Kim Baker, and I\u2019m a television reporter. (Sorry, print journalism.) I have a made-up frenemy who is much hotter than any of my actual friends from Afghanistan. (Sorry, actual friends.) I\u2019m also only in Afghanistan \u2014 there\u2019s no shuffling to Pakistan involved. (Apologies, Pakistan.) It\u2019s Hollywood. But it took Hollywood\u2019s exaggeration to accurately evoke the absurdity of our lives in Kabul \u2014 the Kabubble. It is funny, but not overly so, which seems fitting. I wrote \u201cThe Taliban Shuffle\u201d as a comedy precisely because we witnessed so much tragedy, and the only way to bear it was with a dose of dark humor. I knew people who were killed, who were kidnapped. We all did. The longer I was there, the more times I had to wash blood and whatever else off the bottom of my shoes, the more I felt parts of myself slipping away.I wrote the book because I was furious with all that had gone wrong in these countries that I had come to love, and because absurdity was the only frame that helped me make sense of what I saw: a military operation dubbed Operation Turtle, a Tarts-and-Talibs-themed party. My greatest wish is that the movie will remind people about Afghanistan, currently in a perilous state and almost forgotten by the world\u2019s media. Maybe more people will start talking about a holistic approach to the region rather than the Whack-a-Terrorist game we seem to be playing. And maybe more people will read the book, which as everyone knows is \u201calways better than the movie.\u201dKim Barker, a metro reporter at The Times, is the author of \u201cThe Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Said to Be Trying to Make It Harder to Hack iPhones", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Apple engineers have begun developing new security measures that would make it impossible for the government to break into a locked iPhone using methods similar to those now at the center of a court fight in California, according to people close to the company and security experts.If Apple succeeds in upgrading its security \u2014 and experts say it almost surely will \u2014 the company will create a significant technical challenge for law enforcement agencies, even if the Obama administration wins its fight over access to data stored on an iPhone used by one of the killers in last year\u2019s San Bernardino, Calif., rampage. If the Federal Bureau of Investigation wanted to get into a phone in the future, it would need a new way to do so. That would most likely prompt a new cycle of court fights and, yet again, more technical fixes by Apple.The only way out of this scenario, experts say, is for Congress to get involved. Federal wiretapping laws require traditional phone carriers to make their data accessible to law enforcement agencies. But tech companies like Apple and Google are not covered, and they have strongly resisted legislation that would place similar requirements on them.\u201cWe are in for an arms race unless and until Congress decides to clarify who has what obligations in situations like this,\u201d said Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Companies have always searched for software bugs and patched holes to keep their code secure from hackers. But since the revelations of government surveillance made by Edward J. Snowden, companies have been retooling their products to protect against government intrusion.For Apple, security is also a global marketing strategy. New security measures would not only help the company in its fight with the government, but also reassure investors and customers.\u201cFor all of those people who want to have a voice but they\u2019re afraid, we are standing up, and we are standing up for our customers because protecting them we view as our job,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said on Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.The company first raised the prospect of a security update last week in a phone call with reporters, who asked why the company would allow firmware \u2014 the software at the heart of the iPhone \u2014 to be modified without requiring a user password.One senior executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, replied that it was safe to bet that security would continue to improve. Separately, a person close to the company, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed this week that Apple engineers had begun work on a solution even before the San Bernardino attack. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on what she called rumors and speculation.Independent experts say they have held informal conversations with Apple engineers over the last week about the vulnerability. Exactly how Apple will address the issue is unclear. Security experts who have been studying Apple\u2019s phone security say it is technically possible to fix.\u201cThere are probably 50 different ideas we have all sent to Apple,\u201d said Jonathan Zdziarski, a security researcher.But there is a catch. Each iPhone has a built-in troubleshooting system that lets the company update the system software without the need for a user to enter a passcode. Apple designed that feature to make it easier to repair malfunctioning phones.Apple regularly publishes security updates and gives credit to researchers who hunt for bugs in the company\u2019s software. \u201cUsually, bug reports come in an email saying, \u2018Dear Apple Security, we\u2019ve discovered a flaw in your product,\u2019 \u201d said Chris Soghoian, a technology analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThis bug report has come in the form of a court order.\u201dThe court order to which Mr. Soghoian referred was issued last week by a federal magistrate, and tells Apple to write and install the code sought by the F.B.I. Apple has promised to challenge that order. Its lawyers have until Friday to file its opposition in court.In many ways, Apple\u2019s response continues a trend that has persisted in Silicon Valley since Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations. Yahoo, for instance, left its email service unencrypted for years. After Mr. Snowden revealed the National Security Agency surveillance, the company quickly announced plans to encrypt email. Google similarly moved to fix a vulnerability that the government was using to hack into company data centers.Apple\u2019s showdown with the Justice Department is different in one important way. Now that the government has tried to force Apple to hack its own code, security officials say, the company must view itself as the vulnerability.\u201cThis is the first time that Apple has been included in their own threat model,\u201d Mr. Zdziarski said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Apple ever considered becoming a compelled arm of the government.\u201dThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., signaled this week that he expected Apple to change its security, saying that the phone-cracking tool the government sought in the San Bernardino case was \u201cincreasingly obsolete.\u201d He said that supported the government\u2019s argument that it was not seeking a skeleton key to hack into all iPhones.Apple, though, says the case could set a precedent for forcing company engineers to write code to help the government break into any iPhone. \u201cThe U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create,\u201d Mr. Cook said in his letter.The heated back-and-forth between the government and technology companies is, at least in part, a function of the Obama administration\u2019s strategy. The White House has said it will not ask Congress to pass a law requiring tech companies to give the F.B.I. a way to gain access to customer data. That has left the Justice Department to fight for access one phone at a time, in court cases that often go unnoticed.While it is generally accepted that Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants can outgun the government in a technical fight, the companies do face one important limitation. Security features often come at the expense of making products slower or clunkier.Apple\u2019s brand is built around creating products that are sleek and intuitive. A security solution that defeats the F.B.I. is unworkable if it frustrates consumers.

The board would spin off Yahoo itself and, for good measure, said it would consider \u201calternatives.\u201dBut only a few months later, the board has again shifted course, this time initiating a full-fledged process to sell the company. An independent committee of the board has been formed, and lawyers and three investment banks \u2014 Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and PJT Partners \u2014 have been hired. Even the hiring of three banks shows the bloat at Yahoo as it searches for someone to lead it somewhere.The company says that this is only one option, but independent committees have a life of their own. The train has started and it will probably stop at a sale.Moreover, it is nearly impossible to run a turnaround plan when you are actively exploring a sale and are contacting bidders. The board knows this, and so the talk of a sale being \u201conly an alternative\u201d is cheap.It\u2019s exactly what a weak board would do at this time \u2014 throw its hands up, despite the possible value of waiting.This is a result in part of the failures of Ms. Mayer. A rock star hire, one of her ideas was that Yahoo could be a top-tier player again if it acted like her old employer, Google. That meant spending billions of dollars on acquisitions, giving employees free food and free iPhones, sponsoring the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and throwing multimillion-dollar holiday parties.All of this would be fine if you are Google or Facebook and are minting cash. But it seemed wrong for Yahoo to again sponsor the World Economic Forum this year. You may suspect that many at the forum were looking at the Yahoo executives and thinking that this would be their last year there. What a waste of money, and what bad public relations.All this would make it hard for any board to maintain control. The default, of course, is to pull the ripcord. I had thought that the Yahoo board was taking a stronger stance by trying to buy a year with the Yahoo spinoff, but the board has buckled under pressure, with a potential proxy contest from the hedge fund Starboard Value looming.Yahoo\u2019s bankers will now call the usual subjects and run an auction. This typically takes about one to two months, although given the fact that everyone knows the situation here, it may go more quickly.During that time, indications of interest will be received and the field will be narrowed to a few bidders. Private equity players will undoubtedly bid, but so will strategic ones like Verizon, which bought AOL.Yahoo is likely to sell for less than all of the money Ms. Mayer spent. If she had sought to liquidate Yahoo as soon as she took over and distributed the proceeds, Yahoo shareholders would have fared much better than they will now.Whatever the outcome, Ms. Mayer will be able to parachute out of Yahoo with a big paycheck \u2014 more than $28 million, according to company\u2019s last proxy statement, although a decline in the stock price will make this less. And that is on top of the more than $100 million she has already earned at Yahoo for her years there. The notion of pay for performance loses out once again.This does not mean that an agreement of the Yahoo board to sell the company is the end of the Yahoo story. Some hedge funds like SpringOwl are likely to oppose a sale as insufficient. Other funds like Starboard are salivating for a sale. Indeed, Starboard is likely to try to unseat the Yahoo board in a proxy contest, if only to make sure the board does not again change its mind and decide not to sell.So the next fight to come at Yahoo will be whether the company is selling too cheaply.It all brings to mind a truism on Wall Street, that once you are at the mercy of financial engineers and schemes, it is over. Say good night, Yahoo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Car Exposes Regulatory Divide on Computers as Drivers", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It appears that Google has persuaded federal regulators that \u2014 in some situations at least \u2014 the Tin Man has a heart.The agency\u2019s letter is certain to sharpen the debate over regulation of cars that can drive themselves, even though the technology is still probably years from becoming mainstream. The letter is also at odds with proposed rules in California, where much of the autonomous vehicle research is taking place.\u201cIf driverless cars dramatically reduce accidents, as it appears they will, then speeding up their adoption is good,\u201d said Wendall Wallach, a Yale ethicist. But he added that the N.H.T.S.A. letter \u201ccreates the illusion that by declaring self-driving cars the equivalent of human drivers, we have resolved the broader societal challenges.\u201dThere is no consensus within the automotive industry about the ultimate role of human drivers in the face of rapid progress in artificial intelligence technologies. There is also uncertainty within the industry about whether the technology is advancing quickly enough that it will soon drive a car more safely than humans.Much of the industry has committed to developing autonomous technologies that assist drivers. Last year, Toyota announced a $1 billion research effort adjacent to Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology intended to focus on artificial intelligence that helps human drivers, rather than autonomous vehicles. The industry has begun to deploy a variety of automation systems as safety features, like lane keeping and so-called traffic jam assist.Mr. Hemmersbaugh of the traffic safety agency was responding to a Nov. 12 proposal from Google for a design for a self-driving car without controls, such as a steering wheel, a brake and an accelerator. The prototype, which Google began testing last year, is for a low-speed vehicle that could perform taxi and possibly delivery functions automatically in crowded urban settings.The company switched the focus of its self-driving car program after deciding last year that it could not solve the so-called handoff problem, in which a human driver is required to control the car in an emergency.Google began testing a fleet of cars in 2010, using two professional drivers to oversee the operations of the computer systems that controlled vehicle navigation. However, in 2014, the program was expanded to permit some of the company\u2019s employees to commute using the autonomous cars. The company then observed distracting driving behavior up to and including passengers falling asleep.The legal challenges that artificial intelligence will pose have become more complex as technology has advanced. It was once fashionable to say that the machines would only do exactly what they were programmed to do. And if the human programmer made an error, such as misplacing a decimal point, that would be expressed in some incorrect behavior on the machine\u2019s part.However, recent progress in artificial intelligence has largely been made with so-called deep learning algorithms. This is a branch of machine learning that is based on software composed of multiple processing layers, each with its own complex structure. The programs are \u201ctrained\u201d by exposing them to large data sets. They are then able to perform humanlike tasks, such as categorizing visual objects and understanding speech.At this point, researchers admit that they do not completely understand how the deep learning networks make decisions.This will confront courts with a vexing challenge in the event of accidents caused by the A.I. system. Who will be blamed when it is not clear whether the error was made by human or machine?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Soccer\u2019s Rebranding Gets an Assist From Virtual Reality", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byAdvertisingBut when it finally came time to unveil the new crest, the federation, the national governing body for soccer, elected to largely bypass the traditional news media. Its announcement on Monday will instead be delivered directly to fans via a more immersive experience \u2014 one that involves Google Cardboard, a virtual reality promotional video and a United States Soccer Federation scarf.The federation is hoping that this unorthodox approach will help draw more attention to its first major rebranding since 1995. It could also become a case study of sorts on the effectiveness of virtual reality as an advertising and marketing tool, particularly for sports leagues that are experimenting with different avenues to connect with fans.\u201cThis is an area that I think is still in a really unique phase,\u201d said Jay Berhalter, U.S. Soccer\u2019s chief commercial officer. \u201cWe\u2019re not really sure what it will end up being. But when we looked at it to launch the new crest, we thought it would be a really good fit for this type of dynamic.\u201dU.S. Soccer planned to surreptitiously deliver packages containing the gifts Monday morning to the doorsteps of about 8,000 registered club supporters as well as an additional 2,000 development academy players and other soccer fans across the country. The official unveiling will be later in the day.Shel Holtz, a public relations consultant and principal of the firm Holtz Communication & Technology, said that by doing something unusual, U.S. Soccer might be able to get away with bypassing the normal P.R. route. He likened it to Ford\u2019s effective use of Facebook to unveil its new Explorer model in 2011.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of content these days, a lot of noise,\u201d Mr. Holtz said. \u201cBut as long as you can be early with some of the new technology people are talking about, then you have an edge.\u201dThe approach also echoes what rugby did in the days leading to its World Cup in September, when New Zealand\u2019s national team, in collaboration with American International Group, created a virtual reality experience that it gave away to 1,000 fans. Joe Favorito, an instructor in strategic communications at Columbia University who consulted on the project, said that effort significantly helped raise awareness of the event.\u201cYou want people to get genuinely excited about something, and you want to do it in an atmosphere that they can embrace,\u201d Mr. Favorito said. \u201cSometimes the best way to do it is literally to drop it on their doorstep.\u201dHe says sports entities have used guerrilla marketing tactics in the past \u2014 the Los Angeles Galaxy, for instance, mailed packages with branded goods such as sunscreen to fans \u2014 but virtual reality adds another layer.Mike Gressle, U.S. Soccer\u2019s director of marketing, said that the organization considered the demographics of its fan base before choosing virtual reality.\u201cOur fans are pretty early adopters to technology,\u201d Mr. Gressle said. \u201cGiven that this is the next new thing, we think they\u2019ll be pretty interested in it.\u201dThe rebranding effort is centered on the crest. Crests are like logos for soccer federations, and they are treated reverentially by soccer enthusiasts. The old mark \u2014 which included a flying soccer ball at its center, a rippled top, and six blue stripes below a red field \u2014 was ridiculed as dated and cartoonish. The new one is not unveiled until the end of a two-minute virtual reality highlight reel, which was shot by StriVR and contains 360-degree video from the most recent men\u2019s national team game and the women\u2019s World Cup.Mr. Berhalter said the rebranding and unveiling added up to one of the costliest marketing efforts in the federation\u2019s 102-year history \u2014 reaching seven figures and far outpacing a standard news conference unveiling that might cost around $30,000.\u201cWe kept on coming back to the notion that the press conference isn\u2019t really something that drives the fan experience,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore we\u2019ve moved away from that to something that is more immersive and interacting and experiential for the fan.\u201d(Of course, the federation also reached out to The New York Times in hopes of publicizing the new crest through a more traditional avenue.)The soccer federation enlisted Nike, its sponsor since 1995, to help formulate the look of the new crest. The process began in the fall of 2014 and involved several hundred iterations.The new look is more streamlined, featuring a squared upper limit and 13 vertical stripes (seven red and six white) below a dark blue field containing the block letters U.S.A. The design evokes U.S. Soccer\u2019s original crest from 1913, yet, according to Mr. Berhalter, it conveys an identity that is more modern, aggressive and patriotic.In the days leading up to the unveiling of the new logo, U.S. Soccer scrubbed the previous logo from its website, social media and even the doors of its headquarters in Chicago.First to go from the older crest were its three stars, said Garret Drexler, U.S. Soccer\u2019s fan services manager. Stars traditionally signify World Cups won by that nation, and the United States men\u2019s team has won none (the crest for the women\u2019s team, which has won its World Cup three times, will keep its stars).\u201cI think there\u2019s been a pretty good segment of our fans that have long hoped for an updated identity,\u201d Mr. Drexler said. He added: \u201cOur crest means a lot to our fans. To change it is no small thing. We took a lot of time to make sure we got it right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox May Not Be LeBron James, but It Is Still in the Game", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSo what\u2019s really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying?Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley\u2019s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear.According to Dropbox\u2019s executives, nothing too terrible \u2014 it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron.\u201cSentiment about companies goes in cycles,\u201d Drew Houston, Dropbox\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, told me in an email. \u201cGoogle, Apple, Facebook all went through multiple rounds of this. First, you can do no wrong, then you can do no right. Then people are like, \u2018Actually this is a pretty good company,\u2019 and around it goes. So you have to ignore the noise and stay focused on building great products and making customers happy. The rest will take care of itself.\u201dOther numbers are also promising, they said. More than 400 million people use the company\u2019s service \u2014 a place to keep documents online, so they can easily be shared and synchronized among different people and different computers \u2014 and the service is adding 10 million users a month. Dropbox also has 150,000 business customers, who pay annual fees of about $150 for each employee, and those ranks are growing by about 25,000 businesses a quarter.Insiders declined to specify Dropbox\u2019s revenue and growth rate, other than to say there had been increases since its last funding round, when the company\u2019s annual revenue was reported to be $400 million.Executives also said employee retention and hiring have not been hurt by the recent news. I asked several tech recruiters if they had noticed a diminished interest in working for Dropbox; none had. In the last year, Dropbox has hired from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\u201cDropbox is growing on the same trajectory as the best software-as-a-service companies ever \u2014 like LinkedIn or Salesforce,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and a partner at the investment firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in the company. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we couldn\u2019t be thrilled with that kind of performance.\u201dBut if Dropbox can still thrill its backers, it has also accumulated a chorus of skeptics. The company is one of several looking to ride two tidal waves now sweeping the business world \u2014 the trend toward business software that doesn\u2019t stink, known as the \u201cconsumerization of information technology,\u201d and the rising willingness of companies to store their most precious data on online servers, or in the cloud.Dropbox\u2019s issue is that its products for business customers are relatively new compared with those of its rival Box, which was founded before Dropbox and began focusing on business users earlier. Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market \u2014 the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online.Dropbox argues that the comparison with Box doesn\u2019t take into account the differences in the two companies\u2019 business models. Sure, Dropbox is developing its sales team and expanding its product offerings for businesses. But Dennis Woodside, Dropbox\u2019s chief operating officer, said that its broad brand recognition makes the sales process more efficient \u2014 and thus cheaper \u2014 than Box\u2019s. When Dropbox visits a company\u2019s chief information officer on a sales call, it has something Box struggles to show \u2014 a large base of the company\u2019s employees who are already using its service.\u201cWe fish in a pond that\u2019s used to our product,\u201d Mr. Woodside said. In the last quarter, Dropbox signed up 13 large companies with more than 1,000 users each, he said, three times as many as in the same period last year.Mr. Schreier of Sequoia Capital said Dropbox\u2019s potential for profit was more attractive than Box\u2019s, and argued that when Dropbox eventually goes public, investors will recognize that difference.Aaron Levie, Box\u2019s chief executive, disputed this assertion. \u201cOur differentiation and maturity in the enterprise market is what wins those customers,\u201d he said. A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr. Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox,\u201d he said.Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox \u2014 not to mention Google or Microsoft \u2014 will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business. Analysts say that at the moment, the market is big enough, and wide open enough, for all of these companies to thrive.The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox\u2019s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.An earlier version of this column misstated the fees Dropbox charges its business customers. The fees are about $150 annually for each of the business\u2019s employees, not for each business.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Death, the Prosperity Gospel and Me", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byOpinionDurham, N.C. \u2014 ON a Thursday morning a few months ago, I got a call from my doctor\u2019s assistant telling me that I have Stage 4 cancer. The stomach cramps I was suffering from were not caused by a faulty gallbladder, but by a massive tumor.I am a historian of the American prosperity gospel. Put simply, the prosperity gospel is the belief that God grants health and wealth to those with the right kind of faith. I spent 10 years interviewing televangelists with spiritual formulas for how to earn God\u2019s miracle money. I held hands with people in wheelchairs being prayed for by celebrities known for their miracle touch. I sat in people\u2019s living rooms and heard about how they never would have dreamed of owning this home without the encouragement they heard on Sundays.I went on pilgrimage with the faith healer Benny Hinn and 900 tourists to retrace Jesus\u2019 steps in the Holy Land and see what people would risk for the chance at their own miracle. I ruined family vacations by insisting on being dropped off at the showiest megachurch in town. If there was a river running through the sanctuary, an eagle flying freely in the auditorium or an enormous, spinning statue of a golden globe, I was there.Growing up in the 1980s on the prairies of Manitoba, Canada, an area largely settled by Mennonites, I had been taught in my Anabaptist Bible camp that there were few things closer to God\u2019s heart than pacifism, simplicity and the ability to compliment your neighbor\u2019s John Deere Turbo Combine without envy. Though Mennonites are best known by their bonnets and horse-drawn buggies, they are, for the most part, plainclothes capitalists like the rest of us. I adore them. I married one.But when a number of Mennonites in my hometown began to give money to a pastor who drove a motorcycle onstage \u2014 a motorcycle they gave him for a new church holiday called \u201cPastor\u2019s Appreciation Day\u201d \u2014 I was genuinely baffled. Everyone I interviewed was so sincere about wanting to gain wealth to bless others, too. But how could Mennonites, of all people \u2014 a tradition once suspicious of the shine of chrome bumpers and the luxury of lace curtains \u2014 now attend a congregation with a love for unfettered accumulation?The riddle of a Mennonite megachurch became my intellectual obsession. No one had written a sustained account of how the prosperity gospel grew from small tent revivals across the country in the 1950s into one of the most popular forms of American Christianity, and I was determined to do it. I learned that the prosperity gospel sprang, in part, from the American metaphysical tradition of New Thought, a late-19th-century ripening of ideas about the power of the mind: Positive thoughts yielded positive circumstances, and negative thoughts negative circumstances.Variations of this belief became foundational to the development of self-help psychology. Today, it is the standard \u201cAha!\u201d moment of Oprah\u2019s Lifeclass, the reason your uncle has a copy of \u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u201d and the takeaway for the more than 19 million who bought \u201cThe Secret.\u201d (Save your money: the secret is to think positively.) These ideas about mind power became a popular answer to a difficult question: Why are some people healed and some not?The modern prosperity gospel can be directly traced to the turn-of-the-century theology of a pastor named E. W. Kenyon, whose evangelical spin on New Thought taught Christians to believe that their minds were powerful incubators of good or ill. Christians, Kenyon advised, must avoid words and ideas that create sickness and poverty; instead, they should repeat: \u201cGod is in me. God\u2019s ability is mine. God\u2019s strength is mine. God\u2019s health is mine. His success is mine. I am a winner. I am a conqueror.\u201d Or, as prosperity believers summarized it for me, \u201cI am blessed.\u201dBlessed is a loaded term because it blurs the distinction between two very different categories: gift and reward. It can be a term of pure gratitude. \u201cThank you, God. I could not have secured this for myself.\u201d But it can also imply that it was deserved. \u201cThank you, me. For being the kind of person who gets it right.\u201d It is a perfect word for an American society that says it believes the American dream is based on hard work, not luck.If Oprah could eliminate a single word, it would be \u201cluck.\u201d \u201cNothing about my life is lucky,\u201d she argued on her cable show. \u201cNothing. A lot of grace. A lot of blessings. A lot of divine order. But I don\u2019t believe in luck. For me luck is preparation meeting the moment of opportunity.\u201d This is America, where there are no setbacks, just setups. Tragedies are simply tests of character.It is the reason a neighbor knocked on our door to tell my husband that everything happens for a reason.\u201cI\u2019d love to hear it,\u201d my husband said.\u201cPardon?\u201d she said, startled.\u201cI\u2019d love to hear the reason my wife is dying,\u201d he said, in that sweet and sour way he has.My neighbor wasn\u2019t trying to sell him a spiritual guarantee. But there was a reason she wanted to fill that silence around why some people die young and others grow old and fussy about their lawns. She wanted some kind of order behind this chaos. Because the opposite of #blessed is leaving a husband and a toddler behind, and people can\u2019t quite let themselves say it: \u201cWow. That\u2019s awful.\u201d There has to be a reason, because without one we are left as helpless and possibly as unlucky as everyone else.One of the most endearing and saddest things about being sick is watching people\u2019s attempts to make sense of your problem. My academic friends did what researchers do and Googled the hell out of it. When did you start noticing pain? What exactly were the symptoms, again? Is it hereditary? I can out-know my cancer using the Mayo Clinic website. Buried in all their concern is the unspoken question: Do I have any control?I can also hear it in all my hippie friends\u2019 attempts to find the most healing kale salad for me. I can eat my way out of cancer. Or, if I were to follow my prosperity gospel friends\u2019 advice, I can positively declare that it has no power over me and set myself free.The prosperity gospel tries to solve the riddle of human suffering. It is an explanation for the problem of evil. It provides an answer to the question: Why me? For years I sat with prosperity churchgoers and asked them about how they drew conclusions about the good and the bad in their lives. Does God want you to get that promotion? Tell me what it\u2019s like to believe in healing from that hospital bed. What do you hear God saying when it all falls apart?The prosperity gospel popularized a Christian explanation for why some people make it and some do not. They revolutionized prayer as an instrument for getting God always to say \u201cyes.\u201d It offers people a guarantee: Follow these rules, and God will reward you, heal you, restore you. It\u2019s also distressingly similar to the popular cartoon emojis for the iPhone, the ones that show you images of yourself in various poses. One of the standard cartoons shows me holding a #blessed sign. My world is conspiring to make me believe that I am special, that I am the exception whose character will save me from the grisly predictions and the CT scans in my inbox. I am blessed.The prosperity gospel holds to this illusion of control until the very end. If a believer gets sick and dies, shame compounds the grief. Those who are loved and lost are just that \u2014 those who have lost the test of faith. In my work, I have heard countless stories of refusing to acknowledge that the end had finally come. An emaciated man was pushed about a megachurch in a wheelchair as churchgoers declared that he was already healed. A woman danced around her sister\u2019s deathbed shouting to horrified family members that the body can yet live. There is no graceful death, no ars moriendi, in the prosperity gospel. There are only jarring disappointments after fevered attempts to deny its inevitability.CANCER has kicked down the walls of my life. I cannot be certain I will walk my son to his elementary school someday or subject his love interests to cheerful scrutiny. I struggle to buy books for academic projects I fear I can\u2019t finish for a perfect job I may be unable to keep. I have surrendered my favorite manifestoes about having it all, managing work-life balance and maximizing my potential. I cannot help but remind my best friend that if my husband remarries everyone will need to simmer down on talking about how special I was in front of her. (And then I go on and on about how this is an impossible task given my many delightful qualities. Let\u2019s list them. \u2026) Cancer requires that I stumble around in the debris of dreams I thought I was entitled to and plans I didn\u2019t realize I had made.I am well aware that news of my cancer will be seen by many in the prosperity community as proof of something. I have heard enough sermons about those who \u201cspeak against God\u2019s anointed\u201d to know that it is inevitable, despite the fact that the book I wrote about them is very gentle. I understand. Most everyone likes to poke fun at the prosperity gospel, and I\u2019m not always immune. No word of a lie: I once saw a megachurch pastor almost choke to death on his own fog machine. Someone had cranked it up to the Holy Spirit maximum.But mostly I find the daily lives of its believers remarkable and, often, inspirational. They face the impossible and demand that God make a way. They refuse to accept crippling debt as insurmountable. They stubbornly get out of their hospital beds and declare themselves healed, and every now and then, it works.This is surely an American God, and as I am so far from home, I cannot escape him.Advertisement"}

Witness the popularity of Bernie Sanders, the socialist running neck and neck in the opinion polls with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Monday. To rehabilitate the system of free enterprise, it needs to be buttressed by a modern conception of fairness.Viewed from Mars, capitalism has been a huge success. Free enterprise has generated wealth and removed hundreds of millions of people from poverty. But viewed from Earth, what often stands out is how many have been left behind by the march of globalization and technology, while others have gotten ahead by methods more foul than fair.The classic left-wing response to the perceived unfairness of capitalism has been to tax and spend. That doesn\u2019t work well. High taxes can sap entrepreneurial spirit, while high welfare spending can leave poorer people dependent on handouts.Just because that response has been tried and failed doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be tried again. The success of left-wing populists like the Syriza party in Greece and the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party in Britain shows that such ideas still have appeal.This makes it important for centrists \u2014 whether they consider themselves left-wing progressives, radical centrists or liberal conservatives \u2014 to articulate a credible middle road. It should be based less on the view that fairness is the same as equality and more on the idea that people should get a fair crack at a good standard of life.There are two main aspects. First, it is important to tackle the foul methods by which people and companies get ahead and that make it tougher for hard-working, honest people to make progress.One example of this is evading or avoiding tax. This is rife in some countries, like Greece. But it is a global problem that makes people furious everywhere. Witness the anger in January in Britain over how Google, the Internet giant, was seemingly able to run rings around the authorities and pay what looks like a tiny amount of tax.Corruption, which is again widespread across the world, also creates indignation. Sweetheart deals between politicians and business line the pockets of the few to the detriment of the many.Another justified target of ire is the existence of markets that favor insiders at the expense of the general public. Finance is at the top of the list. The global financial crisis exposed how many bankers had a one-way bet: During the good times, they raked it in; during the bad, the state picked up the pieces. This was a mockery of how capitalism is supposed to work.Monopolies and vested interests are yet another source of resentment. Sometimes, the culprits are the oligarchs who pull the strings in government to get the rules written in their favor by giving bribes to politicians or senior officials.But often the beneficiaries of vested interests are not particularly rich or powerful as individuals. Greece is one of the best examples of this phenomenon. Over decades, it perfected the art of doling out special privileges to such an array of groups \u2014 farmers, notaries, pharmacists, civil servants, teachers and ordinary retirees as well as shipping magnates \u2014 that its economy gummed up.Such practices sap entrepreneurial spirit, but they do so by locking people out of opportunity rather than by using the methods of old-fashioned socialism. They also inflict bigger taxes on honest citizens and higher prices on consumers.A modern conception of fairness would put an assault of foul methods at its heart. But it would do more than that.Although successful societies need welfare states, most of Europe\u2019s welfare states need refocusing. Part of the problem is that too much government spending is directed to what Europeans call the middle class rather than the needy.The situation varies from country to country, but the main goodies are generous state pensions for middle-to-high earners and tax breaks that benefit relatively well-off people. To be fair, some countries are reining these in. For example, Britain no longer offers such attractive incentives for rich people to save for their retirement. But in many countries, there is a lot that could be done.The money saved from funding this middle-class welfare state could be redeployed where it is needed. The priority would often be to invest in schools, so children get a fair start in life, and in adult education, so that older people whose skills become obsolete as a result of technology can retrain.Such a conception of fairness is not really new. It has a lot in common with classic liberalism. Nor is it dead. Successful politicians around the world \u2014 like Narendra Modi of India with his fight against corruption or Matteo Renzi of Italy with his willingness to confront some vested interests \u2014 are deploying some strategies from this playbook.It is a rich source of ideas with which to tackle the unfairness of capitalism without falling for the inefficiency of socialism.Hugo Dixon writes a biweekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Wellness App Aims to Improve Workplace Nutrition", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byA growing number of companies are offering their employees digital tools to help improve their eating habits in hopes of increasing productivity, reducing sick days and cutting health care costs.With an app and a website, Zipongo, a small digital start-up, is aimed at helping employees navigate a company\u2019s cafeteria menu to find choices that best meet a set of preferences and health goals set by the workers themselves.But Zipongo also extends its reach to takeout meals and the home kitchen, offering recipes, shopping lists and discounts on grocery items like fruits and vegetables.Since it made its debut in 2011, Zipongo has connected with some 125 companies to let employees try it, although none have made it mandatory.While Google was an early adopter a few years ago, IBM was among the most recent and began offering Zipongo to its tens of thousands of United States employees in January. Like other companies, IBM has long worked to steer its employees to healthier eating, even using a \u201ctraffic light\u201d system to indicate which cafeteria foods might be good choices. In 2007, the company offered a $150 cash rebate for IBM families recording their healthier eating habits in a confidential online system for eight weeks.\u201cWe strongly believe eating healthy is a social endeavor, both at work and at home,\u201d said Dr. Kyu Rhee, chief health officer at IBM. \u201cIt makes no sense if you eat healthy at the office and then eat badly at home.\u201dJason Langheier, the founder of Zipongo, noted that the National Center for Health Statistics had estimated that the average cost of a nutrition counseling session was $73.\u201cI thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a useful set of digital tools first,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Langheier said.Zipongo is a private company. It has raised roughly $10 million in financing since its start in 2011, including a $5 million investment by Excel Venture Management in late 2014, according to CrunchBase. It currently is raising more money.On average, Zipongo charges employers a little more than $50 a year per employee for a complete set of its services, Dr. Langheier said.Zipongo and other digital start-ups offering such wellness apps to employers and employees continue to raise concerns among health advocates as to whether these types of tools pose problems for protecting employee privacy.\u201cAre they going to share your information with restaurants in your neighborhood? Grocery stores?\u201d Ms. Pollitz asked. \u201cThe privacy statement is, like most privacy statements, very broad and permissive.\u201dDr. Langheier said his company did not collect any biometric information via its free system. Employees of companies that pay for the system can load it with various biometrics and tie their grocery loyalty cards to it. He said that Zipongo did not sell any information on its users to advertisers and that any data shared with employers for the purposes of analyzing the service was anonymized.Employers have long been trying to find ways to get their employees to eat better, said Michael O\u2019Donnell, director of the Health Management Research Center at the University of Michigan. \u201cNutrition has been one of the challenges in our field,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIn workplace programs, the same as in national health education programs, it\u2019s been very difficult to get people to eat more fruits and vegetables.\u201dAt Google, which has promoted healthy eating for several years, employees have been using Zipongo since 2013.\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is start saying what people can and can\u2019t eat,\u201d said Michiel Bakker, director of global food services at Google. \u201cBut we do think we can help our employees make food choices that are better for them as an individual.\u201dAbout half of Google employees who signed up for Zipongo used the app at least once a month in 2014, according to a Harvard Business School case study. (One of the study\u2019s authors is an investor in Zipongo.)Users plug in their food preferences \u2014 spicy, gluten-free, protein-rich \u2014 and, if they want, biometric data like cholesterol and blood pressure levels. Zipongo then creates a menu from the choices in Google\u2019s cafeteria.Google employees using Zipongo ate more fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, calcium, fish and fiber-rich foods. Google also saw a dip in red meat consumption among its Zipongo users, which was one of its goals.\u201cWe tried Meatless Monday, but it was very difficult to make that work,\u201d Mr. Bakker said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t respond well if we say, \u2018Eat more of this and less of that,\u2019 but they\u2019re open to suggestions about better food choices like Zipongo provides.\u201dBut Dr. Langheier, who has a degree in public health as well as a medical degree, said he did not invent Zipongo to reach only high-paid workers at tech companies like Google and IBM. Inspiration for the system came from work he did as a pro bono consultant where he first realized the obstacles doctors faced in offering diet advice to overweight patients.\u201cWe spend $8,500 a year in the U.S., on average, for health care for one person, and just $2,200 on food, yet we rank 35th globally for life expectancy,\u201d Dr. Langheier said. \u201cIn Japan, they spend about $3,200 on health care and $3,300 on food \u2014 and they rank second for life expectancy.\u201dAn article on Monday about Zipongo, a start-up aimed at helping companies improve the eating habits of their employees, transposed the numbers in a quotation from Jason Langheier, Zipongo\u2019s founder. He said that Japan spends about $3,200 per person on health care and $3,300 on food, not the reverse. Because of editing errors, the article also misstated the number of IBM employees who can use Zipongo and the year that Google introduced the service. IBM offers the service to tens of thousands of American employees, not to 10,000 workers worldwide, and Google started using Zipongo in 2013, not 2011.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Unicorn", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital.For a moment, there was no more prestigious endorsement for a technology start-up than joining the so-called Unicorn Club, consisting of more than 150 private technology companies valued at a billion dollars or more. Now, with valuations deflating, it\u2019s often viewed as more of a scarlet letter.However, because the only membership criterion is valuation, the members of this club have about as much in common with each other as a gram of gold has with a barrel of oil.Some private market valuations got ahead of themselves, requiring adjustment. But that\u2019s hardly remarkable; this happens frequently in public markets, too. The issue is that many unicorns are not sustainable; they have a shiny veneer of revenue growth, without a sufficiently durable competitive advantage to create substantial, long-term value.Several well-known Internet companies, particularly the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now a unit of Alphabet \u2014 have built powerful positions. The market recognized this by adding more than $250 billion in market cap to this group over the last 12 months \u2014 even while the broader market was down more than 10 percent.The huge success of the FANG stocks, however, distracts from the reality that the web has ground down the barriers to entry in many technology markets, increasing transparency and competition. For new entrants, lower barriers create opportunity. But they create the same chance for scores of other start-ups, too, making it challenging to build a durable advantage.Just when a firm seems to be getting a dominant foothold, a plethora of start-ups emerge to erode its advantage. Less than a year ago, GrubHub had a market cap of more than $4 billion and seemed to be on the way to a powerful monopoly in food delivery. But myriad start-ups, backed by billions of dollars, have been competing for its market. Investors no longer see GrubHub as a putative monopoly. Accordingly, its stock is down more than 60 percent over the last year.There are limited sources of genuine competitive advantage in Silicon Valley, as with other businesses. Most significant are economies of scale. McDonald\u2019s buys ingredients more cheaply than a stand-alone burger joint, and its marketing costs are spread across tens of millions of customers.For technology companies, the holy grail is a specially durable subset of scale advantage: network effects, virtually unknown in the rest of the economy. The most potent flavor is on the consumer side, where a service\u2019s utility increases as more people use it. That creates a powerful barrier: If one\u2019s friends and family are all on Facebook, an alternative social network, even with superior features, is unlikely to be tempting \u2014 which is why Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users each month, and rising. A Big Mac, in contrast, does not taste any better even with millions of simultaneous consumers.In Silicon Valley, virtually every pitch deck claims network effects \u2014 but they are rarely spotted in the wild. The largest on-demand home cleaning service in any locale may have a cost and speed advantage versus competitors, which helps attract more consumers and more cleaning people.But this virtuous cycle, despite the common misconception, is just a garden variety impact of local scale \u2014 not network effects. A large customer base does not make any service even a smidgen more valuable to someone getting their home cleaned. For a small discount, customers will happily try an alternative cleaning service, on-demand car valet or flash sale. Monopolies in these categories, like most others, are unlikely. In contrast, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it would take to pry Snapchat out of a teenager\u2019s hands \u2014 but it sure wouldn\u2019t be a cheap coupon.It\u2019s not just start-ups that find it hard to build a monopoly. Even in the rarefied air of the FANG stocks, monopolies are hard to come by.Amazon is a powerhouse with substantial scale advantages \u2014 its latest quarterly revenue was $36 billion, and it has increasing customer loyalty, including more than 50 million paying Prime subscribers. But Amazon is far from a monopoly. In retail, beyond a few narrow categories where it dominates (notably: books), Amazon is a leading player in intensely competitive markets. In cloud computing, its innovative Amazon Web Services is the leading player serving start-up customers and is making inroads with enterprises. But it does not have the cloud to itself. It is locked in ferocious competition with Microsoft, Google and several others. Unsurprisingly, in the decade since its debut, the service has cut prices more than 50 times.Similarly, Netflix is the leading subscription video distributor. It has more than 75 million subscribers and is producing hundreds of hours of original content. Netflix has scale advantages and strong customer captivity, but zero network effects; it does not become more entertaining with more subscribers. It is well placed to create enormous value as a long-term leader in this market but is far from a monopoly. It\u2019s too late for start-ups to enter the fray, but there are already formidable competitors, such as HBO and Amazon, driving up content acquisition costs and keeping a lid on consumer prices. Netflix is already on track to spend more than $5 billion on content this year \u2014 more than half its forecast revenue. And other deep-pocketed players, such as YouTube and Apple, have adjacent businesses that are strong enough to be potentially serious future players as well.That Silicon Valley is not all bulletproof billion-dollar companies and \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets is no cause for gloom. The current environment is a reminder of the primacy of business economics and market structure. At least for the moment, investors will revert to saving billion-dollar valuations for exceptionally defensible, growing businesses. That closes the chapter on the ill-fated unicorn experiment, which valued growth at any cost. Hopefully, it also spells the end of the term itself \u2014 which predictably turned out to be as useless a descriptor on the way down as it was on the way up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Livin\u2019 Bernie Sanders\u2019s Danish Dream", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAmerican capitalism has always been distinct from continental European capitalism. We\u2019ve had more entrepreneurial creativity but less security. Our system has favored higher living standards for consumers while theirs has favored stability for employees and producers.For the past several decades, the United States has had a bipartisan consensus that we should stick to our style of capitalism and our style of welfare state. There has always been a broad consensus that a continent-size nation like ours had to be diverse and decentralized, with a vibrant charitable sector and a great variety of spending patterns and lifestyles.American values have always been biased toward individualism, achievement and flexibility \u2014 nurturing disruptive dynamos like Bell Labs, Walmart, Whole Foods, Google and Apple \u2014 and less toward dirigisme, order and economic equality.First, Sanders would centralize power in Washington. If you radically increase the amount of money going to the Washington establishment, as Sanders would, you\u2019re giving that establishment greater resources to control American life.Second, Sanders would weaken the ability of members of the middle class to make choices about their own lives. He would raise taxes on the rich, but there is only so much money you can squeeze out of such a small group of people. European welfare states generally rely on a highly regressive value-added/sales tax \u2014 usually around 20 to 25 percent.Middle classes across Europe bear a much higher tax load than the American middle class. As Austan Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to President Obama, has noted, you really can\u2019t have a Swedish-style welfare state without a broad high tax burden. That means less spending power for most Americans, and fewer resources to choose one\u2019s own lifestyle.It\u2019s possible that entrepreneurs, company founders and others would pay these rates without changing their behavior, but I wouldn\u2019t count on it. When you make risk-taking less rewarding, you get fewer risk-takers, which is exactly what you see across the Atlantic. When you raise taxes that high, the Elon Musks of the world find other places to build their companies.Fourth, Sanders would Europeanize American public universities. It sounds great to make college free. In fact, it\u2019s a hugely expensive program that would mostly benefit the already affluent.There\u2019s nothing wrong with living in northern Europe. I\u2019ve lived there myself. It\u2019s just not the homeland we\u2019ve always known. Bernie Sanders\u2019s America is starkly different from Alexander Hamilton\u2019s or Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s America or even Bill Clinton\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s America.It\u2019s amazing that so many young people want to mimic a continent that has been sluggish for decades. It\u2019s amazing that so many look to the future and want a country that would be a lot less vibrant.Advertisement"}
