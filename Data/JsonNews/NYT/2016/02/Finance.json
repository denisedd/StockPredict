{"Headline": "Audit Faults New York City for Not Using Vacant Lots for Affordable Housing", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byNew York City\u2019s scarcity of inexpensive land is often cited as an impediment to building more affordable housing, but the comptroller\u2019s office has identified more than 1,000 city-owned vacant lots across the boroughs that have been sitting idle, most for more than 30 years.The city-owned properties, mostly clustered in Brooklyn and Queens, are remnants of the thousands of abandoned lots and buildings the city seized after the fiscal crisis of the 1970s. City officials say many of the leftover properties have been hard to develop because they need basic infrastructure such as road access and sewer lines, require too much subsidy or, after Hurricane Sandy, no longer meet resiliency concerns.Calling the comptroller\u2019s conclusions \u201cfalse and misleading,\u201d housing officials said that out of the 1,131 vacant properties identified in the audit, about 310 were in flood zones or had other issues that would make development challenging. They also said that an additional 150 properties were better suited for projects other than residential buildings, such as parks and police stations.Of the remaining 670 lots, about 400 have already been assigned to developers or will be scheduled for development within the next two years, the officials said.\u201cThe assertion that H.P.D. allows vacant city-owned properties to languish in the face of the affordable housing crisis is simply wrong,\u201d Vicki Been, the housing commissioner, said in a statement.The properties have brought blight to some neighborhoods. At a large vacant property in Brownsville, Brooklyn, a sign affixed to a chain-link fence by the housing department says \u201cNo Dumping\u201d and threatens fines, but heaps of garbage \u2014 including bags, empty alcohol bottles, cans and, oddly, a broken violin and violin case \u2014 have rendered the warning useless.Residents complain that the lot has been that way for decades. They say that the city cuts the grass and clears the debris occasionally, but that it all quickly accumulates anew.\u201cThey clearly don\u2019t want any development or infrastructure around here,\u201d Christal Benjamin, 26, a medical-school student who has lived in the neighborhood for two years, said on Wednesday. She said she would like to see the land used for a park or a community center.Another resident, Lorenzo McGriff, 46, who works in human services at a center for people with mental health and addiction issues, said he dreamed of turning the lot into a development with housing for the homeless, affordable apartments for those with low-income jobs, a community center, a pool and social service programs.\u201cA vacant lot this huge in Brooklyn is a rarity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sends a signal that people don\u2019t care about us.\u201d (City officials said this was among the lots targeted for development within the next two years.)But Mr. Stringer, calling the properties \u201cgolden assets\u201d at a time of great need for affordable housing, said that history did not inspire confidence.\u201cYou had 30 or 40 years to figure out how to build a road?\u201d the comptroller, a Democrat, said. \u201cThis is generations of inaction.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s got to be part of our housing agenda in the city,\u201d Mr. Stringer said.The new model could bring the city new money for affordable housing by tapping into a multimillion-dollar fund in the state attorney general\u2019s office that is dedicated to financing land-bank acquisitions of vacant, abandoned or foreclosed properties.For city-owned properties, Mr. Stringer said the city could transfer ownership to the land bank, which in turn would lease the land rather than sell it to retain control and ensure that permanently affordable housing would be built in every case.Still, Eric Enderlin, the housing department\u2019s deputy commissioner for development, said that for some of the vacant parcels, a land bank would face the same challenges of location that the city faces now.\u201cThese challenges don\u2019t respond to who owns them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to be addressed on their own. We believe we\u2019re doing everything that was requested in his report.\u201dThe audit recommends that the city develop realistic timetables for transferring properties and then track the transfers, documenting every change along the way. The audit also recommends reviewing an additional 340 vacant lots under the jurisdiction of other city agencies that could be used for residential construction.Marcus Johnson, 34, could not remember the land as anything but vacant, but hoped to see that change.\u201cThey could turn it into anything \u2014 housing, gardens, a community center \u2014 anything but an empty space,\u201d Mr. Johnson, a tax consultant who lives near the lots, said. \u201cWho exactly is this helping?\u201dNoah Remnick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Rare Appearance, China\u2019s Central Bank Chief Says All Is Well", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 For the second time since last summer, an avuncular, graying man has stepped out of Beijing\u2019s shadows and calmed financial markets after a Chinese devaluation \u2014 but once again, his assurances came after nearly a month of turmoil and growing worry about the country\u2019s economic health.Mixing folksy charm with deft explanations of economic thought, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China\u2019s central bank, held a rare news conference in Shanghai on Friday morning, as finance officials from around the world gathered for the Group of 20 major economies meeting. Mr. Zhou acknowledged worries about spiraling debt at Chinese corporations and local governments but offered reasons why the Chinese economy might be uniquely able to deal with it for the time being.He also dismissed American hedge funds\u2019 concerns about the erosion of China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves and assured the audience that China did not plan to further devalue its currency to increase its already formidable export prowess.China\u2019s supply of foreign exchange reserves \u201cis not an oil field with a static stock of oil. It is like water in a reservoir, so there are constant flows in and flows out,\u201d he said.Following Mr. Zhou\u2019s remarks, the Shanghai stock market rebounded 1 percent on Friday, on the heels of a 6.4 percent plunge on Thursday. The value of the renminbi also steadied on Friday in largely unregulated trading in Hong Kong, although it still dipped slightly against the dollar for the day.What Mr. Zhou did not do on Friday, however, was provide any indication of when he might next offer an explanation of Chinese monetary policy. He also did not announce any plans for the People\u2019s Bank of China to follow other leading central banks \u2014 like the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan \u2014 in holding regular news briefings after important policy decisions.\u201cIt is very clear that he still does not want to talk too much about policy; he wants to leave it a bit uncertain,\u201d said Zhou Hao, the Asia economist for Commerzbank, who is not related to Zhou Xiaochuan. \u201cFrom China\u2019s perspective, if it\u2019s too transparent, then people will expect too much of you.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In contrast with the central banks of other major economies, China\u2019s central bank is to some extent an advisory body instead of an independent, decision-making institution. The final say on major economic decisions, like interest rate moves or devaluations, belongs to the country\u2019s political leadership.On both occasions, Mr. Zhou said fairly little until the next meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors a month later. The last ministerial meeting was in September in Ankara, Turkey; China holds the group\u2019s presidency this year and chose Shanghai for the gathering on Friday night and Saturday.United States Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew added his voice late Friday afternoon to those calling for China to explain policy changes.\u201cThe exchange rate policy is one in particular that needs to be clearly communicated, and it\u2019s important that as they make their transitions, that they do it in an orderly way,\u201d he told a small group of reporters in Shanghai before a meeting with other finance ministers.Although Mr. Zhou spoke for more than an hour at his news conference on Friday morning in a large, tastefully decorated hall on the fourth floor of the central bank\u2019s Shanghai branch office, he said virtually nothing that would limit the political leadership\u2019s options. He did not, for instance, categorically rule out another decline in the renminbi at some point against the dollar.When one question suggested the renminbi was pegged to a basket of other currencies, Mr. Zhou quickly objected. He said instead that the value of the renminbi would be set \u201cwith reference\u201d to a basket of other currencies \u2014 essentially a weighted average. He preserved even more flexibility for China\u2019s leadership by emphasizing that the renminbi would not be measured against just one basket, but against several.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.Mr. Zhou decisively ruled out a depreciation for the purpose of trade advantage, but did not address whether the currency might someday rise or fall for other reasons.\u201cWe will not resort to competitive depreciation so as to boost our advantage in exports,\u201d he said.Mr. Zhou hinted at another Chinese policy effort to strengthen economic growth when he talked about there being room for banks to lend more money for mortgages. Although companies and local governments are heavily in debt, Chinese households generally are not, he noted.The People\u2019s Bank of China recently cut the regulatory minimum for down payments on mortgages to 20 percent of a home\u2019s value, from 30 percent.Mr. Zhou also offered explanations why foreign investors were wrong to worry about China\u2019s rising overall levels of credit, relative to economic output. China has a far higher savings rate than most other economies, so banks have a lot in deposits to lend, he said.China\u2019s stock markets are somewhat small, compared with the size of its economy, forcing companies that need money to rely more on bank loans and bonds, he added. And because China was poor until very recently, many families have not had enough time to accumulate the wealth to start businesses just with their own savings.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a lot of accumulation,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to borrow.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Donald Trump in New York: Deep Roots, but Little Influence", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byBut while Trump remains a visible brand name around the city\u2019s five boroughs, it is much harder to discern his imprint as a classic power broker, someone who is feared and can make things happen with a phone call or a quiet aside with the right person at the right time.Though he portrays himself as a major developer, his companies\u2019 highest profile ownership stakes in real estate in New York include an office building on Wall Street; part of another on Avenue of the Americas; commercial space at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, where he lives; and parking below the Trump Plaza on East 61st Street.\u201cIt\u2019s a very successful garage,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.Mr. Trump\u2019s operation also runs Wollman Rink and the carousel in Central Park, through contracts with the city\u2019s parks department.The major banks, for their part, say they are leery of lending to him after having lost millions of dollars on past deals. Lawyers and contractors he has hired in the past say he is slow to pay his bills, and often shortchanges them. Even the few Wall Street executives who say privately that he is a friend are loath to speak publicly about him.Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has been a central figure in local politics for years, does not recall ever meeting Mr. Trump. Mr. de Blasio \u2014 who supports a fellow Democrat, Hillary Clinton, for president \u2014 noted that one reason some might think Mr. Trump is a major player in New York is he arguably once was.\u201cI think in the 1980s, for example, some of his developments were controversial and got a lot of attention and he was more in the center of things in this city,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut at this point I don\u2019t see a lot of influence from Trump in New York City. You see his name on buildings, but you don\u2019t see him.\u201dMr. Trump once received favorable treatment from the city\u2019s tabloid newspapers, personally calling in stories that landed on the front page. But as he stokes populist outrage in the Republican presidential primaries, The Daily News, in particular, has served up headlines like \u201cDawn of the Brain Dead\u201d and \u201cAnti Christ!\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s evanescence at home stands in stark contrast to his image around the country and the world, thanks to his celebrity as a reality television star, and through the hotels and golf courses that bear his name.For his part, Mr. Trump does not disagree that he is less of a New York mover-and-shaker than he once was. He says he does not need anything from Wall Street or the traditional corridors of power and argues his diminished footprint in New York is balanced by his broadening reach. And he has branched out beyond the city, in name at least, licensing \u201cTrump\u201d on hotels and endeavors including a brand of vodka and energy drinks in Israel and a winery in Virginia.\u201cI\u2019m less focused on New York now,\u201d he said. \u201cI started going international and national, which is what we are doing now, and then I did the presidential thing, so that to me is cooler than all of it.\u201dA New York Times review of records of his 500 or so companies, released in July by the Federal Election Commission, highlights just how little of his business empire is now related to anything in the city. Among his many interests elsewhere are the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., golf courses in Scotland and Ireland, and an office building in downtown San Francisco. Many of the other entities were set up to hold specific trademarks with the Trump name; others were either inactive or connected to his family\u2019s holdings from the 1960s.It was not always so.Mr. Trump, and entities affiliated with him, used to reliably donate to local Democrats and Republicans in New York \u2014 more than $700,000 to state candidates and $140,000 to city candidates since 1980, records indicate.He actively supported aspiring or incumbent comptrollers \u2014 an office that approves city contracts and acts as a fiscal watchdog \u2014 giving more than $23,000 to Harrison J. Goldin, $9,000 to Alan G. Hevesi, and $8,000 to Elizabeth Holtzman, between 1985 and 2000.However, Mr. Trump could appear na\u00efve about the mechanics of campaign finance. In 1996, eager to support Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s re-election bid as mayor, he enclosed two checks totaling $6,900 in a letter addressed to the Republican mayor and mailed to City Hall. The money was later returned, according to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s public archives.He has not been a force in state politics, either, as his brief flirtation with the 2014 race for governor illustrated.Bill Nojay, a Republican state assemblyman from the Rochester area, was an early supporter, but said there were not many others, in part because Mr. Trump had no base in the state and was not active in the party.Donald J. Trump wrote a letter to Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1996 with two checks totaling $6,900 to support the mayor in his re-election bid. The money was returned, according to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s public archives.The Trump name was once closely associated with the muscular Brooklyn Democratic machine that, in its heyday, catapulted numerous officials to City Hall and Albany.Mr. Trump\u2019s father, Fred C. Trump, established himself as a major developer of midrise apartment complexes for middle-class families, especially for World War II veterans, in Brooklyn, in Queens and on Staten Island.\u201cI was the king of approvals,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump would not provide a list of his properties, saying his company is privately held.Besides the legal battles, the way Mr. Trump has managed business relationships has been a source of friction.One contractor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being sued by Mr. Trump, said Mr. Trump underpaid on one large job, at one of his towers, by almost $100,000. The contractor opted not to sue, estimating the litigation would cost more than the losses. The two parties have not done business since.Lawyers who spoke to The Times had similar stories.Mr. Trump revels in his reputation, boasting about not paying some of his outstanding legal and construction bills. \u201cIf they do a bad job, they have to suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they overbill me or if they don\u2019t do a good job, I take plenty of time to pay them and I negotiate with them.\u201dRichard LeFrak, a billionaire real estate executive who is among Mr. Trump\u2019s closest friends, going back four decades, put a positive spin on Mr. Trump\u2019s local relationships. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t make political contributions because the industry does it,\u201d Mr. LeFrak said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t join industry associations because everyone does it.\u201dHe added, referring to the local trade groups, \u201cDonald is his own ABNY, his own Rebny \u2014 he\u2019s Donald.\u201dOne New York institution Mr. Trump has been forced to deal with is Wall Street. Here bank executives are cautious, citing his previous bankruptcies and his propensity for litigation.Fifteen companies with ties to Mr. Trump owe banks in excess of $270 million, according to his Federal Election Commission disclosures. The actual amount of debt is higher, however \u2014 the top range candidates are required to reveal is $50 million or above for any given loan.Deutsche Bank is one of his main lenders; his filings show JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are not currently lending to him.Mr. Trump says he has no need for banks.\u201cI don\u2019t use Wall Street much because I don\u2019t need money,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who said he is worth $11 billion and has $1 billion cash on hand. \u201cI do my own financing.\u201dBusiness executives and hedge fund managers who piece together multimillion-dollar deals say Mr. Trump is not on their radar.Mr. Trump does have one significant Wall Street power broker in his corner: Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire activist shareholder.\u201cI really think a lot of people have missed the fact that this country has real troubles and you need a completely fresh personality in the White House,\u201d he said.Mr. Icahn\u2019s says his pitch has not resonated. \u201cA lot of Wall Street guys don\u2019t like him,\u201d Mr. Icahn said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the brashness, maybe.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump is largely self-funded, he has raised almost $7.5 million from individual contributors, records with the Federal Election Commission show. Very little of it has come from Wall Street.At Goldman Sachs, employees have directly contributed since 2013 more than $94,000 to Mrs. Clinton and more than $199,000 to one of Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents in the Republican race, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, according to the commission.Records show just one Goldman employee, a financial adviser in the wealth management division, has donated to Mr. Trump \u2014 $534.58, to be precise.Mr. Thorburn declined to comment.Reporting was contributed by Alexander Burns, Steve Eder, Thomas Kaplan and Jeremy Merrill, and research by Susan C.

{"Headline": "A Blockbuster Deal Reassures the Art World", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byAs the art market braces for a difficult year ahead, along comes news of a $500 million private sale that creates a reassuring sense of business as usual.The buyer was the Chicago hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of Citadel, which manages more than $24 billion in assets, and the seller was the entertainment mogul David Geffen, owner of one of the world\u2019s most admired collections of postwar American art.Mr. Griffin was said to have paid $300 million for the de Kooning and $200 million for the 1948 Jackson Pollock drip painting \u201cNumber 17A\u201d in a transaction that was completed in the fall, Bloomberg News reported.Both works have been on loan to the Art Institute of Chicago since September.Mr. Griffin, 47, has a net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes. Katie Spring, his spokeswoman at Citadel, confirmed in an email that the two paintings had been bought for $500 million, but she declined to specify their individual prices.Mary Hoeveler, an art adviser in New York, said, \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual on a grand scale \u2014 the uber rich buying the most coveted works of art.\u201d\u201cRegardless of conditions, and sometimes because of them, the market always responds to once-in-a-lifetime opportunities,\u201d she added. \u201cMasterpieces are a safe haven for wealth.\u201dThe Griffin acquisition also has symbolic value. Back in 1989, \u201cInterchanged\u201d was bought by the Mountain Tortoise Gallery in Tokyo for a $20.7 million at auction, at the time the highest price for a contemporary work of art. But that was only about a quarter of the $82.5 million paid the next year for Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cPortrait of Dr. Gachet\u201d at the high-point of the late-1980s art boom. Now this monumental de Kooning abstract is deemed equal to, if not more valuable than, such Post-Impressionist masterpieces.Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser in New York, said: \u201cThat cycle ended and we have skipped on to the Abstract Expressionists. That is where the focus is right now. It\u2019s a natural evolution that comes with a younger generation of collector.\u201dMany in the United States revere de Kooning, Pollock and Rothko as the Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo of postwar modernism.Unfortunately for private collectors, virtually all the prime examples by these Abstract Expressionist masters are in, or promised to, museums.Dealers said \u201cNumber 17A\u201d was probably the last available large-scale Pollock from his most admired period, 1947 to 1950. The painting, which is three feet, eight inches wide, was one of three featured in a Life magazine article in August 1949 entitled, \u201cJackson Pollock: Is He the Greatest Living Painter in the United States?\u201dKilled in a car accident in 1956, Pollock might now seem to be regarded as the country\u2019s greatest dead painter. In 2011, the San Francisco collectors Harry W. and Mary Margaret Anderson bequeathed Pollock\u2019s majestic drip painting \u201cLucifer,\u201d dating from 1947, to the Anderson Collection at Stanford University. Dealers now value that work at as much as $500 million.With museum-quality Pollocks rare on the market, collectors returned to the realities of the mainstream art trade on Wednesday at the ARCOmadrid fair in Spain. The event, now in its 35th year, is one of a group of what might be called second-tier contemporary art fairs, with price levels that can be more accessible to many collectors than those being asked by the megagalleries at Art Basel, Frieze or FIAC.But this is a crowded marketplace. Art Cologne in Germany, Artissima in Turin, The Armory Show in New York, Art Brussels in Belgium, viennacontemporary in Austria and ARCOmadrid are all vying for a similar audience of wealthy, but not necessarily extremely wealthy, clients. All need to come up with something distinctive to persuade serious exhibitors and collectors to participate, particularly at a time of economic uncertainty.One way of doing that is to pay for them. ARCOmadrid is organized by a consortium of local municipal bodies in the Spanish capital that this year allocated the fair a budget of 4.5 million euros, about $5 million. The fair was thus able to finance visits from about 400 collectors, curators and \u201cinternational influencers,\u201d and offer moderately priced or even free booths to exhibitors.The Paris dealer Chantal Crousel, who exhibited at the first edition of ARCO in 1982, was one of 33 galleries allotted free spaces to present works by two of their artists, selected by the fair\u2019s curators to celebrate the 35th anniversary.\u201cThe fair has become a lot more open and international,\u201d said Ms. Crousel, who was showing Mona Hatoum and Danh Vo. \u201cThe city\u2019s museums give a point of reference, and people from abroad love to come to Madrid.\u201dWorks by Mr. Vo, a Vietnamese-born Danish artist who represented Denmark at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale, continue to be on collectors\u2019 shopping lists. One of his 2011-2014 \u201cWe the People\u201d copper sculptures, derived from a drapery section of the Statue of Liberty, sold at ARCO\u2019s Wednesday preview for \u20ac174,000 to a Spanish client and a gold-painted Corona beer cardboard-box sculpture was bought by a Belgian for \u20ac70,000.The fair, held as usual in the Feria de Madrid exhibition center on the outskirts of the city, featured 221 galleries from 27 countries and was expected to have attracted 100,000 visitors by the time it closed on Sunday.Most galleries in the main body of the fair, even if they were not from Spain, featured works by Spanish-speaking artists. Lisson Gallery of London, for example, sold two brightly colored 2010 fabric sculptures by the Spanish artist Angela de la Cruz, priced between 20,000 and 50,000 pounds, or $27,000 and $69,700.Sales were sporadic, though, and there was a conspicuous lack of urgency in the way that visitors browsed on preview day. There was, however, plenty of commercial action at the booth of the Berlin gallery Crone, which was showing works by young Cuban artists.Notable for their technical innovation and political engagement \u2014 and for 20 sales at the preview on Wednesday to a range of international buyers \u2014 the Crone sales included 18 drawings made by Kelvin L\u00f3pez, using a fake official rubber stamp, of houses appropriated by the former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Ten of these \u201cThis Is Your House Fidel\u201d drawings sold for \u20ac800 each. Two of Rachel Vald\u00e9s\u2019s mirror installations, \u201cInfinite Composition,\u201d from an edition of five, have respectively sold to a German collector and the Cuban state for \u20ac100,000 each. Ms. Vald\u00e9s, who, like Mr. L\u00f3pez, lives in Havana, is just 25.\u201cWith the opening up of Cuba, collectors are looking for opportunities,\u201d said the New York adviser Erica Barrish, who was one of the fair\u2019s 400 invited guests. \u201cThey\u2019re always looking to new regions. Something similar happened in China.\u201dThese transactions might seem small in light of the money that has been paid for those works by the two Abstract Expressionist painters. But they do show that there is still some life left in the market for contemporary art.An earlier version of this article misidentified the gallery at Stanford University to which a different Pollock work, \u201cLucifer,\u201d was bequeathed. It was the Anderson Collection at Stanford University, not the Stanford University art gallery. The article also gave an incorrect date for the bequest. It was in 2011, not 2014.Advertisement"}

Nobody stands above the law.\u201dIsraeli television broadcast live coverage of Mr. Olmert\u2019s arrival at Maasiyahu Prison, southeast of Tel Aviv. According to prison regulations, he was permitted, like other prisoners, to take with him four pairs of underwear, four pairs of socks, two towels, bedding and toiletries, among other items.Mr. Olmert\u2019s legal troubles began in 2008, two years after he took office, and he was forced to resign under a growing cloud of suspicion and police investigations. He was convicted of taking bribes while he was mayor of Jerusalem, in part to facilitate the construction of a large housing complex known as Holyland, despite fierce local opposition.Last week, a Jerusalem magistrate\u2019s court extended Mr. Olmert\u2019s sentence by a month after rejecting the terms of a plea bargain in an obstruction-of-justice case.Mr. Olmert emphasized in his statement that none of the charges pertained to his time as prime minister, and he appealed to Israelis not to forget his efforts at peacemaking and his service to the country.As prime minister, Mr. Olmert held extensive peace negotiations with the Palestinians and indirect talks with Syria, through Turkish mediators. He hinted darkly in his videotaped statement on Monday that his conviction, which he described as a result of a \u201clegal snowball,\u201d grew out of something more than legal considerations.\u201cPerhaps with more distance, the public will be able to examine this dire moment with a critical and balanced outlook,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that then they will recognize that during my tenure as prime minister, honest and promising steps were taken to open a door of hope for a better future of peace, happiness and security.\u201dThe prison authorities will now be responsible for the security of a prisoner who was privy to state secrets.Mr. Olmert will be held in Wing 10 of Maasiyahu Prison, a section that many Israelis refer to as the V.I.P. wing. The Israeli Prison Service said that renovations of the wing had been completed in recent days and that four other prisoners had already been transferred there. For Mr. Olmert\u2019s protection, all residents of Wing 10 are to be vetted.Several people who have been convicted in the Holyland case are expected to join him there.The wing has six cells, each with three beds, a shower and toilet, a cupboard, a table and chairs, and a television set. It also has its own library, yard and dining room, as well as telephones in the corridor.Shlomo Benizri, a former minister of health and social welfare minister who was released from prison in 2012 after serving about two and a half years for charges that included accepting bribes, offered Mr. Olmert some advice about how to get by in prison.\u201cWhen you are there, it\u2019s \u2018My name is Ehud Olmert, I\u2019m not the prime minister, not the mayor, not a minister, nothing,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Benizri told Israel Radio. He warned Mr. Olmert not to patronize the guards, who he said were \u201cnot sentimental about ministers.\u201dMr. Olmert, whose sentence can be reduced by one-third for good behavior, should keep things in perspective, Mr. Benizri added.\u201cIt passes. After a quarter of the time, he will get furlough,\u201d he said, noting that Mr. Olmert has a supportive family. \u201cThere are people without families, they don\u2019t even have someone to call.\u201dHe added, \u201cBy the way, he can use the phone all day there.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of an American businessman.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Il Duce Routine", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Europe, the soil on which Fascism took root, is watching the rise of Donald Trump with dismay. Contempt for the excesses of America is a European reflex, but when the United States seems tempted by a latter-day Mussolini, smugness in London, Paris and Berlin gives way to alarm. Europe knows that democracies can collapse.It\u2019s not just that Trump retweets to his six million followers a quote attributed to Mussolini: \u201cIt is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.\u201d It\u2019s not just that Trump refuses to condemn David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, who has expressed support for him. It\u2019s not just that violence is woven into Trump\u2019s language as indelibly as the snarl woven into his features \u2014 the talk of shooting somebody or punching a protester in the face, the insulting of the disabled, the macho mockery of women, the anti-Muslim and anti-Mexican tirades. It\u2019s not just that he could become Silvio Berlusconi with nukes.It\u2019s the echoes, now unmistakable, of times when the skies darkened. Europe knows how democracies collapse, after lost wars, in times of fear and anger and economic hardship, when the pouting demagogue appears with his pageantry and promises. America\u2019s Weimar-lite democratic dysfunction is plain to see. A corrupted polity tends toward collapse.Trump is telling people something is rotten in the state of America. The message resonates because the rot is there.He has emerged from a political system corrupted by money, locked in an echo chamber of insults, reduced to the show business of an endless campaign, blocked by a kind of partisanship run amok that leads Republican members of Congress to declare they will not meet with President Obama\u2019s eventual nominee for the Supreme Court, let alone listen to him or her. This is an outrage! The public interest has become less than an afterthought.Trump is a man repeatedly underestimated by the very elites who made Trumpism possible. He\u2019s smarter than most of his belittlers, and quicker on his feet, which makes him only more dangerous.He\u2019s the anti-Obama, all theater where the president is all prudence, the mouth-that-spews to the presidential teleprompter, rage against reason, the backslapper against the maestro of aloofness, the rabble-rouser to the cerebral law professor, the deal maker to the diligent observer. If Obama in another life could have been a successful European social democrat, Trump is only and absolutely of America.Part of the Trump danger is that he\u2019s captured an American irredentism, a desire to reclaim something \u2014 power, confidence, rising incomes \u2014 that many people feel is lost. Trump is a late harvest of 9/11 and the fears that took hold that day. He\u2019s the focus of vague hopes and dim resentments that have turned him into a savior in waiting. As with Ronald Reagan, it\u2019s not the specifics with Trump, it\u2019s a feeling, a vibration \u2014 and no matter how much he dissembles, reveals himself as a thug, traffics in contradictions, the raptness persists.So do a few Europeans, among them the French rightist Jean-Marie Le Pen. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is a fan, as are some Russian oligarchs. Judge a man by the company he keeps.This disoriented America just might want Trump \u2014 and that possibility should be taken very seriously, before it is too late, by every believer in American government of the people, by the people, for the people. The power of the Oval Office and the temperament of a bully make for an explosive combination, especially when he has shown contempt for the press, a taste for violence, a consistent inhumanity, a devouring ego and an above-the-law swagger.As Europe knows, democracies do die. Often, they are the midwives of their own demise. Once lost, the cost of recovery is high.Advertisement"}

Chris Christie and other New Jersey officials on Monday, calling their plan to take more control of the city fascist and hypocritical.The tone of the remarks at a news conference in front of City Hall left no doubt that any hope of a partnership between city and state officials had disappeared faster than chips on a craps table. Mayor Donald Guardian gave a fiery speech urging lawmakers to reject the legislation introduced last week in the State Senate, saying it would hand too much power to the state.\u201cWe cannot stand here today and accept any bill with the broad, overreaching powers as the one presented to us last week contained,\u201d Mr. Guardian, a Republican, said. \u201cIt is unacceptable. The civil rights of our citizens are being trampled on.\u201dMr. Guardian said city officials had drawn up different legislation that they hoped would be introduced soon, though he declined to say who might sponsor it. A key difference in this bill, he said, would be a provision for redirecting more of the taxes collected from casinos to the city.While the mayor hesitated to invoke racism as a factor in the dispute, other speakers did not. Betty Lewis, president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the organization would file a civil-rights lawsuit against the state if the takeover proceeded. About 70 percent of Atlantic City residents are black or Hispanic.\u201cThis seems to be about racism and greed,\u201d she said.\u201cWe cannot afford to be Flint, Michigan,\u201d Ms. Lewis said.Marty Small, the president of the City Council, said the takeover plan was \u201chypocrisy at its highest level.\u201d He said state officials had been involved in running the city since 2010, and called those efforts an \u201cepic failure.\u201dAlluding to past pronouncements about transforming Atlantic City into a diverse tourist destination in the mold of New Orleans, Mr. Small, a Democrat, said: \u201cWhere is Bourbon Street on Pacific Avenue? I think I heard that in 2010.\u201dInstead, the boardwalk has become drearier as out-of-state competitors have drawn away customers. Four of the city\u2019s 12 casinos closed in 2014, and the industry\u2019s revenue has been cut in half in a decade. The most successful of the casinos, the Borgata, has stopped paying its property taxes because the city has not paid a $160 million tax rebate due to the casino.\u201cThis is truly disheartening,\u201d Mr. Guardian said. \u201cSo much time has been lost. And because so much time has been lost, the City of Atlantic City has now been put in a position of running out of money within the next two months.\u201dThe city officials received no sympathy in Trenton on Monday.\u201cToday was nothing more than political posturing,\u201d Brian Murray, a spokesman for Mr. Christie, said. \u201cOne thing is for certain: The taxpayers of all of New Jersey can no longer be asked to bail out Atlantic City, especially when they continue to tax and spend so irresponsibly.\u201dRichard McGrath, a spokesman for the Democratic leadership of the Senate, said, \u201cNo one has been a better partner or a better advocate for Atlantic City than Senate President Sweeney, but the city has had more than two years to make the types of cutbacks and reforms needed to bring finances into line but has failed to do the job.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "SolarCity and Other Rooftop Providers Face a Cloudier Future", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byJust two years ago, SolarCity and other rooftop solar providers were Wall Street darlings, and prospects for growth were flying high, as enthusiasm for solar power was seemingly boundless.After all, they had built a better mousetrap, allowing the masses to install environmentally minded solar power systems at little or no cost to them and to reduce their electricity bills at the same time.But in two years, the landscape has drastically shifted.Nevada recently rolled back the generous support it gave rooftop solar systems; 20 other states are rethinking their policies, as well. And despite the extension of an important federal tax credit last year, losses by rooftop solar companies have accelerated.SolarCity, the nation\u2019s largest provider of rooftop systems, is but the most visible of a cluster of companies, built with the aid of government subsidies and utility incentives, now facing deep uncertainties, despite unflagging consumer interest and surging growth in renewable energy.Once nearly $86 a share, SolarCity\u2019s stock price has gone in mostly one direction, down, as investors have cast increasing doubts about its business model. On Wednesday, after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, the shares fell nearly 30 percent to close at $18.63 after a warning that the company faces steeper-than-expected losses.Even Lyndon Rive, SolarCity\u2019s brash and optimistic chief executive, concedes that the company is facing challenges, like the recent decision in Nevada to apply a less generous rate system to existing and future solar customers.The company and other industry leaders like Vivint and Sunrun are so vulnerable to regulatory shifts that they all responded by abandoning the state.\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone forecasted this risk,\u201d Mr. Rive said. Referring to the potential to gain new customers in Nevada, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for anyone to do it \u2014 it makes no financial sense for a consumer.\u201dThe pain in the industry has been widely felt. Last year, two prominent companies, SunEdison and NRG, alarmed investors with ambitious forays into the rooftop solar business, leading to reorganization, belt-tightening and, in the case of NRG, the departure of its chief executive, David Crane.Solar panels have been around for decades, but the businesses and methods that have propelled their fast spread across rooftops in the last five or six years are still new and untested.Many of the assumptions that underpin the financial models are far from certain, analysts and experts say, and as market conditions, public policies and technologies evolve, the risks are becoming more evident. Cheap natural gas doesn\u2019t help, making it harder for rooftop solar energy to compete in markets with low electric rates.SolarCity\u2019s troubles have attracted strong interest from short-sellers, who make money by wagering that a stock price will fall. Prominent among them is James S. Chanos, the hedge fund manager who, more than a decade ago, was one of the first to question Enron and make millions betting against it.\u201cA lot more risk has been introduced into the model,\u201d said Paul Strigler, a vice president for Esplanade Capital in Boston, which focuses on solar energy. \u201cI would call it an almost impossible segment of the market to even value.\u201d Still, Esplanade bought stock in SolarCity on Wednesday.Some things, though, have gone the company\u2019s way of late, including the extension of a federal tax credit \u2014 worth 30 percent of a system\u2019s cost \u2014 and a $113 million investment in its debt led by the clean-energy arm of Silver Lake and Mr. Rive along with his cousin, the solar company\u2019s enigmatic chairman, Elon Musk.But it is not clear that those triumphs can offset the mounting losses and increasing competition that led SolarCity to cut its growth rate in half last fall.\u201cSolarCity has been way more aggressive than anybody in its marketing,\u201d Mr. Chanos said in December at his offices in Midtown Manhattan, seated before shelves lined with business titles propped up by bear bookends. \u201cThey should be making huge amounts of money right now and they\u2019re not.\u201dOne way to make money is to look for new investors.More so than any of its kind, SolarCity has been at the forefront of engineering ways to raise money to finance its operations, including its innovation of selling bonds backed by bundles of customer agreements.Those agreements, which generate the bulk of the company\u2019s revenue, are based on SolarCity\u2019s fundamental pitch: Customers, with little or even no upfront payments, generally commit to 20-year leases to install rooftop solar systems on their homes and buy the electricity they produce for less than what they would typically pay utilities.In addition to the federal tax break and state and local incentives, the credits that utilities give customers for excess electricity sent back to the grid \u2014 known as net metering \u2014 are a potent part of making the deals economically attractive all around.Over the last couple of years, thanks to these generous, overlapping incentives, SolarCity\u2019s revenue growth has been robust.But it is expensive to build out these systems.SolarCity\u2019s revenue last year grew nearly 60 percent to $400 million from the year before. But its costs grew at much faster rate, leaving the company with an operating loss of $648 million for the year.Put another way, the company spent nearly two dollars for every new dollar in sales last year.As a result, SolarCity announced a shift in its strategy last fall. It hopes to become profitable by cutting its growth rate from 85 percent a year to about 40 percent. It is planning to sell the cash flows from its customer agreements and recently has raised $345 million in debt, including some backed by a bundle of customer loan agreements, an industry first.But even more troubling, SolarCity\u2019s debt levels are soaring as cash levels shrink. Last year, the company\u2019s interest payments on its debt totaled nearly a quarter of its revenue.SolarCity executives continue to express faith in their business model. The potential market for solar panels is barely tapped, they say, and the extension of the federal tax credits bolsters their ability to capture it.As governments around the world look to increase their share of solar power, Mr. Rive said, customers will continue to want a product that saves them money and offers a clean alternative to utility power.But it is local rate policies, like the sharp cut in net metering credits in Nevada, that pose a threat to SolarCity and its ilk. The reductions, supported by the main utility, NV Energy, a subsidiary of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s company Berkshire Hathaway, apply to existing contracts as well as to new ones, raising worries that customers will try to renegotiate or break them.\u201cWhat the developers are selling is a savings,\u201d said Tracy Rice, an analyst at Moody\u2019s, which concluded that the Nevada ruling could spur other states to follow suit. \u201cUnhappy customers who may have noted their savings eroded may attempt to get a modification or a lower solar price.\u201dIn other important solar states like Arizona, California and Hawaii, which have approved new fees and less advantageous incentives or rate plans for future solar customers, the spread of rooftop solar could slow, she added.In the meantime, solar customers in Nevada are left to grapple with a sudden gap between their budgets and their convictions.\u201cI feel kind of like I\u2019m being penalized for making a choice for my family and the environment,\u201d said Kelly Schwarze, who just had his panels installed and was still waiting for the utility to give a final approval to switch them on. He and his wife had discussed trying to get out of the contract but they were unsure of the best way forward.\u201cI was quite proud of the fact that I was going solar because it kind of made me feel like I was doing my part.\u201dBut now, he said, \u201cI feel like the black sheep in a way, like I\u2019m some villain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

An agreement is expected by the end of June.\u201cThe advantages for Viacom and Paramount are significant,\u201d Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom\u2019s chief executive, said in a note to staff members. \u201cA strategic partner can enhance Paramount\u2019s business by adding overall expertise, funding expanded production, building on our distribution clout and scale, and providing new creative opportunities for our employees, our talent and our studio production partners.\u201dThe ailing 92-year-old Sumner M. Redstone stepped down just weeks ago as executive chairman of the company. In 1994, he added Paramount to his media empire, beating out Barry Diller and John C. Malone.Paramount Pictures has struggled in the last year, largely because of a lack of theatrical hits and the ancillary income they generate once distributed on DVD and on television. When the studio has succeeded, as with \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Rogue Nation,\u201d its upside has been limited because other companies have held stakes. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, revenue declined 15 percent to $612 million. Mr. Dauman has said that Paramount\u2019s output will increase to a 15-film slate in the current fiscal year. In the fiscal year just ended, the studio made 11 films.Paramount finished 2015 in last place among the six major studios at the North American box office, with market share of about 6 percent and total domestic ticket sales of $674.7 million. (To compare, Universal Pictures, the leader, had 21.3 percent market share and $2.4 billion in domestic ticket sales.)The studio found a modest hit in December with \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which received five Oscar nominations, but its challenges show no sign of letting up, in part because it is enormously difficult for a studio to speed up its movie pipeline when it has slowed it to the degree Paramount has in recent years.\u201cZoolander 2\u201d flopped, the apparent victim of poor scheduling. Paramount released it against the comic-book adaptation \u201cDeadpool.\u201d Michael Bay\u2019s \u201c13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi\u201d was also a misfire, costing $50 million to produce and taking in $56.8 million worldwide, roughly half of which goes to theater owners.Paramount, which has three more \u201cTransformers\u201d sequels in the works, will try again on March 4 with \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot,\u201d which is set in Afghanistan.The ownership of the major film studios has been surprisingly stable for years, after decades in which they were traded \u2014 in whole, or in part \u2014 among investors who might lose money on operations, but usually sold their interests at a profit.The most recent experiment with split ownership ended in 2013, as Comcast bought a 49 percent interest in NBCUniversal from General Electric for about $16.7 billion, after a period of partnership between the companies.Historically, split ownership has led to some ferocious conflicts. In the 1980s, for instance, the media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the oil entrepreneur Marvin Davis were co-owners of 20th Century Fox. After considerable pushing and shoving, Mr. Murdoch bought Mr. Davis\u2019s share in the studio, which has since remained nested in his own corporate family.An obvious advantage to Paramount would be access to moviemaking capital, always a concern to studios, which invest heavily in projects that usually yield a return over years, if ever. As the cost of large-scale sequels and effects-driven fantasy movies has risen, most companies have sought investment directly in their film slates, or, sometimes, from friendly governments, as did Warner, which financed the Hobbit films with the help of a $100 million-plus contribution from New Zealand.In 2013, Daniel S. Loeb, an activist investor, suggested that the Sony Corporation should spin off as much as 20 percent of its entertainment interests, which include Sony Pictures Entertainment. But its parent, based in Tokyo, resisted that call.Michael Cieply and Brooks Barnes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morgan Stanley to Pay $3.2 Billion Over Flawed Mortgage Bonds", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byMorgan Stanley will pay $3.2 billion to strike a settlement with state and federal authorities over the Wall Street firm\u2019s creation of mortgage-backed bonds before the financial crisis.The settlement, which was announced Thursday morning, is one of the last that is expected to come out of a working group that President Obama helped form in 2012 to deal with the flawed mortgaged-backed bonds that banks put together before the financial crisis. In the go-go years that preceded the crisis, Wall Street banks purchased subprime mortgages and packaged them into bonds that ended up suffering significant losses.Because Morgan Stanley did not originate mortgages itself, its settlement is much smaller than those struck by large consumer banks like Bank of America, which paid $16.6 billion in its 2014 settlement.Morgan Stanley said on Thursday that it had set aside legal reserves to cover the agreement and would not take any additional charges in its coming financial results.\u201cWe are pleased to have finalized these settlements involving legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters,\u201d a spokesman for the firm, Mark Lake, said in a statement.Morgan Stanley relied on a few subprime mortgage originators, especially New Century, to feed its bond pipeline. In the settlement this week, Morgan Stanley agreed to a statement of fact that includes revealing details about its relationship with New Century.The statement says that Morgan Stanley employees frequently tried to increase the \u201cpull-through rate\u201d of New Century loans getting into securities, even when the loans were lower quality than expected.In thousands of cases, Morgan Stanley included loans that were worth more than the value of the underlying property \u2013 something it had told investors it would not do, according to the settlement.Emails cited in the document suggest that Morgan Stanley employees knew that they were bending the rules to include riskier loans.\u201cPlease do not mention the \u2018slightly higher risk tolerance\u2019 in these communications,\u201d one employee said in an email quoted in the statement. \u201cWe are running under the radar and do not want to document these types of things.\u201dThe acting United States attorney in San Francisco, Brian J. Stretch, said on Thursday that \u201cMorgan Stanley knew that in reality, many of the loans backing its securities were toxic. Abuses in the mortgage-backed securities industry such as these helped bring about the most devastating financial crisis in our lifetime. \u201cAs part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley will pay $150 million in cash to New York State, and another $400 million in consumer relief, according to the office of the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman.It is paying another $22.5 million to the State of Illinois.Previously, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $1.25 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency and $275 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle investigations involving similar issues. In total, Morgan Stanley has paid about $5 billion to members of the residential mortgage-backed securities working group.The agreement struck this week leaves Goldman Sachs as the last of the big Wall Street banks not to have completed its settlement with the federal working group. Goldman said last month that it expected its settlement to cost up to $5 billion.An earlier version of this article misstated the nature of some of the loans that Morgan Stanley was including in securities it was selling. In thousands of cases, they were worth more than the value of the underlying property, not less.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Democratic Debate, Hillary Clinton Paints Bernie Sanders\u2019s Plans as Unrealistic", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 Hillary Clinton, scrambling to recover from her double-digit defeat in the New Hampshire primary, repeatedly challenged the trillion-dollar policy plans of Bernie Sanders at their presidential debate on Thursday night and portrayed him as a big talker who needed to \u201clevel\u201d with voters about the difficulty of accomplishing his agenda.Foreign affairs also took on unusual prominence as Mrs. Clinton sought to underscore her experience and Mr. Sanders excoriated her judgment on Libya and Iraq, as well as her previous praise of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. But Mrs. Clinton was frequently on the offensive as well, seizing an opportunity to talk about leaders she admired and turning it against Mr. Sanders by bashing his past criticism of President Obama \u2014 a remark that Mr. Sanders called a \u201clow blow.\u201dWith tensions between the two Democrats becoming increasingly obvious, the debate was full of new lines of attack from Mrs. Clinton, who faces pressure to puncture Mr. Sanders\u2019s growing popularity before the next nominating contests in Nevada and South Carolina.Mrs. Clinton pounced from the start, after Mr. Sanders demurred in saying how much his proposals would increase the size of the federal government. She stepped in and said that by economists\u2019 estimates, the government would grow 40 percent under Mr. Sanders.A generation gap is emerging over the importance of electing a woman to the White House. We invite you to share your opinion. The Times may follow up with you.And rather than bashing him as she did at their debate last Thursday, she appeared to try to get under his skin by implying that he had not been transparent about the cost of his programs, such as his proposed expansion of government health care.\u201cThis is not about math. This is about people\u2019s lives, and we should level with the American people,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. She then repeated a jab at Mr. Sanders\u2019s reputation as a truth-teller that she would return to during the debate: \u201cYou need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don\u2019t add up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to,\u201d Mr. Sanders responded, insisting that families could come out with savings. \u201cThat is absolutely inaccurate.\u201dMr. Sanders, who has exuded confidence since his New Hampshire win, raising more than $6 million in the 24 hours after the polls closed there, was more pointed and even belittling of Mrs. Clinton at times. He said bluntly that some of her attacks were wrongheaded, and he was dismissive after Mrs. Clinton talked about her plans to increase federal spending by about $100 billion a year. After Mrs. Clinton responded to a question by saying, \u201conce I\u2019m in the White House,\u201d he began his next answer by saying, \u201cSecretary Clinton, you\u2019re not in the White House yet,\u201d drawing some murmurs and jeers.The candidates had one of their sharpest exchanges of the race when the moderators of the debate asked them what is typically a softball question: which leaders they admire. Mr. Sanders named Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, while Mrs. Clinton named Nelson Mandela \u2014 and then used the question to berate her opponent for his complaints about Mr. Obama over the years.\u201cThe kind of criticism that we\u2019ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination.\u201dThe New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.Mr. Sanders called the comment a \u201clow blow\u201d and said that while he disagreed with Mr. Obama on occasion in the Senate, the president was a friend.\u201cOne of us ran against Barack Obama,\u201d he fired back at Mrs. Clinton. \u201cI was not that candidate.\u201dThe PBS debate, the sixth of the Democratic race but only the second to include just Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, came at a moment of rising concern among Democrats about the strength of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy and the electability of Mr. Sanders if he becomes the Democratic nominee. Mrs. Clinton fared poorly among key parts of the Democratic electorate in the New Hampshire primary, losing a majority of the women who voted, as well as young people, who expressed mistrust of her on the campaign trail. As for Mr. Sanders, some Democrats believe he is too liberal and his proposed tax increases too toxic to win a general election.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pointed critique of Mr. Sanders was part of a new calculation by her campaign that the debate format, in which Mrs. Clinton excels, was the best way to draw attention to Mr. Sanders\u2019s record and his minimal expertise in foreign policy. The role of commander in chief became another flash point on Thursday, when Mr. Sanders argued that his judgment was better than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s, and more important than her experience. He criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize the war in Iraq, her push to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya and her consulting of Mr. Kissinger.\u201cI\u2019m proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, saying Mr. Kissinger had enabled genocide in Cambodia under Pol Pot.Mrs. Clinton turned the exchange back on Mr. Sanders, noting that he had sidestepped requests to identify his own foreign policy advisers.\u201cWell, it ain\u2019t Henry Kissinger,\u201d Mr. Sanders snapped back.Mr. Sanders also criticized Mrs. Clinton for telling CNN in 2014 that the children who entered the United States from Central America should be sent back, a statement that made some young Latinos question her commitment to their communities.\u201cI made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. But she said the United States also had to send a message to parents \u201cnot to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.\u201d\u201cThese are children,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we use them to send a message, I think we welcome them into this country.\u201dMrs. Clinton, sensing her rival\u2019s relative inexperience on world affairs, offered a somewhat belittling reply at one point in the exchange: \u201cIt\u2019s a big, complicated world out there,\u201d she said.Mr. Sanders also put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive over donations to the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her, saying that its $25 million haul included $15 million with some connection to Wall Street. Mrs. Clinton countered that she was not involved with the super PAC, but noted that Mr. Obama had also taken money from Wall Street. She rejected the idea that \u201cif you take donations from Wall Street, you can\u2019t be independent.\u201d\u201cThe people aren\u2019t dumb,\u201d Mr. Sanders replied. \u201cWhy in God\u2019s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around,\u201d he added to applause.Mrs. Clinton responded by repeating her plans to impose new regulations on hedge funds and other firms. Yet Mr. Sanders hit back again, invoking Theodore Roosevelt to argue that big banks had become too predatory against average Americans and needed to be broken up.Throughout the debate, Mr. Sanders, who is seeking to appeal to racially diverse voters in Nevada and South Carolina, demonstrated little capacity to broaden his political message in compelling new directions beyond overhauling the economy, campaign finance and health care.While he noted that his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program would save the average middle-class family $5,000 a year, he did not present his vision in any new way or frame the issue in personal terms for average voters. His advisers said during the debate that his focus was on introducing himself to new voters around the country, who may be intrigued by his candidacy after days of news coverage about his huge win in New Hampshire.At the same time, several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s answers reflected an urgent political imperative: to maintain and energize her deep support among minority voters in order to offset Mr. Sanders\u2019s popularity with young people, liberals and some working-class white voters.In her opening statement, Mrs. Clinton denounced discrimination against African-Americans in employment, education, housing and the criminal justice system. But she was matched by Mr. Sanders as he railed against a legal system in which young people have criminal records because of petty drug offenses while Wall Street executives escaped culpability for the great recession.When asked whether he was potentially blocking a milestone for women by challenging Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, who would be the first Jewish president if elected, said, \u201cI think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment as well.\u201dHe also asserted that race relations would be better under a Sanders administration than they had been under Mr. Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president.\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWhat we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they\u2019re not hanging out on street corners.\u201dAmy Chozick reported from Milwaukee, and Patrick Healy from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Johnny Coca Save Mulberry?", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 \u201cI have always liked a challenge,\u201d said Johnny Coca, the new creative director of Mulberry, as he sipped a green tea last week, deep in the heart of the brand\u2019s headquarters on Kensington Church Street here.The worlds of fashion and finance are both looking at the 40-year-old Mr. Coca, the brand\u2019s creative director since July, to see what he can deliver.\u201cFive years ago, two British luxury labels ruled the roost: Burberry and then Mulberry, its cooler, quirkier and less intimidating little sister,\u201d said Richard Gray, the Sunday Times Style magazine fashion director.\u201cIt had carved out a distinct and lucrative identity for itself before it all went horribly wrong,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cIt will be a very big ask to get Mulberry back to the position it had in the handbag market before. Two and a half years out of the game in the fashion world is a very long, long time.\u201dDespite the mounting pressure surrounding his debut, Mr. Coca, the onetime LVMH wunderkind, appeared sanguine.\u201cI\u2019m not nervous,\u201d Mr. Coca said, resplendent in a black and white kilt, oversize knit, large silver hoops and spectacles. \u201cI don\u2019t get nervous. It\u2019s important that I stay calm, both for me and my team.\u201dStill, he was not an obvious choice for the role. Mr. Coca, a diminutive Spaniard with a shy yet relentlessly cheerful mien, was educated in Paris at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts and \u00c9cole Boulle, and began his career designing store windows for Louis Vuitton.Then came stints in the design studios at Bally and most recently C\u00e9line, where he was in charge of accessories, and created such \u201cit\u201d bags as the \u201ctrapeze,\u201d garnering a reputation as a behind-the-scenes hitmaker.Mulberry will mark not just Mr. Coca\u2019s first step into the spotlight, but also his first venture into ready-to-wear. And though other accessory designers have successfully made the transition (Alessandro Michele at Gucci, for example, and Pierpaolo Piccioli and Maria Grazia Chiuri at Valentino), success is not guaranteed.\u201cThe truth is that sometimes I like to take risks and to push myself,\u201d Mr. Coca said. \u201cI don\u2019t always want to work in a company where there is no improvement to be done and where everyone is on cruise control. I don\u2019t see myself as a star. But I do like the process of making things right.\u201dMulberry was founded in 1971 in Somerset, where it still has its two factories. It has endured a stormy few years.But a disastrous push upmarket led by Bruno Guillon, a new chief executive from the French luxury house Herm\u00e8s, began in 2012. The company cut out wholesalers, rolled out flashy flagship stores and hiked prices, alienating its core customer base, particularly in its crucial domestic market.The creative director Emma Hill quit in 2013, sales collapsed and Mulberry was forced to repeatedly issue profit warnings before parting company with Mr. Guillon.\u201cThey got stuck in the middle: too expensive for their former clients, not credible enough for the clients they aspired to,\u201d wrote Luca Solca, chief luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, in a report after Mr. Guillon was ousted. \u201cWhat a pity Mulberry went on an overambitious journey to nowhere, while the accessible handbags market was booming.\u201dAfter reversing the missteps, the chairman, Godfrey Davis, started looking for Mulberry\u2019s saviors, finding them (after a protracted search) in the form of Mr. Coca and the chief executive Thierry Andretta, the former chief executive of Lanvin and Buccellati, who arrived in March.And the tide appears to be turning. In December, the company announced it had returned to profit, making \u00a3100,000 \u2014 or about $143,000 \u2014 in the half year to Sept. 30, 2015, versus a loss of \u00a31.1 million (nearly $1.6 million) in the same period a year earlier.\u201cWe know exactly what we need to do from this point on,\u201d Mr. Andretta said, \u201cand I am positive that we will do it.\u201dFirst moves are a revised retail price of \u00a3500 to \u00a3995 (about $717 to $1,425) for handbags, featuring both old favorites and new products, and a focus on the British market (which still constitutes over half its sales).Last week, in a move that suggested Mulberry sees growth potential beyond its core product line, the company announced a new manufacturing and licensing deal with the Onward Luxury Group, a Japanese-controlled Italian-based company, for worldwide distribution of its ready-to-wear and footwear collections.Lastly, digital platforms are a priority. Mulberry has been trailing snippets of the coming collection on Instagram and Snapchat in the run-up to its debut. As for Mr. Coca, he pointed to Britain\u2019s punk and rock scenes, weekends in the country and traditional floral prints as inspirations.The coming collection, he said, would have a foundation in a strong and classic palette of khaki, navy, burgundy and black, with silhouettes occasionally broken by pops of bright orange and pink.Florals would be a recurring theme, he said, as would signature military finishings and hardware, especially poppers, which would provide a dash of 1980s King\u2019s Road punk attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s about capturing an attitude that exists here, a fusion of tradition, modernity and underlying rebellion, that is palpable when you walk around,\u201d Mr. Coca said. He harked back to the original Mulberry logo and brand font after discovering it in the archives, a nod to both the company\u2019s \u201970s roots and its fresh start.\u201cI am not interested in change for change\u2019s sake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I also want us to be distinguishable from the rest of the market. This is an important chance to prove that in my eyes, product does not have to be expensive to be luxurious. This is not couture. I am making products for people that they can use every day. If you understand the proportions and technicalities of accessories inside out, it will help you elsewhere and make you a success.\u201dThe truth of that statement will be put to the runway test on Sunday.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Analysts Question Viability of Deep Tax Cuts Proposed by Republican Candidates", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The tax plans of the Republican presidential candidates would cut federal revenues as much as $12 trillion over a decade, a post-World War II record eclipsing the deep tax cuts of George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy. And they would come just as America faces the costs of its aging baby-boom generation.The combination of the tax cuts\u2019 size and timing has many tax and budget policy analysts questioning their viability. The Republican rivals routinely denounce the current $14 trillion debt, but none has said how he would offset the revenues lost to his tax cuts, beyond unspecified cuts to domestic programs and repeals of some existing tax breaks.Each candidate has said his tax cuts are needed to promote work, saving, investment and faster economic growth.Tax policy groups agree generally, but only if the revenue losses are offset by budget savings that avoid piling up more debt that would be counterproductive to spurring the economy.\u201cThe candidates need to present real specifics for how they would address our record levels of debt,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, the president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\u201cMassive tax cuts and few specifics for what spending to reduce will only make the challenges much worse,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd miraculous growth projections and \u2018waste, fraud and abuse\u2019 are just not credible solutions.\u201dAlso, at a time when many Americans lament the growing gap between rich and poor \u2014 and the shrinking middle class in between \u2014 the Republicans\u2019 plans would mostly benefit the richest individuals and corporations, according to analyses by research groups that lean left, right and center.What is indisputable is the sheer size of the proposed tax cuts. The four most detailed proposals would easily eclipse the reductions under Presidents Bush, Reagan and Kennedy, compared with the size of the economy.\u201cThe 2016 primary contenders make those guys look like pikers,\u201d said the economist Leonard Burman, the director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington and a Treasury official in the Reagan and Clinton administrations.\u201cIt\u2019ll simplify the tax code. It\u2019ll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn\u2019t seen for decades,\u201d Mr. Trump said in September, dismissing any concerns over cost.Even the least of the loss estimates would mean a cost of nearly $4 trillion over the first decade \u2014 the price tag that the Tax Foundation put on the Cruz plan. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, also have proposed deep tax cuts, but without enough detail for many economists to analyze in depth.The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.The Tax Foundation has separate estimates showing that all the Republican plans would have lower budgetary losses if the economic growth they would spark was counted in the cost.However, \u201cwe assume that the tax cuts are appropriately financed by, for example, spending reductions,\u201d said Kyle E. Pomerleau, the director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation. \u201cIt is certainly the case that having significant deficits well into the future would have an adverse impact on the economy.\u201d\u201cOne, they are enormous tax cuts relative to anything we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d said William Gale, an economist at Brookings. \u201cTwo, the candidates don\u2019t specify how they\u2019re going to pay for these tax cuts.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd three, they are hugely regressive\u201d \u2014 that is, the higher a person\u2019s income, the bigger the tax cuts that taxpayer would receive, both in dollars and as a percentage of income.If the candidates \u201cever do get around to specifying how they\u2019re going to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Mr. Gale added, the budget savings are \u201cgoing to come from low- and middle-income households\u201d because those Americans benefit more than the rich from the government\u2019s domestic spending programs.Many economists favor consumption taxes over income taxes because they provide incentives to save and invest. But critics counter that consumption taxes fall harder on lower-income wage earners, who can save little.Advertisement"}

The economic shock, they fear, could lead to large-scale social unrest even as the country is pulled apart by war, displacement and sectarian animosities.Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.He worried that come summer, when temperatures soar and electricity shortages spread, there will be \u201ccivil disobedience all over the country.\u201dIn a country increasingly fragmented along ethnic and sectarian lines \u2014 Shiite and Sunni Arabs and Kurds \u2014 and with a widening gulf between the public and a political class widely viewed as corrupt and ineffective, a government salary or pension is perhaps the last link between citizen and state.\u201cCutting the salaries would represent the full destruction of the Iraqi people,\u201d said Salman Najam, 37, an administrator at Kirkuk University. \u201cWe cannot accept cutting off our salaries because the salaries are the main source of our living, and we do not have another alternative.\u201dMr. Najam added that cutting salaries would be \u201cthe bullet that hits the Iraqi state and the unity of Iraq.\u201d In fact, he says, \u201cIt might completely destroy it.\u201dAhmed al-Rubai, a local politician in Diyala Province, where farmers are struggling to get paid by the government, said, \u201cWhat we are afraid of in this economic crisis is the inability of the government to pay salaries for millions of employees because this might lead to a social earthquake with dangerous results.\u201dWhen Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi proposed late last year to slash salaries, protests in the streets forced him to back off, for the time being.In many ways, the fall in oil prices is forcing a painful reckoning with how Iraq has conducted its economic affairs. When oil was selling at $90 to $100 a barrel, the norm in recent years, the cash fed a corrupt political system based on patronage. Instead of investments in public services, the money fed an unsustainable expansion of government payrolls, and with it a rise in consumer spending, highlighted by shopping malls that have sprouted up in Baghdad in recent years.Luay al-Khatteeb, an adviser to the Iraqi government and founder of the Iraq Energy Institute, said the country needed radical reforms that \u201ctouch on every single aspect of the economic system and the social structure of Iraq.\u201dAlready there have been painful budget cuts. Across the country, the landscape is blighted by stalled construction projects \u2014 hospitals, schools, factories and a soccer stadium. The Health Ministry is proposing to charge fees for health care, essentially dismantling the free system established by the Baath Party in the 1970s. Growth in luxury spending that propelled the economy in better times is slowing drastically, and the owner of the local Jaguar dealership said he may be out of business soon.In Mr. Khatteeb\u2019s view, many of the most profound changes under consideration by the government have become necessary: a tax system, the substantial whittling of government payrolls, and a reduction in the fuel subsidies and monthly food rations \u2014 sugar, tea, rice and cooking oil \u2014 that every Iraqi citizen receives.Any of these steps, if taken, would represent a fundamental reordering of a society in which citizens rely on the government for a livelihood.\u201cIt\u2019s the culture in Iraq,\u201d said Mudher Mohammed Salih, Mr. Abadi\u2019s adviser for financial policy. \u201cEveryone is looking for a free lunch.\u201dThis culture will make it difficult, if not impossible, for the government to establish a tax system, as it is trying to do in an attempt to expand revenues beyond oil.\u201cI would not pay taxes,\u201d said Fadil Yaseen, 55, a retiree in Baghdad. \u201cPay for what? The state is not giving us any services, and not improving any sector or aspects of our lives. When the state improves and develops the country, then I would pay.\u201dIraq will also try to sell savings bonds in the coming months to Iraqi citizens, in an effort to raise more than $4 billion, and appeal to national unity in its sales pitch. That will be a tough sell in a country where most people keep their money in cash at home and have little trust in government.Still, Mr. Salih said, even as the government pursues these measures, it is also preparing for what he said is the worst-case scenario: that oil prices fall further and the country faces economic conditions reminiscent of the sanctions period of the 1990s, which devastated the economy.He said that if there is one thing the government is determined to keep spending money on, it is war.\u201cThe priority is war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of our existence.\u201dSpeaking to reporters recently, Hoshyar Zebari, the finance minister, said, \u201cThe tremendous decline in oil prices will sadly continue.\u201dHe noted that in recent years, when oil prices were high, the country could count on nearly $8 billion per month in oil revenue, compared with less than $3 billion last month. Salaries alone cost the government close to $4 billion per month.\u201cI\u2019m not a man of denial,\u201d Mr. Zebari said. \u201cIf the situation is not good, we must say it\u2019s not good.\u201dReporting was contributed by Falih Hassan and Ahmed Salah from Baghdad, Kamil Kakol from Sulaimaniya, and employees of The New York Times from Kirkuk, Najaf, Hilla and Diyala Province.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Era of Big-Program Liberalism Over?", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorBERNIE Sanders and the policies he advocates may represent the future for many Democratic primary voters, but his basic theory of government is very traditional, dating to the New Deal.That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and it\u2019s deeply embedded in Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach. His proposals for single-payer health care, free college tuition and paid family leave financed through a small payroll tax reflect the view that successful programs should be universal and create a connection between individuals and government.That\u2019s in sharp contrast to the policy approach of the Obama administration since about 2011, and also to Hillary Clinton and most of Mr. Sanders\u2019s congressional colleagues. Their agendas are most interesting and novel for the absence of big, universal programs that require legislative action. Instead, they test the limits of what government can do by rearranging the pieces of existing programs, using regulations, incentives to states, tax credits and \u201cnudges\u201d informed by behavioral economics in place of direct spending.What does that say about the future of big programs? Unless Mr. Sanders can sweep to power with a mandate and wide congressional majorities that share his view \u2014 the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d he promises \u2014 the future of social and economic policy will involve, for better or worse, these complex, incremental and often invisible changes, instead of big programs.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201ccompact\u201d for college tuition assistance, which costs a fraction of what Mr. Sanders\u2019s free college plan costs, illustrates the new method. There is no single new program. Instead, she promises, for example, to provide grants to states to help them provide free tuition at community colleges; to expand regulation of predatory loan servicers and education programs; to enact a \u201cBorrower Bill of Rights\u201d; and to allow students to refinance their loans at lower rates.It\u2019s all a lot more complicated \u2014 and for candidate Clinton, especially in the primary, a tougher sell \u2014 than a single new program in which government takes most of the responsibility. But it fits well with the methods employed by the Obama administration in the years since the president realized that he could not expect to achieve an ambitious program with a deeply partisan Congress and a Republican House.It\u2019s more than just congressional intransigence and polarization that led liberals to move beyond big new programs. Passage of the Affordable Care Act finally put in place the last big piece of the New Deal\u2019s agenda. And the cautiousness of most Democratic candidates about taxes makes it difficult to push for new programs. While Mr. Sanders acknowledges that his new programs will require tax increases, he uses the same rule as Mrs. Clinton and President Obama \u2014 no tax increases on households under $250,000 \u2014 in several of his initiatives, and claims that he will pay for the cost of others through taxes on the \u201cbillionaire class.\u201dBut without new programs, it really is possible to deny the need for broader tax increases, as Mrs. Clinton does. There is no need for revenue to reduce future budget deficits; the best way to keep deficits under control is to keep the economy growing and to reduce health care spending, which again means more tinkering.These policy machinations should not be confused with \u201ctriangulation\u201d \u2014 the modest, symbolic gestures adopted by the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s to show a recognition of conservative values. These are intended instead to make progress toward big goals by putting together various moving pieces.There are many downsides to building policy this way. It\u2019s unlikely that the MyRA, for example, will be enough to meet the shortfall in Americans\u2019 retirement savings or reduce inequality of wealth.But if this is the only way to drive reform \u2014 and in the current political configuration, it is \u2014 then politicians in both parties will have no choice but to find ways to achieve big change without big new programs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republican Race Puts Donald Trump and Paul Ryan on Collision Course", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byPanicked Republicans question whether Mr. Trump will be able to unite a Republican-controlled Congress that would normally be expected to promote and promulgate his agenda, an internal crisis nearly unheard-of in a generation of American politics. On nearly every significant issue, Mr. Trump stands in opposition to Republican orthodoxy and his party\u2019s policy prescriptions \u2014 the very ideas that Mr. Ryan has done more than anyone else to form, refine or promote over the last decade.\u201cYou\u2019re hitting on a very big problem, which is that Trump is not a Republican,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who dropped out of the race for the White House in December \u201cI have no idea how we reconcile a Donald Trump agenda with a Republican agenda. How do we write a platform?\u201dMr. Ryan\u2019s positions embody the modern institutional Republican Party. He has been a crucial promoter of free trade on Capitol Hill, which Mr. Trump opposes. Mr. Ryan supports taking away money from Planned Parenthood \u2014 a central target of Republicans for years \u2014 while Mr. Trump has said the group provides needed care to women. Eminent domain, the right of the government to seize private property for public use? The concept is despised by Republicans. Mr. Trump, who has used eminent domain to try to demolish an older woman\u2019s home in Atlantic City to build a parking lot, calls it \u201cwonderful.\u201dAs House speaker, Paul D. Ryan will chair the Republican National Convention this summer. Many of his views are diametrically opposite the frontrunner for the nomination, Donald J. Trump.Mr. Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 deporting millions of undocumented workers \u2014 also stands in contrast to Mr. Ryan\u2019s belief that his party needs to change the current system to help some immigrants, and in the process attract them to the party. Not least, Mr. Trump said last week that he would be \u201ca neutral guy\u201d in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Mr. Ryan holds the traditional Republican position of strong support for Israel.This week, as Mr. Trump is once again bashing conservative notions, Mr. Ryan\u2019s House is holding a series of members-only ideas forums on poverty, health care and other issues. Mr. Ryan also gives speeches and conducts television and radio interviews pretty much wherever he goes these days. But for now, Mr. Trump has the bigger microphone.\u201cEverything about this cycle has presented a departure from routine,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican consultant. \u201cIn normal circumstances, you would expect the party to adjust to the nominee\u2019s agenda. But in this case, you have a front-runner running on rhetoric, not substance.\u201dThough most in the Republican establishment are hoping for the dust to settle and for Senator Marco Rubio to emerge as their nominee \u2014 his Capitol Hill endorsements stack up daily \u2014 some still murmur privately that in the event of Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination, they would like to see Mr. Ryan emerge as a brokered nominee at the Republican National Convention in July.\u201cIn a lot of ways, it might actually be conducive to getting things done to have someone with business sense in the White House,\u201d said Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina and a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.Like Mr. Ryan, Mr. Trump also supports gun rights and a strong military, although Mr. Trump has broken with many Republicans with his criticism of the Iraq war.\u201cAll of the Republican presidential candidates would be better than Hillary Clinton,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. \u201cAnd Speaker Ryan would be able to work with any one of them.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Some even argue that Mr. Ryan, who operated in lonely political waters before his party took over the House in 2011, will adjust to the environment and try to help Republicans in congressional races who, in many states, will be fighting for their lives.\u201cSenate candidates will be looking for someone who is going to serve as a lodestar in the contest of ideas,\u201d Mr. Madden said. \u201cIn that sense, Paul Ryan becomes that much more important as it relates to the important differences between Republicans and Democrats.\u201dHistory has few parallels. \u201cTrump is kind of unusual in that he is not ideological, so it is hard to place him,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor at Princeton University and a specialist in American political history.Mr. Zelizer noted that Barry Goldwater sought a much more radical abolition of government than most of the Republicans in Congress in 1964 and that in 1976, Jimmy Carter was out of step with many of the central factions of the Democratic Party, including Thomas P. O\u2019Neill Jr., the speaker at the time.Congressional Republicans \u2014 especially senators up for re-election in swing states \u2014 have been terrified to criticize Mr. Trump by name because they need his voters, too, in primary and possible general election battles. White-hot fear is beginning to set in.\u201cI finally got scared last night,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses on Tuesday. \u201cAs we get closer and people get more serious, I hope more people up here speak out.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Micklethwait\u2019s Balancing Act, After a Year as Bloomberg Editor in Chief", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byIn recent weeks, John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of Bloomberg, has sometimes felt, as he put it, like \u201ca character in a Graham Greene novel. There\u2019s an element of \u2018there\u2019s no perfect answer to it.\u2019\u201dAs part of a wide-ranging interview about his first year at Bloomberg, Mr. Micklethwait was discussing the latest in a line of complex balancing acts he has performed since he began running one of the world\u2019s largest news organizations \u2014 in this case, how Bloomberg should cover its founder, Michael R. Bloomberg, as Mr. Bloomberg considers a presidential run.At his previous job, as the top editor of The Economist, where he oversaw a staff of about 150, Mr. Micklethwait did not have to concern himself with such things. But his arrival at Bloomberg coincided with, among other changes, a broad refocusing within the organization\u2019s newsroom.Days later, Kathy Kiely, a news director in Washington for Bloomberg, resigned, citing those restrictions as unacceptable. Mr. Micklethwait described that resignation as \u201ca little odd,\u201d given the company\u2019s stated policy of not covering itself or its founder to avoid the appearance of bias. \u201cIf he did declare, then we would probably come up with a more formal set of things, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m looking at with our Washington people,\u201d Mr. Micklethwait said.Since finishing his tenure as mayor of New York City at the end of 2013, Mr. Bloomberg has returned to run the company that is the source of his personal fortune, which Forbes estimates at nearly $40 billion. Sweeping changes have followed.At the end of 2014, it was announced that Matthew Winkler \u2014 who oversaw Bloomberg\u2019s news operation as it became one of the largest in the world, with a staff of about 2,400 \u2014 would take an emeritus title and that Mr. Micklethwait would join the company. In addition, Daniel L. Doctoroff, the chief executive at Bloomberg who led a new media strategy and hired a number of people to execute it, said he would be leaving. Other important news staff members left in the weeks and months that followed.And so a broad reconsideration of Bloomberg\u2019s news and media offerings fell to Mr. Micklethwait, 53, a relative of the Duke of Norfolk and a descendant of William the Conqueror, the nobleman who led the Norman Conquest of Britain in 1066. (It is perhaps this heritage that led some in his newsroom to think, incorrectly, that he owned a castle in England.)Mr. Micklethwait was educated at the Ampleforth College, an upscale English boarding school, and subsequently at the University of Oxford. He worked for Chase Manhattan Bank before switching to journalism and joining The Economist in 1987.By 2006, he was editing The Economist, famed for lively and collegial discussions at its weekly meetings \u2014 discussions that form the basis for some of its distinctive articles.If the World Economic Forum, held each year in Davos, Switzerland, decided to elect a mayor, the highly connected Mr. Micklethwait might be considered. He is also associated with the Bilderberg Group, a society that includes some of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people, including politicians, executives and financiers \u2014 precisely the people that Bloomberg News aims to reach \u2014 who gather annually to discuss global issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to meet people,\u201d Mr. Micklethwait said. (He could not remember precisely where or when he had met Mr. Bloomberg, but the two have known each other for several years.)John Elkann, who leads the investment group Exor, which owns a stake in The Economist, described Mr. Micklethwait as \u201cpoised and calm,\u201d with a gift for British understatement. He acknowledged that The Economist was a very different organization from Bloomberg News, but he said that in Mr. Micklethwait, Mr. Bloomberg had a leader who could push the news organization\u2019s global growth.Though Mr. Bloomberg has a reputation for concerning himself with details as small as the on-air gestures of Bloomberg\u2019s television presenters and how the paper towel dispensers in the company\u2019s offices are labeled, Mr. Micklethwait said he had no difficulties with his boss.The two are aligned in their thinking about the company\u2019s news offerings, he said, adding that Mr. Bloomberg generally doesn\u2019t make any journalistic decisions. They disagree from time to time, he said, but in that case they \u201ccome to an arrangement.\u201d Mr. Micklethwait declined to cite specific examples.A recent memo Mr. Micklethwait sent to his staff outlined a long list of new endeavors, and achievements, including an opinion site, Gadfly, and a morning news service, Daybreak. And most of the efforts focus on the six areas at which he has said the company\u2019s reporting should be aimed: business, finance, markets, economics, technology and power (political and governmental).But some Bloomberg staff members are concerned with the company\u2019s new direction, which they fear could mean a retreat from pursuing ambitious journalism. It is hard, they have suggested, to afflict the comfortable when some of those same people are paying more than $20,000 annually to subscribe to Bloomberg\u2019s financial information terminals \u2014 a computer system that provides users with data \u2014 especially when those terminals account for about 80 percent of Bloomberg\u2019s annual revenue of about $9 billion.Mr. Micklethwait denied that Bloomberg had cut back on investigative reporting. But he said it was true that the organization had refocused, a process that seemed to have resolved a tension between those who saw it as a media company with bold ambitions fueled by the terminals\u2019 profits, and those who saw it as a more measured media company in the service of those terminals.Last fall, Bloomberg\u2019s media group produced a graphic to clarify how it interpreted its customer base. It looks like the cross-section of a planet. The large, gray core is \u201cTerminal Customers.\u201d Around it are thinner layers that represent audiences of \u201cGlobal Finance Professionals\u201d and \u201cGlobal Business Professionals.\u201d More general audiences are not mentioned.Mr. Micklethwait disagreed that his newsroom had become more reflexively establishmentarian. Bloomberg, he said, is a kind of \u201cparish magazine of finance. And when we say this hedge fund is messed up this way or this bank has done this thing wrong, that particular banker may not particularly love us at that moment, but the rest of finance wants to know about it. And that I think is key.\u201dThe tension has been particularly acute in its reporting on China, which represents a vast potential market for Bloomberg but is also strictly controlled by an authoritarian government that has punished journalists and news organizations that have displeased the country\u2019s leaders.Several Bloomberg employees, including some who still work there, subsequently accused the organization of shying away from similar reporting in the aftermath. Some of the investigative staff members resigned.Mr. Micklethwait said that though he was not at Bloomberg when the issue arose, there was not currently a policy to cover China less aggressively. The company has continued to report there, he said. \u201cBut let me just be clear on one thing,\u201d Mr. Micklethwait said. \u201cOur license within China is just to be a business and finance wire.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Online Lender Ezubao Took $7.6 Billion in Ponzi Scheme, China Says", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byThe accusations throw a shadow over China\u2019s online finance industry, a lucrative area for many global leaders in the sector, but one that the authorities say has also drawn a growing number of cases of fraud and flameouts.Chinese officials say that the online company, Ezubao, once a dynamo of the industry, offered mostly fake investment products to its nearly one million investors, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The authorities arrested 21 people in Anhui, the eastern Chinese province where Ezubao is based, and closed some of the platform\u2019s operations, the agency reported on Sunday.\u201cEzubao is a Ponzi scheme,\u201d Xinhua quoted Zhang Min, a former executive at the company, as saying. Officials at the company could not be reached for comment.A new category of Chinese companies has emerged in recent years to do for customers what the country\u2019s state-owned banks will not. Chinese customers widely use their smartphones to buy groceries or transfer money, and new types of finance companies are offering loans to small businesses, students and others that state banks traditionally ignore.Ezubao claims to be a peer-to-peer lender, matching investors with potential borrowers over the Internet. China\u2019s growth in peer-to-peer lending has been strong, and Morgan Stanley estimated total volume in the country last year at $33.2 billion, surpassing the United States. The Chinese market is fragmented, Morgan Stanley says, with more than 1,500 such lending platforms.Ezubao has been under official scrutiny for weeks. In December, Xinhua said the company was under investigation for suspected illegal business activities.Xinhua said an investigation by local authorities had found that most of the investment products the company marketed were fake. Some offered investors annual interest payments of as much as 15 percent.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.In reality, the platform, which was set up by the Yucheng Group in July 2014, was used to enrich top executives, Xinhua said.That included more than 1 billion renminbi, or around $150 million, that Ding Ning, the chairman of Yucheng, is reported to have spent on items and gifts including real estate, cars and luxury goods, according to the news agency.The report added that the salary paid to Mr. Ding\u2019s brother, Ding Dian, was increased to 1 million renminbi a month from 18,000 renminbi. The company spent as much as 800 million renminbi on payroll in the month of November.Another executive, who was in charge of risk management at a company affiliated with the Yucheng Group, said that more than 95 percent of the investment products Ezubao marketed on the platform were fake, according to the report, and those responsible went to considerable lengths to conceal their ruse.The Xinhua report said that suspects had placed about 1,200 documents and other pieces of evidence related to the scheme in 80 bags and had buried them six meters, or nearly 20 feet, underground at a site on the outskirts of Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province.It took the police 20 hours with two excavators to unearth the evidence, Xinhua said, and the police described the case as \u201cextremely difficult.\u201dOwen Guo contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "ADT in $6.9 Billion Deal to Sell Itself to Apollo Buyout Firm", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byThe ADT Corporation, which provides home and business security systems for 6.5 million customers, is being acquired by the private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $6.9 billion in the largest leveraged buyout so far this year.Apollo intends to merge ADT with Protection 1 and ASG Security, two other security companies that the firm agreed to purchase last May, although they will all operate under the ADT name. The combined company would create pro forma annual revenue surpassing $4.2 billion.ADT was the last of Tyco\u2019s largest former subsidiaries to be acquired. The company first merged its flow-control unit with Pentair in 2012. In January, the security and fire-safety systems company that maintained the Tyco name decided to combine with Johnson Controls.An analyst at William Blair, a financial services firm, said one catalyst for the offer by Apollo was the drop in ADT\u2019s stock price after the company reported earnings for the first quarter of the 2016 fiscal year that showed a decline in free-cash flow before special items. On Tuesday, ADT\u2019s stock surged 47.5 percent to $39.64 \u2014 a few dollars shy of the takeover price. About 21 percent of ADT\u2019s shares outstanding were sold short, so a lot of that gain was from investors covering those positions, said the William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann.While the board of directors approved the transaction, the deal includes a \u201cgo shop\u201d period, in which ADT can solicit other bids that it might deem superior, over the next 40 days.Timothy J. Whall, president and chief executive of Protection 1, will lead the combined business. Protection 1\u2019s \u201ccommercial presence\u201d will help ADT expand into that customer base by increasing sales and technical skills in that area, Mr. Whall said.In a market that has been inhospitable to leveraged buyouts, the ADT deal is the largest in 2016. Only 10 leveraged buyouts have occurred so far this year, with none before ADT surpassing $1.5 billion in value, according to data compiled by Dealogic.Under the ADT deal, funds managed by Apollo and its co-investors will provide $4.5 billion for the transaction. The deal will also be financed by $1.6 billion through new first-lien loans and $3.1 billion in second-lien loans, as well as $750 million in preferred securities through the investment arm of Koch Industries, according to the statement. Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Canada are providing the financing and they have provided financial advice to Protection 1.The acquisition is expected to be completed by June, subject to shareholder approval and antitrust waiting periods.Ian Zaffino, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said the deal was \u201chighly likely\u201d to be completed.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign, Billed as Self-Funded, Risks Little of His Fortune", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byMr. Trump\u2019s campaign spent just $12.4 million in 2015, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission, millions less than any of his leading rivals for the Republican nomination. More than half of Mr. Trump\u2019s total spending was covered by checks from his supporters, who have thronged to his stump speeches and bought millions of dollars\u2019 worth of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and T-shirts.While the convoluted accounting is required by law \u2014 so that Mr. Trump\u2019s companies do not make illegal corporate contributions directly to his campaign \u2014 it also means that Mr. Trump is in effect taking millions of dollars out of one pocket and depositing it into another.What remains is a quintessentially Trumpian endeavor that blurs the line between campaigning and brand-building and complicates Mr. Trump\u2019s claims that he is funding his own White House campaign. About three-quarters of Mr. Trump\u2019s total campaign spending has either gone to reimburse his own businesses or has been covered by funds from grass-roots donors, according to an analysis by The New York Times of F.E.C. reports. Virtually all of the money Mr. Trump himself has put into the campaign was lent, rather than donated outright, meaning that he could potentially sell enough hats and T-shirts to pay himself back down the road.\u201cI think there\u2019s always been a case to be made that Donald Trump looked at this as a way to extend his brand to a new generation of people,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Florida-based Republican strategist who has done work for a group supporting Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. \u201cI bet \u2018Art of the Deal\u2019 was in the remainder bin until this year.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just the business Mr. Trump has lost but the business opportunities that are not coming to him because of the strong stands he has taken,\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cI\u2019ve personally been there in the room when he has been offered massive, massive business opportunities out of the country, and he says he does not want to do them because his sole focus is running for the president of the United States.\u201dSome of the costs for which Mr. Trump\u2019s companies are now charging his campaign would probably be incurred even if he were not running for president, such as salaries for borrowed Trump Organization personnel and some of his private plane flights. Excluding short hops around the New York City area, Mr. Trump\u2019s private aircraft logged 66 flights in July, August and September 2015, according to the most recent available federal flight records. During the same period in 2014, the aircraft made 51 flights.But a tour through campaign filings suggests that no one meshes business and political pursuits quite as seamlessly as the candidate whose campaign is built on his celebrity.It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign operation is better at promoting the candidate\u2019s brand or at winning elections. He lost the Iowa caucuses by a few percentage points. On the other hand, Mr. Trump has sold 179,000 copies of his new book, \u201cCrippled America,\u201d according to Nielsen BookScan, about $4 million worth of sales at the list price.Mr. Trump himself can seem hazy on the distinction between his political and business pursuits. Virtually every Trump speech includes a reference to one of his hotels or casinos; recently he heaped praise on the Doral, the luxury golf resort outside Miami he acquired in 2012. He often suggests that the Obama administration should have read his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d before negotiating the Iran nuclear agreement. (As Mr. Wilson suspected, sales of that 1987 best seller have lately skyrocketed, from 3,000 copies in 2014 to 47,000 in 2015.)At a campaign event in Exeter on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump promoted his soon-to-open Washington hotel, which will be in the renovated old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fantastic project,\u201d Mr. Trump promised. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and have it open for a certain date,\u201d he told the crowd, adding, \u201csitting on Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201dMr. Lewandowski, the campaign manager, said there was no confusion back at the campaign headquarters (a slice of the fifth floor of Trump Tower). Since the campaign is not allowed to take in-kind contributions from the company, Mr. Lewandowski said, every borrowed Trump employee and flight-hour has to be properly compensated out of the campaign account.After the Iowa caucuses, the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates.\u201cWe pay fair market value for all the items that we use,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said. \u201cWe pay the Trump Corporation or the Trump entities such things as the rent for the headquarters.\u201dSome critics remain unconvinced that all of the help Mr. Trump\u2019s companies are providing his campaign is being properly accounted for.Reminded that candidates are forbidden to use corporate resources for campaign purposes, Mr. Trump\u2019s company argued that an attack on Mr. Trump anywhere was an attack on him everywhere. \u201cThe Trump Organization has vigorously policed Mr. Trump\u2019s brand and business interests for many years,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThose rights are not forfeited by virtue of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\u201dRight to Rise has filed an F.E.C. complaint, charging that Mr. Trump is illegally using corporate resources to further his campaign.There are signs that Mr. Trump has begun to invest more significantly in a traditional political apparatus. His campaign\u2019s payments to companies not affiliated with the Trump Organization doubled between August and November. As of the end of December, Mr. Trump had spent almost as much on field staff ($2 million) as on promotional merchandise and marketing ($2.5 million).And at the moment, Mr. Trump leads by double-digits in national polls and in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Tuesday.One way or another, he suggested Wednesday, he will win.\u201cIf I don\u2019t make the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d Mr. Trump told his supporters, \u201cI\u2019m going to be living on Pennsylvania Avenue anyway.\u201dNicholas Confessore reported from Manchester, and Sarah Cohen from New York.

And as soon as a company hits turbulence, calls for a management shake-up almost always follow.History suggests that changing course can have big results. But not every company has needed to shake up its ranks to regain its footing. And even those that did bring in new management have found themselves under attack again:In the late 1990s, Priceline seemed to have the golden touch. On its first day of trading in 1999, its market value hit $12.9 billion. At the time, it was the highest first day valuation of any company that had gone public.The company\u2019s stock plummeted. At one point, the company was worth less than $250 million.Over the years, Priceline acquired competitors including Booking.com, Kayak and OpenTable, becoming dominant in the online travel segment. By 2010, it surpassed Expedia in online hotel reservations. It now has a market value of $53 billion.Keeping competition at bay is critical for any technology company, said David Hsu, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIf you\u2019ve discovered a valuable space, there\u2019s a lot of companies, new entrants,\u201d he said.Amazon was a pioneer in web retailing, beginning with online book sales in 1995.

But the company had not recorded a profit in its early years, causing some analysts and investors to question whether it was any different than all the other dot-coms that failed by 2001.\u201cAt Amazon, they were ruthlessly committed to the customer experience,\u201d said Nick Donatiello, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \u201cAnd that is still their strategy.\u201dThrough it all, Mr. Bezos consistently relayed his growth plan to investors.That\u2019s unlike some tech companies like Yahoo and Twitter, Professor Hsu of Wharton said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear communication either by way of their actions or their words as to how they are going stay relevant.\u201d\u201cOf course, it is unlikely Bezos could have anticipated how the various initiatives would turn out,\u201d he added. \u201cHe therefore had some sense of the necessary pacing of new business introductions to widen the touch points Amazon would need to ultimately win.\u201d\u201cIt took a change in management to clean up some prior misdirection and set a new strategy,\u201d said Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. \u201cTo make these changes, the company needed to \u2018reset expectations\u2019 and take the short-term hit from Wall Street as it invested for the long-term gain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Republican Party\u2019s Desperate Mission to Stop Donald Trump", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported by_____The scenario Karl Rove outlined was bleak.Addressing a luncheon of Republican governors and donors in Washington on Feb. 19, he warned that Donald J. Trump\u2019s increasingly likely nomination would be catastrophic, dooming the party in November. But Mr. Rove, the master strategist of George W. Bush\u2019s campaigns, insisted it was not too late for them to stop Mr. Trump, according to three people present.At a meeting of Republican governors the next morning, Paul R. LePage of Maine called for action. Seated at a long boardroom table at the Willard Hotel, he erupted in frustration over the state of the 2016 race, saying Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination would deeply wound the Republican Party. Mr. LePage urged the governors to draft an open letter \u201cto the people,\u201d disavowing Mr. Trump and his divisive brand of politics.The suggestion was not taken up. Since then, Mr. Trump has only gotten stronger, winning two more state contests and collecting the endorsement of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.In public, there were calls for the party to unite behind a single candidate. In dozens of interviews, elected officials, political strategists and donors described a frantic, last-ditch campaign to block Mr. Trump \u2014 and the agonizing reasons that many of them have become convinced it will fail. Behind the scenes, a desperate mission to save the party sputtered and stalled at every turn.Efforts to unite warring candidates behind one failed spectacularly: An overture from Senator Marco Rubio to Mr. Christie angered and insulted the governor. An unsubtle appeal from Mitt Romney to John Kasich, about the party\u2019s need to consolidate behind one rival to Mr. Trump, fell on deaf ears.At least two campaigns have drafted plans to overtake Mr. Trump in a brokered convention, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has laid out a plan that would have lawmakers break with Mr. Trump explicitly in a general election.Despite all the forces arrayed against Mr. Trump, the interviews show, the party has been gripped by a nearly incapacitating leadership vacuum and a paralytic sense of indecision and despair, as he has won smashing victories in South Carolina and Nevada. Donors have dreaded the consequences of clashing with Mr. Trump directly. Elected officials have balked at attacking him out of concern that they might unintentionally fuel his populist revolt. And Republicans have lacked someone from outside the presidential race who could help set the terms of debate from afar.Should Mr. Trump clinch the presidential nomination, it would represent a rout of historic proportions for the institutional Republican Party, and could set off an internal rift unseen in either party for a half-century, since white Southerners abandoned the Democratic Party en masse during the civil rights movement.Former Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a top adviser to Mr. Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign, said the party was unable to come up with a united front to quash Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\u201cThere is no mechanism,\u201d Mr. Leavitt said. \u201cThere is no smoke-filled room. If there is, I\u2019ve never seen it, nor do I know anyone who has. This is going to play out in the way that it will.\u201dResistance Runs DeepRepublicans have ruefully acknowledged that they came to this dire pass in no small part because of their own passivity. There were ample opportunities to battle Mr. Trump earlier; more than one plan was drawn up only to be rejected. Rivals who attacked him early, like Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal, the former governors of Texas and Louisiana, received little backup and quickly faded.\u201cWe want voters to imagine Donald Trump in the Big Chair in the Oval Office, with responsibilities for worldwide confrontation at his fingertips,\u201d they wrote in the previously unreported memo. Mr. Castellanos even produced ads portraying Mr. Trump as unfit for the presidency, according to people who saw them and who, along with many of those interviewed, insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.The two strategists, who declined to comment, proposed to attack Mr. Trump in New Hampshire over his business failures and past liberal positions, and emphasized the extreme urgency of their project. A Trump nomination would not only cause Republicans to lose the presidency, they wrote, \u201cbut we also lose the Senate, competitive gubernatorial elections and moderate House Republicans.\u201dNo major donors committed to the project, and it was abandoned. No other sustained Stop Trump effort sprang up in its place.Resistance to Mr. Trump still runs deep. The party\u2019s biggest benefactors remain totally opposed to him. At a recent presentation hosted by the billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch, the country\u2019s most prolific conservative donors, their political advisers characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s record as utterly unacceptable, and highlighted his support for government-funded business subsidies and government-backed health care, according to people who attended.But the Kochs, like Mr. Adelson, have shown no appetite to intervene directly in the primary with decisive force.Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s challengers are staking their hopes on a set of guerrilla tactics and long-shot possibilities, racing to line up mainstream voters and interest groups against his increasingly formidable campaign. Donors and elected leaders have begun to rouse themselves for the fight, but perhaps too late.Two of Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents have openly acknowledged that they may have to wrest the Republican nomination from him in a deadlocked convention.Speaking to political donors in Manhattan on Wednesday evening, Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, noted that most delegates are bound to a candidate only on the first ballot. Many of them, moreover, are likely to be party regulars who may not support Mr. Trump over multiple rounds of balloting, he added, according to a person present for Mr. Sullivan\u2019s presentation, which was first reported by CNN.Advisers to Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, have told potential supporters that his strategy boils down to a convention battle. Judd Gregg, a former New Hampshire senator who had endorsed Jeb Bush, said Mr. Kasich\u2019s emissaries had sketched an outcome in which Mr. Kasich \u201cprobably ends up with the second-highest delegate count going into the convention\u201d and digs in there to compete with Mr. Trump.In Washington, Mr. Kasich\u2019s persistence in the race has become a source of frustration. At Senate luncheons on Wednesday and Thursday, Republican lawmakers vented about Mr. Kasich\u2019s intransigence, calling it selfishness.One senior Republican senator, noting that Mr. Kasich has truly contested only one of the first four states, complained: \u201cHe\u2019s just flailing his arms around and having a wonderful time going around the country, and it just drives me up the wall.\u201dMr. McConnell was especially vocal, describing Mr. Kasich\u2019s persistence as irrational because he has no plausible path to the nomination, several senators said.While still hopeful that Mr. Rubio might prevail, Mr. McConnell has begun preparing senators for the prospect of a Trump nomination, assuring them that, if it threatened to harm them in the general election, they could run negative ads about Mr. Trump to create space between him and Republican senators seeking re-election. Mr. McConnell has raised the possibility of treating Mr. Trump\u2019s loss as a given and describing a Republican Senate to voters as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton, according to senators at the lunches.An interactive delegate calculator simulates how the G.O.P. nomination race might unfold.He has reminded colleagues of his own 1996 re-election campaign, when he won comfortably amid President Bill Clinton\u2019s easy re-election. Of Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell has said, \u201cWe\u2019ll drop him like a hot rock,\u201d according to his colleagues.The Rubio HopeThere is still hope that Mr. Rubio might be able to unite much of the party and slow Mr. Trump\u2019s advance in a series of big-state primaries in March, and a host of top elected officials endorsed him over the last week. But Mr. Rubio has struggled to sideline Mr. Kasich and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is running a dogged campaign on the right. He has also been unable to win over several of his former rivals who might help consolidate the Republican establishment more squarely behind him.Mr. Rubio showed a lack of finesse in dealing with his fallen rivals\u2019 injured egos.Mr. Christie had attacked Mr. Rubio contemptuously in New Hampshire, calling him shallow and scripted, and humiliating him in a debate. Nevertheless, Mr. Rubio made a tentative overture to Mr. Christie after his withdrawal from the presidential race. He left the governor a voice mail message, seeking Mr. Christie\u2019s support and assuring him that he had a bright future in public service, according to people who have heard Mr. Christie\u2019s characterization of the message.Mr. Christie, 53, took the message as deeply disrespectful and patronizing, questioning why \u201ca 44-year-old\u201d was telling him about his future, said people who described his reaction on the condition of anonymity. Further efforts to connect the two never yielded a direct conversation.Mr. Trump, by contrast, made frequent calls to Mr. Christie once he dropped out, a person close to the governor said. After the two met at Trump Tower on Thursday with their wives, Mr. Christie flew to Texas and emerged on Friday to back Mr. Trump and mock Mr. Rubio as a desperate candidate near the end of a losing campaign.\u2018Verging on Panic\u2019Mr. Bush has been nearly silent since quitting the race Feb. 20, playing golf with his son Jeb Jr. in Miami and turning to the task of thank-you notes. In a Wednesday conference call with supporters, he did not express a preference among the remaining contenders. When Mr. Rubio called him on Monday, their conversation did not last long, two people briefed on it said, and Mr. Rubio did not ask for his endorsement.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cThere\u2019s this desire, verging on panic, to consolidate the field,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a former supporter of Mr. Bush. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see any movement at all.\u201dMr. Rubio\u2019s advisers were also thwarted in their efforts to secure an endorsement from Mr. Romney, whom they lobbied strenuously after the Feb. 20 South Carolina primary.Mr. Romney had been eager to tilt the race, and even called Mr. Christie after he ended his campaign to vent about Mr. Trump and say he must be stopped. On the night of the primary, Mr. Romney was close to endorsing Mr. Rubio himself, people familiar with his deliberations said.Yet Mr. Romney pulled back, instead telling advisers that he would take on Mr. Trump directly. After a Tuesday night dinner with former campaign aides, during which he expressed a sense of horror at the Republican race, Mr. Romney made a blunt demand Wednesday on Fox News: Mr. Trump must release his tax returns to prove he was not concealing a \u201cbombshell\u201d political vulnerability.Mr. Trump responded only with casual derision, dismissing Mr. Romney on Twitter as \u201cone of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics.\u201dMr. Romney is expected to withhold his support before the voting this week on the so-called Super Tuesday, but some of his allies have urged him to endorse Mr. Rubio before Michigan and Idaho vote March 8. Mr. Romney grew up in Michigan, and many Idahoans are fellow Mormons.But already, a handful of senior party leaders have struck a conciliatory tone toward Mr. Trump. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said on television that he believed he could work with him as president. Many in the party acknowledged a growing mood of resignation.Fred Malek, the finance chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said the party\u2019s mainstream had simply run up against the limits of its influence.\u201cThere\u2019s no single leader and no single institution that can bring a diverse group called the Republican Party together, behind a single candidate,\u201d Mr. Malek said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201dOn Friday, a few hours after Mr. Christie endorsed him, Mr. Trump collected support from a second governor, who in a radio interview said Mr. Trump could be \u201cone of the greatest presidents.\u201dThat governor was Paul LePage.Advertisement"}

To date, there has been less policy divergence in reality than had been predicted. This observation raises the question of whether there may be limits on policy divergence in current circumstances.

Put differently, predictions that U.S. monetary policy would chart a notably divergent path have been tempered by powerful crosscurrents from abroad.Not to keep you in suspense, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the punchline: the US economy reaps the bulk of the gains from rising demand relative to other countries if and only if that relative rise is perceived by markets as temporary.

He just wanted to make sure that Kensho had pulled the right number \u2014 the overall growth in American payrolls \u2014 from the employment report. It was the least he could do, given that within minutes, at 8:35 a.m., Kensho\u2019s analysis would be made available to employees at Goldman Sachs.In addition to being a customer, Goldman is also Kensho\u2019s largest investor. Nadler, who is 32, spent the rest of the morning checking in with some of the bank\u2019s most regular Kensho users \u2014 a top executive on the options-and-derivatives-trading desks, a fund manager \u2014 then took an Uber down for a lunch meeting at Goldman\u2019s glass tower just off the West Side Highway in Manhattan. While almost everyone in the building dresses in neatly pressed work attire, Nadler rarely deviates from his standard outfit: Louis Vuitton leather sandals and a casual but well-cut T-shirt and pants, both by the designer Alexander Wang. Nadler owns 10 sets of these. His austere aesthetic is informed by the summer vacations he spent in Japan while pursuing a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard, mostly visiting temples and meditating. (\u2018\u2018Kensho\u2019\u2019 is the Japanese term for one of the first states of awareness in the Zen Buddhist progression.) He also wrote a volume of poetry \u2014 imagined ancient love poems \u2014 that Farrar Straus & Giroux will publish later this year.I met with Nadler later that day in his own office, across the street from the Goldman building, on the 45th floor of 1 World Trade Center. His dozen or so employees shared a large room decked out in typical start-up style, including an aquarium and large speakers playing electronic music. Nadler has an office off to the side with little more than a large desk, made out of reclaimed telephone poles, and a large upholstered leather chair with matching ottoman. After closing the door, Nadler, who has curly dark hair and pale skin, sat on the ottoman, folded his bare feet under him and told me about the day\u2019s feedback from Goldman. This included some tips on what they wanted in the next report, and a good dose of amazement at Kensho\u2019s speed. \u2018\u2018People always tell me, \u2018I used to spend two out of five days a week doing this sort of thing,\u2019 or \u2018I used to have a guy whose job it was to do nothing other than this one thing,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Nadler said.This might sound like bragging. But Nadler was primarily recounting those reactions as a way of explaining his concern about the impact that start-ups like his are likely to have on the financial industry. Within a decade, he said, between a third and a half of the current employees in finance will lose their jobs to Kensho and other automation software. It began with the lower-paid clerks, many of whom became unnecessary when stock tickers and trading tickets went electronic. It has moved on to research and analysis, as software like Kensho has become capable of parsing enormous data sets far more quickly and reliably than humans ever could. The next \u2018\u2018tranche,\u2019\u2019 as Nadler puts it, will come from the employees who deal with clients: Soon, sophisticated interfaces will mean that clients no longer feel they need or even want to work through a human being.\u2018\u2018I\u2019m assuming that the majority of those people over a five-to-10-year horizon are not going to be replaced by other people,\u2019\u2019 he said, getting into the flow of his thoughts, which, for Nadler, meant closing his eyes and gesticulating as though he were preaching or playing the piano. \u2018\u2018In 10 years Goldman Sachs will be significantly smaller by head count than it is today.\u2019\u2019Goldman executives are reluctant to discuss the plight of their displaced financial analysts. Several managers I spoke to insisted that Kensho has not yet caused any layoffs, nor is it likely to soon. Nadler had warned me that I would hear something like that. \u2018\u2018When you start talking about automating jobs,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018everybody all of a sudden gets really quiet.\u2019\u2019Goldman employees who lose their jobs to machines are not likely to evoke much pity. But it is exactly Goldman\u2019s privileged status that makes the threat to its workers so interesting. If jobs can be displaced at Goldman, they can probably be displaced even more quickly at other, less sophisticated companies, within the financial industry as well as without.According to the Oxford paper and subsequent research, employment prospects vary significantly by industry. In health care, for example, where human interaction is vital, automation threatens fewer jobs than it does in the labor market as a whole. Taxi and truck drivers, though, face a bleak future given recent advances in self-driving cars. Among better-compensated professions, the Oxford researchers took into account software that can analyze and sort legal documents, doing the work that even well-paid lawyers often spend hours on. Journalists face start-ups like Automated Insights, which is already writing up summaries of basketball games. Finance stood out in particular: Because of the degree to which the industry is built on processing information \u2014 the stuff of digitization \u2014 the research suggested that it has more jobs at high risk of automation than any skilled industry, about 54 percent.The Oxford study received plenty of criticism \u2014 understandably, given the patina of exactness that it tried to apply to a speculative exercise. Nevertheless, the financial industry is taking automation very seriously, both as an opportunity and as a threat. It is one thing to make a few analysts redundant, but automation could put whole business models in peril. Investments in what is known as fintech, or financial technology, tripled between 2013 and 2014 to $12.2 billion, and start-ups are now taking aim at nearly every line of financial business. Decisions about loans are now being made by software that can take into account a variety of finely parsed data about a borrower, rather than just a credit score and a background check. So-called robo-advisers create personalized investment portfolios, obviating the need for stockbrokers and financial advisers. Nearly every Wall Street firm has put out research reports on the tens of billions of dollars of revenue that might be lost to these upstarts in the coming years. Banks are trying to fend off the newcomers by making their own investments in start-ups like Kensho, which has raised more than $25 million so far.The skilled industries that form the bedrock of New York City\u2019s economy have so far largely avoided this sort of transformation, because the work of financial analysts, publishers and designers hasn\u2019t been easy to automate. But to look at a company like Kensho, and the sort of conversation it generates across the financial industry, is to see the degree to which these trends are now confronting industries that used to be thought exempt from this sort of disruption. Last fall, Antony Jenkins, who was dismissed a few months earlier as chief executive of Barclays, the giant British bank, gave a speech in which he said a coming series of \u2018\u2018Uber moments\u2019\u2019 would hit the financial industry.\u2018\u2018I predict that the number of branches and people employed in the financial-services sector may decline by as much as 50 percent,\u2019\u2019 Jenkins told the audience. \u2018\u2018Even in a less-harsh scenario, I expect a decline of at least 20 percent.\u2019\u2019 This process could, in at least some cases, help do away with some of the expensive bloat in the financial system, providing more transparent services with fewer hidden fees. It could also be seen as a satisfying blow against the titans of an industry that only recently almost crashed the world economy. But so far the burden of job losses is stopping just short of the executive suites, even as the gains in efficiency are worsening already troubling levels of income inequality.Some of the venture capitalists backing Kensho have told Nadler that he would be wise to stop talking about the potential job losses at the same banks he is trying to secure as customers. Nadler has told them that he needs to carry on, partly to maintain his intellectual integrity. He often connects his discussion of jobs to his political fund-raising on behalf of candidates who call for a more robust social-safety net. But he also says that his awareness of what his business is both creating and taking away sets him apart as an entrepreneur: It\u2019s his \u2018\u2018edge\u2019\u2019 in a business that is all about competing to predict the future more accurately.Now a sales representative can simply click an icon and access the Kensho interface, which consists of a simple black search bar. Nadler walked me through the process on his own laptop. Type in the word \u2018\u2018Syria,\u2019\u2019 and several groups of events related to Syria\u2019s civil war appear, in much the same way that Google recommends queries based on past searches. Here, among the top event groups, are \u2018\u2018Advances Against ISIS,\u2019\u2019 which includes 25 past events, and \u2018\u2018Major ISIS Advances and Brutal Atrocities,\u2019\u2019 with 105 events.Kensho\u2019s software is constantly tweaking and broadening these suggested search terms, all with little human intervention. In some ways, this is the most sophisticated part of the program. In the past, a trader or analyst would have to search Wikipedia or a news database using whatever keywords came to mind. Kensho\u2019s search engine automatically categorizes events according to abstract features. It has figured out, for instance, that ISIS\u2019s seizure of Palmyra and France\u2019s first airstrike in Syria were both escalations in the civil war there but also that in one of those cases, ISIS was the aggressor while in the other case, it was on the defense. The software also looks for new and unexpected relationships between events and asset prices, allowing it to recommend searches that a user might not have considered. For this feature, Nadler said, he hired one of the machine-learning whizzes who worked on Google\u2019s megacatalog of the world\u2019s libraries.Back on the trading desk, after picking out one group of events \u2014 the 27 incidents of \u2018\u2018Escalations in the Syrian civil war,\u2019\u2019 say \u2014 a sales trader can pick from a series of drop-down menus that narrow the search to a specific time period and a specific set of investments. The broadest set includes the world\u2019s 40 or so major assets, including German stocks, the Australian dollar and a few varieties of crude oil. They can then click on the green Generate Study button, and a few minutes later they\u2019ll have a new page full of charts. Nadler clicked to demonstrate. The top chart showed that the prices of natural gas and crude oil have underperformed in the weeks after past escalations in the war, while Asian stocks and the United States and Canadian dollar pair has outperformed. Scrolling down, we could also see how each event in Syria played out and begin to structure an optimal set of trades based on that history.Nadler closed his laptop. The whole process had taken just a few minutes. Generating a similar query without automation, he said, \u2018\u2018would have taken days, probably 40 man-hours, from people who were making an average of $350,000 to $500,000 a year.\u2019\u2019Kensho\u2019s main office is still in Cambridge, Mass., two floors above an old barbershop, with windows looking out onto Harvard Yard. The 30 or so employees in the large main room look like the kind of bright-eyed kids who in years past might have gone to work for Goldman Sachs. Here, though, they work at standup desks, wear jeans and enjoy the benefits of a Zen room, with pillows and tatami mats for meditation, as well as a game room with chessboards and a poker table.I visited the Cambridge office in December, shortly before Christmas. When I arrived, most of the employees were doing their Secret Santa gift exchange; their laughter frequently trickled back to the conference room where I sat with Nadler and a few of his top deputies. Curious to know how much they all talked about the larger implications of their work, I asked the deputies how quickly the topic of automation and job loss had come up in their relationship with Nadler.\u2018\u2018Pretty much the second sentence,\u2019\u2019 said Matt Taylor, the chief technology officer, who, at 38, is one of the senior citizens of the company.\u2018\u2018This was Day 1,\u2019\u2019 said Martin Camacho, Kensho\u2019s 20-year-old chief architect, who entered Harvard as a freshman when he was 15.Camacho remembered going home one night to Nadler\u2019s apartment during their first summer working on Kensho. They watched the science-fiction film \u2018\u2018Oblivion,\u2019\u2019 about a world populated by alien-generated human clones, and stayed up talking about the socioeconomic implications of the story. More recently, Nadler invited his engineering team to a dinner at one of Cambridge\u2019s nicest restaurants, Henrietta\u2019s Table, for a group conversation about the more distant implications of automation. Nadler said he anticipated some form of strong artificial intelligence, whereby computers in the far future would be smart enough to anticipate our needs and usher in an era of abundance. For the next few decades, though, he predicted a more complicated time \u2014 an interregnum in which the computers are not as smart as people but smart enough to do many of the tasks that make us money.Camacho was less pessimistic than his boss. When computer-assisted math proofs were invented a few years back, he said, it didn\u2019t lead to any decline in the number of math-research jobs. \u2018\u2018I think there will be plenty for everyone to do,\u2019\u2019 Taylor said, agreeing.When I raised the topic of automation with executives at Goldman and beyond, I often heard a similarly optimistic belief that all the new software will free up employees in the financial industry to do other, more valuable things; that it would also create new types of jobs that don\u2019t exist right now. Several executives I spoke with argued that when A.T.M.s were widely deployed, you didn\u2019t suddenly see bank branches disappearing.This is a common criticism of the Oxford report on automation: Even if 47 percent of all current jobs end up being automated, that does not mean that 47 percent of the working population will not have jobs, as many newspaper articles on the report concluded. Cars once displaced lots of coachmen and stable boys but created many more new jobs laying out highways and attending service stations. Nowadays, software that provides financial advice has automated the work of some stockbrokers, but it is also expanding the number of people getting financial advice and the demand for cheap investment products.The lead author on the Oxford paper, Carl Benedikt Frey, told me that he was aware that new technologies created jobs even as they destroyed them. But, Frey was quick to add, just because the total number of jobs stays the same doesn\u2019t mean there are no disruptions along the way. The automation of textile work may not have driven up the national unemployment rate, but vast swathes of the American South suffered all the same. When it comes to those A.T.M.s, there has, in fact, been a recent steady decline in both the number of bank branches and the number of bank tellers, even as the number of low-paid workers in remote call centers has grown.Chavez said Kensho itself was unlikely to displace many employees. The software, he said, was doing something that was previously so time-consuming that it was seldom attempted. (Some users also told me that there were still significant limitations on the sort of events the software could search.) But whatever the impact of Kensho, Chavez\u2019s larger efforts to digitize more of Goldman\u2019s operations are already changing the number and the type of employees at the firm. Over the last few years, the number of campus recruits coming to Goldman from science-and-technology majors has gone up 5 percent each year, while the total head count has barely budged. (Goldman is one of the few companies on Wall Street at which the total number of employees hasn\u2019t dropped significantly.) \u2018\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure there are going to be new jobs 10 or 20 years from now that none of us could even imagine today,\u2019\u2019 Chavez said.Stock trading, one of the earliest areas to go electronic, provides an interesting precedent for how automation can play out in an institution like Goldman. On the company\u2019s trading desks, stocks are now bought and sold by computers instead of people. Chavez says that the advent of computerized trading over the last two decades has reduced the number of Goldman employees who buy and sell American stocks the old-fashioned way \u2014 over the phone \u2014 to four from around 600, but the change in the number of traders tells only part of the story. Some of the traditional traders were replaced by programmers who design and monitor the new trading algorithms. Beyond that, there are now new jobs in the data centers where the high-speed trading takes place.Goldman doesn\u2019t provide numbers on any of this. But Paul Chou, who worked on Goldman\u2019s electronic-trading desks from 2006 to 2010, told me that he would guess that the company probably needed one programmer for every 10 of the old-school traders who lost their jobs. In one sign of the shrinking work force, Goldman moved the last trader out of one of its four Manhattan trading floors last year.The progression of Goldman\u2019s stock-trading operations also illustrates that automation is not an on-off switch. When Chou first joined Goldman, after graduating from M.I.T., part of his job involved logging onto dozens of trading systems and checking on what the algorithms were spitting out to make sure they weren\u2019t making any mistakes before the trades were executed. Chou sat near a woman who had been doing phone-based trading for years. She helped Chou and his young colleagues learn what to look for in a good trade. Over time, though, the programs proved themselves more error-proof than the humans. The woman left Goldman. And then Chou himself created a new program that logged into all the trading systems and pulled everything into a single screen. When he first got it going, he remembers his boss, a programmer himself, turning to Chou and saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t even know why I show up to work anymore.\u2019\u2019The software Chou designed made it possible for him to dedicate himself to higher-level work, researching new trading strategies for the computers. This was more satisfying than all the monitoring he had been doing, but eventually it became too repetitive as well. Chou left Goldman in 2010 for Silicon Valley and now runs LedgerX, an options exchange that he founded with his wife and two others. The team he left at Goldman was smaller than it was when he arrived.Over the course of my conversations with Nadler, he backed away from the notion that Kensho will destroy jobs at Goldman itself. But he said he had no doubt that Kensho and other financial start-ups would eliminate jobs as they expanded across the industry and that the pace of the losses would be much faster outside Goldman than inside. After the end of Goldman\u2019s period of exclusivity with Kensho last summer, Nadler signed contracts to roll out the software at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.The number of jobs that these banks will support in the future will be influenced by much more than just software. Banks are currently cutting back in response to slower-than-expected economic growth and new regulations since the financial crisis. But these factors are also encouraging all the banks to look for any place where they can find a cheaper and more transparent way to do jobs that are currently being done by expensive and unreliable humans.When I asked Chavez whether the job losses were likely to continue to outpace the gains, he reacted with what seemed like genuine uncertainty. \u2018\u2018That is one of the most interesting questions of our time,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2018\u2018Technology is becoming more labor-saving and less job-creating,\u2019\u2019 Frey said.One theory for why this might be happening is that many of the recent technological advances have been in software rather than hardware. While a company like IBM or Dell needed employees to build each new computer for every new customer, software like Facebook and Kensho can be replicated endlessly, at near-zero marginal cost. When Chou came up with the software that automatically logged onto dozens of trading systems, it could essentially have been rolled out across all of Goldman\u2019s trading desks around the world the next day. This is very different from the 1970s, when Detroit would need to retrofit its car-manufacturing plants one at a time, after the robots themselves were actually built. The difference is what convinced Chou, after his time at Goldman Sachs and in Silicon Valley, that this phase of automation would play out differently from past ones.\u2018\u2018We are not coming up with new jobs as fast as we are replacing them,\u2019\u2019 Chou told me.This observation appears to be borne out by Kensho. In less than three years, Nadler\u2019s company has expanded to serve three of the world\u2019s largest banks and has needed only around 50 employees to do so, just enough to fill two relatively small offices. Recently, Nadler\u2019s New York staff moved to a bigger office in 1 World Trade Center. It has more room for desks so that Kensho can expand. But most of the additional space is taken up by a kitchen, a pool table and a putting green.The growth has made Kensho worth hundreds of millions of dollars and turned Nadler into a millionaire many times over, at least when his stake in the company is taken into account. But it\u2019s not clear how beneficial his company will be to the American labor market as a whole. Back when I first met Nadler, for a lunch last summer, he wasn\u2019t too proud to admit this. \u2018\u2018The cynical answer that another tech entrepreneur would give you is that we\u2019re creating new jobs, we\u2019re creating technology jobs,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve created, on paper at least, more than a dozen millionaires.\u2018\u2018That might help people sleep better at night,\u2019\u2019 he continued, \u2018\u2018but we are creating a very small number of high-paying jobs in return for destroying a very large number of fairly high-paying jobs, and the net-net to society, absent some sort of policy intervention or new industry that no one\u2019s thought of yet to employ all those people, is a net loss.\u2019\u2019Nathaniel Popper is a financial reporter for The Times and the author of \u2018\u2018Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tough Start to the Auction Year", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byA \u201ccorrection,\u201d economists generally agree, is a decline of at least 10 percent in the value of a stock, commodity, bond or market index. By this definition, the art auction market has already undergone a significant correction from the highs it reached in 2015.Last week, sales totals at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s evening auctions of contemporary art were, respectively, 50 percent and 44 percent less than last year\u2019s. This month, the take from the auction houses\u2019 evening sales of Impressionist and modern art fell 35 percent at Christie\u2019s and 50 percent at Sotheby\u2019s.\u201cThe market peaked in the first half of 2015 and the second half saw a softening,\u201d said Todd Levin, an art adviser in New York. \u201cI expect that to continue in 2016.\u201dThe main reason for the slump, experts said, is that buyers have been unnerved by financial turbulence in the wake of slowing growth in China.This was, of course, only the first big round of auctions this year. And there were a number of sales that indicated if the artist, the work, the provenance and the estimate ticked the right boxes, bullish prices could still be achieved.At Sotheby\u2019s Impressionist and modern art sale on Feb. 3, for example, the 11.6 million pounds, or about $16.7 million \u2014 almost double the low estimate \u2014 paid by Ben Frija, an Oslo dealer, for Rodin\u2019s 1890-91 bronze \u201cIris, Messag\u00e8re des Dieux\u201d showed what wealthy collectors were prepared to pay for the few large-scale casts made in the sculptor\u2019s lifetime that remain in private hands.And there was even a cheeky \u201cflip\u201d at that Sotheby\u2019s sale. Picasso\u2019s 1933 charcoal drawing \u201cLe Peintre et Son Mod\u00e8le\u201d had been bought by its seller in October for about $1.2 million from the New York dealer Richard L. Feigen at the Frieze Masters Fair in London. Five months later, it managed to find a telephone buyer for \u00a31.4 million with fees, about $2.1 million.There was also successful profit-taking at Christie\u2019s contemporary auction on Feb. 11 when two telephone bidders pushed Peter Doig\u2019s 1991 painting \u201cThe Architect\u2019s Home in the Ravine\u201d to the evening\u2019s highest price of \u00a311.3 million with fees, against a low estimate of \u00a310 million. Guaranteed to sell by a third party, the work had been acquired by its European owner for \u00a37.7 million three years earlier at Christie\u2019s.Such individual successes might have created a sense in the goldfish-bowl environment of the salesrooms that it would be business as usual. But then cracks appeared in the glass.Christie\u2019s failed to find a buyer for Yves Klein\u2019s 1960 \u201cAnthropometrie Sans Titre,\u201d estimated at \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. Sotheby\u2019s most highly valued work the previous evening had been a 1990 Gerhard Richter, \u201cAbstraktes Bild,\u201d valued at \u00a314 million to \u00a320 million, which two dealers with knowledge of the matter said was owned by the London collectors Eskander and Fatima Maleki. The work was withdrawn just before the sale for fear of being \u201cburned\u201d by failure at a public auction, according to dealers.Neither the Klein nor the Richter were protected by financing from the auction house or a third party, as they might well have been early last year.At last February\u2019s evening sale in London, for example, Christie\u2019s guaranteed the sale of a Cy Twombly painting valued at \u00a316 million. This February, the company guaranteed just two lots with a combined low estimate of \u00a3240,000.\u201cSome of the blockbuster lots are going to return to the private market,\u201d said Mr. Levin, the New York art adviser. \u201cThe lessening of guarantees will impact on the auctions. A softer market favors private sales.\u201dHe added that owners were fearful of damaging the value of their artworks by unsuccessful exposure at auction, and that often, for various reasons, they did not want to be seen to be selling their art.A far more significant test of the market will come in May, when Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips hold a \u201cgigaweek\u201d of marquee auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art. Last May, Christie\u2019s evening sales of 20th- and 21st-century art raised a total of $1.4 billion, including $179.4 million for Picasso\u2019s 1955 \u201cLes Femmes d\u2019Alger (Version \u2018O\u2019).\u201d More than half of the 117 lots offered in those Christie\u2019s sales were supported by guarantees.\u201cGuarantees distorted and inflated the top end of the market,\u201d said the London dealer Alan Hobart, who has been a prominent buyer of trophy-quality 20th-century works at auction. \u201cBut there are still going to be sales in May, and there will still be deals to be done.\u201dOther sectors of the auction market showed similar dips this year.Sales of classic cars were down 14 percent, to $250.6 million, at the annual series of specialist auctions in Arizona in the last two weeks of January. On Feb. 5, the Paris auctioneer Artcurial sold a 1957 Ferrari 335 Sport Scaglietti to an American collector for a low estimate 32.1 million euros, about $36 million \u2014 a salesroom high for any car in Europe. But other auctions held during the French capital\u2019s \u201cRetromobile\u201d week this February struggled with oversupply. Bonhams sold just 58 percent of the 130 cars it offered on Feb. 4 at the Grand Palais.And even when sales seemed robust, they came with a caveat. Sotheby\u2019s New York old masters sale late last month raised $97.5 million, the auction house\u2019s highest total for a New York \u201cMasters Week\u201d in five years.But almost a third of the total came from the $30.5 million paid by the J. Paul Getty Museum on Jan. 28 for the Orazio Gentileschi painting \u201cDanae.\u201d A selling rate of just 50 percent for the remaining 60 lots in that evening sale was a reality check.Sotheby\u2019s, which in January spent around $85 million to acquire the advisory company Art Agency, Partners, has had the sobering experience of trying to claw back the $515 million it paid to auction the collection of a former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, who died in April. It recouped $437.8 million last year and on Jan. 27, a sale of Mr. Taubman\u2019s old masters added an additional $24.1 million.On paper, then, Sotheby\u2019s has lost at least $50 million on the Taubman collection. But by including the value of unsold lots, the auction house estimates the shortfall at just $6 million, plus a further $6 million in \u201csale related\u201d expenses, according to a Jan. 21 Securities and Exchange Commission filing.The auction house\u2019s stock price has fallen by more than 40 percent (it closed at at $22.88 on Thursday in New York) since Tad Smith\u2019s appointment as president and chief executive in March 2015. Profits have been hit by the Taubman guarantee and by downturns across a range of collecting sectors.Melanie Clore, Sotheby\u2019s chairman of Europe and worldwide co-chairman of Impressionist and modern art, said on Monday that she would be leaving the company after almost 35 years. Her departure comes after 80 employees took voluntary buyouts late last year, at a projected cost to Sotheby\u2019s of about $40 million. Ms. Clore said in an email that she informed Sotheby\u2019s in the fall that she wanted to leave.There is at the moment an enormous amount of uncertainty in the global economy, and this is affecting the art market.A report issued on Tuesday by Citi Private Bank\u2019s art advisory and finance division predicted that the slowdown in China would have an impact on the top end of the Impressionist, modern and contemporary markets. But, the report said, \u201cart remains a valuable asset.\u201dWe are likely to discover just how valuable over the next few months.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge in Dewey & LeBoeuf Fraud Case Whittles Down Charges", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byAn accounting fraud case at a once-prominent New York law firm that captured front-page headlines in 2014 is now looking more ordinary.On Friday, a New York State Supreme Court judge threw out all the grand larceny charges against the two remaining defendants stemming from the collapse of the law firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf, in 2012.\u201cWe are very gratified by the court\u2019s decision,\u201d said Andrew J. Frisch, a lawyer for Mr. Sanders.The latest whittling down of the criminal case is another blow to Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, in one of the most notable white-collar cases filed by his office.Earlier this year, Mr. Vance agreed to deferred prosecution deals to dismiss eventually the charges against two of the original four defendants, including Steven H. Davis, the former chairman of Dewey.Afterward, prosecutors dismissed many of the original charges against the three men.The fourth defendant, Zachary Warren, a low-level employee who has since become a lawyer, recently reached a deferred prosecution agreement just a month before he was scheduled to go on trial.Austin V. Campriello, a lawyer for Mr. DiCarmine, the former executive director of Dewey, said he hoped prosecutors would consider offering a deferred prosecution agreement to his client after reassessing what remains of the case.Speaking outside the courtroom, Mr. Campriello said Mr. Vance\u2019s prosecutorial team needed to re-examine the case because \u201cthe judge has dismissed the heart of the people\u2019s case.\u201dJoan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vance, had no comment on Justice Stolz\u2019s decision.In March 2014, when prosecutors announced a 106-count indictment in the case, Mr. Vance said the four original defendants had helped orchestrate a nearly four-year scheme to manipulate the law firm\u2019s books. The men, he said, were trying to keep the law firm afloat during the financial crisis, in the process defrauding bank lenders and institutional investors in a debt offering.The indictment painted a portrait of a law firm run like a criminal enterprise. Mr. Vance said those at the top of Dewey had \u201cdirected employees to hide the firm\u2019s true financial condition from creditors, investors, auditors and even partners of the firm.\u201dTwo years later, the guts of the prosecution\u2019s case have been reduced to six counts against Mr. Sanders, the firm\u2019s former chief financial officer, and Mr. DiCarmine.Justice Stolz, in a ruling from the bench, said he was dismissing the 15 grand larceny charges because no reasonable jury would be able to convict Mr. Sanders or Mr. DiCarmine on them.The judge, however, denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the still pending conspiracy, scheme to defraud and securities fraud charges.A conviction on any one of the grand larceny charges could have resulted in a sentence ranging from eight and a third years in prison to 25 years. A conviction carries a mandatory prison sentence of one year.By contrast, the maximum sentence on the scheme to defraud charge could result in a sentence of up to four years in prison. But a judge is not required to impose a prison sentence as part of the punishment.Even before the judge tossed out the grand larceny charges, prosecutors said a second trial would be shorter and simpler than the first.In interviews after the trial, a number of jurors said prosecutors had made the case too complex by bringing too many charges and letting the proceedings stretch through the summer.Seven former Dewey employees, most of them low-level workers who had pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to manipulate the firm\u2019s finances, testified at the first trial. It is not known if prosecutors will call them as witnesses again. Many of them are not expected to receive prison time.The star witness at the first trial was Francis J. Canellas, the firm\u2019s former finance director, who told the jury that the plan to manipulate the financial books and records of Dewey was first discussed over steak dinner at Del Frisco\u2019s in Midtown Manhattan in late December 2008. Mr. Canellas, who pleaded guilty to a single count of grand larceny in return for a more lenient sentence, testified that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Warren attended that dinner.On Monday, lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed its own fraud lawsuit against several former Dewey executives, told a federal judge that the S.E.C. had reached a partial settlement with Mr. Canellas in that litigation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Plan for Puerto Rico Favors Pensions Over Bondholders", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 If it\u2019s up to the Treasury Department, public employees in Puerto Rico who were promised pensions could be better off than investors who bought the island\u2019s bonds.A broad plan being put forward by the Treasury Department to ease Puerto Rico\u2019s financial crisis would put pension payments to retirees ahead of payments to bondholders \u2014 a move that some experts fear could rattle the larger municipal bond market.The proposal was being driven by evidence that Puerto Rico\u2019s pension system is nearly out of money, leaving retirees who are dependent on it financially vulnerable.\u201cThe major problem is, the entire pension system is close to being depleted,\u201d said Antonio Weiss, counselor to Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary. \u201cBut 330,000 people depend on it. It\u2019s unfunded, and they have to be protected.\u201dShielding retirees from pension cuts, the thinking goes, would not only protect thousands of older residents on the island, but it might also encourage younger retirees to stay there, rather than move to the United States mainland in search of new jobs and incomes.Out-migration is considered a prime cause of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial tailspin, because it shrinks the island\u2019s economy, leaving fewer people and fewer dollars to support the crushing debt.Puerto Rico is said to have about $72 billion of financial debt outstanding, most of it in the form of municipal bonds. By some estimates, it has incurred an additional $43 billion in unfunded pension obligations.But deciding that pensioners\u2019 interests should be put above those of bondholders \u2014 if a choice must be made \u2014 is not without certain risks.Some public-finance experts say they fear that if Puerto Rico can renege on promises to pay debts to investors, while sparing retirees, other municipalities might try to do the same, casting a pall over the larger market in municipal bonds, where American towns and cities have gone for decades to get the money they need to build roads, schools and other public works.If Puerto Rico gets special treatment, \u201cyou have huge contagion risk to the entire municipal market,\u201d Andrew N. Rosenberg, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, said at a recent gathering of creditor representatives.Treasury officials said such concerns were unfounded. The framework they are proposing would be designed only for distressed United States territories, like Puerto Rico, and could not be used by states or municipalities on the mainland.Officials pointed to a report by an investment firm, Nuveen Asset Management, which said, \u201cWe believe most institutional investors understand Puerto Rico\u2019s unique situation and the coming debt restructuring will not create widespread credit implications.\u201dStill, moving public pensions to the top of the stack would infuriate at least some bondholders \u2014 especially those who paid close to face value for their bonds years ago, when they were still rated investment grade, and who had expected to hold them to maturity and get all their principal back.Although the bondholders have often been portrayed as deep-pocketed vultures since Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis began, many of them are small investors, themselves trying to save for a comfortable retirement.\u201cMost Puerto Rican debt is held by individuals,\u201d said Thomas Moers Mayer, a lawyer representing two large mutual fund companies, Franklin Advisers and OppenheimerFunds, which together own about $10 billion in Puerto Rican debt securities. \u201cThey are mostly over 65, and they mostly have incomes of less than $100,000 a year. They are not vulture funds. They are your friends and neighbors.\u201dSome Republican senators \u2014 notably Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah \u2014 whose constituents are among the bondholders, have expressed similar views. Puerto Rico\u2019s debt is unusually widely held because it offered above average yields and interest that was exempt from federal, state and local taxes, no matter where the buyer lived.Treasury officials have said they are willing to work with Congress to find a suitable way of handling the different categories of creditors.Financial help for Puerto Rico will be the subject of a hearing on Thursday by the House Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. Weiss is scheduled to be the sole witness.Any rescue plan would need congressional approval and various committees in the House and Senate are weighing ways to help the island reduce its debt and better manage its economy.Paul D. Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House, has set a deadline of March 30 for a House version of a bill. A version of Treasury\u2019s plan was outlined in a draft bill presented to a Senate committee; it has not been voted on.The draft, obtained by The New York Times, also calls for a five-member \u201cfiscal reform assistance council\u201d appointed by the president to hold the island to meaningful budgeting, disclosure and fiscal reform practices. The board would have the power to make across-the-board budget cuts if necessary.Members of Congress, especially Republicans, have expressed concern about whether Puerto Rico has the wherewithal to manage its future finances, even if it gets help in the short term. Credit markets have also been reluctant to invest further in Puerto Rico\u2019s bonds without some assurances that the island\u2019s finances will be better managed in the years to come.The idea of an oversight board has rankled residents, however, who say it has overtones of colonialism.The part of the proposal that gives priority to pensioners has received little attention. Currently, Puerto Rico\u2019s laws and Constitution give top priority to general-obligation bonds \u2014 the type backed by the government\u2019s \u201cgood faith, credit and taxing power.\u201dPuerto Rico is not unique in this respect; for decades, the general-obligation bonds of all the states have been marketed as virtually default-proof, safe enough for widows and orphans. The concept was developed after the Civil War, as a way to rebuild investor trust after a number of notorious bond defaults.Public workers\u2019 pensions, the center found, fall on a second hierarchy altogether, which sets priorities for the government\u2019s operational disbursements. Here again, however, payments due on general-obligation bonds come first, followed by payments due on legally binding contracts. Outlays for pensions come third.That means that under existing law in Puerto Rico, if there is not enough money to pay both general-obligation bonds and public retirees\u2019 pensions, the money would go to bondholders.But the Treasury\u2019s proposed restructuring framework would change that. It would require that the restructuring plan \u201cnot unduly impair the claims of any class of pensioners.\u201dGeneral-obligation bondholders, on the other hand, would get such protection only \u201cif feasible,\u201d according to the draft that outlined the plan.This new legal framework is being created because Puerto Rico, as a United States territory, has no access to bankruptcy laws, where complicated claims by creditors can be worked out in a court under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge.Puerto Rico has already defaulted on some of its bonds. More payments are due in May and June. Bonds are now nearly impossible to sell, and members of Congress, especially Democrats, as well as financial experts say the island\u2019s troubles will become increasingly enormous if some kind of restructuring framework is not approved soon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Christie Splits With His Past in Backing Trump", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported by_____On the night he cruised to a landslide re-election in 2013, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, already eyeing the presidency, had a message for fellow Republicans outside his Democratic-leaning state.\u201cWe don\u2019t just show up in the places where we\u2019re comfortable. We show up in the places where we\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d he said, lecturing his party about the need to be inclusive.But Mr. Christie\u2019s carefully calibrated endorsement of Mr. Trump \u2014 though not all his policies \u2014 reflected the competing impulses he and many of his supporters are now feeling, as Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of resentment politics resonates and he enters Super Tuesday the favorite to win the nomination.The governor\u2019s decision, which caught some of his closest supporters off guard, has nudged some of his allies to do the same, horrified others and created a loyalty test that is forcing many to confront which runs deeper: their devotion to the governor or their unease with Mr. Trump.\u201cDonald Trump is unfit to be president,\u201d Ms. Whitman said. \u201cHe is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears. Trump would take America on a dangerous journey. Christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly. The governor is mistaken if he believes he can now count on my support, and I call on Christie\u2019s donors and supporters to reject the governor and Donald Trump outright. I believe they will. For some of us, principle and country still matter.\u201dMany of Mr. Christie\u2019s backers were more reluctant to criticize him so bluntly. But there was an unmistakable sense of shock among his allies that he would link himself to a candidate many mainstream Republicans consider unserious if not a menace to the party and country.\u201cI remain close to Chris, but I don\u2019t get it,\u201d said Bobbie Kilberg, a Northern Virginia technology executive and one of his leading fund-raisers. Ms. Kilberg is now supporting Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.Ray Washburne, Mr. Christie\u2019s finance chairman, was just as confounded. Asked if Mr. Christie was risking his reputation for being an inclusive-minded Republican by supporting Mr. Trump, Mr. Washburne said: \u201cThat\u2019s sure what a lot of people think. I\u2019m still shocked and dismayed.\u201dBut then he quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m loyal to Chris,\u201d and said he was mostly surprised that the endorsement had come so soon.Still, Mr. Washburne said it had prompted emails and text messages from fellow donors, with some asking him how they could get on board with Mr. Trump and others asking in distress, \u201cWhat is going on with Chris?\u201dMr. Washburne, a Dallas-area entrepreneur, indicated he was uncertain about whether he would support Mr. Trump. But he gave voice to the calculation many believe Mr. Christie has made: \u201cIf Trump wins, Chris will have been the first guy who jumped on the boat with him.\u201dSome of Mr. Christie\u2019s supporters joined him: Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine came out for Mr. Trump, and Kraig Paulsen, the former Iowa House speaker, said in an interview that he was \u201cabsolutely open\u201d to Mr. Trump.But among the political strategists who supported Mr. Christie\u2019s presidential bid, there was palpable unease.\u201cI was honored to support Governor Christie, and I believed he would make a great president,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cBut I absolutely and unequivocally disagree with his endorsement of Donald Trump.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.The governor made his decision after little deliberation with his staff. Only one adviser, William J. Palatucci, accompanied him to Texas for Friday\u2019s endorsement. Mr. Washburne said he found out only about 30 minutes before the news broke in a phone call from Mr. Palatucci.\u201cThis is why you should not make decisions in anger,\u201d said one friend of Mr. Christie\u2019s, who asked for anonymity to talk candidly about the governor\u2019s decision to back Mr. Trump.Mr. Christie, according to those who have spoken to him, does not think Mr. Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas are qualified to be president and believes Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who aggressively sought his support and with whom he is friendly, has no path to the nomination.In New Jersey, the reaction to Mr. Christie\u2019s endorsement has been a combination of surprise and, among Democrats, thinly disguised glee. Mr. Christie invested considerable political capital at home reaching out to minority groups, often offering tart words for those Republicans who he thought were closed-minded.\u201cIt\u2019s just crazy, and I\u2019m tired of dealing with the crazies,\u201d he said in 2011 when conservatives questioned his appointment of a Muslim to a state judgeship.Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-right brand of politics is unlikely to play well in a suburban, moderate state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate in nearly three decades.State Senator Richard L. Codey, a Democrat who was a former governor of New Jersey, said he was stunned, despite Mr. Christie\u2019s previous praise of Mr. Trump. \u201cI kept saying to myself, when he was sucking up, that\u2019s about legal work or something down the road,\u201d Mr. Codey said. \u201cNow it\u2019s just like \u2014 oh, geez. I don\u2019t know where this guy can go where he\u2019s not going to be booed.\u201dBut so far, at least, New Jersey Republicans have stuck with Mr. Christie. Jon M. Bramnick, the Republican leader in the State Assembly, said he was conferring with other party leaders about the presidential race but expected to follow Mr. Christie\u2019s lead in backing Mr. Trump.Mr. Bramnick, a potential candidate for governor in 2017, said he believed Mr. Christie\u2019s endorsement was based on his friendship with Mr. Trump.\u201cI intend to support the governor\u2019s choice here, because Trump has the most nexus with New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Bramnick said. \u201cHe has golf courses here. He knows New Jersey pretty well. There\u2019s no real connection between the other candidates and New Jersey.\u201d It was possible, Mr. Bramnick said, that Republican leaders would make a move en masse in the presidential race as soon as this week.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Are We?", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byI find this election bizarre for many reasons but none more than this: If I were given a blank sheet of paper and told to write down America\u2019s three greatest sources of strength, they would be \u201ca culture of entrepreneurship,\u201d \u201can ethic of pluralism\u201d and the \u201cquality of our governing institutions.\u201d And yet I look at the campaign so far and I hear leading candidates trashing all of them.Donald Trump is running against pluralism. Bernie Sanders shows zero interest in entrepreneurship and says the Wall Street banks that provide capital to risk-takers are involved in \u201cfraud,\u201d and Ted Cruz speaks of our government in the same way as the anti-tax zealot Grover Norquist, who says we should shrink government \u201cto the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\u201d (Am I a bad person if I hope that when Norquist slips in that bathtub and has to call 911, no one answers?)I don\u2019t remember an election when the pillars of America\u2019s strength were so under attack \u2014 and winning applause, often from young people!Trump\u2019s famous hat says \u201cMake America great again.\u201d You can\u2019t do that if your message to Hispanics and Muslims is: Get out or stay away. We have an immigration problem. It\u2019s an outrage that we can\u2019t control our border, but both parties have been complicit \u2014 Democrats because they saw new voters coming across and Republicans because they saw cheap labor coming across. But we can fix the border without turning every Hispanic into a rapist or Muslim into a terrorist.Trump seized on immigration as an emotional wedge to rally his base against \u201cthe other\u201d and to blame \u201cthe other\u201d for lost jobs, even though more jobs, particularly low-skilled jobs, are lost to microchips, not Mexicans.Just to remind again: We have twice elected a black man whose grandfather was a Muslim and who defeated a woman to run against a Mormon! Who does that? That is such a source of strength, such a magnet for the best talent in the world. Yet Trump, starting with his \u201cbirther\u201d crusade, has sought to undermine that uniqueness rather than celebrate it.Sanders seems to me like someone with a good soul, and he is right that Wall Street excesses helped tank the economy in 2008. But thanks to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, that can\u2019t easily happen again.I\u2019d take Sanders more seriously if he would stop bleating about breaking up the big banks and instead breathed life into what really matters for jobs: nurturing more entrepreneurs and starter-uppers. I never hear Sanders talk about where employees come from. They come from employers \u2014 risk-takers, people ready to take a second mortgage to start a business. If you want more employees, you need more employers, not just government stimulus.In short, we\u2019re not socialists.Unlike Sanders, Ted Cruz does not have a good soul. He brims with hate, and his trashing of Washington, D.C., is despicable. I can\u2019t defend every government regulation. But I know this: As the world gets faster and more interdependent, the quality of your governing institutions will matter more than ever, and ours are still pretty good. I wonder how much the average Russian would pay to have our F.B.I. or Justice Department for a day, or how much a Chinese city dweller would pay for a day of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or Environmental Protection Agency? Cruz wraps himself in an American flag and spits on all the institutions that it represents.America didn\u2019t become the richest country in the world by practicing socialism, or the strongest country by denigrating its governing institutions, or the most talent-filled country by stoking fear of immigrants. It got here via the motto \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d \u2014 Out of Many, One.Our forefathers so cherished that motto they didn\u2019t put it on a hat. They put it on coins and then on the dollar bill. For a guy with so many of those, Trump should have noticed by now.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peggy Siegal, Best Hostess in a Supporting Role", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byTo Ms. Siegal, however, the ascendence seemed utterly natural.\u201cAs a Jewish princess from New Jersey,\u201d she said, \u201cI always wanted to be a queen.\u201dFor anyone who knows Ms. Siegal \u2014 and above a certain rung in this city\u2019s social stratosphere, who doesn\u2019t? \u2014 that story says it all.Irrepressible, truncheon-blunt and forever pushing the boundaries between \u201cno\u201d and \u201cmaybe,\u201d Ms. Siegal, 68, has employed sharp elbows and inexhaustible energy reservoirs to claim a unique social position in New York and the Hamptons: as a host for hire for clubby, insider-only film screenings and dinners for the influential, she stands at the crossroads of Hollywood power and New York society (or what\u2019s left of it), functioning as a spin doctor, salonista, celebrity confidante and, occasionally, bouncer.7 PhotosCertainly, her business is changing, as studios pay closer attention to the bottom line and competitors look to siphon clients. Even so, after 30 years, Ms. Siegal remains Hollywood\u2019s secret weapon in New York, particularly during the breathless sprint known as Oscar campaign season.It was a crisp afternoon in early January, and Ms. Siegal stood at the base of the stairs of Kappo Masa, the celestially expensive Japanese restaurant beneath the Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue. She wore a Chanel-inspired wool miniskirt and jumper, and her hair, once a spiky confection that veered into Joan Jett territory, had been trimmed into a floppy-banged wedge that recalled an English schoolboy.She was fulminating about the red carpet. Of her many tirades, it is among her favorites: \u201cThe red carpet has become nothing but a screaming match for, \u2018Who are you wearing?\u2019 I find that so intellectually insulting to these geniuses, the filmmakers. The girls are nothing more than fashion shills, and the men, too, are saying nothing more than, \u2018I\u2019m wearing Tom Ford,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m wearing Armani.\u2019\u201d\u201cYou might as well have everyone march down the red carpet and go home,\u201d she said. \u201cWho needs the movie?\u201dAlthough Ms. Siegal likes to say that her lunches are basically \u201ca press conference wrapped around a piece of chicken,\u201d they are serious business for studios, especially this time of year. This lunch, for example, was just days before ballots for Oscar nominations were due.Ms. Siegal\u2019s screenings give media insiders an incentive to sit through the film on the big screen and spend an afternoon discussing it with other cinephiles, while still adhering to the rules. Such soft-sell marketing can be crucial, said Cynthia Swartz, whose company, Strategy PR/Consulting, helps studios devise Oscar campaigns, particularly since \u201ca year like this is really close, and every vote is going to count.\u201dAs the producer Jerry Bruckheimer put it, Ms. Siegal \u201chas a way getting the filmmakers and actors to sit and talk with the people who actually vote, and make it interesting for both sides,\u201d adding, \u201cit certainly helps in the voting.\u201dAnd few people have done it better. In an industry where publicists come and go, Ms. Siegal has lasted for 30 years, even as the era of publicist as star seems to be passing.One mentor, Bobby Zarem, is now living in Savannah, Ga.; another, Lois Smith, died in 2012. While fellow boldface names in the business have worked to extend their reach (Nadine Johnson has broad portfolio of clients in art, fashion, real estate and technology; Lizzie Grubman has ventured into branding and talent management), Ms. Siegal has made herself a force in the business by dominating a highly specific niche: A-list screening events.She has faced challenges, most clearly from Andrew Saffir, whose rival marketing company, the Cinema Society, has been gaining momentum in recent years. (Darin Pfeiffer, a former employee, has also started his own events business.) But no one has managed to supplant her.After three decades of Malibu weddings, Greenwich polo matches and Hamptons barbecues, Ms. Siegal knows how to draw influencers. She maintains a database of some 30,000 contacts, she says, broken down by profession (she has a filmmaker list, a finance list, an art list) and nationality (a British list, a German list).Even so, just as Martin Scorsese keeps going back to Leonardo DiCaprio for his films, Ms. Siegal tends to traffic in some familiar faces: Charlie Rose, Barbara Walters and Martha Stewart in media; Michael Douglas, Darren Aronofsky and Sofia Coppola in film. The actor Bob Balaban is such a frequent guest that he may as well be her mascot.Typical of a Peggy Siegal event, the lemon-yellow banquettes at Kappo Masa were dotted with highly familiar faces that day.After lunch, Mr. DiCaprio, microphone in hand, perched on a tall wooden chair and recounted the crew\u2019s experiences in the subzero wilds of Alberta, Canada. Committed to shooting in natural light, they had only a short window each day to get the shot, which was difficult on days in which \u201cour entire set became a frozen popsicle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so cold out, the cameras wouldn\u2019t operate.\u201dTo Ms. Siegal, who friends say is something of a Nostradamus when it comes to Oscar prognostication, Mr. DiCaprio is a near lock for best actor.\u201cMaking this film was a survival contest, and that\u2019s what has resonated with voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHe survived the elements. He gained weight, just like De Niro.\u201d And, she noted, he ended up eating the liver of a buffalo. \u201cYou can\u2019t get more authentic than that.\u201dBesides, she added, \u201che\u2019s had six nominations. He\u2019s due.\u201dIn addition to making sure the talent and the influencers are spread around the room (the biggest talent matched with the biggest journalists), she said she tries to do a \u201cpersonality matchup\u201d at each table, a form of matchmaking: \u201cOn one side is their best friend, on the other side is their new best friend.\u201dLike a marathoner at Mile 7, she was getting up to cruising speed with her second of five events that day, a personal record (the day began with a brunch for \u201cThe Hateful Eight\u201d featuring Samuel L. Jackson and ended with a Sylvester Stallone dinner for \u201cCreed\u201d).But if the pace was grinding her down, the strain did not show in her face.That face.As her friend Michael Douglas said, \u201cPeggy looks the same as she did in 1985.\u201d Pushing 70, her skin is buttery smooth, her crow\u2019s-feet but a hint. That\u2019s the nice way to say it. Considering that she is pushing 70, it is natural to assume she has had work done. That would be the not-so-nice-way to put it, at least with most women. For Ms. Siegal, it\u2019s a compliment.To her, cosmetic surgery is just another weapon in a woman\u2019s arsenal, along with Oscar de la Renta gowns. \u201cThe best way to combat gender and age discrimination is to knock them out when you walk into a room,\u201d she said.Whether knocking them out or knocking them over, it\u2019s fair to say that Ms. Siegal makes her presence felt. Brash, profane and polarizing, she has a old-school showbiz personality that seems lifted from \u201cSweet Smell of Success.\u201dWith those in positions of power, she knows how to stroke and coddle (she famously signs off on emails \u201cXOXO Peggy\u201d \u2014 even, seemingly, when mass-emailed by assistants).She can also bare fangs. Joanna Molloy, a longtime gossip columnist for The Daily News, recalled a lunch at Michael\u2019s where a waiter asked if they would like to hear the specials. \u201cDon\u2019t even bother,\u201d Ms. Siegal barked at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably get it wrong, and I know what I want.\u201d (\u201cShe\u2019s one tough lady,\u201d Ms. Molloy said).Reporters who cross her can usually expect a volcanic response.Paula Froelich, a former reporter for the New York Post\u2019s Page Six column, recalls Ms. Siegal lambasting her over an offending item during an event at Monkey Bar. First, Ms. Froelich heard a furious shriek over her shoulder, as Ms. Siegal approached her, violently stabbing a finger in the air as she demanded an apology. The anger was so intense that Ms. Froelich\u2019s back was pressed against the wall. \u201cShe didn\u2019t touch me,\u201d Ms. Froelich said. \u201cIt was just the power of her emotional force.\u201dIn a rare gesture in the gossip world, Ms. Froelich apologized. \u201cThe older I get,\u201d she said, \u201cthe more I say, \u2018Go, Team Peggy.\u2019 She\u2019s the Sue Mengers of P.R. She\u2019s an original, and to me that\u2019s the highest compliment in this homogenized world.\u201dMs. Siegal\u2019s quirks extend to her memory, which can be highly selective, to say the least. While she can rattle off a social register\u2019s worth of details about seemingly hundreds of friends on the A-list \u2014 family trees, employment history, children\u2019s birthdays \u2014 she sometimes has trouble remembering the names of her staff, she admitted. \u201cI literally have to put name tags on the wall so I know who they are,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise, I call them \u2018you\u2019 or \u2018the little one.\u2019\u201dEven so, two former employees said her reputation as a tyrannical boss is overblown. \u201cIt was run-of-the-mill Hollywood yelling,\u201d one said. \u201cShe would get upset, it would pass.\u201d(Many have gone on to land plum jobs in the industry, too; Gigi Semone is the executive director of the Governor\u2019s Office of Motion Picture and Television Development; Elizabeth Petit and Debra Nathin Solomons went on to prominent jobs in the New York publicity offices for 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros., respectively.)Ms. Siegal said that she has taken steps to rein in her temper.\u201cI went to a Freudian analyst a thousand years ago and told him I was always late and always yelling,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Buy a watch and be explicit.\u2019\u201d\u201cMiscommunication is what sends me into a rage,\u201d she said.\u201cFor Peggy,\u201d he added, \u201cthat was not even the most minor of hurdles.\u201dRichard Johnson of the Page Six gossip column often has tarred her with sobriquets like \u201cthe pushy publicist\u201d or \u201cperpetually petulant publicist.\u201d\u201cFor years, I\u2019ve been called \u2018pushy,\u2019\u201d Ms. Siegal said. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t call David Geffen \u2018pushy.\u2019\u201dWhile she has had public tiffs with the likes of Jerry Della Femina, the adman and Hamptons power broker, perhaps her most meaningful face-off is with the Cinema Society\u2019s Andrew Saffir, the former Ralph Lauren executive who has elbowed his way into a professional niche that Ms. Siegal basically invented; his company holds some 70 events a year.To set himself apart, Mr. Saffir has claimed downtown as his turf, holding fashion-heavy screening parties at nightclubs or rooftop bars like Mr. Purple, on the Lower East Side, that draw guests like Prabal Gurung and Michael Stipe.\u201cA lot of Upper East Side people will come downtown, at least for the right event,\u201d Mr. Saffir said. \u201cNot a lot of downtown people will go to the Upper East Side.\u201dTo Ms. Siegal, her relationships built up over three decades protect her market dominance, particularly with prestige, \u201cintellectual\u201d films, and she is quick to dismiss any suggestion of a rivalry with Mr. Saffir.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the Academy since 1986,\u201d she said. \u201cI have impeccable relationships with directors. He has impeccable relationships with models.\u201dBesides, Ms. Siegal said, she has already tried to colonize downtown. In 2000, she joined forces with Lizzie Grubman, the publicity dynamo 23 years her junior.The professional marriage lasted about a year. It did not help that Ms. Grubman became a tabloid staple after backing her Mercedes S.U.V. into a crowd at a Southampton nightclub, injuring 16 people. Ms. Siegal said that ultimately, the generation gap was too great.\u201cI went downtown because I thought I needed to be young,\u201d Ms. Siegal said. \u201cI would say, \u2018All the President\u2019s Men.\u2019 She\u2019d say, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 She would say, \u2018Do you know Snoop Dogg?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018Who the hell is that?\u2019\u201d\u201cI was in the wrong part of town,\u201d Ms. Siegal said.She lives in a two-bedroom apartment on East 74th Street that used to belong to Black Jack Bouvier (Jacqueline Onassis\u2019s father), decorated like an English manor, with stately portraits of \u201cother people\u2019s relatives,\u201d she said. She recently mingled with Juan Carlos I, the former king of Spain at the Dominican Republic resort of the sugar baron Pepe Fanjul; she spent Thanksgiving at Martha Stewart\u2019s house; she counts David Koch, the oil magnate and Libertarian patron saint, as a close friend.Even so, success has come at a price. She never married, or had children, although she has been linked to plenty of power players, like Austin Hearst, the publishing heir. She often works seven days a week.\u201cYou want to know how pathetic my life is?\u201d she asked. \u201cI sleep with my BlackBerry on my pillow.\u201dHer old Freudian analyst might say that she is still trying to satisfy the ambitions of her mother, Annette, who died in 2011.Annette Siegal, the wife of an upwardly mobile light bulb magnate, Martin Siegal, was a regal woman who wore white gloves and couture clothing, and pushed her daughter toward the social pinnacle. \u201cShe named me Peggy, which has nothing to do with Siegal \u2014 it\u2019s like Tyrone Katz \u2014 because she thought that name would sound great in the halls of Vogue magazine,\u201d Ms. Siegal said.Her mother also rode her mercilessly to be thin, attractive, perfectly attired. \u201cMy mother used to slap me on the back, scream at me, to stand up straight,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t as bad as, what are those Chinese mothers? My mother was the precursor to the tiger mom. She was the Jewish mom.\u201dWhile her mother taught her that appearance was of paramount importance for a woman, she thought education was better left to men, Ms. Siegal said.\u201cWhen I was 12, my mother sent my brother to private school, not me, and I resented her my entire life,\u201d Ms. Siegal said. \u201cEvery day in high school I had to watch my brother come home in a school uniform, going to school with rich kids in New York. I was going to school at Fort Lee High with the children of hairdressers and gas station attendants. This was beyond humiliating. Every day of high school I had to look at him in this blue blazer with the school crest on the pocket.\u201dShe added: \u201cI never got over this. I felt this intellectual stigma my entire life, and every time someone said to me, \u2018Where did you go to school?\u2019 I hated my mother.\u201dThat slight, she said, has provided a lifetime of motivation.\u201cEveryone says to me, you never would have accomplished anything if your mother had sent you to private school,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d be married and living in Great Neck with four children.\u201dIndeed, missing out on motherhood was another sacrifice for a woman who learned to challenge a multitude of dissatisfactions and frustrations into work. In her 30s, she recalled, \u201cI thought about being a single mother. I was always 10 years ahead of my time. It wasn\u2019t that accepted, it was not the thing my mother was hoping for. So I always made these practical decisions, supporting myself, which always went back to my business. When I started to have success in my business, that became more comforting to me than being dumped on by my last boyfriend.\u201dThe secret of her survival is hardly her acumen with a spreadsheet. Ms. Siegal admits that she has never been a numbers person, which is why she teamed up with Bryan Bantry, an agent and theatrical producer, as her managing partner. (\u201cOn any given day, I take on the role of adviser, coach, negotiator, fixer and at times most importantly travel agent,\u201d Mr. Bantry said.) As Ms. Siegal used to tell Pepe Fanjul: \u201cI love what I do, I\u2019d pay my clients to do it. He\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s your problem.\u2019\u201dNor is it her ability to join forces with other brand-name agencies. Her attempts to form partnerships with other power publicists, like Harriet Weintraub and Ms. Grubman, were short-lived. And there seems to be no suggestion of an anointed successor in her own office, as if the possibility she will one day stop what she is doing is all but unthinkable.\u201cIt\u2019s love of the game,\u201d said Jeremy Barber, a partner at United Talent Agency. \u201cShe\u2019s at every screening, she\u2019s at every festival. She\u2019s not scared to box around with the titans in the space. Sometimes she\u2019s at odds with them, sometimes she\u2019s employed by them. There\u2019s a certain old-school publicity diva, and she just is one.\u201dAt last, the Lincoln pulled up to Monkey Bar. Ms. Siegal, in a mink scarf, headed off for another night of air kisses, another night brokering introductions between the likes of Rudolph Giuliani and John Travolta.Around midnight, the party was still hopping, but Ms. Siegal slouched into a red leather booth, placing a small bowl of sauteed spinach on the white tablecloth before her.\u201cDinner,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Time for a Strategic Shift at UBS\u2019s Investment Bank", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsRunning an investment bank is a well-paid but sometimes frustrating business.Since Mr. Orcel\u2019s first full year in 2013, UBS\u2019s investment banking revenue is up a bit, even as rivals have experienced declines. Full-year return on equity in 2015 was just below 26 percent. Mr. Orcel\u2019s background is in advising, not trading, where most of the performance has originated, but arguably his fresh eyes and attention to detail helped. UBS also has a better relationship with its regulators now than it did then.If he deserves credit for the rise, what about the fall? Investment banking has two main drivers \u2014 trading activity and a willingness among corporate clients to make deals. UBS was reminded in the last quarter that it had little control over either. There were some discrete afflictions: losses on energy loans, the costs of Britain\u2019s balance-sheet tax and restructuring charges. But it was the overall 10 percent top-line decline that did most of the damage.Time for another strategic shift. UBS\u2019s China exposure meant the recent slowdown hurt it especially. Equities trading revenue fell almost one-fifth versus a slight aggregate rise on Wall Street because of its skew toward structured products sold to its wealthiest private banking clients in Asia.Mr. Orcel wants more revenue in the United States to rebalance its business. But UBS\u2019s American advisory brand was hammered after the 2008 crisis as rainmakers decamped to boutiques. And all banks are trying to grow in more vanilla equities trading, given its relatively light capital treatment.UBS has done this before and isn\u2019t the only one that needs a new strategy. Corporate finance activity was tepid in January. The first quarter of the year, traditionally the strongest for investment banking, could mirror UBS\u2019s fourth-quarter experience. If that\u2019s the best that an investment bank chief can hope for, it could be a long year ahead.Alternative careers in more predictable businesses like commercial banking have rarely looked so appealing \u2013 and not just for Mr. Orcel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rivals Disrupt Jacob Zuma\u2019s Speech on South African Economy", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byMr. Zuma, in his ninth state of the nation address since taking power in 2009, faced the country and Parliament more humbled that he has ever been. In the days leading up to the address, Mr. Zuma, who has typically handled his critics by mocking them, made a point of listening to South Africans: meeting with business leaders in Cape Town and talking to drivers and customers at a taxi stand in Pretoria.During Mr. Zuma\u2019s address on Thursday, opposition lawmakers demanded that he explain his firing in December of a well-respected finance minister who had clashed with one of Mr. Zuma\u2019s closest allies, and replacing him with a little-known lawmaker. It was a decision that further eroded investors\u2019 confidence in the country\u2019s economy and the health of its institutions.On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court, the nation\u2019s highest, heard arguments from two opposition party lawyers that Mr. Zuma had acted illegally by defying an order to pay back part of expensive upgrades to his private home in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The court has yet to rule on the case, which for many has come to symbolize widespread corruption inside the A.N.C., the party that has held power since the end of apartheid in 1994.But opposition parties are now seeking a court ruling that the president violated the Constitution, in a bid to start impeachment proceedings against him. Any impeachment attempt would likely fail, given Mr. Zuma\u2019s control of Parliament, but it could hurt his party in important municipal elections later this year.\u201cThe president should himself expedite the process of his removal from office by doing the honorable thing and resigning,\u201d Mr. Maimane said.Members of the second-largest opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, repeatedly interrupted Mr. Zuma\u2019s speech, delaying its start by nearly an hour.\u201cZuma is no longer a president that deserves the respect from anyone,\u201d the party\u2019s leader, Julius Malema, yelled as he and his members were eventually expelled from the parliamentary chamber. \u201cHe has stolen from us, he has corrupted the economy of South Africa, he has made this country a joke and after that, he has laughed at us.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yahoo Again Considers Selling Itself as Investor Pressure Rises", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It is game on once more for a potential Yahoo deal \u2014 maybe.In acknowledging that it is exploring \u201cstrategic alternatives,\u201d which is Wall Street\u2019s favorite way to say \u201cputting itself up for sale,\u201d Yahoo finds itself in a familiar place. In 2008, Microsoft tried and failed to buy the web company.Three years after that effort, as activist investors like Daniel S. Loeb hovered, speculation ran wild that the company might get sold. Then competing groups of investors prepared for the chance to buy a minority stake in Yahoo \u2014 only to see that opportunity disappear.Now it is 2016, and Yahoo is reluctantly weighing a sale of its core Internet operations as hedge fund activists like Starboard Value once more criticize the company\u2019s management.It is clear that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, would prefer her own self-help plan of cutting costs, businesses and employees. Both Ms. Mayer and people close to the company have said that the current focus on a so-called reverse spin, where it would spin off into a separately traded company Yahoo\u2019s core business along with its stake in its Japanese affiliate, makes the most sense.But pressure from Starboard and others have finally forced Yahoo into weighing alternatives in the name of getting the most for long-suffering shareholders. In the company\u2019s words, it is leaving no stone unturned.As Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.The company\u2019s announcement on Tuesday sought to make clear that it would consider \u201cqualified strategic proposals\u201d \u2014 language aimed at preserving whatever negotiating leverage it can with potential suitors. That may be difficult, given how stagnant its stock has been over the past decade.Public market investors still assign no value to Yahoo\u2019s core Internet operations. The company\u2019s stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, alone comes to about $26 billion, or virtually all of Yahoo\u2019s current market value.But clearly what remains \u2014 including Yahoo\u2019s mail, sports, finance and search operations \u2014 has some value, a point that both management and investors agitating for a sale have argued. The company says that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its core units should amount to $1 billion.Verizon Communications, often mentioned as a likely suitor for Yahoo, valued AOL, a similarly stagnant business, at roughly 7.5 times Ebitda in its $4.4 billion takeover of the onetime Internet giant last year. Analysts and investors have speculated that putting AOL and Yahoo together, a combination dreamed of for some time, could yield advertising efficiencies that could compel Verizon to pay up for Yahoo.Both corporate suitors and private equity firms have expressed interest in a potential deal, as varied as Verizon, TPG Capital or Bain Capital, according to people briefed on the matter.But it is early days yet, with several potential buyers cautioning that their plans are in the preliminary stage. The slowdown in the debt markets may put a dent in the ability of private equity firms\u2019 ability to buy Yahoo, though bankers said that the company\u2019s relatively steady revenues would support the financing required in a leveraged buyout.Yahoo may yet forgo a sale, at least if it had its way. It certainly has the experience in doing so. The trick now will be in convincing shareholders that sticking to its plans will pay off in a way that an outright sale will not \u2014 an argument that may be harder to make with irate investors prepared to wage battle once more.Advertisement"}

It was a seeming change of tack for Mr. Trump, who has rarely missed a chance to tell a crowd how well he was doing, or how poorly his opponents were faring, in the polls.But, for 45 minutes at a rally at Great Bay Community College, he did not mention his poll numbers. He did not attack or mention Mr. Cruz or Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who came in third in Iowa.

His promise to have Mexico finance a wall on the United States border is so well-known that the crowd loudly answered \u00e2\u0080\u009cMexico!\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he asked them who was going to pay for it.

The comments come as Mr. Sanders is fighting to prove he can remain viable in the race, which will mean broadening his support beyond the thousands of young people and working-class whites that pack his events.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to say that I am delighted that Secretary Clinton, month after month after month, seems to be adopting more and more of the positions that we have advocated. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, adding that Mrs. Clinton was \u201cbeginning to use a lot of the language and phraseology that we have used.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn fact, I think I saw a TV ad and thought it was me. But it turned out it was Secretary Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picture in the end,\u201d Mr. Sanders said at a news conference at an ironworkers union office in Boston.Mr. Sanders went on to imply that Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stances on issues were not as genuine as his own.\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the people of Massachusetts and the people of the United States need to know the difference between hastily adopted campaign rhetoric and the real record and long-held ideas of the candidates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said.Mr. Sanders has said that the Iowa caucuses, where Mrs. Clinton narrowly beat him, and the New Hampshire primary, where Mr. Sanders won by double digits, proves that his message of a rigged economy is resonating with voters.

Never, never, never,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the American people need to ask a very simple question: If these contributions from Wall Street and other powerful special interests have no influence over the candidate, why are these special interests making huge campaign contributions?\u201d\u201cSimple question. Now maybe they are dummies. And maybe they just think they throw millions of dollars and expect to get nothing. Maybe.

{"Headline": "Judge Deals Setback to Holdouts in Negotiations With Argentina", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byA federal judge presiding over a long-running battle between Argentina and a group of New York hedge funds said on Friday that he would lift an injunction that had locked Argentina out of international markets.The ruling represents a sharp turnaround by Judge Thomas Griesa of the United States District Court in Manhattan, who had previously prevented Argentina from raising new money or paying its creditors before paying investors holding its defaulted debt.These investors \u2014 known as holdouts \u2014 include a group of hedge funds led by NML Capital, a unit of the billionaire Paul E. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management. They have battled with Argentina for more than a decade in a fight that stems from 2001, when the country defaulted on nearly $100 billion of debt.Argentina later offered twice to restructure the bonds for new and cheaper ones, but the holdouts refused and won a series of victories in the United States courts in recent years. Friday\u2019s ruling now weakens the hand of the holdouts in negotiating with Argentina.In his ruling on Friday, Judge Griesa said he would drop the injunctions after Argentina repeals domestic laws that prevent the country from making payments to the holdouts and makes full payments to bondholders who settle with Argentina by Feb. 29.Ms. Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her administration called the hedge funds \u201cvultures\u201d and \u201cfinancial terrorists,\u201d and went as far as denigrating Judge Griesa.All those years, Argentina \u201cnever seriously pursued negotiations toward settlement,\u201d Judge Griesa wrote in his ruling on Friday.\u201cAll that has changed,\u201d the judge added, referring to the newly elected president, Mauricio Macri, who has pledged to resolve the debt dispute as part of a bigger plan to overhaul Argentina\u2019s economy.In recent weeks, Mr. Macri\u2019s administration has moved to settle with several other holdouts, striking a $1.35 billion settlement with a group of Italian investors, among several other deals. On Feb. 5, after a week of intense negotiations with the group of six holdout hedge funds, it offered to pay $6.5 billion in an effort to put the battle behind it.Two hedge funds \u2014 Montreux Partners and Dart Management \u2014 accepted the proposal, which would amount to three-quarters of a $9 billion claim on defaulted bonds.The four others funds, which include NML Capital and Aurelius Capital Management, a hedge fund run by the former Elliott trader Mark Brodsky, have continued to reject the proposal.If the court were to refuse to vacate the injunctions now, \u201cit would unfairly deny those plaintiffs the opportunities to resolve their disputes amicably with the Republic,\u201d Judge Griesa wrote on Friday.He added that \u201cvacating the injunctions serves the public interest by encouraging settlement to resolve disputes generally \u2014 particularly such protracted ones \u2014 as well as the concern for finality in this particular litigation.\u201dThe ruling is also conditioned on a federal appeals court giving Judge Griesa the green light to go ahead.\u201cTo think that after all that Elliott\u2019s been through, that they could be outfoxed at this late hour \u2014 incredible, Macri\u2019s a genius,\u201d said one hedge fund manager who has not been involved in the dispute, but has watched it closely and has investments in Argentina.Aurelius declined to comment, as did a spokesman for NML Capital.Argentina had hoped to get the injunctions vacated first, so it could raise new money to pay the settlements it is reaching. But referring to Judge Griesa\u2019s decision that the government pay the bondholders as a condition for his lifting the injunctions thereafter, Yael Bialostozky, the chief spokeswoman for Argentina\u2019s Finance Ministry, said: \u201cThere was no surprise here. We keep progressing to close out agreements with the greatest possible number of bondholders.\u201dJonathan Gilbert contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Tangled History With Supreme Court Sets Stage for Nominee Fight", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The first time President Obama sat down to pick a new Supreme Court justice, surprised aides discovered that he had gone beyond the briefing memos to read the leading candidate\u2019s past judicial rulings. The president, a onetime constitutional law teacher, was in his element, a \u201clegal nerd,\u201d as one aide called him, putting theory into practice.During his two terms in the White House, the Supreme Court has given Mr. Obama fits, given him reprieves and now given him a new mission for his final year in office. He has publicly feuded with the court as few of his modern predecessors have. By one measure, he has enjoyed less success before the court than any president since World War II. But today his unexpected chance to remake the court depends on overcoming the formidable will of Senate Republicans.\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s had a more contentious relationship with the court than any president I can remember, at least since Nixon,\u201d said Curt Levey, a veteran of judicial nomination battles and executive director of the FreedomWorks Foundation, a conservative advocacy group. \u201cThis is a fight to the death for control of the Supreme Court.\u201dMr. Obama arrives at this fight with a complicated history with the court. Perhaps no president since William Howard Taft, a former judge and future Supreme Court chief justice, entered the White House more immersed in constitutional theory than Mr. Obama, and few in modern times have seen theory explode into political reality more starkly.Until Mr. Obama, John F. Kennedy had the lowest victory rate since World War II, winning 58 percent of his cases. Ronald Reagan had the highest success rate among modern presidents, with 73 percent. Mr. Obama\u2019s supporters attribute his record to an ideologically conservative court, while opponents say it stems from what they call the president\u2019s aggressive abuses of power.Mr. Obama has experienced the court in three distinct phases \u2014 teaching constitutional law for 12 years at the University of Chicago, voting on Supreme Court nominees for four years as a senator and selecting nominees and litigating cases for seven years as president.\u201cWhen Obama taught at Chicago and when I got to know him, he was a believer in the role of the court maintaining our constitutional system and protecting constitutional rights,\u201d said Prof. Geoffrey R. Stone, a colleague at the university. \u201cBut he was always pretty moderate in his views. He was not someone who was a strong judicial activist.\u201dMr. Obama expressed reservations about the activism of Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s court, although he supported its liberal rulings on segregation and civil rights. \u201cHis view was that the Warren court was too active for his taste,\u201d Professor Stone said.Still, in a 2007 speech, he said compassion, not just the letter of the law, should come into play. \u201cWe need somebody who\u2019s got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it\u2019s like to be a young teenage mom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe empathy to understand what it\u2019s like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old. And that\u2019s the criteria by which I\u2019m going to be selecting my judges.\u201dHe argued the Senate had every right to block a president\u2019s choices, even by filibuster. \u201cBecause federal judges receive lifetime appointments and often serve through the terms of multiple presidents, it behooves a president \u2014 and benefits our democracy \u2014 to find moderate nominees who can garner some measure of bipartisan support,\u201d he wrote in his book.He voted against the confirmation of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and supported a filibuster against Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. that ultimately failed. From the vantage point of a president whose own nominations are subject to filibuster, Mr. Obama has come to regret his support for the Alito filibuster, his spokesman said recently.But conservatives see his focus on empathy as code for steering cases based on desired outcomes. \u201cOn matters that he really cares about, there\u2019s no meaningful difference between his political views and his constitutional views,\u201d said M. Edward Whelan III, president of the Ethics & Public Policy Center and a former Scalia clerk. In effect, \u201cthe empathy standard that he\u2019s used in nominating justices is just camouflage for judicial lawlessness.\u201dBut some decisions, he added, \u201cwill be shaped by his or her own experience, ethics and judgment.\u201d Justice, he added, \u201cis not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook. It\u2019s the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom.\u201dMr. Obama has had two chances until now to reorient the court through his nominations of Justices Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Elena Kagan a year later.\u201cHe approached this in a very lawyerly, kind of scholarly way,\u201d recalled Cynthia Hogan, who as a White House lawyer helped direct the process. \u201cHe was looking for someone who was going to be supersmart and approach the law in a reasonable way.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure there are any important cases that have been decided since Sotomayor and Kagan joined the court that wouldn\u2019t have turned out the same way had Souter and Stevens stayed on the court,\u201d Professor Stone said. \u201cSo in that sense he hasn\u2019t really changed anything. He\u2019s kept the same balance in place.\u201dThat is why the fight over Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement is so momentous, magnified because two of the most significant initiatives of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, on immigration and climate change, are awaiting the eventual judgment of a court now ideologically divided 4 to 4.\u201cThis one is different,\u201d Professor Stone said. \u201cObviously, the opportunity to replace Scalia is the first time he\u2019s had a chance to affect the balance on the court. And historically, it\u2019s potentially a very important appointment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trial Illuminates Porsches\u2019 Rise to Power at Volkswagen", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A criminal trial in Germany has shed new light on how a billionaire family acquired ultimate power at Volkswagen in the years leading up to the carmaker\u2019s emissions-cheating crisis.Two former top managers of the Porsche family holding company \u2014 as part of one of the more spectacular financial maneuvers of the last decade \u2014 are accused of manipulating Volkswagen\u2019s share price in 2008, according to evidence presented in the trial. On paper, at least, Volkswagen briefly became the most valuable company in the world.The Porsche family went on to become Volkswagen\u2019s majority shareholders. Prosecutors say the maneuver was part of a carefully planned takeover of Volkswagen that was even given an internal code name, \u201cProject Bavaria.\u201d In its aftermath, a German billionaire committed suicide, plagued by losses.The fund, one of the largest investors in the world, has a 1.2 percent stake in VW valued at $1.3 billion.Documents related to the trial, some not previously available to the public, suggest that in 2008 the Porsche family could easily have lost its grip on Volkswagen, which it was trying to acquire. Volkswagen might have been taken over by a rival car company instead, or perhaps it would have more independent shareholders. But favorable share price movements \u2014 a result of illegal market manipulation, according to prosecutors \u2014 rescued the family fortune and paved the way for it to acquire a majority in Volkswagen.Some analysts say Volkswagen\u2019s shortage of independent shareholder oversight \u2014 88 percent of all shares today are held by just three investors: the Porsche family (just over 50 percent), the Qatar government (17 percent) and the German state of Lower Saxony (20 percent) \u2014 could have created an atmosphere conducive to fraud because there were not enough critical voices on the board.The emissions crisis \u201chighlights serious corporate governance problems at Volkswagen,\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a report this month. \u201cThese deficiencies include ineffective internal controls to uncover improper activity and poor risk management by VW\u2019s management and supervisory boards.\u201dThe fallout from the emissions crisis includes investigations in Germany, the United States and other countries, as well as lawsuits by shareholders and owners of Volkswagen diesel cars.A central contention of the criminal trial, taking place at a state court in Stuttgart, is that two top officials at a Porsche family holding company set out to manipulate VW\u2019s stock price to avert a decline that could have severely diminished the family\u2019s wealth.No Porsche family members are charged with crimes. Representatives of the family say the holding company, known as Porsche SE, had 3 billion euros in cash available in October 2008 and was not under threat. \u201cThe liquidity situation of Porsche SE was completely different than it has been portrayed by the state\u2019s attorney,\u201d Porsche SE said on Friday in response to questions.\u201cThe second maintains,\u201d Mr. Pi\u00ebch continued. \u201cMy generation is the third. We normally destroy. In 2008, we almost did.\u201dProsecutors in the current case are scheduled to summarize their case on Thursday. A verdict by a panel of judges is expected by the end of the month.The trial revolves around a few turbulent days in October 2008, soon after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers propelled financial markets globally into chaos.Volkswagen shares were losing value fast. Speculators, anticipating a rout, swooped in and began betting that VW\u2019s price would fall further by using a risky short-selling strategy in which investors sell borrowed shares in anticipation of buying them back later, at a lower price, and pocketing the difference. Compounding the risk, some sold shares that they hadn\u2019t actually borrowed \u2014 a \u201cnaked\u201d short that makes it even tougher to cover the bet later.On Oct. 26, 2008, a Sunday, the Porsche holding company (which at the time owned Porsche the sports-car maker) issued a statement that German prosecutors now say was an attempt to mislead investors and prop up sagging Volkswagen shares. In the statement, Porsche disclosed that it owned 42.6 percent of Volkswagen voting shares outright and options equal to another 31.5 percent. In other words, Porsche had already locked up 74.1 percent of Volkswagen shares and was close to its goal of acquiring the 75 percent needed to control the company under German law.It was no secret by then that Porsche was trying to take over Volkswagen and had acquired a sizable bloc of shares, as well as options. Porsche was eager to protect its relationship with Volkswagen, which helped manufacture highly profitable Porsche cars like the Cayenne sport utility vehicle.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.But the size of the options position came as a shock to the investors betting that the stock would fall. They realized that if VW had locked up so many shares, relatively few were still up for grabs.The hedge funds suddenly needed to settle their short-sale bets, which required them to own Volkswagen shares. The Porsche statement left them with the impression that there weren\u2019t enough available to buy, a situation known as a short squeeze.Prosecutors say the market panic was unwarranted. Porsche was on the verge of running out of cash it needed to sustain the options play, according to prosecutors, and soon would have been forced to dump millions of shares on the market.According to prosecutors, Porsche\u2019s financial distress stemmed from the agreement it had made with Maple Bank, a niche investment bank that handled the options trades.If Volkswagen shares fell below certain benchmarks, Porsche was obligated to post cash security with Maple Bank. The more the shares fell, the more Porsche had to pay.By Oct. 24, 2008, Porsche had already had to post \u20ac4.3 billion and was down to its last \u20ac326 million, according to the indictment. If the shares rose, on the other hand, Porsche would get the money back and the pressure would ease.The Oct. 26 news release gave no indication that the company was in a tight spot. Prosecutors contend that the omission of that crucial information misled investors and amounted to a criminal violation of German securities laws.Lawyers for Mr. Wiedeking and Mr. H\u00e4rter argue that they could not have known what the market reaction to the Oct. 26 statement would be. They argue that Porsche still had enough cash to fulfill its obligations. The lawyers also say that Mr. Wiedeking and Mr. H\u00e4rter were open about Porsche\u2019s intentions.\u201cEverything was always communicated correctly,\u201d Mr. Wiedeking said in a statement to the court. \u201cThere was never any talk that Maple was going to quit the options strategy.\u201dMartin Weimann, a Berlin lawyer who is president of a shareholder-advocacy group, said the Stuttgart trial exposed the weakness of investor protections under German law. \u201cGermany runs the risk of looking like a banana republic,\u201d Mr. Weimann said in an email. International investors, he said, \u201chave already taken note of how long the case has taken to process and what a small role the rights of damaged capital-market participants play.\u201dUltimately, Porsche\u2019s takeover of Volkswagen failed, at least on paper. Instead, Volkswagen went on to buy Porsche.But the deal left the Porsche family, via its holding company, with more than half of VW\u2019s voting shares. In effect, the Porsche family traded a niche sports car maker for a majority stake in the world\u2019s second-largest carmaker, after Toyota.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Friend, the Former Muslim Extremist", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byOne of 13 children, Rafi is a Pashtun who grew up in a mud home close to the Afghan border, in an area notorious for tribal feuds and violent clashes. His parents are illiterate farmers, and it looked as if Rafi\u2019s education would end in the fifth grade, when he was sent to a madrasa. His mom wanted him to become a hafiz, someone who has memorized the entire Quran.\u201cOne reason people send kids to madrasa is that a hafiz can get to paradise and take 10 other people along,\u201d Rafi notes, explaining a local belief about getting to heaven. \u201cMy mother wanted me to be a hafiz, so I could be her ticket to paradise.\u201dUltimately, Rafi\u2019s life was transformed because his eldest brother, Akhtar, pinched pennies and sent Rafi to the best public school in the family\u2019s home province, Balochistan. Rafi had an outstanding mind and rocketed to the top of his class. But he also fell under the spell of political Islam. A charismatic Islamic studies teacher turned Rafi into a Taliban sympathizer who despised the West.\u201cI subscribed to conspiracy theories that 9/11 was done by the Americans themselves, that there were 4,000 Jews who were absent from work that day,\u201d Rafi recalls. \u201cI thought the Taliban were freedom fighters.\u201dI\u2019ve often written about education as an antidote to extremism. But in Pakistan, it was high school that radicalized Rafi. \u201cEducation can be a problem,\u201d Rafi says dryly.He\u2019s right. It\u2019s possible to be too glib about the impact of education: Osama bin Laden was an engineer. Ayman al-Zawahri, the current leader of Al Qaeda, is a trilingual surgeon. Rafi notes that Pakistani doctors or engineers are sometimes extremists because in that country\u2019s specialized education system they gain the confidence of a university degree without the critical thinking that (ideally) comes from an acquaintance with the liberal arts.Donor countries should support education, Rafi says, but pay far more attention to the curriculum. I think he\u2019s right, and we should also put more pressure on countries like Saudi Arabia to stop financing extremist madrasas in poor countries in Africa and Asia.We should also invest in girls\u2019 education, for it changes entire societies. Educated women have fewer children, which reduces the youth bulge in a population \u2014 one of the factors that correlates most strongly to terrorism and war. And educating girls changes boys. Ones like Rafi.When Rafi attended college in the city of Lahore, he encountered educated women for the first time. Previously, he had assumed that girls have second-rate minds, and that educated women have loose morals.\u201cI\u2019d never interacted with a woman,\u201d he said. \u201cThen in college there were these talented, outspoken women in class. It was a shock.\u201d It was part of an intellectual journey that led Rafi to become a passionate advocate for girls\u2019 education, including in his own family. His oldest sisters are illiterate, but his youngest sister is bound for college.Rafi won a Fulbright scholarship to study at Augustana College in South Dakota, an experience that left him more understanding of the United States, though still exasperated at many American policies. After college he won a Rhodes scholarship, and last year he completed graduate studies at Oxford.Today Rafi is a voice against the Taliban, against conspiracy theories and against blind anti-Americanism, in part because the United States did not take Donald Trump\u2019s advice to ban Muslims. Extremist American voices like Trump\u2019s, Rafi says, empower extremist voices throughout the Islamic world.\u201cIt\u2019s people like Donald Trump who are put forward by the extremists back home,\u201d Rafi told me. \u201cIt pours cold water on us.\u201dRafi teaches us that a book can be a more powerful force against extremism than a drone.

{"Headline": "North Korea to Freeze South\u2019s Assets at Kaesong Industrial Park", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea said on Thursday that it would freeze all South Korean assets at a joint industrial complex the South shut down to retaliate for a recent nuclear test and a rocket launch by the North.In addition, it said it was shutting down the only cross-border highway open between the two Koreas. The road has linked South Korea with the factory park since 2004, when it began operations just over the western inter-Korean border. The zone will return to the control of the North Korean military, it said.South Korea\u2019s action was \u201ca declaration of an end to the last lifeline of the North-South relations\u201d and \u201cdriving the situation in the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war,\u201d said a statement from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, a North Korean government agency in charge of relations with the South.\u201cThe South Korean puppet group will experience what disastrous and painful consequences will be entailed by its action,\u201d it said, calling the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, \u201ca traitor for all ages.\u201dThe Kaesong complex had been the last functioning project of inter-Korean cooperation dating from the \u201cSunshine Policy\u201d era, from 1998 to 2008, when South Korea began a series of joint ventures with the North. The decision to close the park signaled an end to a South Korean belief in using economic cooperation to chip away at decades of political mistrust on the divided peninsula and move toward eventual reunification.The corridor linking Kaesong and Seoul, the South Korean capital, was the main invasion route for North Korean troops during the 1950-53 Korean War and was at one time the most heavily guarded section of the 155-mile border.After a historic inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000 in which the two sides agreed to promote reconciliation, the hard-line North Korean People\u2019s Army grudgingly stepped aside as South Korean engineers removed barbed-wire fences, tank traps and minefields to build the highway across the border.But South Korea suspected that the North had taken the bulk of the $560 million South Korean factories had paid to its workers since 2004 and used the money for its nuclear weapons and missile development.The assets North Korea vowed to freeze in Kaesong included $852 million worth of investments South Korea poured into factories, roads and other facilities there, as well as millions of dollars\u2019 worth of finished goods that the South Korean factory managers now cannot bring home.The two Koreas had agreed as recently as 2013 that they would not shut down Kaesong for political reasons \u201cunder any circumstances.\u201d The South reiterated on Thursday that it would provide financial aid to prevent the factory owners from going bankrupt and help them find new sites for their operations.Some of the South Korean factory supervisors were able to leave Kaesong on Thursday before the North Korean announcement. They looked like a caravan of refugees streaming across the border, their cars and trucks bulging with cargo as they tried to bring home as many finished goods as they could.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hieronymus Bosch Is Credited With Work in Kansas City Museum", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported by\u2019S-HERTOGENBOSCH, the Netherlands \u2014 A small 16th-century oil on panel largely kept in storage at a Kansas City, Mo., museum is a work by the Dutch Renaissance master Hieronymus Bosch, researchers here said on Monday, a finding that, if accepted by other scholars, would add to the tiny list of about 25 recognized Bosch paintings in the world.The painting, \u201cThe Temptation of St. Anthony,\u201d dated 1500-1510, had previously been attributed to the workshop of Bosch or to a follower of Bosch, known for his comic and surreal images of heaven and hell and the earthly moral purgatory in between.With the attribution, \u201cSt. Anthony\u201d would be one of only five Bosch works in the United States. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven each own one painting by Bosch, and the Morgan Library & Museum in New York has a Bosch drawing.The Nelson-Atkins, a small but highly regarded museum with a $30 million annual operating budget and about a half a million visitors a year, has a collection of 40,000 to 50,000 works, with highlights by Caravaggio, Gauguin and Monet.Independent experts have not yet reviewed the project\u2019s evidence, and it can take years for scholars to come to a consensus on the authenticity of a painting. This attribution is based, however, on the most comprehensive study of Bosch works ever conducted, and it is accompanied by the publication of a 1,000-page monograph on Bosch by a team of eight specialists, including Bosch scholars and scientists.\u201cIt\u2019s an intriguing and plausible attribution,\u201d Joseph Koerner, a professor of art history and architecture at Harvard, and the author of a coming book on Bosch and Bruegel, said on Sunday. He said he would need to see the painting himself before making a final determination.Professor Koerner said that the work of the Bosch project was highly respected among scholars. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he added, \u201cthere\u2019s no question that these attributions \u2014 and I\u2019m sure they will admit this themselves \u2014 are not a science ultimately. It\u2019s partly an art.\u201dMatthijs Ilsink, the coordinator of the Bosch Research and Conservation Project and a co-curator of the retrospective, said he first became interested in the painting when he saw it in an exhibition catalog several years ago and got a tip from an amateur historian who had taken an interest in the work.But Kansas City is a long flight from Amsterdam, and so he put the picture on his lengthy to-check list. It was not until last fall, after he and his colleagues were finishing up their studies for the monograph, that he remembered the work at the Nelson-Atkins.Notably absent is \u201cGarden of Earthly Delights,\u201d which is a centerpiece of the Prado and has not left Spain in more than 400 years.The research project, which was financed by the city of \u2018s-Hertogenbosch, the Foundation Jheronimus Bosch 500, the Gieskes-Strijbis Fund and the Getty Foundation, examined about 35 paintings by Bosch, his followers or members of his workshop.\u201cThe Temptation of St. Anthony,\u201d which is about 15 inches tall and 10 inches wide, was probably part of a much larger panel from a triptych that was dismantled at some point in the last 500 years. It had been heavily retouched and painted over.The Nelson-Atkins bought the work from a dealer in New York in 1935, two years after the museum was founded on the former estate of William Rockhill Nelson, a real estate developer and founder of The Kansas City Star newspaper.\u201cSt. Anthony\u201d contains the bizarre details that have long amused and baffled viewers \u2014 what the Bosch project called \u201cfamiliar little monsters,\u201d like a figure with a spoonbill beak, a toad clambering out of the water and a floating sausage.But the key to the upgrade of the painting\u2019s authorship to master from follower lay beneath the surface, researchers said.Bosch was constantly reworking his paintings, covering over or wiping out whole scenes from earlier drafts. Mr. Ilsink and his team were able to visualize those layers, using infrared photography and infrared reflectography, and they said that the \u201cSt. Anthony\u201d underdrawings \u201cperfectly match\u201d those from other panels in Bosch\u2019s core oeuvre in style, composition and brush work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Vote for Bankruptcy Reform that Haunts Hillary Clinton", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported by\u201cAnybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me, name anything they\u2019ve influenced me on,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a CNN forum on Wednesday. \u201cJust name one thing.\u201d\u201cSenator Elizabeth Warren can certainly name at least one thing,\u201d his campaign said in a \u201cfact-check\u201d emailed to reporters on Thursday.To make its case, the Sanders campaign is leaning on years-old criticism from Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and liberal icon, over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s vote in 2001 to make it harder for Americans to wipe out their debts through bankruptcy.Mrs. Clinton, who has received millions from the financial sector in speaking fees and donations to her campaigns and charitable foundation, expressed regret over the legislation when she ran for president in 2008, though she had plenty of company among Democrats in voting for it.And the Clinton campaign said the email from the Sanders camp was simply a veiled personal attack. \u201cIf Senator Sanders means to allege that Secretary Clinton ever changed her position because of contributions, he should have the courage to say it, rather than continue to assassinate her character through insinuation,\u201d Jesse Ferguson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said on Saturday.Ms. Warren\u2019s critique had its beginnings in 1998, when Congress was contemplating an overhaul to the bankruptcy system. Ms. Warren, a Harvard law professor, wrote an Op-Ed piece for The New York Times warning that under such an overhaul, a woman owed child support could lose some of her ability to collect it if the child\u2019s father declared bankruptcy.In a 2003 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d Ms. Warren offered a stinging portrayal of how, by her account, Mrs. Clinton changed her views.\u201cHad the bill been transformed to get rid of all those awful provisions that had so concerned First Lady Hillary Clinton? No,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote. \u201cThe bill was essentially the same, but Hillary Rodham Clinton was not.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.She wrote that as first lady, Mrs. Clinton had been \u201cwilling to fight for her beliefs.\u201d\u201cAs New York\u2019s newest senator, however, it seems that Hillary Clinton could not afford such a principled position,\u201d Ms. Warren added. \u201cCampaigns cost money, and that money wasn\u2019t coming from families in financial trouble.\u201dThe number of bankruptcy filings had risen in the 1990s, and the legislation would have made it harder for people to wipe out their unsecured debts, including credit card debts. The legislation was avidly sought by the banking and credit card industries; its supporters said it would rein in abuse of the bankruptcy system that had driven up the cost of borrowing.At the time, Mrs. Clinton said improvements had been made to the legislation, explaining that women could be assured that they would be able to collect child support.Ms. Warren later cited Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign fund-raising from the banking industry as a factor in her vote. Mrs. Clinton represented Wall Street as a senator, but as she made the case for the legislation, she talked about small credit unions around New York whose members suffered, she said, when the credit union had to cover bankruptcy losses.\u201cIt\u2019s not a gift for the banks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift to people who pay their bills and are willing to pay a little bit more for those who can\u2019t, but aren\u2019t willing to pay a little bit more for those who don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cShe did a 180 once she became senator,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was galling.\u201dMrs. Clinton faced scrutiny over her bankruptcy vote when she ran for president in 2008, and was criticized for it by Barack Obama.An aide to Ms. Warren said on Friday that the senator appreciated that Mrs. Clinton had expressed regret.Advertisement"}

Their use of arbitration has raised concerns with state regulators \u00e2\u0080\u0094 officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia urged the federal government to deny Medicaid and Medicare money to nursing homes that use the clauses. The argument is catching on \u00e2\u0080\u0094 appeals courts across the country have been throwing out arbitration agreements signed by family members of nursing home residents.Investors who scooped up broken-down houses at bargain prices after the financial crisis have made deals with low-income home buyers unable to get traditional mortgages. The buyers sign on to an installment plan with a high-interest, long-term loan called a contract for deed, or land contract. Nationwide, more than three million people are estimated to have bought a home through a contract for deed.

In Detroit, 300 homes bought by Harbour have received notices for prolonged failure to pay property taxes, according to a Wayne County website. Harbour disputes the accuracy of these numbers. Provisions in a contract for deed are enforceable as long as they do not conflict with state law.

He added that Democrats hoped the public would recoil at the idea of \u201cthe Senate on strike, refusing to do its duty.\u201dSince 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.Some Democrats expressed confidence that they could build public pressure on the Republicans to give Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee a hearing.But Republicans appear far more interested in mobilizing their base of conservative supporters than worrying about voters in the general election. Even if Republicans might appeal to moderate voters by giving Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee a hearing, they reason, angering their own base would be more damaging.Some allies of the president said they expected Republicans to hold firm, given the court\u2019s crucial role and the intensity of feelings among conservatives. Mr. Axelrod predicted that Mr. McConnell and the other Senate Republicans would be \u201cimplacable\u201d on the issue.\u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to move,\u201d he said. \u201cAny Republican who breaks rank on this will face the full fury of the base.\u201dWhite House aides said the president would pick a nominee \u201cin due time,\u201d but they gave few hints about whom he was considering. Former top aides to Mr. Obama said they expected the White House to select someone who could overcome the Republican opposition.\u201cThis is a lifetime appointment and an incredible part of his legacy,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, who helped guide the president\u2019s previous nominees through the Senate confirmation process. Ms. Cutter said she expected Mr. Obama to avoid an obviously polarizing nomination in favor of a sitting judge who has had bipartisan support in the past.\u201cHe\u2019s going to make it as appealing as possible and as difficult as possible for the Senate not to confirm this person,\u201d Ms. Cutter said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do everything he can to get this person through.\u201dRepublicans and Democrats are arguing over whether President Obama, whose term expires in 342 days, should try to fill Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s seat.While Mr. Obama\u2019s aides try to avoid the word \u201clegacy,\u201d the president\u2019s final year in office was always going to be about defending his policies on health care, Wall Street regulation, outreach to Iran and Cuba, climate change and civil rights. Replacing Justice Scalia with a liberal could do more to protect his policies than almost anything else.Days before Justice Scalia\u2019s death, Mr. Obama said as much during two Democratic fund-raisers in California. On Friday in Los Angeles, he said it had \u201cnever been more important\u201d to elect senators who would confirm court nominees who would preserve hard-fought gains on \u201ccivil rights and equal rights.\u201dDemocrats are counting on Republicans who are up for re-election in states with large numbers of independent voters to support a hearing for Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee. But they may be underestimating the fears those candidates have of a primary fight and the pressure from conservative groups.\u201cSenator McConnell is right: Under no circumstance should the Republican Senate majority confirm a Supreme Court nominee as Americans are in the midst of picking the next president,\u201d said Michael A. Needham, the president of Heritage Action, the political arm of the Heritage Foundation.At least one Republican, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is not facing re-election, sought a middle ground. \u201cOur role in the Senate is to evaluate the nominee\u2019s temperament, intellect, experience, integrity and respect for the Constitution and the rule of law,\u201d she said in a statement.But Republicans were quick to seize on a July 2007 speech that Mr. Schumer gave to the liberal American Constitution Society in which he said senators should \u201creverse the presumption of confirmation\u201d for Supreme Court nominees during the remainder of George W. Bush\u2019s term.Mr. Schumer said the comparison was improper because, unlike Mr. McConnell, he supported holding hearings on nominees.\u201cWhat I said is after a hearing, if you\u2019re not satisfied, it is legitimate to vote no,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite different than not having a hearing or a vote.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader, countered that it would be \u201cunprecedented in recent history\u201d for the Supreme Court to go a year without a full complement of justices. Before the evening was over, President Obama promised to nominate a successor, saying he expected a timely Senate vote.These are big shifts, either terrifying or thrilling to contemplate, depending on your political stance. It is obviously good politics for Mr. McConnell, Mr. Cruz and anyone else courting the conservative base to promise not to let the Supreme Court flip.If Mr. Obama nominated a moderate and the Republicans who control the Senate refused to confirm the nominee, would the country find itself in the throes of a constitutional crisis? I did a quick poll of five constitutional law professors on Saturday night, and the consensus was no. \u201cThe world won\u2019t crumble,\u201d as Bruce Ackerman, a Yale law professor, put it.I asked Professor Tushnet if Mr. McConnell\u2019s apparent plan to block an Obama nominee qualifies as constitutional hardball. He said \u201cprobably yes,\u201d explaining in an email: \u201cThe argument for calling it hardball is that there might be a reasonably settled understanding that it\u2019s undesirable for the Supreme Court to operate \u2018too long\u2019 without a full complement of judges, and, as a result of that understanding, that the Senate will consider nominations sent to it reasonably far in advance of a presidential election.\u201dOne name being circulated as a possible nominee is Judge Srikanth Srinivasan, who was confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by a Senate vote of 97 to 0 less than three years ago. If the Republicans block a nominee like Judge Srinivasan, they risk charges of not just obstructionism but also hypocrisy, since they just helped put him on the Court of Appeals. But maybe they will not care. Maybe it matters more to please the base and emphasize the divide between the parties\u2019 visions of the Supreme Court for the November election.The election is the Constitution\u2019s answer for preventing any long-term crisis. The voters will get to punish or reward whichever party they choose. But a year or more of a Supreme Court vacancy would expose the creaks in the joints of the Constitution. Maybe it is an argument for updating the 226-year-old document. If Supreme Court justices served 18-year terms instead of life tenure, their appointments could be staggered so that each president would get two. The process would be more predictable and more orderly.But the chances for that kind of constitutional amendment are probably lower than the odds of the next justice sailing to his or her confirmation.

Andrew Cuomo, who should be using his power to make New York City more hospitable to working-class and middle-class families, has instead slipped a little poison into his executive budget that could cripple the city\u2019s ambitious efforts to build affordable housing.Mr. Cuomo says it\u2019s transparency and accountability, but it is more about intrusion and control. It would give the head of the Empire State Development Corporation, a Cuomo appointee, the power to sign off on the flow of tax-exempt bonds to New York City, which uses them almost exclusively for affordable housing. It would also require that every single affordable-housing project in New York City that uses the bonds get the approval of the Public Authorities Control Board, a shadowy entity controlled by the governor and the leaders of the Assembly and Senate.These are the proverbial \u201cthree men in a room\u201d who hold a death grip on policy-making power in New York State government. The phrase evokes the low-minded, chronically corrupt jockeying and deal-making that govern how the Albany game is played. That two of the three \u2014 Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos \u2014 were ejected from the room last year, because of federal felony convictions, is about all you need to know.The Cuomo plan has angered the de Blasio administration, City Council members and nonprofit housing organizations, who call it pointless and harmful. The city\u2019s Housing Development Corporation, created in 1971, has long been a transparent and effective steward of the precious federal financing \u2014 between $650 million and $900 million a year in recent years \u2014 that it has leveraged with tax credits and other resources in a system that has built or preserved 125,000 affordable apartments over the last 12 years. If the system came under Albany\u2019s thumb, it would be plagued by delays and uncertainty. Lenders would not lend, developers would not build, projects would collapse, the city\u2019s control over its own housing agenda would be thrown into turmoil.Even the big developers are saying as much: The Real Estate Board of New York said Mr. Cuomo\u2019s meddling threatens the \u201cclarity and predictability\u201d that builders and banks rely on. \u201cThe proposed increased oversight could mean uncertainty for builders and lenders and thus negatively affect the creation of new affordable, below-market rental housing that New York City so desperately needs,\u201d the board\u2019s president, John Banks III, said in a statement.If Mr. Cuomo were serious about solving the affordable housing crisis, he would not be trying to pull the Housing Development Corporation into Albany\u2019s tractor beam. He would be doing everything he could to help Mr. de Blasio fulfill his housing pledge. Mr. Cuomo said in his State of the State address last month that the state would spend $20 billion to build 100,000 affordable units over five years \u2014 but no one has seen the details of that plan, and now his oversight proposals threaten to drag everything backward.\u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said last week, testifying in the State Legislature. He said it almost plaintively. Mr. Cuomo, regrettably, has the power to break almost anything he wants.Advertisement"}

As he pledges to battle the establishment, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hoping to buck a hard reality: Americans aged 18 to 24 are the most unreliable voters in the electorate, with participation that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fallen from 51 percent in 1964, to 38 percent in 2012. Even in 2008, Barack Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historic candidacy brought only 44 percent of this group to the polls. Sunday at the Five Sullivan Brothers Convention Center in Waterloo, Krissy Haglund, a doctor whose student debt tops $3,800 a month, had road-tripped from Minneapolis with her two young children to join in the movement. While Mr. Sanders spoke, Ms. Haglund made a handmade sign reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cStudent Loan Reform\u00e2\u0080\u009d on a pizza box, then jumped up and down waving it until Mr. Sanders noticed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, the young lady there, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to that in a minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlongside Dr. Haglund, young people in college sweatshirts, a man with lots of piercings and a Sanders cap, a woman with a baby in a cloth sling, and a middle-aged couple called out \u00e2\u0080\u009czero!\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he asked what the financing rate on an education should be. Many hands go up when Mr. Sanders asks who has student loans. When he ticks off the sins of big banks, the crowd boos. On Saturday night in Cedar Rapids, as he introduced another \u00e2\u0080\u009cinternational embarrassment\u00e2\u0080\u009d that must be stopped, somebody shouted \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrump!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the place went crazy.

She speaks from a stage that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elevated from the crowd, flanked by Secret Service agents, her staff and barricades so dense that when an elderly woman felt faint during a Cedar Rapids rally on Saturday, it took three men 15 minutes to remove the security fences for her to exit. Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rally Sunday in Des Moines was ebullient, as friends hugged one another and swayed to piped-in Katy Perry. The crowd was older and more female, and while they might be less hip and more staid, they are among the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most dependable primary voters.The enthusiasm for \u00e2\u0080\u009crevolution\u00e2\u0080\u009d that greets Mr. Sanders, the Democratic Socialist from Vermont feels similar in some ways to that for Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas congressman who polled about 6 percent in the 2008 Republican primaries. Mr. Sanders hopes that his emotional appeal to the economic pain felt by the young will propel them to participate at the rates they did in 2008, or higher. When turnout is low, he warns them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepublicans win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His fans are true believers, but whether their faith translates into action is the big question mark hanging over every packed, whooping rally.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Setbacks, Newark Alters a Program to Encourage Home Building", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byThe AppraisalNEWARK \u2014 For the past week, on a block of North 13th Street just past the Morris & Essex Line tracks in this tumbledown city, the air has been full of diesel fuel and promise.At 48 North 13th Street, or what is left of it, Gilbert Gomez directed his brother Leonardo, who sat behind the wheel of a roaring backhoe, scooping masses of sienna-colored earth into the air. Another brother, Geovany, gave the signal when the bucket was over the small dump truck they had rented to cart away the dirt as they dug a foundation for their new home.\u201cThis is what we came here for, to build a better life,\u201d Gilbert Gomez said, standing amid the discarded cups from Popeyes, plastic shopping bags and concrete chunks that littered the street.Now they are first.While city officials initially thought construction would be underway on most homes at this point, the Gomez brothers are the only people in the program who have broken ground. For many, a deal that seemed too good to be true has turned out to be exactly that.The new plan is intended to remove obstacles that have slowed the process, including designing a home, getting permits or, most challenging of all, finding a bank willing to provide not just a mortgage but a construction loan in one of the most depressed real estate markets in the country.\u201cWe learned that people want this, they are hungry for it,\u201d Baye Adofo-Wilson, the deputy mayor for economic and housing development, said at City Hall last week. \u201cWe just have to make sure they have the capacity to build a home, and if not, we will help them do the rest.\u201dWhile so-called urban homesteading programs are not uncommon, they typically involve buyers\u2019 fixing up abandoned properties, not building new ones from scratch. With at least 2,000 vacant lots, Newark was eager to experiment.Under the program, buyers are required to live in the homes for five years and will receive a five-year tax abatement. As they rebuild, properties would be knit back into the community.LaToya Davis, a nursing assistant from Irvington, N.J., believes that if not for a loan from the Department of Veterans Affairs, thanks to her husband\u2019s service in the United States Army, they could not afford to build a house in the Weequahic neighborhood of Newark. \u201cEverything in life is a gamble, so you have to take your chances,\u201d she said.It does not help that some homes surrounding the lots were not in the best shape. One of the two next to the Gomezes\u2019 lot has been abandoned for years.Twenty-one Valentine\u2019s buyers returned their lots within a month or two, including Annette Newton, who lives in neighboring East Orange and was 113th in line on the day of the sale.\u201cIt was one of the last lots available, and the location turned out to be pretty run-down,\u201d Ms. Newton said. \u201cI still thinks it\u2019s great what they\u2019re doing.\u201dThose who moved forward were less frustrated with the city than with the banks that all but ignored their inquiries \u2014 sometimes with good reason.The average Newark home sold for $150,000 in 2015, an 18 percent increase from three years earlier, but less than half the price fetched in 2006, according to RealtyTrac, an online real estate data firm. And foreclosures are on the rise, reaching 2,469, or one in 47 homes, last year, a level not seen since 2010.Most couples have been expecting to spend between $250,000 and $350,000 to build their homes.Besides the Gomezes, four couples have closed on their properties and are finishing their financing. An additional 18 had their permits approved but have been unable so far to secure construction loans. Despite her connections as a real estate agent, Christina Coaker and her fianc\u00e9e, Bern Woods, have tried every major bank and are now turning to a private one for the two-family, loft-style home they plan to build in the North Ward.\u201cWe drive by pretty regularly, so it\u2019s fresh in our mind and we don\u2019t give up on it,\u201d Ms. Coaker, who lives with Ms. Woods in a condominium in Jersey City, said.Some homesteaders have been delayed by circumstances. Jacqueline Machado was six months pregnant when she joined her husband in line. The birth of their twins made the Brazilian couple, who live in the Ironbound neighborhood, wait until this year to begin planning. John Errico, a start-up founder, and his wife, Shannon Guy, a lawyer, had already renovated two homes in Union City, N.J. But when his father, who lives in Florida, found out he had cancer, it caused a re-evaluation.\u201cIt was a little difficult to justify a $300,000-plus expenditure on a new home when pre-existing homes in the area on similar lots can be had for less than $100,000,\u201d Mr. Errico said.That is a reason Mr. Adofo-Wilson is now urging people to consider building more affordable single-family homes that can cost as little as $179,000 with the city\u2019s help (most participants prefer two-family homes for the rental income). The Newark Community Economic Development Corporation hopes the remaining 54 couples who have made little progress will work with its selected contractors to begin building.While the homes may not be there yet, the real goal \u2014 getting more people to want to live in Newark \u2014 may have succeeded.\u201cSince we\u2019ve done this, we\u2019ve had people in here every day asking for lots,\u201d Mr. Adofo-Wilson said. \u201cI think if we had another Valentine\u2019s Day sale this Sunday, we\u2019d have had another 400 or 500 people out there. Whatever kinks we had in the system, we\u2019ll get rid of them, and then maybe we can do it again next year.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Gil Rose, the leader of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and its label, BMOP/sound, which has used Kickstarter for four albums, said that the site is most useful as a supplement to other forms of fund-raising, and functions best when the composers or artists involved activate their own networks online.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserves Dwindling Rapidly", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 As markets around the world have churned, China has long taken comfort in having what in the financial world amounts to a life preserver: its vast holdings of other countries\u2019 money.A year and a half ago, China held as much as $4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. The reserves represented a symbolic trophy for China\u2019s leaders, who have described them as the \u201cblood and sweat\u201d of the workers and upheld them as a sign of national strength.Now, as China\u2019s economic growth slows, that sign of national strength is ebbing.China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves are shrinking steadily as money flows out of the country, and Beijing moves to shore up its currency.The country\u2019s reserves have shrunk by nearly a fifth since the summer of 2014 \u2014 and more than a third of the shrinkage has been in the last three months.As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.By the end of January, reserves stood at $3.23 trillion, a level that has prompted speculation about how much lower Beijing will let them go.With a smaller pot of reserves, Chinese leaders have less room to maneuver, should the economy undergo a sudden shock. The reserves situation also weakens China\u2019s control over the value of its currency, the renminbi.The drop in reserves could also hurt China\u2019s efforts to raise its global profile, as it doesn\u2019t have as much money to pump into major projects in developing countries.\u201cIf you use up $700 billion of reserves, how much more is going to follow? That is the basic problem,\u201d said Guntram Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a nonprofit economic research institute in Brussels.The dwindling reserves are one of the many factors shaking global investor confidence because of the impact the slide could have on China\u2019s financial system. A number of investors are now betting that China may have to let its currency depreciate, rather than dip further into its reserves.China\u2019s reserve hoard is a byproduct of the way it manages its currency.During China\u2019s biggest boom years, its currency could have risen in value as huge sums in dollars, euros and yen flowed into the country. Instead, Beijing tightly controlled the value of the renminbi, buying up much of the inflows and putting them into its reserves instead. That brought angry accusations from the United States and Europe that it was manipulating its currency to help keep Chinese exports inexpensive and competitive in foreign countries.Now that the renminbi faces pressure to fall, China is spending its reserves in an effort to prop up the currency. But many American lawmakers and presidential candidates still accuse China of keeping its currency artificially weak.The reserves are still considerable, more than double Japan\u2019s, which has the world\u2019s second-largest amount. The central bank chief, Mr. Zhou, and others have questioned whether the reserves are too big and the money could be better invested if left in the private sector. Mr. Zhou led a move over the last two years to make it easier for Chinese companies and families to invest their own money overseas, only to find in recent months that the outflows have been disconcertingly fast at times.China has taken steps to stem further flows out of the country. This winter the Chinese authorities arrested the leaders of underground banks that were converting billions of renminbi into dollars and euros. They also made it harder for Chinese citizens to use their renminbi to buy insurance policies in dollars.More quietly, Beijing bank regulators have halted sales within China of investment funds known as wealth management products that are denominated in dollars.Beijing has also instructed bank branches in Hong Kong to limit their lending of renminbi to make it harder for traders and investors to place bets against the Chinese currency in financial markets.\u201cWe did receive notice from Beijing in the earlier part of January to be more stringent in approving renminbi-denominated loans,\u201d said a Hong Kong-based China bank executive, who insisted on anonymity for fear of employer retaliation. \u201cIt is no fun being caught in the middle, with marketing officers wanting to do more business and the higher-ups telling you to be tougher when reviewing credit proposals.\u201dThe erosion of reserves is also politically awkward, given public perception, and Beijing has taken steps aimed directly at shoring them up.One move would keep more of its reserves free of long-term commitments. China\u2019s central bank now demands that at least some foreign money managers who want to invest part of the reserves pledge to achieve an annual return of as much as 26 percent or else their management fees will be reduced, said a person with knowledge of China\u2019s foreign reserves who insisted on anonymity to avoid retaliation.Chinese markets rose this week, as some investors bet that China could slow the erosion. Expectations have faded that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates this year, making China look more attractive. And China is running huge trade surpluses, bringing in a steady inflow of foreign money.Economists inside and outside China are increasingly trying to guess how far reserves must fall before China might consider a sharp devaluation of the currency. An International Monetary Fund model suggests that an economy of China\u2019s size needs $1.5 trillion with strict capital controls and $2.7 trillion without them.Brad Setser, a former United States Treasury official now at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that China could manage with smaller reserves because the model exaggerates the need for reserves in a country like China with very large domestic banking deposits.Longer term, China looks less likely to commit its reserves to big projects that build up its image abroad, said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese finance at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cWhen you\u2019re losing $100 billion a month, you can\u2019t afford to invest in a highway in the middle of nowhere or a railway in Pakistan that could be blown up,\u201d he said.Last month, Mr. Xi announced yet another fund for additional infrastructure projects in the world\u2019s poorest countries. Its total: just $50 million, barely enough to build a few roads in a single impoverished country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Peacekeepers Come Home", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorsOver decades, several truths have emerged about United Nations peacekeeping forces. They can do immense good by separating combatants and pacifying civilian areas. They are, on occasion, guilty of sexual violence and financial corruption in the societies they have been sent to help. And increasingly, the troops are drawn from less wealthy countries, rather than the rich nations that finance the operations.But a major task remains. The training, combat experience and relatively high salaries the peacekeepers from developing nations get can equip them to affect politics at home when they return. The United Nations needs to study and clarify what influence \u2014 for ill or otherwise \u2014 returning troops exert. The question applies in many countries and has gone unanswered for too long.For the current fiscal year, the United Nations budgeted more than $8 billion to keep roughly 120,000 peacekeeping personnel deployed. The United States and other rich nations pay generously to support those operations and to train and equip troops. But America sends fewer than 100 soldiers and other personnel directly into the United Nations missions.The average peacekeeping operation has at the same time grown in intensity; today it more closely resembles active counterinsurgency than the traditional separation and monitoring of two sides after hostilities cease. Indeed, the United Nations is experimenting with what it calls a Force Intervention Brigade made up of troops from Malawi, South Africa and Tanzania that is tasked with offensive operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.The United States has devoted considerable resources to predeployment training for such missions. Since 2013, for example, nearly one of every five Rwandan soldiers has received peacekeeper training from America. A United Nations peacekeeper\u2019s monthly stipend of $1,332 often represents a threefold to -twentyfold increase over a soldier\u2019s normal salary.But what happens when those troops\u2019 missions end? For better or worse, peacekeeping training and combat experience provide tools that can be used for internal security (or repression) back home.Take Burundi, for example. Minorities in its military, a third of which is deployed as peacekeepers, instigated a failed military coup last year, cracked down on civilian protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza\u2019s extraconstitutional third term, and then defected to form a new armed opposition. For now, most soldiers seem to be on the sidelines, with some defending civilians, as violence escalates. This may hint that peacekeeping experience can be a stabilizing force, even as payments for the peacekeepers\u2019 services help a president cling to power.The combined effect of monthly peacekeeper reimbursements, training, equipment and increased financial aid are a valuable source of revenue for cash-challenged Fiji, which has contributed more soldiers per capita than any other nation since 1970. But the political effect of this income can mimic the \u201cresource curse\u201d more commonly associated with oil. For Fiji, peacekeeper salaries alone amount to nearly $10 million in annual revenue, one-fifth of its entire defense budget. Predictably, that props up a political system dominated by the military.Such an influx of cash can also spawn instability. Maggie Dwyer, a scholar of African Studies at the University of Edinburgh, said that at least 10 mutinies in West Africa since 1991 have been linked to grievances by returning peacekeepers disappointed by the cut in their wages, alongside perceived corruption among their home-based superior officers.Finally, regimes can use their peacekeeping contributions to replace aid packages from international donors while resisting pressure for domestic reforms. The United States reduced aid to Uganda in response to anti-gay legislation two years ago, but that country remains one of six funded by a new $500 million African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership.Of course, other militaries with extensive peacekeeping experience have played positive domestic roles. Burkina Faso, which has just experienced back-to-back military coups, deploys roughly a quarter of its army on peacekeeping missions annually. It now appears that the military rank and file has rallied behind the public against the latest group of coup plotters, who had threatened to undermine impending elections.The bottom line is that a great influx of money, training and combat experience for peacekeepers is likely to have large political consequences in their homelands. But, given current demands, the United Nations simply cannot afford to be choosy in where it gets its peacekeepers.So if the West wants to reverse the downward trend of wealth and democracy in the largest troop-contributing countries, it\u2019s not a matter of putting money where its mouth is. America and other countries need to put soldiers there too, relieving somewhat the need to supply troops from the most problematic states.And the United Nations needs to better understand how returning peacekeepers contribute to \u2014 or undermine \u2014 the politics of their home states. Increased study and attention for peacekeeping veterans also seems not only prudent but ethical, perhaps accompanied by medical or other post-deployment support.In the United States, we are reconsidering the implications of providing surplus military equipment from foreign counterinsurgency efforts to our domestic police. We should be equally concerned about what happens when surplus soldiers return from similar operations to countries that are much less wealthy, democratic and stable.Advertisement"}

All of his winter coats, caps and umbrellas come from the South Bronx. So do the gloves he recently bought for his campaign volunteers on a freezing morning. The head shots for his campaign posters?

He says he plans to go back and get his bachelor\u2019s degree.He became the community board\u2019s district manager in 2010 after serving on it.Mr. Salamanca, who had been earning $117,000 annually in the job, lives in the Longwood neighborhood with his wife, Jessenia, who works for the Parks and Recreation Department, and their two sons, Justin, 15, and Aidan, 18 months. As a councilman, he will earn $148,500.\u201cI\u2019m the type of individual, when change needs to be done \u2014 and I see it\u2019s not getting done \u2014 I have to be involved,\u201d he said.Mr. Salamanca found that, all too often, the community board would make recommendations to city agencies that would be ignored. He recalled that it once took months of pushing city transportation officials to get a stop sign erected at a dangerous intersection.Mr. Salamanca, a Democrat, said that as a member of the Council, he would work to give community boards more power. \u201cAll community boards have an ally, a friend \u2014 someone who is going to be advocating for them,\u201d he said.He also plans to focus on bringing more jobs and affordable housing to the South Bronx and financing for after-school jobs to keep young people off the streets. \u201cI have a lot of work that needs to be done, and I\u2019m passionate about it,\u201d he said.Though Mr. Salamanca took a leave of absence from his job to campaign, he remained entrenched in the day-to-day life of the South Bronx. In between knocking on doors and handing out fliers around the district, he could not resist calling in potholes and garbage piles to the city\u2019s 311 hotline.As Mr. Salamanca recently carried two new suits out of Boulevard Menswear, he was stopped by Digna James, 47, a day care worker. Speaking in Spanish, Ms. James told him she had voted for him because she believed he could do the job.Mr. Salamanca told her he would work hard for the community.Ms. James said she was concerned about crime and jobs, and jokingly demanded a meeting.At Chucky\u2019s Barber Shop, where Mr. Salamanca goes every week to get his beard trimmed, the owner, Raymond Lopez, said he used to close the shop at night with a baseball bat in hand to fend off thieves. But a while ago, he said, he was able to retire the bat because Mr. Salamanca helped make the street safer with brighter lights and other improvements.During the campaign, Mr. Lopez displayed Mr. Salamanca\u2019s poster in his window. When a rival candidate asked if he would put up his poster too, Mr. Lopez told him no.\u201cThis is the barber shop\u2019s guy,\u201d he said of Mr. Salamanca. \u201cHe looks out for the neighborhood, always. You need someone like that around here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton, Shifting Line of Attack, Paints Bernie Sanders as a One-Issue Candidate", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byHENDERSON, Nev. \u2014 Hillary Clinton set out on Saturday to blunt one of Bernie Sanders\u2019s most potent arguments against her, attacking the Vermont senator as a one-note rival whose relentless focus on Wall Street excess and exorbitant political spending would do little to improve the lives of Americans. The line of attack, laid out at a rally here with labor union members and amplified more pointedly by a video Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign released on Saturday morning, comes as she is seeking to sow doubts about Mr. Sanders\u2019s readiness for office and defend herself as a more reliable and proven fighter for Democratic interests. Accompanied by a phalanx of Democratic politicians and union leaders, Mrs. Clinton reminded her audience of how difficult it was for the ill to obtain health insurance before President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. And in a state with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, she promised to focus closely on creating jobs and raising wages, saying the American middle class could not renew itself without a broader agenda than Mr. Sanders offered.\u201cI want you to not only tell people what you\u2019re against \u2014 what we\u2019re fighting against, what we\u2019re going to stop,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, in an apparent jab at Mr. Sanders. \u201cI want you to tell them what you\u2019re for.\u201d It was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s newest stab at untangling the contradiction that has unexpectedly stifled her candidacy: how to make pragmatism and practicality sound as exciting as the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d grandly, if vaguely, promised by Mr. Sanders. In their debates and on the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton has sought to dismiss Mr. Sanders as unrealistic and his proposals as shallow, sometimes at the risk of making even her most far-reaching proposals sound timid by comparison.But with their next two contests in South Carolina and Nevada, states that are far more racially and ethnically diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton has shifted to a different critique: that despite his calls for wholesale change, it was Mr. Sanders, with his constant attacks on \u201cWall Street billionaires\u201d and the country\u2019s campaign finance system, whose vision was too narrow.\u201cIf we broke up the big banks tomorrow,\u201d Mrs. Clinton asked the audience of black, white and Hispanic union members, \u201cwould that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination against the L.G.B.T. community?,\u201d she said, using an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. \u201cWould that make people feel more welcoming to immigrants overnight?\u201dAt each question, the crowd called back with a resounding no. Mr. Sanders, appearing across the state in Reno, dismissed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sally with a sarcasm that he has seemed increasingly disinclined to mask. Stopping to speak with reporters before boarding a chartered plane to Colorado, Mr. Sanders pronounced himself \u201creally stunned by some of the attacks that we are getting from Secretary Clinton,\u201d calling her team \u201cunraveled\u201d by his 22-percentage-point victory in New Hampshire last week. Mr. Sanders said that he believed the American people understood that he was talking about a broad range of issues, including climate change, low wages, health care and foreign policy.\u201cThe idea that I am a single-issue candidate \u2014 the American people understand that we are the only major nation on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care for all people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThe American people understand that we have got to aggressively deal with climate change, in order to give our children and our grandchildren a planet that is healthy and habitable. The idea in terms of\u00a0education\u00a0that we must make public colleges and universities\u00a0tuition\u00a0free. We\u00a0have\u00a0got\u00a0to\u00a0raise the\u00a0minimum\u00a0wage to a living wage. It\u2019s not one issue.\u201dLynn Wright, a 63-year-old accountant controller who lives in Carson City, Nev., and is volunteering for Mr. Sanders, agreed that his vision was comprehensive.\u201cI\u2019m supporting him because it is the only way that we can save our nation and take care of all of our people,\u201d said Ms. Wright, who attended a gathering of Sanders volunteers in Reno\u00a0on Saturday. \u201cChange has to happen.\u201dMrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders parried shortly before news broke of the death of the conservative Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, leaving a vacancy on the nation\u2019s highest court that is likely to galvanize Democrats and Republicans alike and provoke new debate over whether Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Sanders is the more electable candidate.Earlier in the day, Mrs. Clinton made a surprise visit to a casino employees\u2019 cafeteria to visit members of Nevada\u2019s powerful culinary workers union, one of the few in the state that has not backed her yet. In Henderson, Mrs. Clinton spoke to union members, whose organizations have already swung behind her campaign. Most seemed enthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton and worried about \u2014 if not hostile to \u2014 Mr. Sanders.\u201cI hear he has a lot of ideas that may be good things, but may or may not happen,\u201d said Ray LeVangie, 59, a plumber who said he would hear Mr. Sanders out but had decided to vote for Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBut to be able to put people in jobs \u2014 good middle-class jobs \u2014 that\u2019s very important to me.\u201dKaren Siegel, a New York-born Nevadan, said she agreed with Mr. Sanders about money speaking too loudly in politics and believed he had a broader agenda. But she was worried, Ms. Siegel said, that Mr. Sanders\u2019s liberal ideas would alienate too many voters for him to win.\u201cI knocked on doors for McGovern. I poll-watched. But he lost 49 states,\u201d Ms. Siegel said, referring to George McGovern, the Democrats\u2019 1972 presidential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m scared of Bernie being the nominee.\u201dNicholas Confessore reported from Henderson, and Yamiche Alcindor from Reno, Nev.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Speedskater Is Poised to Upend Rule of Sports\u2019 Highest Court", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byThe Court of Arbitration for Sport has for decades served as the final arbiter on sports disputes throughout the world, ruling on thousands of cases ranging from trifling to momentous. The court enabled Oscar Pistorius to run against able-bodied athletes, upheld the cyclist Floyd Landis\u2019s doping suspension and prevented Luis Su\u00e1rez from overturning his suspension from soccer for biting an opponent at the 2014 World Cup.All Olympic federations and the World-Anti Doping Agency recognize the court\u2019s supremacy, and athletes can compete only if they waive their right to bring sports cases to their national courts by signing arbitration clauses binding them to the sports court, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland.A speedskater from Germany, however, is on the verge of turning this entrenched system of justice on its head. Claudia Pechstein, Germany\u2019s most decorated Winter Olympian, has challenged the fairness of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in a German court, and a ruling next month could drastically alter how justice is meted out in the sports arena. If she prevails, athletes may be able to bypass international sports\u2019 normal dispute-resolution systems and instead seek redress for their grievances through their national courts \u2014 a radical notion considering the vastly different justice systems around the world.\u201cIf we are successful, all athletes might think about circumventing the CAS,\u201d said Thomas Summerer, one of Pechstein\u2019s lawyers.Pechstein, 43, was barred from competition for two years by the international governing body for speedskating in 2009 after antidoping authorities testing samples of her blood found what they believed were abnormal levels of reticulocytes, or immature red blood cells, often an indicator of doping. Pechstein emphatically denies doping and says the irregularity is the result of a congenital blood disorder.\u201cI don\u2019t wish what happened to me on anyone,\u201d she said in a phone interview from Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s hell.\u201dNext month, Germany\u2019s Federal Court of Justice, the country\u2019s highest civil court, will decide whether to uphold a ruling issued last January by the Munich Higher Regional Court, which went against both the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the Swiss Federal Tribunal, allowing Pechstein to proceed with a lawsuit seeking 4.4 million euros, almost $5 million, in compensation from her sport\u2019s governing body, the International Skating Union, for lost income.Mike Morgan, the founding partner of Morgan Sports Law, who has represented athletes and national Olympic committees before the sports court, said that a ruling in Pechstein\u2019s favor would \u201cdefinitely send shock waves through sports arbitration.\u201d\u201cThis will have an impact like the Bosman ruling,\u201d said Richard Ings, a former head of the Australian Anti-Doping Agency, referring to the 1995 European Court of Justice decision that transformed how soccer players could move among teams.Created in 1984 by Juan Antonio Samaranch, then the president of the International Olympic Committee, the Court of Arbitration for Sport filled a need for a specialized international arbitration tribunal able to resolve sporting disputes expeditiously and without political influence.With the I.O.C. controlling and financing the court, concerns about its impartiality escalated. After a ruling from the Swiss Federal Tribunal raised questions about these cozy links in 1994, the International Council of Arbitration for Sport was created to manage the court, independent of the I.O.C.The court\u2019s annual budget has more than doubled, to $13.9 million in 2015 from $5.6 million in 2005. Its 356 arbitrators from 81 countries received a record 503 filings in 2015, compared with 232 during the 1990s.National courts have largely deferred to the sports court\u2019s decisions. But that changed when the Munich court issued its ruling, declaring both a sports court decision upholding the International Skating Union\u2019s ban and Pechstein\u2019s signed arbitration clause invalid.The court determined that since the skating organization controls the market for speedskating events, its use of arbitration clauses binding athletes to the sports court constituted an abuse of a dominant position under German antitrust law. The German court said it found a structural imbalance within the sports court that favored sports governing bodies over athletes.The imbalance, according to the court, involves the composition of the International Council of Arbitration for Sport, which administers the sports court and whose 20 members are nominated primarily by the I.O.C. and international sporting organizations. John Coates, an I.O.C. vice president, is president of the international council, which has a critical influence because it appoints the sports court\u2019s arbitrators. And in each three-member arbitration panel \u2014 after both parties to a dispute have selected an arbitrator \u2014 an international council member selects the president of the panel. This creates a risk, according to the Munich court, that each panel could be skewed against athletes.Though initially optimistic before her case was heard by the sports court, Pechstein said she was left disillusioned. \u201cWhat do you expect from a court whose judges are mostly appointed by the sports\u2019 governing bodies?\u201d she said. \u201cAthletes don\u2019t have a chance at a fair trial.\u201dPechstein said that she lost sponsors and that her reputation was damaged as a result of the more than six-year legal battle. She described the Munich court\u2019s ruling as a \u201csuccess worth more than all of my Olympic medals.\u201d (She has won nine over all, including five golds.)FIFPro, the global soccer union, announced its support of Pechstein in July. \u201cThe independence and impartiality of the CAS is an issue that concerns a large number of athletes,\u201d said Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, a FIFPro policy director. The Pechstein decision \u201cput everything on its head,\u201d said Paul Greene, the founder of the sports law firm Global Sports Advocates L.L.C. \u201cAnyone who goes outside the CAS system generally loses.\u201dConsider the American sprinter Justin Gatlin. In 2008, a Florida court characterized his four-year doping ban \u2014 which was upheld by the sports court \u2014 as \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d and in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. But it ultimately concluded that he was bound to the sports court, a decision the judge admitted was \u201cquite troubling\u201d because it meant \u201cUnited States courts have no power to right the wrong perpetrated upon one of its citizens.\u201dPechstein said her case was \u201ca real awakening for many athletes.\u201dRobert Harting, a German who won gold in the discus at the 2012 London Olympics, has been one of Pechstein\u2019s staunchest supporters. Many athletes, he said, believe mandatory arbitration is unfair but sign anyway so they can compete, and clean athletes who believe they have been wrongfully barred by the sports court have no other option to clear their name.\u201cWhy should I sign an arbitration agreement, which takes away all my rights and doesn\u2019t give me the chance to fight against a wrong judgment?\u201d Harting said in an email.(Appeals to sports court rulings can be made to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, but the group vacates sports court awards based on public policy violations or procedural missteps, and not on merit.)The sports court issued a statement after the Munich court\u2019s ruling, contending that if other countries followed suit, then \u201cthe basic principles of international arbitration would be compromised.\u201dSince then, the sports court has announced some reforms. It said in December that it would grant athletes\u2019 commissions the opportunity to send nominations for arbitrators to the International Council of Arbitration for Sport. But Morgan and Summerer say athletes\u2019 commissions \u2014 composed of former and current athletes often appointed directly by the I.O.C. and WADA \u2014 lack the independence to represent athletes in the way a players\u2019 union would.The sports court has many defenders, many of whom say legal chaos would ensue if athletes could turn to their own countries\u2019 justice system to challenge sanctions.Looking at arbitration clauses \u201cas a gun to your head is ignoring the alternative,\u201d said Andrew de Lotbini\u00e8re McDougall, a sports court arbitrator and partner at White & Case in Paris. He added, \u201cYou can imagine the lack of consistency in decisions about matters such as doping and team selection between national courts in different countries.\u201dMatthieu Reeb, the secretary general of the sports court, noted that the group has introduced improvements, including legal aid for those who might struggle to pay arbitration costs. \u201cIt\u2019s in the interest of athletes to use the services of the CAS rather than going before the civil courts with procedures and appeals that can last for several years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CAS is quicker, more efficient and adapted to sport.\u201dPechstein\u2019s lengthy court battle seems to support Reeb\u2019s belief. But, she said, \u201cJustice is what matters, not speed.\u201d\u201cGenerally, you can have a pretty fair shake at the CAS,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cRather than disband it and start all over again, it needs to listen to the athlete groups and learn from the Pechstein case.\u201dPechstein said she was eager to close this legal process so she could focus on qualifying for the 2018 Winter Games, where she hopes to be Germany\u2019s flag-bearer days before her 46th birthday.\u201cIt would be the perfect ending for my rehabilitation,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marissa Mayer Meets Yahoo Developers at a Confrontation-Free Gathering", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Many of the people attending Yahoo\u2019s mobile developer conference on Thursday were not there for the traditional business of striking deals or learning more about the company\u2019s products.They were there to watch a live episode of Silicon Valley\u2019s 21-year-old soap opera: The Story of Yahoo. As one recently hired Yahoo employee put it, \u201cAren\u2019t you here to gossip?\u201dAnyone hoping for dramatic confrontations or big plot twists was sorely disappointed, however.Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, clad in a jacket of white and Yahoo purple, made introductory remarks, noting that Yahoo had more than 600 million monthly users on mobile devices. She thanked the thousands of developers who had integrated Yahoo ads into their apps and were now raking in about $200 million a year in revenue from them (with Yahoo getting an extra $100 million or so on top of that).\u201cOur commitment to the developer community is stronger than ever,\u201d Ms. Mayer said. \u201cWe want you to know that you are in the right place.\u201dAs Ms. Mayer exited to modest applause, Simon Khalaf, the company\u2019s senior vice president for publisher products and the former chief of Flurry, the analytics company that Yahoo bought two years ago, took the stage.He delivered his annual report on the state of the mobile world, with his trademark array of fun facts and statistics. The number of people in the world who check their phones more than 60 times a day is now 280 million, he said \u2014 a population of mobile addicts big enough to be the fourth-largest country in the world.Americans spend an average of 4 hours 11 minutes a day on mobile phones, more time than they spend watching television. And mobile video game play was dropping because of the rise of e-sports, where spectators watch skilled players compete against one another.Next came a panel about the new trend of concierge services delivered through messaging services. Hyatt Hotels, for example, lets guests orders fresh towels via Facebook Messenger.But throughout, there was barely a mention of Yahoo or its role in the mobile world \u2014 perhaps because the company is still struggling to articulate a strategy that will help it compete with Facebook and Google, the two giants in mobile.In short, Yahoo was almost a bit character at its own show.Sitting in the audience of about 500 people, Bob Bahramipour, senior vice president for global business development at InMobi, an India-based global advertising platform, said he had mostly come to \u201cplant seeds\u201d about a possible future partnership with Yahoo.Given all the uncertainty over the company\u2019s future \u2014 will it be sold or broken up for parts? Will Ms. Mayer and her management team be forced out by disenchanted investors? \u2014 he said that InMobi was not sure that anyone at Yahoo would be in a position to close a deal anytime soon.Xinhua Liu, chief marketing officer of Cheetah Mobile, a Chinese company that makes mobile utilities and game apps with 567 million monthly users worldwide, was more upbeat. Yahoo, he said, was a great partner, supplying content, search results and native display ads \u2014 all things he couldn\u2019t get from other partners like Facebook and Google.\u201cYahoo is well positioned to serve these offers\u201d from brands, he said, complementing Cheetah\u2019s other revenue streams, such as application install ads from Facebook. Mr. Liu said that Yahoo\u2019s corporate turmoil did not worry him since the team he worked with was stable.The same could not be said of Mr. Khalaf\u2019s team, which includes Yahoo\u2019s news, finance, sports and media content. On Wednesday, Yahoo gutted its media staff and closed half of its digital magazines.In an interview after his presentation on Thursday, Mr. Khalaf said that the company would now focus more on showcasing content created by its users, concentrating on popular topics like news, sports, politics and finance.Conversations are important to driving traffic and engagement, Mr. Khalaf said. Investors, for example, don\u2019t just want to read articles about the companies in their stock portfolio, he said, \u201cthey want to brag about how their portfolio is doing.\u201dTumblr, the social network that Yahoo acquired in 2013, will be an important source of that user content, particularly for images and video. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things you can do inexpensively,\u201d Mr. Khalaf said.As for the larger soap opera that is Yahoo, he said he reminds his team, \u201cIn the Valley, one day you\u2019re the pigeon and the second day you\u2019re the statue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In 2012, that limit was 22.5 million euros, or about $25 million in today\u2019s dollars.Bygmalion, a public relations company, is suspected of issuing false invoices to the U.M.P. for about \u20ac18 million, to bill for events that were actually organized for Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s campaign.But the new case is an obstacle facing Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s bid to return to power.

{"Headline": "Caught Between Costly Alternatives, Ferguson Residents Worry About Its Fate", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byBut now the Department of Justice has responded with a civil rights suit against this municipality, outside St. Louis, which was shattered by violence in 2014 after a police shooting of an unarmed black man. And the city faces the specter of a lengthy, costly legal battle that has left many here worrying whether their community is hurtling toward ruin.\u201cI just feel sad,\u201d said Bridgett Lewis, who owns a restaurant, Drake\u2019s Place, with her husband. \u201cPeople are saying it\u2019s going to be the end of Ferguson and Ferguson is going to go broke. Some people are saying: \u2018Well, that\u2019s the cost of racism. They should have thought about it before they did all this stuff.\u2019 We all are worried and concerned about how this is going to impact Ferguson.\u201dStill, until last week, many had hoped that their city was moving forward. Yes, plywood still covered the facades of some businesses along its commercial corridors where violence once raged. But there also were signs of change: the wooden frame of what will be a mixed-use development rising on a lot across from the Police Department, the body cameras outfitting the city\u2019s officers and the dashboard cameras in their cars.Barbara Tipsword, 85, a Ferguson resident, said she thought that things had been looking up. \u201cBut this newest wrinkle, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to come out of this,\u201d she said.The roughly 130-page consent decree struck between Ferguson and the federal government detailed multiple changes that Ferguson would have to make to its law enforcement practices \u2014 from changing laws to new officer training \u2014 to avoid being sued. It would have to pay for an independent monitor and give raises to the police to attract qualified new officers.But once it studied the costs, the Council decided that it was staring at two expensive options. Putting the consent decree, as it stood, into effect would cost up to $3.7 million in the first year, and as much as $3 million in subsequent years, Ferguson\u2019s finance director, Jeffrey Blume, said. A legal battle against the Justice Department could cost as much as $8 million, Dan Webb, a lawyer for the city, estimated.\u201cIf we were to pass this thing, the likelihood of us surviving as a city for much longer than a year was unlikely,\u201d said Mark Byrne, a Council member who is a lawyer and took part in the negotiations \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even an option. It could not even be an option.\u201dOn Tuesday, the Council voted 6 to 0 to adopt the deal but with seven changes, including eliminating the provision calling for pay raises for police officers and adding a clause saying that if Ferguson dissolved its Police Department, whatever agency took over would not be bound to the agreement.Mr. Byrne said officials still thought further negotiations were possible. \u201cI think that they needed to see a level of commitment from us,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a purely trying-to-get-the-deal-done point of view, it seemed more prudent to pass it with the amendments and then put the ball back in their court.\u201dInstead, the Justice Department sued the city the next day, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch was scathing. She said the people of Ferguson should not have to wait any longer for \u201ctheir city to adopt an agreement that would protect their rights and keep them safe.\u201dThe St. Louis American, a newsweekly, called the Council\u2019s move \u201cfoolish,\u201d while Hillary Clinton released a statement calling it \u201cdisappointing.\u201dThose who have protested against the city are dubious of the cost estimates made by Mr. Blume, the same finance director whom the Justice Department blamed in part for the city\u2019s practice of charging excessive legal fines and fees.\u201cThey were just making excuses on why they couldn\u2019t get this done,\u201d said Kayla Reed, who lives in St. Louis and has organized protests for racial justice in Ferguson.Tony Rice, who has lived in Ferguson for 12 years and has been a regular protester, argued that if the city had fulfilled the agreement quickly enough, the consent decree could be lifted sooner than expected, saving money.He said he believed that city officials were resistant to the agreement because \u201cthey would like to go back to business as usual.\u201dEven some residents who had concerns about the cost of the agreement questioned the Council\u2019s wisdom.\u201cI think that you\u2019re fighting the federal government, who has a lot more assets than you do,\u201d said Dan Cosgrove, 67, who has lived in Ferguson nearly his entire life. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to fight it except to spend more money.\u201dOthers support the Council. \u201cThe D.O.J. has wanted to use us as an example from the beginning,\u201d said Dara Ashby, who has lived here for 16 years.Things could be made more complicated by the April 5 municipal election. Not only is the Council up for election, but the ballot includes initiatives to increase property and sales taxes to close the budget deficit. But residents would be unlikely to vote to raise taxes if the revenue was just going to pay court fees, Mr. Byrne said, adding that if a plan was in place to institute police overhauls, that might get more support from the public.Should both of those tax proposals fail, he said, the city might still be able to create savings and generate new revenue through a proposal to change the way the city\u2019s Fire Department is managed. That overhaul would appear on the ballot in August. \u201cIf all three of them ended up failing,\u201d Mr. Byrne said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dMr. Rice\u2019s view of the future is quite pessimistic.As the city\u2019s finances continue to dwindle, Mr. Rice, who chronicles protests on Twitter, predicted that more blacks would be elected to government. And the majority black leadership would inherit a situation that is beyond repair, he said.\u201cTwo or three years later,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ll blame the black people for destroying Ferguson.\u201dAustin Huguelet contributed reporting from Ferguson, and Matt Apuzzo from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "HSBC Hires Goldman Executive for Investment Bank", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsHSBC is adopting the \u201cjust add Goldman Sachs\u201d recipe plan for its investment bank.The London-based bank is recruiting Matthew Westerman, a former top partner at the Wall Street firm, to help lead a reordering of HSBC\u2019s operations serving big global clients. His arrival implies that the bank\u2019s ambition to crack the top league requires fresh impetus.Mr. Westerman and HSBC have some history together. The Goldman veteran, who held several top investment banking jobs at the bank run by Lloyd C. Blankfein over a 16-year period, is a longtime adviser to HSBC and knows Asia, HSBC\u2019s most fertile territory, well.He and Robin Phillips \u2013 with whom Mr. Westerman will co-head HSBC\u2019s newly created global banking division \u2014 should have enough to do to keep them from the kind of power struggle that often imperils such co-executive partnerships. HSBC is folding hundreds of commercial banking clients into the new unit, as well as adding in corporate and asset-backed finance businesses \u2013 a reversal of their separation into a stand-alone arm in 2013. The head of investment banking at HBSC, Samir Assaf, reckons this will help with cost-cutting.It sends an odd signal to shareholders, though. HSBC has tried and failed to grow in higher-margin corporate finance businesses before, notably under the deal-maker John Studzinski, who now works at the Blackstone Group. Rivals including Barclays are considering moving the dividing line between corporate and investment banking to maximize cross-selling opportunities. But it feels a little too soon for HSBC to do so given it outlined a series of investment bank targets barely over six months ago.Perhaps the adage \u201cno one ever got fired for hiring Goldman\u201d applies to investment bankers as well as their corporate clients. Deutsche Bank has recruited the former Goldman financial sponsors head Alasdair Warren as its European head of investment banking. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, historically weaker in Europe than its home market, in 2012 hired a Goldman alumnus, Diego de Giorgi, as a top executive for the region, and has performed creditably in European league tables since.Nonetheless, the sluggish start to the year in terms of primary capital market and merger volumes has made it tough for investment banks to expand. Other second-tier players looking to grow include the French lenders BNP Paribas and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as well as UniCredit of Italy. The catch is that with markets skittish, investing to grow looks almost pointless, no matter the pedigree of leadership.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama and Paul Ryan Have Lunch, and Consider a Wary Truce", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byWhite House officials said the president expressed optimism in the two meetings that the Republican-controlled Congress would work with the administration to address five key goals: the financial crisis in Puerto Rico, ratification of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, providing money for an initiative to fight cancer, confronting a resurgence of heroin addiction and overhauling the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.\u201cHopefully, we\u2019re going to find willing partners on Capitol Hill to advance those measures,\u201d Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think that is certainly the expectation of most voters across the country.\u201dBut Mr. McConnell seemed less optimistic after leaving the White House. Calling the discussion wide-ranging, Mr. McConnell nonetheless said that he had cautioned Mr. Obama against pushing for approval of a sweeping trade deal with Pacific Rim nations because of opposition among a number of the presidential candidates as well as lawmakers.\u201cWith both the Democratic candidates for president opposed to the deal, and a number of the presidential candidates from our party opposed to the deal, my advice is that we not pursue that certainly before the election,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what we agreed to do is to continue to talk about it.\u201dMr. McConnell said he was also clear with Mr. Obama that Congress would not support any taxpayer-financed bailout of Puerto Rico, which faces serious financial difficulties in the months ahead. Mr. McConnell said that Republicans were continuing to discuss ways that Puerto Rico could restructure its finances, but that he warned the president against a government bailout.\u201cNo solution to the Puerto Rico problem that involves the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars is going to be passing in this Congress,\u201d he said.The Republican leaders raised with Mr. Obama the need to aggressively confront the spread of the Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects when the disease is contracted by pregnant women.But in discussing that issue after the meeting, Mr. McConnell was quick to criticize the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the Ebola crisis.\u201cWe need to get out in front of the Zika virus,\u201d Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in the Capitol, \u201cand make sure that we don\u2019t end up having the kind of feeling across the country that we are sort of reacting too late like we did on Ebola.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Earnest was equally quick to deliver a relatively gloomy assessment about the Republican intentions even as the president was still having lunch with Mr. Ryan.Indeed, in a sign of the continuing deep gulf between Republicans and Mr. Obama, the House on Tuesday sought to override the president\u2019s veto of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The vote was 241 to 186 in favor of repeal, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed for an override.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019 except that today it actually is Groundhog Day and they\u2019re doing it again,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not really sure that qualifies as the contours of a proactive legislative agenda.\u201dAsked whether the president was eager to use the idea of Republican obstructionism as a political issue during the coming elections, Mr. Earnest said Mr. Obama\u2019s rivals could avoid that problem by simply agreeing to pass the president\u2019s proposals.\u201cProve us wrong. Prove us wrong,\u201d Mr. Earnest said. \u201cDo it. Just do the five things then. Take that argument off the table.\u201dMr. Obama and Mr. Ryan have a long history of sparring, and neither has made much effort in the past months to develop a closer working relationship.In fact, Mr. Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate on the 2012 ticket, has used strikingly harsh language since becoming speaker to describe Mr. Obama and his policies.A frequent Twitter user, Mr. Ryan has repeatedly accused Mr. Obama of leading the country in the wrong direction, has criticized him for \u201cblatant violations of the Constitution\u201d and has called him the \u201cmost polarizing president.\u201dIn a statement about Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Mr. Ryan\u2019s office said he had \u201cin particular, expressed hope that progress can be made to reform our criminal justice and mental health systems.\u201dMr. McConnell has had an even longer and more contentious history with the president. He vowed to block Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda in the president\u2019s first term in an attempt to keep him from being re-elected. In 2013, Mr. Obama joked about their lack of a relationship, saying that when someone says he should get a drink with the Senate leader, he responds, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?\u201dMr. McConnell described the meeting as \u201ca potpourri of discussions about a variety of different issues.\u201d But there were also topics that the three leaders did not address, including the possibility of a new authorization by Congress for the use of military force against the Islamic State.While the discussion at the White House had been expected to focus in part on criminal justice issues \u2014 one of the few areas in which congressional leaders have expressed hope of passing major legislation amid the electoral politics of 2016 \u2014 the recent declaration of the Zika virus as a global emergency catapulted health issues to the top of the agenda.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Roger Goodell\u2019s Unstoppable Football Machine", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "FeatureFor all the revelations about its brutality, pro football is more popular and profitable than ever. How the N.F.L. commissioner and a group of billionaire owners have kept the league on offense.Supported byThough the Shield is itself a symbol of defense, it still requires safeguarding. Goodell, the league\u2019s tightly coiled and sometimes embattled commissioner, is always going on about how his first job is to \u2018\u2018protect the Shield.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s as if he is paid another huge bonus if he mentions the Shield enough. The Shield evokes gallant warriors and immovable forces, but it is also a reminder that the enterprise is under siege. When Goodell sits at his desk, he gazes upon a large rendering of the Shield on a back wall of his office. \u2018\u2018It is a reminder to look out,\u2019\u2019 he says.These are days of both great confidence and unease in professional football. As with any empire, there is a sense that for all its riches and popularity, the league is never far from some catastrophic demise. You hear talk of the N.F.L.\u2019s \u2018\u2018existential\u2019\u2019 challenges over player health and safety; the nation\u2019s growing concern over concussions and degenerative brain disease; the drop in youth-football participation; lawsuits, regulatory roadblocks and disruptions to the broadcast model that the league\u2019s modern business has been built on.And yet, everyone wants a piece of the Shield. Put it on TV, and people will watch; put it on a jersey, they will wear it. The N.F.L.\u2019s total revenue in 2015 ($12.4 billion) is nearly double that of a decade earlier ($6.6 billion). The price of television ads during the Super Bowl has increased by more than 75 percent over the last decade. This year\u2019s conference championship games set yet another viewership record for the league: 53.3 million people watched the A.F.C. game on CBS; 45.7 million watched the N.F.C. game on Fox. Goodell talks constantly about \u2018\u2018growing the pie,\u2019\u2019 finding new revenue streams and ways to make the N.F.L. a \u2018\u2018year-round\u2019\u2019 experience rather than just during fall and winter. He has said he wants the N.F.L. to achieve $25 billion in gross revenue by 2027. No league is as relentless when it comes to growth and making cash for its billionaire cartel. It\u2019s reminiscent of a shark that will die if it doesn\u2019t keep moving and ripping little fish to shreds.For as familiar as the Shield is, the group that owns it is a closed and mysterious club. These are the proprietors of the league\u2019s teams \u2014 31 of which are owned by individuals, families or partnerships, while the other (the Green Bay Packers) is owned by shareholder fans. As a collective, the N.F.L. owners are known within the league as the Membership.The sport might represent the great spectacle of 21st-century America, played by extraordinary, bulked-up specimens before millions of viewers. But it\u2019s these needy billionaires who own it. They are the heads of the football city-states that stir our civic passions and twist our moods from September to February. They are cutthroat businessmen and competitors, but they also envision themselves as noble stewards of the community.\u2018\u2018We offer a respite,\u2019\u2019 Jerry Jones, the rascally owner of the Dallas Cowboys, told me. \u2018\u2018We are a respite that moves you away from your trials and missteps, or my trials and missteps.\u2019\u2019 Jones describes a weekly display in which representatives from my town and your town meet up. \u2018\u2018And we\u2019ll just have a big old time, being relevant to one another.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Relevant\u2019\u2019 is a curiously timid concept in light of the N.F.L.\u2019s dominance. But it, too, is heard with regularity in N.F.L. circles. Of course the league is relevant to contemporary America \u2014 as the Beatles are relevant to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. I thought of the news conference Bill Clinton gave in 1995 at a particularly low moment of his presidency. \u2018\u2018I am relevant,\u2019\u2019 the most powerful man in the free world felt the need to say. \u2018\u2018The Constitution gives me relevance.\u2019\u2019For its current state of unmatched relevance, the Membership praises Roger Goodell, even if a good part of the football-watching and football-playing public does not. Since Goodell became the league commissioner in 2006, most of the Membership has seen the value of its franchises double (20 are now among the 50 most valuable sports franchises on the planet, according to Forbes).Goodell understands leverage. \u2018\u2018Whenever you have immense power like that, you\u2019ve got the whip hand,\u2019\u2019 said Senator John McCain, who this season criticized the N.F.L. for charging the Department of Defense for promotional events for the military at league games. Goodell thinks little of success, more of the alternative. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m driven,\u2019\u2019 Goodell said. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t like failure. Everything can change so fast in our society, for me or anyone else.\u2019\u2019Another mantra I heard repeated around the N.F.L. headquarters is \u2018\u2018Only the paranoid survive.\u2019\u2019 The phrase \u2014 popularized by Andrew Grove of Intel \u2014 is a Goodell favorite. During my three visits to the N.F.L.\u2019s Park Avenue offices, I was always struck by the thick propaganda of the place. The N.F.L. Network plays at all times on big screens. Every corporate office celebrates itself, to some degree, but the N.F.L.\u2019s is particularly overwhelming, as if it were the sanctum of a highly successful megachurch marrying ESPN and Scientology. I had the strange feeling, as I waited in the lobby, that I was being watched, if not filmed.On my first visit, Greg Aiello, the N.F.L.\u2019s longtime communications director, took me to the cafeteria, known as the Huddle. We passed photo murals celebrating the various Members in their moments of triumph. He brought me an iced tea, sat me down and told me good stuff about the commissioner, good things about the league, big and heady numbers. He handed me positive fact sheets and articles and then, unprompted, summed things up: \u2018\u2018Roger wins.\u2019\u2019On another visit to the Huddle, I met Tod Leiweke, the league\u2019s chief operating officer, who was hired last summer. Leiweke, a former Seattle Seahawks president, has brushed-back white hair, a sunny and almost New Agey manner and a beakish nose that makes him somewhat resemble an actual sea hawk. He wore a beige sweater with the Shield embroidered across his chest. Leiweke got to know Goodell on a climb up Mount Rainier with other executives. Over lunch, he hurled mountain metaphors at me. \u2018\u2018There are \u00adchallenges to running the most successful league in the world,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like clouds on Rainier. Not everything\u2019s perfect, but you fight through it.\u2019\u2019 He continued: \u2018\u2018The league is trying to climb new mountains of its own.\u2019\u2019He described Goodell as \u2018\u2018convicted,\u2019\u2019 meaning, it seemed, having strong convictions. \u2018\u2018Roger is hard-working, dedicated, convicted, tenacious,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018He is an amazing, convicted guy.\u2019\u2019 He closed on message. \u2018\u2018And he\u2019s a winner.\u2019\u2019Pats fans have company in their distaste for the commissioner. Goodell has come under blistering public criticism, periodic calls for his resignation and a procession of rebukes in court over a host of incidents and scandals \u2014 each knowable in shorthand (Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson, the various \u2018\u2018-gates\u2019\u2019). He is booed every year at the N.F.L. draft. There are sports bars with dartboards featuring his likeness. Goodell\u2019s high profile is itself a testament to football\u2019s runaway prosperity and popularity. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like the old saying,\u2019\u2019 the Houston Texans\u2019 owner, Robert C. McNair, told me. \u2018\u2018The higher up the palm tree the monkey climbs, the more of his ass is exposed.\u2019\u2019 McNair laughed. He supports Goodell, although he thinks his astronomical salary makes him a target of easy resentment ($44 million in 2012 and $35 million in 2013 in salary and bonuses, the last years those numbers were available).Every chief-executive job involves political duties, but watching Goodell, who is 56, evokes a most familiar mastery. I live in Washington and usually write about politics; Goodell \u2014 whose father, Charles Goodell, was a senator from New York \u2014 seems very much of that world. On camera, Goodell can come off as tight, smug and sanctimonious \u2014 a politician, and not a particularly compelling one. Since the Ray Rice domestic-violence scandal of 2014, he rarely speaks to the news media in unsafe settings. He repeats himself often and recites talking points. \u2018\u2018We\u2019d like to see him more relaxed and smiling and answering the questions,\u2019\u2019 McNair said. \u2018\u2018You know, he\u2019s got all these legal advisers telling him you can\u2019t say this or you can\u2019t say that.\u2019\u2019But as he worked the stadium from midfield before the N.F.C. championship game, Goodell\u2019s schmoozing genes were elite. He moved among his constituents in a former jock\u2019s ballet of bro-hugs and two-handed handgrips, punctuated with backslaps. He received guests, laughing easily if not for real. Goodell made sure to seek out Panthers executives, the Cardinals\u2019 owner, referees and each head coach.\u2018\u2018Come on, let\u2019s walk,\u2019\u2019 Goodell told me. \u2018\u2018If we don\u2019t get away from the crowd, we\u2019ll never get this done.\u2019\u2019 Goodell said he spends many N.F.L. Sundays watching games at home in Bronxville, north of New York City. He boasted about his man cave equipped with three TVs, which he watches simultaneously while checking multiple laptops. He watches as a fan, as the commissioner and as a micromanager, firing off emails, making calls to his staff about everything from a referee\u2019s call to something an announcer said to a promotion he caught that should not have aired. Goodell told me he spends most weekends watching game after game of football \u2014 pro, college and even high school. I asked him if he had seen \u2018\u2018Concussion,\u2019\u2019 the Will Smith film about the devastating toll of head injuries in N.F.L. players and the league\u2019s complicity in either ignoring or covering up the problem. Goodell said he would get around to it. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t tell you the last time I\u2019ve been to a movie,\u2019\u2019 he told me, although in the next breath he said he had seen \u2018\u2018The Intern,\u2019\u2019 starring Robert DeNiro, with his twin teenage daughters during the snowstorm the night before. Goodell then shoveled out his driveway so he and his wife could go to Soul Cycle on Sunday morning before he flew down to Charlotte via N.F.L. corporate jet. He likes people to know that he\u2019s a workout fiend. He gets up at 5:30, does his weights and cardio and gets \u2018\u2018jazzed up\u2019\u2019 to start his day. He has no visible belly but always seems to be flexing his torso under tight blue suits. Goodell also likes it known that he used to play football in high school, and he appears to be especially energetic around N.F.L. players in their workplace.More and more, the commissioner\u2019s job is to serve as a protective buffer for the Membership. He talks about head injuries so that the owner of, say, the Buffalo Bills does not have to. No one called for the resignation of the Ravens\u2019 owner, Steve Bisciotti, after the video of Ray Rice knocking out his girlfriend in an Atlantic City elevator went public. Goodell testified before Congress on concussions in 2009 and listened to Representative Linda T. S\u00e1nchez of California compare the N.F.L. to the tobacco industry for its indifference to the physical harm being done to its players. \u2018\u2018He is smooth, very smooth,\u201d Jerry Jones said of Goodell. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d say he\u2019s very classy. You see that kind of discipline and refinement.\u2019\u2019Goodell was the middle of five boys born in seven years to Jean and Charles Goodell. His father was a moderate Republican congressman who was appointed to succeed Senator Robert F. Kennedy after Kennedy\u2019s assassination in 1968. Charles Goodell was a favorite of President Richard M. Nixon until he turned against the Vietnam War and introduced a bill to end it. The White House then turned against Goodell and worked to defeat him in the 1970 election. Roger, only a boy, followed his father everywhere on the campaign trail. From this, the commissioner learned the value of making tough and principled decisions, he says. He keeps a copy of his father\u2019s Vietnam Disengagement Act on the wall of his office.Goodell is married to Jane Skinner, a former Fox News anchor and the daughter of Samuel Skinner, a former transportation secretary and White House chief of staff under George Bush. As troubles have swirled around the league, Goodell has relied heavily on the counsel of Glover Park Group, the Washington lobbying, crisis and public-affairs giant. Joe Lockhart, a Glover Park \u00adfounder and the White House press secretary for the Monica Lewinsky-era Bill Clinton, was recently named the N.F.L.\u2019s executive vice president of communications; Cynthia Hogan, former counsel to Vice President Joe Biden, was hired after the Ray Rice affair to run the league\u2019s strengthened public policy and government affairs arm.One key to being a good politician is an ability to identify and prioritize constituencies. Goodell keeps a call sheet at his desk with the names of all the team owners. Their ranks are mostly male and mostly white, with a few exceptions, including Martha Firestone Ford, the 90-year-old widow of the Detroit Lions\u2019 longtime owner, William Clay Ford, and Shahid Khan, the Pakistani-born businessman who owns the Jacksonville Jaguars.Goodell checks in with the Members at least once a month. He is solicitous and attentive and learns what issues are important to them \u2014 precisely what a good legislative leader would do with his caucus. By contrast, Goodell\u2019s predecessor, Paul Tagliabue, had a more distant and even contemptuous relationship with the Membership. He would deal with seven or eight prominent owners and mostly leave the rest to his staff. One player agent described Tagliabue, a cerebral lawyer, as a parental and elusive figure whom the Membership grew tired of, and vice versa. Tagliabue was the longtime outside counsel to the league, while Goodell spent his entire career in the league office. With Goodell, the Membership hired someone more like a younger brother.Goodell serves at the Membership\u2019s pleasure and carries out their wishes, except when he is fining them, taking their draft picks away and damaging their reputations. \u2018\u2018How many jobs do you have where you actually can end up disciplining your boss?\u2019\u2019 Goodell wondered. But Goodell, who started working at the league after graduating from Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, never wanted to work anywhere else. \u2018\u2018If there is one thing I want to accomplish in my life besides becoming commissioner of the N.F.L.,\u2019\u2019 he wrote to his father in a letter while in high school, \u2018\u2018it is to make you proud of me.\u2019\u2019Jones might be one of the more castigated owners in sports, in large part over his continued insistence after 27 years on being exhaustively involved in the team\u2019s football operations (he holds the title of general manager, a rare designation among owners). The once-dynastic Cowboys have not been to a Super Bowl in two decades. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s numbing, it\u2019s numbing, what\u2019s happened to us,\u2019\u2019 Jones said as his team\u2019s record sat at 3-8.He is, in some ways, the embodiment of today\u2019s N.F.L.: rich, bold, distracted, insecure and more than a little tone-deaf. He can also be irresistibly fun, with a big taste for Scotch, a gleam in his icy aqua eyes and a penchant for stem-winding parables that he will often stumble over but that will still make a strange kind of sense.When I asked him why the N.F.L. could hum along so profitably despite the perennial crises it faces, Jones launched into something he once heard from a friend who owned a chain of Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurants. He asked this friend how he could keep the tastes and flavors of the food consistent from franchise to franchise. The answer: intensity. \u2018\u2018If something is supposed to be cold, make it as cold as hot ice,\u2019\u2019 Jones said. \u2018\u2018If it\u2019s supposed to be hot, have it burn the roof of their mouth. Intensity covers up a lot of frailty in the taste and preparation.\u2019\u2019 Likewise, the intensity and drama of football can obscure the dangers, decadence and moral ambiguities inherent to the beloved blood sport.Owners like Jones tend to think of themselves as the geniuses behind the league. They are the ones who build the stadiums, lead the committees, spend their own money and then see their egos tossed up and down on a scoreboard every week. \u2018\u2018Each team is a sovereign nation unto itself,\u2019\u2019 said Nate Jackson, who played six years in the N.F.L. with the Denver Broncos and later wrote a memoir, \u2018\u2018Slow Getting Up.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018They have their own general and their own infantry. They have young men fighting old men\u2019s battles.\u2019\u2019The owners\u2019 ranks are composed of a mix of new money and legacy owners from old-line N.F.L. families. Rivalries and petty grudges can play out in meetings, but the real face-offs happen by proxy. I talked by phone to Mark Wilf, a co-owner of the Minnesota Vikings, a few days after the Vikings were defeated by the Seattle Seahawks in the first round of the playoffs when the Vikings\u2019 kicker, Blair Walsh, missed a 27-yard field goal in the final seconds (and later openly sobbed at his locker). Wilf grew up a Giants fan in New Jersey and used to take losses hard, he said. He remembered his father telling him: \u2018\u2018It could be worse. You could be the owner.\u2019\u2019I had watched the final seconds of the Vikings-Seahawks game on a TV in the concourse of Fed-Ex Field in suburban Maryland, where the Washington Redskins were hosting the Packers. I have always been fascinated by Daniel M. Snyder, the Redskins\u2019 owner, whose unpopularity represents an extremely rare point of agreement among Democrats and Republicans in the capital. He has been pilloried on a variety of issues, from running off accomplished coaches and meddling in football decisions (the Redskins have made the playoffs only five times since he bought the team in 1999) to refusing to change the team name, which offends many.I met Snyder for the first time a few days later in Houston, where he had joined his fellow Members in a special session to resolve which team, or teams, would move to Los Angeles. Snyder, who made his fortune in marketing, is known for aggressive revenue initiatives (at one point charging fans to watch training camp). These tactics might be unpopular to customers, but they have made the Redskins one of the league\u2019s most valuable franchises. Snyder was joined by Tony Wyllie, the Redskins\u2019 public-relations representative, whose sole reason for flying all the way to Houston on Snyder\u2019s jet seemed to be to babysit for my 10-minute meeting. Wyllie suggested strongly to me beforehand that Snyder does not like discussing \u2018\u2018the name issue.\u2019\u2019I found Snyder jittery and vulnerable and eager to present himself well. He said he supported Goodell (\u2018\u2018the Shield comes first\u2019\u2019). He struggled keeping eye contact. But what struck me most was the devastation that came over Snyder when he brought up his team\u2019s loss to the Packers a few days earlier \u2014 which he did six separate times. \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t even talk about it,\u2019\u2019 Snyder said, shaking his head, and then talking about it. \u2018\u2018I thought we were going to win that game, man.\u2019\u2019 He marveled over how great Aaron Rodgers, the Packers\u2019 quarterback, was. \u2018\u2018God almighty, this is just terrible,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018This really, really hurts.\u2019\u2019 He said he grows jealous of other owners whose teams are still playing. I asked him how long it would take him to recover. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll probably start to feel better after the Super Bowl,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018When all the teams are unbeaten again.\u2019\u2019Certain members of the Membership are more influential than others to Goodell, though he will never admit this. Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder and the owner of the Seahawks, is almost never seen or heard from by the league. Neither is the Lions\u2019 matriarch, Martha Firestone Ford, although she did browbeat Goodell at a meeting over terrible officiating. Goodell speaks most days to the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 chairman, Daniel M. Rooney, the commissioner told me. Rooney, 83, is a former ambassador to Ireland and an N.F.L. elder statesman who knocked on the door of Goodell\u2019s hotel room in 2006 to tell him that he had been elected commissioner.There is a core of men you always hear described as \u2018\u2018key owners.\u2019\u2019 They include heirs to old-line N.F.L. families \u2014 Art Rooney II of Pittsburgh (Daniel\u2019s son), John K. Mara of the New York Giants and Clark Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs. Then there are (relatively) newer, more classically entrepreneurial owners \u2014 Robert McNair in Houston, Jerry Richardson in Carolina, Jerry Jones in Dallas and Robert K. Kraft in New England.It also says something about the generational and demographic makeup of the Membership that these influential \u2018\u2018newer\u2019\u2019 owners are all white men in their 70s. They skew Republican. Mitt Romney was ridiculed in 2012 for asserting his love of football by boasting that some of his good friends owned N.F.L. teams; the Jets\u2019 owner, Woody Johnson, is the national finance chairman for Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign; McNair, the Texans\u2019 owner and a big Republican donor, gave $10,000 last year to help repeal a ballot initiative in Houston that protected gays and lesbians from forms of discrimination.McNair, 78, has a bald oval head and bears a slight resemblance to Mr. Clean. He speaks in a blunt drawl. I asked him what he thought of having his team featured last summer on the HBO reality show \u2018\u2018Hard Knocks,\u2019\u2019 about life at an N.F.L. training camp. He said it was a net plus, although he was distraught over how much swearing there was and joked that Coach Bill O\u2019Brien should introduce a cuss jar. I asked McNair if he was as sensitive to other offensive language, specifically the N.F.L. team in the nation\u2019s capital\u2019s being named the Redskins. McNair told me that he grew up in western North Carolina, around many Cherokee Indians. \u2018\u2018Everybody respected their courage,\u2019\u2019 McNair told me of the Indians. \u2018\u2018They might not have respected the way they held their whiskey, but. .\u2009.\u2009.\u2019\u2019 He laughed. \u2018\u2018We respected their courage. They\u2019re very brave people.\u2019\u2019 Put McNair down as not offended by \u2018\u2018Redskins.\u2019\u2019Outside, the citizens of various kingdoms massed. I befriended a group of Oakland Raiders fans who had gathered on the sidewalk in front of the Westin Memorial City Hotel. They had traveled here from as far away as Northern California to display a giant black-and-silver flag and show support for their team\u2019s staying in Oakland despite the efforts of the team owner, Mark Davis, to move the team to Los Angeles. They were joined, in smaller numbers, by fans of the San Diego Chargers and the St. Louis Rams, who were also at risk of seeing their teams bolt.\u2018\u2018The Raiders are bigger than football,\u2019\u2019 a college student named Ray Perez said. Perez, who calls himself Dr. Death, wore a frizzy black wig and striped black-and-white jail pants. He relayed to me an important lesson that his Raider Nation mentor, Raider Jerry, had once imparted. Being a part of this brotherhood involves much more than being a sports fan. It is a form of giving back. Raider Nation is not a club, it\u2019s a movement. \u2018\u2018And it is a people-driven movement,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Death added. \u2018\u2018We show the power of people coming together for something that we love and believe in.\u2019\u2019Their power was limited here. The Membership ground through their day of private votes and deliberations in a meeting room upstairs. They were debating the merits of a proposed stadium project south of Los Angeles in Carson, Calif., that would become the home of the Chargers and possibly the Raiders, as well as a more ambitious extravaganza in Inglewood, on a 60-acre tract near Hollywood Park, that had been imagined by the Rams\u2019 owner, Stan Kroenke.Late in the day, Jerry Jones announced to the commissioner that if discussions went on much longer, he would have no choice but to escape to the hotel bar with the Lions\u2019 Martha Firestone Ford (beer and wine were brought into the meeting room). Paul Allen, who never attends league meetings, showed up for the first time in five years and, according to one owner afterward, \u2018\u2018didn\u2019t shut up.\u2019\u2019By nightfall, the tired tycoons began moving through the lobby en route to waiting limos that would ferry them to private jets and the hell out of Houston. Word emerged that the Membership had voted by secret ballot \u2014 30-to-2 \u2014 in support of the Rams\u2019 multibillion-dollar project in Inglewood. After the vote, Kroenke, a clunky-mannered real estate magnate with a charm quotient to rival the Rams\u2019 meager win totals of recent years, joined Goodell for a news conference. He has a pale and jowly countenance, an unruly comb-over and a \u201970s-vintage mustache. He is known as \u2018\u2018Silent Stan,\u2019\u2019 and the news conference was about as much as he had spoken publicly in years. \u2018\u2018We spend a lot of resources trying to make sure that we stay relevant,\u2019\u2019 he said in a monotone-mumble. Ray Ratto, a Bay Area sportswriter, observed via Twitter that Kroenke looked as if he were \u2018\u2018overdue for his next baby wombat blood injection.\u2019\u2019I parked myself in the lobby and watched the owners escape. \u2018\u2018Hey, y\u2019all,\u2019\u2019 said Tom Benson, the New Orleans Saints\u2019 88-year-old owner, while rolling his wheelchair by. Jones held forth nursing a tumbler of Scotch. The Jets\u2019 owner, Woody Johnson, strolled past him unbothered, wearing a suit and a Jansport backpack over both shoulders. \u2018\u2018Everybody wins in this deal,\u2019\u2019 the Miami Dolphins\u2019 owner, Stephen M. Ross, declared to a bank of reporters as he trailed Johnson out the door. \u2018\u2018What about the fans of St. Louis?\u2019\u2019 someone in the gallery cracked. Ross shrugged. \u2018\u2018Well, somebody has to lose,\u2019\u2019 he said.Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, who represents the abandoned fans of St. Louis, worked closely on the Rams\u2019 relocation process. What is rankling about the league, she said afterward, is its insistence that it is driven by factors beyond the bottom line. \u2018\u2018The money involved in the L.A. plan was irresistible for a league that is focused on growing it to a $25 billion enterprise,\u2019\u2019 McCaskill told me. She described Goodell as \u2018\u2018careful.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018He is always trying to measure the most important constituency, which are the 32 owners, against all the other pressures,\u2019\u2019 she said.The loser among the Membership was Mark Davis, the Everyman spawn of the Raiders\u2019 outlaw founder, Al Davis. His father, who died in 2011, was at constant war with the league. He still engenders bad will among certain owners in a way that does no favors for his son. (\u2018\u2018Oakland gets nothing,\u2019\u2019 Robert McNair told me. \u2018\u2018Al used to sue us all the time.\u2019\u2019) Mark Davis sports a blond version of the Jim Carrey bowl cut from \u2018\u2018Dumb and Dumber.\u2019\u2019 (I could also see Captain Kangaroo.) He wears a fanny pack, drives a 1997 Dodge Caravan, used to frequent Hooters for its all-you-can-eat-wings specials and looks every bit the misfit cousin who keeps showing up at the Membership\u2019s Thanksgiving table. It could not have been easy being Al Davis\u2019s son. As a practical matter, Mark Davis\u2019s family baggage also includes a most unfortunate pre-existing condition \u2014 the worst \u2018\u2018facility\u2019\u2019 in the league, Oakland\u2019s O.co Coliseum, which he shares with the Athletics baseball team.I found Mark Davis leaning against a couch and talking to a group of Raiders fans in the bar of the Westin late that night. He had changed into a powder \u00adblue sweatshirt and black-and-white sneakers and wore a relaxed air of resignation. I asked whether he was mad at Goodell. \u2018\u2018Nah, I call Roger the pope,\u2019\u2019 Davis told me. I wondered why. \u2018\u2018I like to bust his chops.\u2019\u2019 He is fully aware of his runt-of-the-litter standing within the Membership. \u2018\u2018Everyone thinks I have no money,\u201d Davis said. \u2018\u2018But I\u2019ve got $500 million and a team.\u2019\u2019Two weeks earlier, Joe Thomas, a star offensive tackle for the Cleveland Browns, compared Goodell to the professional-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon in an ESPN interview. Thomas did this while voicing support for Brady, saying that the punishment for whatever the quarterback might have done with his footballs was akin to getting the death penalty for a minor traffic violation. Thomas also called the commissioner\u2019s tactics \u2018\u2018brilliant.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018He\u2019s made the N.F.L. relevant 365 [days a year] by having these outrageous, ridiculous witch hunts,\u2019\u2019 Thomas said of Goodell. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s made the game more popular than ever, and it\u2019s become so much more of an entertainment business, and it\u2019s making so much money.\u2019\u2019 He added: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s almost like the Kim Kardashian factor \u2014 that any news is good news when you\u2019re in the N.F.L.\u2019\u2019 The Membership knows the power of a well-placed villain in the name of relevance. \u2018\u2018Make no mistake about it: Legitimate negative criticism does not diminish interest,\u2019\u2019 Jones told me. \u2018\u2018I know we have a huge element of fans that dislike the Cowboys,\u2019\u2019 he added with some pride.I asked Goodell what it was like to be hated. Not just unpopular, but really hated, the way sports fans hate these days, with threats and vulgar tweets and increased police vigilance at his vacation home in Maine during the summer of Deflategate. He said it is part of the job. \u2018\u2018You get knocked down, and you get up,\u2019\u2019 Goodell said. \u2018\u2018Nobody cheers for the commissioner,\u2019\u2019 he added, quoting something the former commissioner Pete Rozelle used to tell him.But Rozelle ran a much different N.F.L. and, maybe more to the point, at a very different time. The N.F.L. did not aspire to year-round relevance; the early N.F.L. drafts were a few dozen people in a hotel ballroom, as opposed to the three-day, nationally televised arena pageant they have now become. Limits were not pushed as far. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like this thing I say around the office, \u2018Believe in better,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Goodell told me. \u2018\u2018Everything can get better. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s ratings or attendance or anything. We can make it better if we really work at it.\u2019\u2019A few days before the conference championship games, Antwaan Randle El, a former wide receiver for the Steelers and the Redskins, said in an interview that he wished he had played baseball instead of football. At only 36, Randle El said he has bouts of memory loss. Goodell spun this news as a triumph of elevated awareness and more open discourse. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s part of the conversation,\u2019\u2019 he told me, meaning that players and former players feel free to \u2018\u2018come forward\u2019\u2019 to discuss medical issues. Rather than ever admitting the obvious \u2014 that the N.F.L. was late to recognize the frequency and dangers of concussions \u2014 he is fond of pointing out the number of \u2018\u2018safety-related rule changes\u2019\u2019 the league has made during his tenure: 39, to be precise. And yet the number of concussions throughout the league is actually up this season.Nate Jackson told me that for all Goodell\u2019s evangelism about making the game safer, back in the locker room, it\u2019s the same conversation as always. \u2018\u2018Hit them as hard as you [expletive] can.\u2019\u2019 He called Goodell \u2018\u2018a football politician, which is his perfect job\u2019\u2019 \u2014 someone who has brilliantly nurtured a system that grows the pie, expands to Europe and possibly Latin America and gains eyeballs trained on the ever-present Shield. The Shield is financial and cultural gold, proof that the system is working \u2014 at least for the Membership.\u2018\u2018To me, the Shield was my loss of identity within a system,\u2019\u2019 Jackson said. \u2018\u2018It was the suggestion that it was not about me. I was prepared to die to make a play. But the reason football is so dangerous is that the men making the decisions are not the ones getting hit.\u2019\u2019As the kickoff of the N.F.C. championship game approached, Bank of America Stadium kept getting louder, until it got quiet. \u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the flag? I can\u2019t find the flag,\u2019\u2019 Goodell said, scanning the field while preparing to observe \u2018\u2018The Star-Spangled Banner.\u2019\u2019 But instead of the song, it was a prayer that would precede the anthem and the rumble, and the commissioner closed his eyes and lowered his head.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Neel Kashkari Says Banks Are \u2018Still Too Big to Fail\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 During the 2008 financial crisis, Neel Kashkari worked tirelessly to save the nation\u2019s largest banks. As a senior Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, he helped those banks grow larger than ever.On Tuesday, he said it was time to think about breaking them up.He described the threat of another crisis that might force the government to bail out large banks, as it did in 2008, as a rare instance of a clear and preventable problem.\u201cThe question is whether we as a country have the courage to actually take action now,\u201d he said.Mr. Kashkari\u2019s remarks caused a stir in Washington. Such views have become relatively common at both ends of the political spectrum \u2014 providing fuel for the presidential campaigns of Senator Bernie Sanders, Democrat of Vermont, and Donald Trump, a Republican \u2014 but Mr. Kashkari is a moderate Republican and a former employee of Goldman Sachs.\u201cThere are lines in your speech I can imagine a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren saying,\u201d David Wessel, a former economics editor at The Wall Street Journal who moderated the Brookings event, told Mr. Kashkari during a panel discussion after the speech. \u201cIt\u2019s not what one expects from a Goldman Sachs Republican.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m not willing to stand up and share my concerns, then I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job,\u201d he said.Donald L. Kohn, who worked with Mr. Kashkari during the crisis as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, said after the speech that he had greater confidence than Mr. Kashkari in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which grants regulators new powers to constrain and, if necessary, dismantle large banks.\u201cI think the new regime, once it\u2019s fully in place, probably will work,\u201d he said.Mr. Kashkari said the cost of large crises underscored the importance of minimizing risk. \u201cIt\u2019s not simply the cost of the bailout,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the economic damage that\u2019s inflicted across society.\u201dMr. Kashkari outlined a number of potential options for restraining large banks, although he emphasized that the list was not intended to be comprehensive.The first and most familiar is forcing large banks to break into smaller pieces, the approach favored by Mr. Sanders, who released a statement on Tuesday saying he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the speech.Big banks argue they play a unique role in the global economy, and that foreign rivals would take up the slack. They also say big banks are stronger in some ways, and that regulations are adequate.\u201cBreaking up the U.S.-based global financial institutions would ensure that one of the United States\u2019 most competitive global industries serving companies small and large is turned over to banks based outside the United States,\u201d said John Dearie, acting chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the interests of large financial firms.A third, broader approach would impose a tax on borrowing throughout the financial system, reducing risk-taking not just by banks but a wide range of other financial intermediaries. The role of banks in the financial system has declined over time, and many experts regard the rest of the financial system, relatively less regulated, as a more likely source of future crises.Critics of both the second and third approaches argue that economic growth requires risk-taking, and preventing risk-taking by banks will shift activity to less regulated sectors.Mr. Kashkari said that limiting the risks posed by large banks could allow the government to ease regulation of smaller banks. He also took a pre-emptive shot at the banking industry, noting the \u201cendless objections\u201d its lobbyists have raised to proposals for stronger regulation.\u201cWe need to move before we as a society have forgotten the lessons of \u201908,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Agreement Clears the Way for Airdrops of Humanitarian Aid in Syria ", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byGENEVA \u2014 Most of the Russian and American aircraft traversing Syria have been warplanes firing missiles and dropping bombs. But under an international agreement to aid Syrians trapped in the fighting, Russian planes will soon be dropping food in an operation partly financed by the United States.The United Nations World Food Program will start its first airdrops in Syria in coming days, relief officials said Thursday. The main focus is Deir al-Zour, an eastern Syrian city where more than 200,000 inhabitants are ringed by forces of the Islamic State, which has made land access impossible.Under the emergency aid agreement, truck convoys began supplying food and medicine to five besieged towns in other parts of Syria on Wednesday. Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special envoy for the Syrian conflict who helped to negotiate the final arrangements, had hinted that airdrops were an option for areas that are unreachable by land.The World Food Program will use aircraft provided by a Russian contractor for the drops, which are conducted by parachute from high altitudes, said Bettina Luescher, a spokeswoman for the agency.Mr. de Mistura said in an interview on Thursday with a Swedish newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet, that the United States had agreed to provide $10 million for the airdrops. The United States is the largest contributor to the World Food Program. Russia and the United States back opposing sides in the Syrian conflict and have criticized each other\u2019s use of military air power.Russia supports President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and its aerial forces have been bombing areas held by rebel groups seeking to depose him. The United States supports some of those rebel groups, but a coalition it leads has been using its warplanes to hit territory held by the Islamic State, which the Americans regard as the most pressing threat.Russian diplomats at the United Nations have boasted in recent days that their military planes already dropped food to Deir al-Zour, a government-held city. On Thursday its deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, said he welcomed what he called \u201cthe very important\u201d decision by the World Food Program to follow Russia\u2019s lead.St\u00e9phane Dujarric, a spokesman for the United Nations, told reporters at its headquarters in New York that he expected crews of the Russian contractor, which has done similar food-drop work in South Sudan, to \u201clive up to the terms of their contract and seek only instructions from the United Nations.\u201dThe emergency aid agreement for Syria calls for food and medical deliveries to 480,000 people who the United Nations estimates are trapped in 18 besieged locations.Encouraged by the successful delivery of aid on Wednesday, members of the international task force on humanitarian aid meeting in Geneva on Thursday set the target of reaching all the other besieged areas in the next\u00a0week.Mr. de Mistura, who suspended a brief round of peace talks in early February, has said it will take a steady flow of humanitarian aid and other confidence-building measures for any negotiations to resume.Mr. de Mistura said that he hoped to resume those discussions by next Thursday, but said he could not realistically call a new round of talks by then, although \u201cwe aim to do so soon.\u201dEven as the United Nations was preparing aid convoys to other besieged areas, advancing Syrian government forces backed by intensive Russian airstrikes in the north were progressively cutting off supply lines to opposition-controlled parts of Aleppo, threatening to encircle the city and driving tens of thousands of civilians to the border with Turkey.The United States has also been accused of killing civilians in its Syrian airstrikes. On Thursday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group with a network of contacts inside Syria, said at least 38 civilians were killed in aerial attacks on territory held by the Islamic State in Hasaka Province in northeast Syria. Lt. Gen. Charles Brown, head of the United States Air Force Central Command, told reporters on Thursday that coalition officials would assess the report\u2019s credibility. Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva, and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations. Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Rick Gladstone from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Terror Threats Thaw Budgets Across Europe", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byPARIS \u2014 A phalanx of soldiers wearing bulletproof vests and wielding machine guns fanned out beneath the Eiffel Tower on a recent afternoon, scanning the crowd for potential terrorist threats. Across the country, nearly 10,000 more armed troops patrolled streets around landmarks, stores and government buildings.Although austerity has been losing favor as a cure-all for Europe\u2019s economic ills, a renewed financial crisis in Greece last year kept a focus on belt-tightening. European leaders threatened to let Greece exit the currency bloc if it did not stick with the budget cuts and economic overhauls required for a new bailout. European Union officials admonished France and other countries for failing to meet deficit reduction pledges.\u201cWe are facing serious terrorist acts,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance, as other countries, has to have at its disposal supplementary means.\u201dThe spending has the potential to provide a much-needed stimulus boost to a region that has struggled for years to kick-start growth.France, Germany, Britain and neighboring countries sharply curbed military outlays while austerity was enforced. Since 2007, Western European military spending has slumped more than 13 percent, accelerating a decline that began earlier in the decade. As of last year, only four European member countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization met the mandated military spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product.As security concerns intensify, the trend is reversing.Germany is hiring more police and intelligence officers, and in January the defense minister proposed increasing military spending by \u20ac130 billion, or about $141 billion, over 15 years. The government may also divert part of its \u20ac12.1 billion budget surplus to managing the wave of refugees flooding into the country. France is expanding its military equipment arsenal, troops and police, as well as increasing surveillance and spending hundreds of millions of euros on new programs to counter radicalization among Muslim youth.\u201cWe can\u2019t exclude a new attack \u2014 no one can,\u201d said Michel Sapin, France\u2019s finance minister. \u201cHere and elsewhere, the risk is present. We need to fight against the origin of this instability.\u201dTotal Western European military spending, led by France, Britain and Germany, is expected to jump by an extra \u20ac50 billion through 2019, to \u20ac215 billion, said Fenella McGerty, an analyst at IHS Jane\u2019s Defence Budgets in London. Europe\u2019s security spending, though, will still pale in comparison to that of the United States. Even so, the shift could prove a windfall for security, military and arms manufacturers.As the austerity mind-set took hold, Europe\u2019s big military suppliers quickly felt the pinch. Contract negotiations with government procurement agencies stalled or orders were scaled back.Some companies, like Airbus Group, downsized their military business. In 2013, Airbus Group announced plans to cut 5,800 jobs from its military and space divisions and to focus primarily on a booming commercial jet business.Now, European armies are growing. In a reverse from planned cuts, France is preparing to add 23,000 positions to the army by 2019. A coalition to fight the Islamic State that includes France and Britain will soon intensify the campaign against militants in Iraq and Syria, prompting additional spending on missiles, drones, jets and surveillance.Airbus is well positioned.The company supplies European militaries with a broad range of flying hardware such as the NH90 helicopter, the A400M cargo and troop transporter and the A330 multi-role refueling tanker. Airbus also has high-tech satellite surveillance equipment as well as integrated border and coastal security systems, a particular focus in Europe as the migrant crisis swells.\u201cWe need more cooperation and integration in foreign policy, in defense, in security policy \u2014 and by security I also mean, obviously, internal security,\u201d Thomas Enders, chief executive of Airbus, told reporters recently, citing the failure of some governments to adequately track and monitor potential jihadists traveling across Europe\u2019s internal borders.In addition to new equipment, much of the increased spending will go toward closing intelligence and security gaps that have permitted Islamic State militants to travel through Europe and plan attacks.France, Germany and Britain are hiring thousands of new intelligence officers and upgrading surveillance equipment and software for monitoring communications, especially on the so-called darknet of encrypted networks that terrorists use to communicate and recruit. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is now reversing years of military cutbacks, has authorized Britain\u2019s creation of a new National Cyber Centre to track jihadists.At the same time, private corporations and big cities alike are ramping up surveillance spending.In the days after the Paris attacks, Securitas, a leading provider of security agents in Europe, was swamped with calls from department stores, museums and other outlets scrambling to hire thousands of guards and intensify screening. Securitas, which already had 16,000 agents in France, could provide only 800 more, and has since accelerated hiring to meet demand.At Visiom, a French maker of metal detectors, orders have jumped fourfold since the Paris attacks, especially from sports stadiums, concert halls and large stores.French companies are expected to spend \u20ac500 million more this year for agents, while security firms and police departments will increase orders for everything from bulletproof vests to drones, said Patrick Haas, director of En Toute S\u00e9curit\u00e9, one of the largest French security firms.\u201cWhat has changed after the attacks is that authorities now realize the threat is permanent,\u201d Mr. Haas said. \u201cWe are facing a radical shift.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, using information from a briefing paper for the European Parliament that paraphrased incorrectly from an academic paper on the costs of homeland security in the United States, misstated expenditures since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. In the decade that followed, the United States spent $360 billion on homeland security; the United States has not spent an average of $360 billion a year on homeland security.Nicola Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But it refused to sign the city\u2019s contract for prekindergarten providers, arguing that it gave the Education Department improper oversight over its operations.The city said that the contract was necessary to ensure a consistent level of quality and noted that the 13 other charter school organizations with prekindergarten had signed it. Because of the dispute, Success has not been paid by the city for its program, which has 72 students. It is seeking roughly $720,000 from the city.The network and a group of parents appealed to the State Education Department in October to settle the matter.On Friday, she said that the network would appeal Ms. Elia\u2019s decision in state court.\u201cThe law is clear,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe have a very strong legal case.\u201dBut in her decision, Ms. Elia noted that the city\u2019s request for proposals to run prekindergarten programs clearly stated \u201cno payments will be made by the D.O.E. until the contract is registered with the N.Y.C. comptroller\u2019s office.\u201dShe also ruled that there was nothing contrary to state education law in the city\u2019s oversight of the program.Taking Success\u2019s argument \u201cto its logical conclusion,\u201d Ms. Elia wrote, \u201cwould mean that D.O.E. would be required to provide charter schools\u2019 prekindergarten programs with public funding without any mechanism to ensure\u201d that they were meeting quality requirements, and that \u201cpublic funds are being spent in accordance with the requirements.\u201dMr. de Blasio has been firing back. In an interview this week, he said that his administration had established good relationships with most charter schools in the city. But he cited the dispute with Success over prekindergarten \u2014 his signature initiative \u2014 as reflective of why City Hall has not been able to work with the organization.\u201cEvery other charter school in New York City that has a pre-K program happily signed the contract,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cEvery religious school signed the contract and is abiding by the contract. Success doesn\u2019t want to sign the contract. I think that says it all. They\u2019re a party of one.\u201d\u201cWe will work with anyone who will abide by some actual rules,\u201d he added.Ms. Elia sided with Success on two smaller issues in its appeal. She said that only the city comptroller, not the Education Department, could audit charter schools\u2019 prekindergarten programs. And she said the city could not require Success or other charter schools to pay what is known as a prevailing wage, which is set by the comptroller and reflects the rate that unionized workers are paid for a job in a particular area.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Philanthropist Drills Down to Discover Why Programs Work", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersPHILANTHROPISTS have poured millions of dollars into improving education in the United States \u2014 paying for new buildings, buying new computers and even creating new charter schools.Susan Crown, a member of the billionaire Crown family of Chicago, is trying something different. Two years ago, she began working with organizations that seek to foster character traits like grit, empathy and perseverance, which studies show can be determinants of future success.But financing organizations that focus on social and emotional learning programs for disadvantaged children was just part of the effort. Ms. Crown said she also wanted to go deeper into understanding why some organizations succeeded so well.\u201cThis is my second chapter of foundation life,\u201d Ms. Crown said. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite of my first chapter, which was widespread, very regional, not terribly strategic. There were a million moving pieces. This is a very focused, intentional, high-risk program.\u201dThe organizations each received $100,000. In return, she asked them to gather three times over the two-year period of the grant to dissect what they were doing and why it had proved successful. Her goal was to find the secret sauce and reveal it to other organizations trying to do similar work.The organizations selected for the program do not offer typical after-school programs. One brings teenagers together to create, write, produce and act in musicals with themes like sexual abuse, bullying and urban violence. Another teaches inner-city students how to build wooden boats.Yet these programs seemed to be improving the lives of the small number of participants they served. How were they doing it, and could it be replicated?\u201cIn boat building, you learn stuff,\u201d Mr. Jackson-Adens said. \u201cYou\u2019re free to move. You don\u2019t have a whole lot of restrictions. It\u2019s more of a trial-and-error kind of thing. You learn from those mistakes. In school, if you fail, you\u2019ve failed.\u201dBrett Hart, executive director of the Philadelphia Wooden Boat Factory, grew up in the same neighborhood and has seen the decline in the education and opportunity there firsthand.\u201cWe are at the front lines of educational inequity,\u201d Mr. Hart said. \u201cOur national response has been to double down on items like Common Core.\u201d But, he said, skills like \u201cthe ability to be adaptive, collaborative, resourceful are the tools we need to thrive.\u201dHe said the funding from the Susan Crown Exchange allowed the organization to bring on a social worker to deepen the work it was doing in helping high school students regulate their emotions and focus on the positive and constructive aspects of their lives. But the meetings with the other organizations and the experts Ms. Crown brought in gave Mr. Hart the perspective to incorporate more academic research into what his organization had been doing intuitively, he said.But the analysis of what AHA was doing helped Ms. Freed envision it as something bigger. \u201cThe thing I learned the most about is how to track the development of social and emotional skills through a yearlong process,\u201d she said. \u201cI really learned how to work with other agencies nationwide and imagine AHA as a nationwide program.\u201dOne criticism of these programs is that they need many well-trained counselors and mentors to work in small groups with students, and that makes them expensive to run and replicate. At AHA, there is a six-to-one student-to-mentor ratio. The Philadelphia Wooden Boat Factory program is limited to 36 students a year.Bringing the ideas behind these programs to more people was one reason Ms. Crown wanted to create what is essentially a how-to guide for other groups.The major skills that needed to be developed, she said, were emotion management, empathy, teamwork, responsibility, initiative and problem solving. If there was one superskill, she said, it was \u201cagency,\u201d another way of saying drive.For many philanthropists, undertaking an initiative like this, in which success is hard to quantify in the short term and endless amounts of money could be spent over time, could be too daunting. After all, a building is built and computers are bought \u2014 or not. (Ms. Crown said she thought the program was costing her about $1 million a year.)\u201cMost philanthropy is big idea, but the big idea that no one else is doing is more difficult,\u201d said Bill Woodson, head of the North America family office group at Citi Private Bank. \u201cSome philanthropists are held back because they may lack the resources. Or it may be a time commitment. Some are just pragmatic, and they want to invest in immediate, tangible results.\u201dBut, Mr. Woodson added, \u201cI\u2019d hate philanthropists to be limited in what they\u2019re doing because of measurability requirements.\u201dMs. Crown said assessing success and failure was always on her mind. \u201cSuccess is getting this through a major youth system and to be able to do pre- and post-measurement,\u201d she said. \u201cFailure would be if this did not resonate. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201cIn our field, social and emotional learning has been very vague,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a consequence, of course, for funders and other folks, there wasn\u2019t really anything to talk about. People knew S.E.L. was important, but what they didn\u2019t know was how do you do it.\u201dMs. Crown said she was pleased with how the first group fared and the field guide turned out but added that the Susan Crown Exchange still had a long way to go: \u201cWe have the luxury of time to study something and the attitude of a growth mind-set and the capital to actually do something.\u201d\u201cWe knew that we\u2019re not going to get a perfect calculus equation,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are certain things we can measure and certain things we can\u2019t.\u201dAnd this is where these programs can succeed on a smaller scale. Next fall, Mr. Jackson-Adens will be attending Colorado State University to begin studies that he hopes will lead to becoming a veterinarian.\u201cBoat got me into thinking outside the box,\u201d he said. \u201cIt helped me adjust to different situations.\u201dThat is a life skill anyone could use.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watchdog Group Asks for Inquiry Into Nonprofits Tied to de Blasio", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byA government watchdog group filed a formal complaint with New York City officials on Monday against Mayor Bill de Blasio and the outside political groups tied to him, requesting an investigation into whether their fund-raising and spending violated the law.The move is the latest salvo in two years of public complaints by good government advocates over the groups, run by close allies of the mayor, that grew out of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign. They have since advocated for his policies, beginning with the push for universal prekindergarten and, now, the battle over rezoning and affordable housing.In a five-page letter sent on Monday, the government watchdog group, Common Cause New York, requested that the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board and its Conflicts of Interest Board look into the mayor\u2019s actions and those of the groups, which, Common Cause asserts, run afoul of broadly worded sections of the city charter and of campaign finance law, \u201cas well as the spirit\u201d of those regulations.While the boards must consider complaints, they are not required to respond to the letter or issue rulings.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve said from the beginning is anything that\u2019s supporting this administration\u2019s goals or anything I\u2019m involved in must be fully disclosed,\u201d Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, told reporters on Monday.Nonprofits of this type are not new or unique to New York and are permitted to engage in political activity, so long as it is not their primary activity. They can seek to influence pending legislation, if, in New York State, they register as lobbyists. Allies of the mayor said similar sorts of nonprofits were used by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to support their policy goals.Common Cause New York requested that the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board and its Conflicts of Interest Board look into nonprofit groups, run by close allies of Mayor Bill de Blasio, that have helped advocate for his policies.\u201cThe goal of the letter is making clear that we do not accept that dark money is a necessary part of the modern mayoralty,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, who has long been critical of the nonprofit groups. What changed this year, she said, was that the emergence of new groups suggested the practice of creating such nonprofits was becoming solidified as a feature of city government.\u201cThere has been a proliferation of the problem in the recent weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a mushrooming of this problem around the Campaign for One New York.\u201d\u201cI think we should be having more of a conversation openly about what the city should be,\u201d Mr. Massey said of his group.Mr. de Blasio defended the fund-raising and spending by the Campaign for One New York to reporters on Monday, saying it had been done \u201cproperly\u201d and fully disclosed. \u201cIt\u2019s not dark money if it\u2019s disclosed,\u201d he said.Ms. Lerner, in her letter, raised several questions for the two city boards, including whether it was appropriate for the mayor to seek political strategy advice from public relations consultants who also represent firms that do business with the city, and whether the Campaign for One New York might be subject to campaign finance laws \u201cat some later date,\u201d if it is not already, as the mayor\u2019s re-election bid gets underway.Dan Levitan, a spokesman for the group, said it had gone \u201cabove and beyond all legal requirements by voluntarily disclosing all of its donors and spending in all of its activities.\u201dThe chairwoman of the Campaign Finance Board, Rose Gill Hearn, said in a statement that city elected leaders were responsible \u201cfirst and foremost to the voters, not to wealthy special interests.\u201d She added that despite the Supreme Court decision in Citizens United that created \u201csome novel challenges,\u201d the board would \u201calways seek to protect this core principle to the full extent the law allows.\u201dThe board would review the letter, a spokesman said.William Neuman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cornell\u2019s Plan to Merge Hotel School Gets an Icy Reception", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byThe school is considered the Harvard of hospitality programs, consistently topping best-of lists and rankings. Its graduates, school officials like to say, do not just run individual hotels, they own entire hotel chains or groups of restaurants. Among its alumni are Drew Nieporent, the celebrated New York City restaurateur whose crown jewels include Tribeca Grill and Nobu; Ted Teng, president of Leading Hotels of the World; and Andrew H. Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation.So perhaps it was no surprise that alumni and students reacted with something akin to a tirade on the hotel rating site TripAdvisor, when Cornell\u2019s board of trustees recently voted to establish a new College of Business. The idea, university officials say, is to fold the hotel school, along with two other business schools, into the new college, strengthening the individual programs in the process.\u201cVery disappointed in Cornell\u2019s decision,\u201d Paul F. Foley, class of 1974, lamented on a Facebook page set up to protest the move. \u201cThe decision and its process was fatally flawed from its inception.\u201dAfter the trustees\u2019 vote, Liz Longstreet, who graduated in 2008, wrote, \u201cI literally feel sick.\u2019\u2019But the hotel school\u2019s stakeholders were especially vocal.\u201cWe want to keep our identity as \u2018hotelies,\u2019\u201d Alec Ulnick, a junior at the hotel school, said, as he worked the reception desk at the Statler on a recent weeknight.\u201cYou have to understand that the people who graduated from this place are attached to it intellectually and emotionally,\u2019\u2019 said Steven Carvell, an associate professor at the hotel school and its associate dean for academic affairs. \u201cThey have an adoration for the school that is different.\u201dSince a vote by the trustees last month authorizing the College of Business, Dr. Kotlikoff and the university president, Elizabeth Garrett, have sought to explain the rationale behind the new college and reassure agitated alumni. In emails and forums, they have argued that a business college encompassing the three schools will elevate Cornell\u2019s business profile.After the consolidation, which is expected to unfold during the 2016-17 academic year, the Cornell school will rank third in terms of size of its research faculty, behind Harvard Business School and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, none of the three individual schools at Cornell, each with 45 to 60 faculty members, rank in the top 10.As a result of the merger, Dr. Kotlikoff said, opportunities for new interdisciplinary programs will emerge from the schools\u2019 collective expertise in agriculture, food security, sustainability, hospitality, finance and technology.The business college should also help Cornell recruit faculty members, Dr. Kotlikoff said.\u201cThe whole attraction to faculty when you come to a program is: \u2018Whom can you work with? What are the collaborative possibilities?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much better sell if you can say you\u2019re coming into an overall department with lots of colleagues working on different things.\u201dTo placate alumni, officials have pledged that the schools will retain their names and that all three will have their own deans.Still, worry persists among alumni like Jan D. Freitag, a 1997 hotel school graduate and now a hotel analyst. \u201cWe were taken aback,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is some fear that the special feeling in the hotel school is going to be rolled up into a larger entity.\u201dMr. Nieporent, a member of the class of 1977 who has opened 39 restaurants in the past 30 years, said, \u201cA vast majority of the alumni certainly would have preferred that it be kept the way it was.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cif it\u2019s a fait accompli, I\u2019m going to be positive about the future. I\u2019m confident that going forward the school won\u2019t lose its eminence.\u201dOthers object to the process itself, saying the administration sprang news of the trustees\u2019 vote on distracted students and faculty in mid-December, during final exams and before the holidays. There were no public meetings or faculty committees organized to deliberate the change. Three governing bodies, the Faculty Senate, University Assembly and Student Assembly, all voted to ask the trustees to delay the vote until March.\u201cLike professors at other colleges and universities, faculty at Cornell want to be consulted on major decisions,\u201d said Michael Fontaine, acting dean of the faculty and an associate professor of classics.Dr. Kotlikoff countered that the faculty and others had for years weighed in on the fragmented nature of the business programs at Cornell, through task forces and committees. \u201cThere has been a lot of previous faculty involvement, but it didn\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d he said.In authorizing the new business college, Dr. Kotlikoff said, the trustees merely created a framework. \u201cWe asked the trustees to create an empty vessel and enable this process, which is so difficult in academics,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow we will get the faculty to work through the governance details that only they can determine.\u201d\u201cWithin Cornell, each of the business schools is a really strong 150-pound sumo wrestler, but they are up against some 350-pound sumo wrestlers,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said. \u201cTo have Johnson, Dyson and the Hotel schools come together under a business college will give them a seat at the table.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Should We Break Up the Big Banks?", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byLettersTo the Editor:Steve Eisman understates his case that large banks did not aggravate the financial crisis. The harm came from leverage, but mostly from the politicians\u2019 drive for easier home financing.Large banks are more tightly regulated than small banks. Therefore, breaking up large banks would allow more folly, not less.Granted, the rules still allow banks to be too leveraged; fines should hurt the wrongdoers and not their shareholders; the lobbying power of banks should be curbed; and the Fed\u2019s powers to take emergency measures must be enhanced. But the public\u2019s instinctive reaction against large banks is a recipe for greater, not less, risk of crises.NICHOLAS L. GEORGAKOPOULOSIndianapolisThe writer is a professor at Robert H. McKinney School of Law, Indiana University.To the Editor:Steve Eisman\u2019s primary argument is that the financial crisis was caused by leverage. Actually, it was caused by the credit rating agencies giving investment-grade ratings to junk investment packages. Without that, almost nobody would have invested in those securities in the first place.A large number of these mortgages were made with \u201cteaser\u201d introductory payment plans. And very predictably, after the teaser period expired, and borrowers were on the hook for much larger payments, is precisely when the losses exploded.There are two important takeaways here. First, there is no longer any business model for credit rating agencies to operate under that doesn\u2019t have a built-in conflict of interest. This is because they make their money from the sellers of the securities.Second, it should be illegal to sell mortgages with any kind of introductory payment schedules. If borrowers cannot make the payments today, it\u2019s a fool\u2019s assessment to expect that they will be in a better position to make those payments a couple of years from now.ZIP G. ZINZELEl PasoTo the Editor:Steve Eisman is correct that leverage was the reason that the house of cards came tumbling down. However, derivatives played a far greater role than he states. That is apparent because the financial collapse affected banks in Europe and Iceland as well. Derivatives traded among international banks on unregulated markets to increase leverage, amounting to trillions of dollars of junk commercial paper, brought most of the world\u2019s financial houses to their knees.While I agree with Mr. Eisman that breaking up the big banks might not be the ideal solution because of unexpected consequences, his advocacy of comprehensive regulation of the financial sector relies on Congress to keep laws in place, or to pass laws, that rein the bankers in. Because of the enormous lobbying efforts by the financial industry, its advocates have the ears of Congress.If we are going to rely on Congress to regulate Wall Street, then we need to curb Wall Street\u2019s power to influence Congress. Entrenched interests will make that a difficult task.PETER L. RUDENSavannah, Ga.To the Editor:If our largest banks were too big to fail back in 2008, that problem has only been exacerbated in the intervening years as their collective market share has grown. \u201cLiving wills\u201d (plans required by Dodd-Frank for how banks would handle insolvency) cannot solve the problem of too-big-to-fail, which is at root a political phenomenon.Forget Dodd-Frank\u2019s unwieldy regulatory apparatus, which is suffocating banks of all sizes; just put a cap on how large banks can become.

The move by the Treasury Department was the latest effort by the United States to choke off the terrorist group\u2019s flow of cash and personnel.The department said it was targeting Faysal al-Zahrani, a top oil official in Syria; Husayn Juaythini, who has worked with the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, to establish a foothold for the organization in Gaza; and Turki al-Binali, a recruiter and senior religious adviser for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.The sanctions, which freeze any assets or property belonging to the men and bar Americans from having financial dealings with them, are intended to isolate the Islamic State from the world financial system by opening anyone who conducts business with them to penalties.\u201cTreasury and our partners worldwide are aggressively targeting ISIL\u2019s ability to earn and make use of its money, and we are making progress on many fronts,\u201d Adam J. Szubin, the top Treasury Department terrorism and financial intelligence official, said in a statement.Mr. Szubin traveled last week to Turkey and France to speak with government officials and business executives about efforts to target the Islamic State\u2019s finances.

That effort will be a focus of a meeting on Sunday in Paris that will bring together officials from 37 countries and an international task force on terrorist financing to discuss ways of disrupting the group\u2019s financial flows.The Treasury Department said Mr. Zahrani served directly under Abu Sayyaf before his death in an American raid last year, and had sent the terrorist group tens of millions of dollars in oil and gas revenue generated from at least five oil fields he controlled in Al Barakah, Syria.Mr. Juaythini \u201cwas the link\u201d between Mr. Baghdadi and armed groups in Gaza, the department said, and the No. 2 leader of the Mujahidin Shura Council, another sanctioned group that the United States government considers a terrorist organization. The Treasury Department said Mr. Juaythini had tried in 2013 to obtain money and supplies to help that group conduct attacks against Israel. More recently, he \u201cwas instrumental in fostering connections between Gaza- and Libya-based terrorists, and facilitating their travel to Syria,\u201d the department said.Mr. Binali, appointed as the Islamic State\u2019s chief religious adviser in 2014, has acted as a recruiter for the group, and in June 2015, the department said he announced on social media that its next attack would be in Bahrain. Bahrain had revoked his citizenship a few months earlier.Advertisement"}

He wanted the mayor to know that he was available to help and could provide access to volumes of studies and plans related to rail construction that he said could save the city time.\u201cWe even still have a rail car sitting on the tracks behind Fairway in Red Hook,\u201d Mr. Diamond said on Thursday, mentioning one of the Brooklyn neighborhoods that the proposed streetcar line would traverse. \u201cIf the mayor want to use it, he\u2019s more than welcome. It has a beautiful paint job.\u201dMr. Diamond is enamored of Brooklyn\u2019s history with trolleys, which stretches back to horsecars in the early 1800s and cable cars in the middle part of that century. Electric trolleys became so plentiful that Brooklyn\u2019s baseball team was named the Trolley Dodgers in the 1890s, before the name was shortened to the Dodgers.Mr. Diamond\u2019s trolley project began in the 1980s when he decided he wanted to build the first trolley line to run in Brooklyn since 1956, one that would link Red Hook to Downtown Brooklyn.Relying on public and private donors, Mr. Diamond built tracks on donated private property along the Red Hook shoreline. He restored old trolley cars and erected electric poles.Mr. Diamond got approvals and financing, bought 15 vintage street cars and installed 1,500 feet of track in Red Hook. But it all fell apart in 2003 when the city, he said, lost interest in his project, scrapped the plan and ripped up the tracks.His fleet of trolleys included one car from Norway, three Pullman cars from Boston that he bought for $9 total, a locomotive purchased from a New Jersey soybean farmer and a dozen cars from Ohio.\u201cMy advice to the mayor is to create a structure that would survive his tenure in office,\u201d Mr. Diamond said. \u201cThe problem with these projects is that eventually they hit an elected official who says, \u2018I won\u2019t get the credit, so why should I do it?\u2019\u201dMr. Diamond also pointed out that in the early 20th century streetcars ran over all four bridges that cross the East River, a fact that made him consider the possibility of bringing streetcars back to Manhattan.On the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge, he said, there is an abandoned underground trolley terminal at Essex Street, and on the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge there is an old depot.\u201cMaybe there\u2019s way I could fit into this, and be an adviser to the mayor,\u201d Mr. Diamond said of the new proposal.He said he could even draw a small salary.\u201cGive me a try for a couple weeks and see if I work,\u201d he said he would tell the mayor\u2019s team. \u201cThen I can get my teeth fixed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Male Sellers on eBay Have an Edge Over Women, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported bySuccessful sellers on eBay know certain things matter: item description, appealing photos, strong seller ratings and, of course, price.Now, a study published Friday in the journal Science Advances suggested another factor might make a subtle difference: whether the seller is a man or woman. Using data supplied by the company, researchers analyzed some 630,000 auction transactions on eBay in the United States and reported that, on average, when men and women with equal selling reputations sold the same products, women received lower prices than men.The difference was far less pronounced for used items: Women sellers received about 97 cents for every dollar men received. But with new items, where the authors say direct comparison is easier, women received about 80 cents on average for every dollar men sellers received.\u201cThe basic point \u2014 that people have different expectations of women versus men and so we treat them very differently in the world \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating and depressing,\u201d said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, who was not involved in the study.\u201cOn eBay, wow,\u201d she added, noting eBay\u2019s fame as a forum where anyone can sell anything. It also does not require that sellers identify their gender. \u201cThis would be kind of the best example where you would think that discrimination would be at its smallest. So we can interpret these data as a lower bound of what we can expect in other environments.\u201dThe study did not paint a universally negative picture for women. For some items, like toys and pet products, women received somewhat higher prices than men. And women tended to have better reputations as sellers, although they tended to have less selling experience.Nor did the study, which controlled for seller reputation, experience, number of photos, use of bold lettering and other elements, indicate that buyers were actively or even consciously discriminating. Male and female buyers appeared to treat women sellers the same, the authors said.\u201cWe actually think that most of it is unconscious,\u201d said Tamar Kricheli-Katz, a professor of law and sociology at Tel Aviv University, who conducted the study with Tali Regev, an economist at IDC Herzliya. \u201cThe fact is that most of us have biases. We hold them unconsciously, and it makes it difficult to change.\u201dBesides analyzing actual eBay transactions, the researchers conducted an experiment to see if people could tell the gender of sellers from user profiles. People guessed correctly in 1,127 of 2,000 cases, wrong in 170 and did not know the rest.In another experiment, the researchers asked people to place value on a $100 Amazon gift card sold by someone named either Alison or Brad. On average, Alison\u2019s gift card was valued at $83.34, while Brad\u2019s was valued at $87.42.Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and expert on gender wage gaps, said the study was intriguing but needed more analysis. \u201cJust perceiving that somebody\u2019s a woman, what exactly does it mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s got to mean something about the quality of the good or service or something that\u2019s not captured in the data that they have.\u201dWithout that additional information, Dr. Goldin said her hunch is that \u201cthe majority of people would be bidding less if they thought that, \u2018This really isn\u2019t a 1948 Rolex\u2019 or \u2018This really isn\u2019t Jackie Robinson\u2019s signature.\u2019 \u201dThe researchers said eBay allowed them access to data on transactions, sellers and buyers, including gender. They evaluated transactions from 2009 to 2012, focusing on the 420 most popular items in eBay\u2019s broader categories, and on auctions because no negotiation is involved. Sellers considered to be stores were excluded.EBay did not provide financing for the study, but set conditions, according to the authors and to editors at Science Advances. The researchers\u2019 contract allowed eBay to approve any study before publication, mostly for potential disclosure of proprietary data and trade secrets; the authors said eBay \u201cended up approving the study without asking us to drop any of our results.\u201dEBay declined to discuss the specifics of the study with a reporter. In a statement, the company did not challenge the results. \u201cThis study, which was based on data from more than four years ago, was not conducted or commissioned by eBay,\u201d the statement said, adding, \u201cWe are passionate about harnessing our platform to empower millions of people by leveling the playing field for them. We do not reveal the gender of our sellers, although they can choose to do that themselves.\u201dA few female sellers said they believed some buyers reacted differently because they were women.Melanie Fodera, 21, a senior at Albion College in Michigan and a seller for about seven years, said when selling a Detroit Lions jersey for \u201c$100 or best offer,\u201d she was offered $50.\u201cI countered $75, and their message to me was, \u2018You don\u2019t know what this is worth because you\u2019re a girl,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Fodera, who usually sells women\u2019s clothes and has an eBay page decorated with roses.In the 631,516 auctions the authors analyzed, women were about 23 percent of sellers. They received, on average, 0.88 fewer bids for the same items, the authors said. New items, where researchers found the largest gender gap, accounted for 78,350 sales. The biggest advantage for male sellers occurred in categories like new video games (the gap was especially huge for Nintendo Wii).The authors analyzed the text sellers used, finding that women used slightly more positive language, saying \u201cworks great\u201d more often than \u201cnever used,\u201d for example, Dr. Regev said. But wording differences did not account for the price gap.Cecilia Ridgeway, a gender issues expert at Stanford, said when reading the study, \u201cI did not think, \u2018Oh, eBay needs to fix this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think this is a key thing we\u2019ve got to do for gender equality.\u201dStill, she said she viewed the study as an indicator of \u201cthe importance of gender as a way of making sense of any human being. That doesn\u2019t mean people endorse these beliefs; they just know them.\u201dAn article on Saturday about a study that found eBay customers tend to bid higher for items sold by men rather than women misidentified the journal that published the study. It is Science Advances, not Science.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Venues Put Milan on the Contemporary Art Map", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byA player piano sounded an evocative refrain. Light boxes resembling old-time movie marquees were suspended from the soaring ceiling. Shadows floated by on the walls, giving viewers a sense of movement through time and space. In the next room, Anselm Kiefer\u2019s \u201cSeven Celestial Palaces\u201d rose high into the air.A few years ago, it would have been rare to find a major work by a leading cross-disciplinary artist like Mr. Parreno on view in Italy. But HangarBicocca and other venues across Milan have put the city back on the contemporary art map. The new luster seems to come from the alchemy of wealthy private enterprise, a public administration open to experimentation and a young, cosmopolitan professional class hungry for culture.Although elegant, Milan has never been considered gorgeous. Traveling south from France, the 19th-century author Henry James once called it \u201crather perhaps the last of the prose capitals than the first of the poetic.\u201d Both HangarBicocca and the Prada Foundation are in the formerly industrial outskirts of the city, a textbook case of culture\u2019s role in a postmanufacturing economy.In the heart of the city, near the central train station, rises a monument from a different era: Gi\u00f2 Ponti and Pier Luigi Nervi\u2019s Pirelli skyscraper, the symbol of Italy\u2019s postwar economic boom. It now houses government offices for the Lombardy region. That afternoon some of its windows were lit to spell out \u201cFamily Day,\u201d in support of a demonstration against a bill before Parliament that would legalize civil unions.If Italy has always been pulled between conservatism and innovation, then Milan \u2014 the country\u2019s capital of finance, fashion and publishing \u2014 has generally pointed toward the future. (In addition to the early 20th-century Futurism movement, the city also produced the media powerhouse-turned-politician Silvio Berlusconi, whose model for creating a viewership and transforming it into an electorate may have been ahead of its time.)Since its opening, the Prada Foundation has become one of the most dynamic cultural spaces in Europe. \u201cPeople love coming in and out,\u201d Ms. Welter said. \u201cThe exhibition spaces are large but not overwhelming. We don\u2019t call it a museum.\u201dShe was sitting over tea at a mint-green retro Formica table in the Prada Foundation\u2019s Bar Luce. It was designed by the director Wes Anderson , inspired by classic Milan bars from the \u201950s and \u201960s but also echoes elements from his films \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d and \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\u201d Outside, people headed to the cinema for a sold-out film series co-curated by the director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.The foundation\u2019s complex has the feel of a Hollywood back lot. The permanent collection favors works with color and texture \u2014 they were, after all, collected by Miuccia Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli.A separate building covered in gold leaf glows in the evening light. It is filled with works by Robert Gober and Louise Bourgeois, like an avant-garde haunted house. A large tower with more exhibition space is under construction.The Prada Foundation has been organizing shows in temporary venues since the 1990s. In this, it is more akin to Moscow\u2019s Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, which presented cutting-edge exhibitions before opening a permanent space last year, also designed by Mr. Koolhaas, than it is to the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, which opened in a Frank Gehry building in 2014 but is still finding its way in a culture-saturated city.\u201cThe big scale is perfect for art and utopian projects,\u201d Ms. Welter said of the complex\u2019s more than 118,000 square feet of exhibition space.That afternoon, the Polish artist Goshka Macuga was putting the finishing touches on \u201cTo the Son of Man Who Ate the Scroll,\u201d an exhibition that runs through June 19 and features a humanoid android who delivers speeches culled from world history. Ms. Macuga filled another space with 73 bronze heads of historical and contemporary figures, including Albert Einstein, Karl Marx and Aaron Swartz, the Internet activist who committed suicide in 2013.Ms. Macuga, who works in London, said her exhibit asked a central question: \u201cAre we still human?\u201d\u201cAre we still in human time or in a posthuman era?\u201d she continued. She was standing in a room with seven metal assembly lines on which mechanical tools drew images from art history.Hers isn\u2019t the only thought-provoking art project in Milan at the moment. Across town, HangarBicocca is showing \u201cSpace Shuttle in the Garden,\u201d on view through March 13, in which the Kosovar artist Petrit Halilaj uses everything from dirt to video installations for a multimedia exploration of a lost homeland and a search for utopia.In many ways, the Prada Foundation and HangarBicocca complement each other.\u201cPeople that come to Milan and see both institutions will really have access to a wide variety of positions, and that I think is what makes a city richer,\u201d said Vicente Todol\u00ed, the artistic director of HangarBicocca since 2013, after the Pirelli Foundation took over the programming and refurbished the space, which had opened as a contemporary art venue in 2004.Last year, when Milan hosted the Expo world\u2019s fair, HangarBicocca had 200,000 visitors; the Prada Foundation would say only that its attendance since opening had exceeded expectations.He divided the unforgivingly huge space into three sections. Mr. Kiefer\u2019s \u201cSeven Celestial Palaces,\u201d a site-specific work from 2004 in which seven cement towers rise 46 to 60 feet into the air, has been cordoned off from the other areas. Several large-scale paintings by Mr. Kiefer were hung on the walls last year. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a symphonic orchestra to play when another one is playing,\u201d Mr. Todol\u00ed said.In the other room, the sounds of Mr. Parreno\u2019s \u201cHypothesis\u201d filled the air.Advertisement"}

She drew criticism for appearing to endorse violence against Syrian refugees and for referring to a black lawmaker as \u201ccolored.\u201d Her Christmas card last year showed nearly every family member, right down to a small child in glasses, with a firearm in hand or strapped to a hip.But this same woman, Michele Fiore, a conservative Republican Nevada Assembly member from a district in Las Vegas, also emerged as the calm peacemaker in the final hours of an occupation that had captivated the nation. As the final four holdouts screamed on Wednesday night that they believed the F.B.I. was preparing to close in on Malheur Federal Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon and kill them all, Ms. Fiore 45, told them to stay calm because the F.B.I. was not about to break the law. \u201cEveryone has to obey the law, even the government,\u201d she told them. \u201cWe are together and we are going to get through this alive.\u201dThe seizure of the Malheur refuge, about six hours from Portland, staggered through 40 days of periodic tension and tedium, with a continually shifting and often surprising cast of occupiers \u2014 some of them hangers-on, some ferociously committed to an anti-government cause, others there for what seemed like almost a lark. Many of the men and women who gathered around the group\u2019s charismatic leader, Ammon Bundy, had little in common but a reverence for him and his family and an antipathy to the federal government and what they called its \u201coverreach\u201d in managing and owning public lands in the West.Mr. Bundy was arrested last month in an operation that also led to the death of a spokesman for the group, LaVoy Finicum, who was shot by Oregon State Police troopers. And while several people helped persuade the last four occupiers to leave on Thursday, including Gavin Seim, a self-described liberty activist who streamed a video of the occupiers\u2019 telephone conversations, the popular evangelist Franklin Graham; and KrisAnne Hall, a self-proclaimed constitutional educator, few people in the drama came to such vivid life as Ms. Fiore as she counseled the group into surrendering without a fight. Sounding more like a negotiator than a politician, Ms. Fiore \u2014 who has been a vehement supporter of the Bundy family \u2014 took the tone of someone who was in the camp with the holdouts, even as she spoke with them from the airport in Portland, where she had just landed. She used inclusive words like \u201cwe,\u201d in speaking with them, as though she were there too, facing what they faced.\u201cI want my weapons,\u201d one occupier, Sandy Anderson, told her on Wednesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving without our weapons.\u201dMs. Fiore replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t need our weapons right now.\u201d She assured them again that the authorities would not hurt them. \u201cThe world is watching,\u201d she added. Then she casually talked about how tomorrow would come, and normal things would happen, like having coffee.\u201cWe talked about having coffee in the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you guys have coffee for when I get there? Serve me coffee at least?\u201dThe F.B.I. special agent in charge, Greg Bretzing, said at a news conference after the final surrender that her help had been important, thanking her for \u201csignificant assistance.\u201d She, in turn, said the F.B.I. \u201cdid a great job.\u201dBut guns, and provocative language, have always seemed to be at hand too. Last year, in defending a bill she had sponsored that would allow guns on college campuses, she suggested that some sexual predators needed to be killed. \u201cIf these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head.\u201dKirk Johnson reported from Seattle, Julie Turkewitz from Denver, and Mike McPhate from New York.

She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking the talk, but not walking the walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Harpootlian, who supported Mr. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaigns and then backed President Obama in 2008 and 2012, comes with a limited political network given that many prominent South Carolina Democrats have endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Harpootlian does have a knack for attracting news media coverage for his chosen candidates, and Mr. Sanders is far less known in South Carolina than Mrs. Clinton. But he also has a history of offensive statements.In 2012, as state party chairman, Mr. Harpootlian compared Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, with Hitler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistress, Eva Braun. He also used the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cretard\u00e2\u0080\u009d to refer to other Republican leaders, and years earlier insinuated that Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was gay by calling him \u00e2\u0080\u009clight in his loafers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Harpootlian may be best remembered for showing up at a South Carolina campaign event in 2008 that Mr. Clinton was holding for his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign. There, Mr. Harpootlian told reporters that the Clinton campaign was using \u00e2\u0080\u009creprehensible\u00e2\u0080\u009d tactics against the Obama campaign and accused the former president of lying about Mr. Obama in order to continue \u00e2\u0080\u009csome kind of Clinton dynasty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton dismissed the remark but then let loose with a torrent of criticism against the Obama campaign, Mr. Harpootlian and the news media \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a public outburst that was unusual for Mr. Clinton and that cast a pall over the primary race, which Mrs. Clinton went on to lose.Mr. Harpootlian said he warned Mr. Sanders recently that his endorsement came \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith some baggage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He described the senator as unconcerned.\u00e2\u0080\u009cSenator Sanders said he understood that I was supposed to be a pitbull and attack dog when I was party chairman, and sometimes you get carried away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Harpootlian said. He added that he did not plan to apologize for his past remarks.Mr. Sanders has been insistent that he will not run a negative campaign against Mrs. Clinton or harshly attack her. When asked about Mr. Harpootlian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history of negative remarks, Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be responsible for views of people who support Senator Sanders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment on the endorsement.The endorsement is something of a reversal for Mr. Harpootlian, who said last year that he did not see himself supporting Mr. Sanders because the senator was a \u00e2\u0080\u009csocialist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Since then, Mr. Harpootlian said, he has become comfortable with Mr. Sanders\u00e2\u0080\u0099s philosophy of democratic socialism \u00e2\u0080\u009csince it does not involve government control of the economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said he supported the senator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan for broad-based tax increases to finance a single-payer health care system because, according to Mr. Sanders, the tax increases would be offset by savings in health care costs.Mr. Harpootlian is a crucial South Carolina ally of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and he had been involved with the ultimately unsuccessful efforts to encourage Mr. Biden to run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Harpootlian said he asked Mr. Biden last month if he might change his mind and enter the race; the vice president said no, according to Mr. Harpootlian, prompting him to give Mr. Sanders a closer look. Mr. Harpootlian said he did not discuss the Sanders endorsement with Mr. Biden.Mrs. Clinton has a double-digit lead over Mr. Sanders in recent South Carolina polls, and she has the support of many elected and former officials, including two former governors, Jim Hodges and Richard Riley, and many mayors and others, including former Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston. She also has strong support from black Democrats in the state, a key part of the electorate that Mr. Sanders is trying to court.

The plummeting value of the remaining eight casinos has torn a hole in the city\u2019s budget that could not be patched. Its debt rating has been reduced to junk-bond status, and lawmakers are considering an end to its statewide monopoly on casinos. The city could go broke before spring.And yet, Mr. Guardian, in office since 2014, swears that he loves his job and has never considered quitting. Not when New Jersey\u2019s most powerful lawmaker proposed an outright takeover of the city by the state. Or even when the governor, Chris Christie, questioned Mr. Guardian\u2019s courage and leadership.\u201cI don\u2019t know what an easy day is, since it seems we have a crisis every day,\u201d Mr. Guardian said in a recent interview. \u201cI wake up in the morning and I\u2019m happy and I take my shower and I\u2019m even happier, then I read the newspaper and I realize I have to address the latest crisis.\u201dThese days, the crisis is existential. Mr. Guardian is fighting for nothing less than the sovereignty of Atlantic City and its 40,000 residents, about 70 percent of whom are black or Hispanic.He seems an unlikely defender of this relatively poor, predominantly Democratic and notoriously fractious constituency. He is gay, white and a Republican, and at 62, he is holding his first public office after spending much of his career as an executive with the Boy Scouts of America.He has broached the idea of filing the first municipal bankruptcy in New Jersey since the Great Depression, a heretical notion in a city so dependent on free-spending visitors. But by many accounts, Mr. Guardian\u2019s steady guidance through the stormy first two years of his tenure has enhanced his popularity.\u201cTo be under that type of pressure and continue to put on your happy face and be a champion of the residents of this city, you can\u2019t do nothing more than thank him,\u201d said Ernest D. Coursey, an Atlantic County freeholder and a former deputy mayor of Atlantic City, who is a Democrat.John J. Schultz, a former city councilman who has known Mr. Guardian for more than 25 years, said the mayor is frequently stopped by passers-by and praised for his efforts.\u201cThe guy\u2019s very popular,\u201d Mr. Schultz said, describing the scene at a charity fund-raiser they attended at a local tavern on a recent weeknight. \u201cSo many people come up to him and say he\u2019s doing a great job.\u201dMr. Christie blamed the mayor and the City Council for failing to shrink the city\u2019s budget to match the falling fortunes of the state\u2019s casino industry. Atlantic City is still the only place in New Jersey where casinos are allowed, but neighboring states have been licensing competitors at a fast pace. The amount of money Atlantic City\u2019s casinos win each year from gamblers has been sliced in half, to about $2.5 billion in 2015, from $5.2 billion in 2006.That criticism did not sit well with Mr. Guardian, who countered that the city had been cutting as fast as it could, having reduced the budget by $25 million in a year. He had been counting on a package of bills passed in Trenton, the state capital, that would have assured the city of about $120 million a year in payments from the casinos in lieu of property taxes. But Mr. Christie refused to sign those bills, holding out for a more expansive solution to the city\u2019s problems, a decision that Mr. Guardian characterized as reneging on a deal.People who know the mayor said they had never seen him as angry as he was, or heard him employ such harsh language in public.\u201cHe was angry because he was double-crossed,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. \u201cIn private, he expresses his frustration about being lied to his face and being told people are going to help and getting no help.\u201dMr. Guardian said that he was disappointed by the turn of events in Trenton. He said he agreed to dial down the rhetoric and work collaboratively with Mr. Christie and lawmakers to fashion a new plan for bailing out the city that could involve the state\u2019s taking control of the city\u2019s finances.This time, the city\u2019s leaders, who had been left out of earlier deliberations, will have some say in the process. But Mr. Guardian has warned that drawing up the legislation is sure to involve some painful compromises for both sides. And he has not ruled out having the city file for bankruptcy as a last resort.In bankruptcy court, the city could stave off its creditors, including its most successful casino, the Borgata. The city owes the Borgata about $160 million in tax rebates, more than $60 million of which is a year past due. In turn, the Borgata has received permission in court to withhold its property-tax payments, which Mr. Guardian has said could deplete the city\u2019s coffers within months.But Mr. Christie and other state officials have made it clear they would oppose a bankruptcy filing, which in New Jersey requires the blessing of the state\u2019s Local Finance Board. The state officials fear that one municipal bankruptcy could beget others, and could damage the ability of government agencies in the state to borrow money.That leaves Mr. Guardian and the City Council to hastily work out some arrangement with the state to forestall the city\u2019s debts while they continue slashing the costs of providing services to the public.\u201cThis is not a good time to be the mayor of Atlantic City,\u201d Mr. Coursey said. \u201cIf I ever had the desire to be mayor, I sure wouldn\u2019t be thinking about it now.\u201dBut Mr. Guardian says he has never doubted his decision three years ago to start a long-shot campaign against a black, Democratic incumbent, Lorenzo Langford. Mr. Guardian, who left the Boy Scouts to help run a now-defunct casino, the Claridge, had been overseeing the main tourist district in the city on behalf of a casino-financed authority.After spending months knocking on doors and asking for votes, he won by a narrow margin. His friends say he has not been deterred from his goal of serving two four-year terms.\u201cMy life, my experiences, my education prepared me to do this job,\u201d Mr. Guardian said. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting time for me to be able to be in a critical position to represent my city.\u201dAnd, amid the drudgery of finding ways to reduce expenses, he still finds time to exercise a prerogative of his office. On Valentine\u2019s Day, he slipped away from a dinner party to marry a couple on a pier near the boardwalk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate in Milwaukee", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate in Milwaukee, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.WOODRUFF: Good evening, and thank you. We are happy to welcome you to Milwaukee for this Democratic debate.WOODRUFF: We are especially pleased to thank our partners at Facebook, who have helped us set up a vibrant conversation among voters who are undecided. And tonight you\u2019re going to hear some of their questions for the candidates. And you can follow along at home on the PBS NewsHour page on Facebook. We also want to thank our hosts, the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, on whose campus we meet, here in the beautiful Helen Bader Concert Hall.IFILL: We want to also extend our warm thanks to Milwaukee Public Radio and Milwaukee Public Television, as well as all of our friends at the PBS member stations across the country tuning in tonight. This is the sixth time the Democrats have met face to face. Each time, we learn more about them and the presidents they say they want to be. You know you\u2019re watching \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Democrat, a Republican, or neither \u2014 because you believe the outcome of the election is important to you. And we believe that, too. With that, let\u2019s welcome the candidates to the stage. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Welcome, Senator, great to see you. And former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (APPLAUSE) Very good to be here with you.CLINTON: Thank you.IFILL: Welcome to you both.WOODRUFF: Now, a word about format. There will be two short breaks, and the rules are simple: 90 seconds for each answer and 30 seconds for the other candidate to respond.IFILL: With Iowa and New Hampshire behind us, we are now broadening the conversation to America\u2019s heartland and beyond, including here in Wisconsin. Now let\u2019s turn to the candidates for their opening statements. The order was decided by coin toss. And, Senator Sanders, you go first.SANDERS: Well, Gwen and Judy, thank you very much for hosting this event. And, PBS, thank you. Nine months ago, our campaign began. And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont. A lot has happened in nine months. And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.SANDERS: And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy. And that\u2019s an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers. They are worried to death about the future of their kids. And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent. And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system. They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million. We\u2019re spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans. They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all. No criminal records for them. I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics. They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors. Thank you.IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you, Senator Sanders. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: I\u2019m running for president to knock down all the barriers that are holding Americans back, and to rebuild the ladders of opportunity that will give every American a chance to advance, especially those who have been left out and left behind. I know a lot of Americans are angry about the economy. And for good cause. Americans haven\u2019t had a raise in 15 years. There aren\u2019t enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people. And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top. We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again. But I want to go further. I want to tackle those barriers that stand in the way of too many Americans right now. African-Americans who face discrimination in the job market, education, housing, and the criminal justice system. Hardworking immigrant families living in fear, who should be brought out of the shadows so they and their children can have a better future. Guaranteeing that women\u2019s work finally gets the pay, the equal pay that we deserve. I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential. That will be my mission as president. And I think together we will make progress.WOODRUFF: Thank you both. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you both. And we\u2019ll be right back after a short break to begin questions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WOODRUFF: And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee. Let\u2019s get right to the questions. Senator Sanders, to you first. Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they\u2019re asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government? It\u2019s already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy. How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled. In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going \u2014 getting poorer. What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people. Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year. I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free. I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind. Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating. Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.WOODRUFF: But, my question is how big would government be? Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...SANDERS: ... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth. Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.CLINTON: Judy, I think that the best analysis that I\u2019ve seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans \u2014 let\u2019s take healthcare for example. Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare. Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don\u2019t add up, and that\u2019s a promise that cannot be kept, and it\u2019s really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math. This is about people\u2019s lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.SANDERS: Well, let us level with the American people. Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they\u2019re going to lose their CHIP program. I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people. We\u2019re not going to dismantle everything. But, here is the truth. Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America. We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. One out of five Americans can\u2019t even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing. Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments. What I said, and let me repeat it, I don\u2019t know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle \u2014 the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars. In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage. You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare. And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage. (APPLAUSE) And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama\u2019s principal accomplishment \u2014 namely the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is because I know how hard it was to get that done. We are at 90 percent coverage. We have to get the remaining 10. I\u2019ve set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs. And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share. But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work. If it\u2019s Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system. The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program. So if you\u2019re having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing. And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don\u2019t add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.IFILL: Final thought, Senator.SANDERS: That is absolutely inaccurate. Look, here is the reality, folks. There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people. There is one major country \u2014 the United States \u2014 which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people. Please do not tell me that in this country, if \u2014 and here\u2019s the if \u2014 we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.CLINTON: Well, let me just \u2014 let me just say, once again... (APPLAUSE) ... that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care. I believe we are on the path to doing that. The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again. And we are not England. We are not France. We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers. So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage. We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100. I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: I\u2019d like to move along. I\u2019d like to move along. Secretary Clinton, you might \u2014 you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government. You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: \u201cThe era of big government is over.\u201d You may remember that. When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied. Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?CLINTON: No. But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family? In my case, whether it\u2019s health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward. I\u2019ve tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning. There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government. I\u2019m aware of that. It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.CLINTON: So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can\u2019t keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people\u2019s lives.IFILL: But I haven\u2019t heard either of you put a price tag on your \u2014 you say... (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: I will put a price tag. My price tag is about $100 billion a year. And again, paid for. And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt. I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing. And I think once I\u2019m in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that. But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.IFILL: Senator?SANDERS: Well, Secretary Clinton, you\u2019re not in the White House yet. And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for. For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling? Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that? Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent? Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent. We need to create jobs. So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax. Yes, I\u2019m going to do away with that. We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure. Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession \u2014 Great Depression. Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We bailed them out. Now it is their time to help the middle class. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans. And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition. We differ, however, on a couple of key points. One of them being that if you don\u2019t have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it\u2019s hard to get to where we need to go. And Senator Sanders\u2019s plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free. I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Next, we\u2019re going to...SANDERS: A brief response.WOODRUFF: Very brief, thank you.SANDERS: Here is where we are with public education. A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms. Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education. And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade. The world has changed. This is 2016. In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago. So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities. That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, your campaign \u2014 you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters. You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president. But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders. What are women missing about you?CLINTON: Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me. I believe that it\u2019s most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society. And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face. So I\u2019m going to keep making that case. I\u2019m going to keep making sure that everything I\u2019ve done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known. But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support. I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m working towards. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there\u2019s a special place in Hell for women who don\u2019t support other women. Do you agree with what she said?CLINTON: Well, look, I think that she\u2019s been saying that for as long as I\u2019ve known her, which is about 25 years. But it doesn\u2019t change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always stood for. And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we\u2019re going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that\u2019s at the core of my campaign. I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we\u2019ve had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage. So, you know, we\u2019ll take our progress wherever we can find it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders, you\u2019re in the minority, but we still want to hear from you. (LAUGHTER)SANDERS: Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian- Americans. We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class. I am very proud, if my memory is not correct \u2014 I think I am \u2014 that I have a lifetime \u2014 and I\u2019ve been in Congress a few years \u2014 a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record. I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women. I\u2019m very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men. And we will join the rest of the other \u2014 the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?SANDERS: Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I have said \u2014 I have said many times, you know, I\u2019m not asking people to support me because I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019m asking people to support me because I think I\u2019m the most qualified, experienced, and ready person to be the president and the commander- in-chief. (APPLAUSE) And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders\u2019 voting record. And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I\u2019ve been a leader on these issues. I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women\u2019s health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.CLINTON: I\u2019m very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women\u2019s issues. Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women\u2019s rights. So I\u2019m asking women, I\u2019m asking men, to support me because I\u2019m ready to go into the White House on January 20th, 2017 and get to work on both domestic and foreign policy challenges. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Final comment.SANDERS: Let me concur with the secretary, no question women\u2019s rights are under fierce attack all over this country. And I will tell you something that really galls me. I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy. Just a little bit. All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government. Government is the enemy. We\u2019re going to cut Social Security to help you. We\u2019re going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible. But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America. If that\u2019s not hypocrisy, I don\u2019t know what hypocrisy is. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Thank you both.IFILL: We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook. They were selected from a curated group of people we\u2019ve been following of undecided voters. The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin. And she writes: \u201cWisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin\u2019s incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country\u2019s rate. What can we do across the nation to address this?\u201d Senator Sanders.SANDERS: This is one of the great tragedies in our country today. And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug. It has to be dealt with. Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail. That is beyond unspeakable. So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: What we have to do is end over-policing in African- American neighborhoods. The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana. Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations. The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites. We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system. I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers. What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders. The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration. The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average. And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I. So we have work to do. There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen. President Obama\u2019s policing commission came out with some. I have fully endorsed those.CLINTON: But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect. And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that\u2019s one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn\u2019t happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level. But, I would also add this. There are other racial discrepancies. Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities. So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with. This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea. It takes away discretion from judges. We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies. (APPLAUSE) We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity. And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see. People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up \u2014 we\u2019re shocked that they end up back in jail again. So, we have a lot of work to do. But, here is a pledge I\u2019ve made throughout this campaign, and it\u2019s really not a very radical pledge. When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size. Here\u2019s my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country. We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example. Hardly anyone believes that they have. Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency? What would you do that the nation\u2019s first African American has not been able to?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m just not sure I agree completely with that assessment. I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did. We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone. So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society. I think President Obama has set a great example. I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward. Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next. We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system. We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education. I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President\u2019s office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama\u2019s work with young women. But, we can\u2019t rest. We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before. So, it\u2019s going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open. Nobody can deny them. To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out. So, we\u2019re going to enforce the law, we\u2019re going to change policing practices, we\u2019re going to change incarceration practices, but we\u2019re also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.(APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders? (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt. People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings. Turns out that the African- American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard. As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration \u2014 which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother \u2014 clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.WOODRUFF: So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they\u2019ve been?SANDERS: Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they\u2019re not hanging out on street corners. We\u2019re going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education. And I think when you give low-income kids \u2014 African-American, white, Latino kids \u2014 the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail. They\u2019re going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color. I want to talk about white people, OK?SANDERS: White people?IFILL: I know. (LAUGHTER) So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country. By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite. Our public schools are already there. If working- class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don\u2019t they have a reason to be resentful, Senator \u2014 Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Look, I am deeply concerned about what\u2019s happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths. People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived. This is a remarkable and horrifying fact. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal. You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us? Do people not care about all of our sacrifice? And I\u2019m going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country. I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has \u2014 the 10-20-30 proposal \u2014 to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty. And you know what? If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out. So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans \u2014 particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have \u2014 you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is. And that\u2019s why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator \u2014 Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to \u2014 am I wrong? Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?SANDERS: Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well. So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue. But it is a general economic issue.SANDERS: And here\u2019s what the economic issue is. The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be. Why is that? Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues. But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street. Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world. But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits. You once had a pension. Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone. They\u2019re off to China. Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone. What have you got now? You are working at McDonald\u2019s? That is why there is massive despair all over this country. People have worked their entire lives. They\u2019re making a half, two-thirds what they used to make. Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all. And that\u2019s why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down. Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that\u2019s why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Thank you. Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants. President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits. Would you go further than that? And if so, how specifically would you do it? Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?SANDERS: The answer is yes. We\u2019ve got 11 million undocumented people in this country. I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported. I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported. I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship. I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act. And in fact I would go further. What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up. And let me say this also. Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies. And I would not support those. Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn\u2019t do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I strongly support the president\u2019s executive actions. I hope the Supreme Court upholds them. I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did. I am against the raids. I\u2019m against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up. We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country. I\u2019m a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform. Have been ever since I was in the Senate. I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act. I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007. Senator Sanders voted against it at that time. Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade. Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country. And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here. If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country. That was not, as I understand it, the secretary\u2019s position. In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it. I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery. Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they\u2019d be thrown out of this country. So it wasn\u2019t just me who opposed it. It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country. It was the AFL-CIO. It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason. But we are where we are right now. And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up. What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.CLINTON: Two quick responses. One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers. I\u2019ve also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law. And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy\u2019s bill. And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done. And I was proud to stand with him and support it. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: I\u2019d like...SANDERS: Well, let me just respond. I worked with Ted Kennedy. He was the chairman of my committee. And I loved Ted Kennedy. But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don\u2019t apologize for that vote. But in terms of the children, I don\u2019t know to whom you\u2019re sending a message. Who are you sending a message to? These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake. That was the fact. I don\u2019t think we use them to send a message. I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, that just wasn\u2019t \u2014 that just wasn\u2019t the fact, Senator. The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border. So we have a disagreement on this. I think now what I\u2019ve called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: If you would allow me now to move on, we\u2019ve been talking about children. I want to talk about seniors. That takes us to our second Facebook question from Farheen Hakeem, who writes, \u201cMy father\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s a 40-year-old woman who works for a nonprofit here in Milwaukee. And she writes, \u201cMy father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid\u2019s family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met?\u201d Start with you, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation. And by those standards, we\u2019re not doing particularly well.SANDERS: We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth. And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors \u2014 and I\u2019ve talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country \u2014 who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security. And you know what? You do the arithmetic. You can\u2019t get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year. And here\u2019s an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference. I have long supported the proposition that we should lift the cap on taxable income coming into the Social Security Trust Fund, starting at $250,000. (APPLAUSE) And when we \u2014 and when we do that, we don\u2019t do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security. We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years. Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes. But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don\u2019t have decent nutrition, where they can\u2019t heat their homes in the wintertime. That is not what America should be about. If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I think \u2014 I think it\u2019s fair to say we don\u2019t have a disagreement. We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m looking at a couple of different ways, one which you mentioned, Senator, but also trying to expand the existing tax to passive income that wealthy people have so that we do get more revenue into the Social Security Trust Fund. I have a slightly different approach, though, about what we should do with that initially. First, rather than expand benefits for everyone, I do want to take care of low-income seniors who worked at low-wage jobs. I want to take care of women. When the Social Security program was started in the 1930s, not very many women worked. And women have been disadvantaged ever since. They do not get any credit for their care-taking responsibilities. And the people who are often the most hard-hit are widows, because when their spouse dies, they can lose up to one-half of their Social Security monthly payment. So we have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. But I want to start by helping those people who are most at risk, the ones who, yes, are cutting their pills in half, who don\u2019t believe they can make the rent, who are worried about what comes next for them.SANDERS: In all due respect... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: In all due respect, Secretary Clinton, a lot of the progressive groups, the online groups have really asked you a simple question. Are you coming onboard a proposal? And what is that proposal? Now, the proposal that I have outlined, you know, should be familiar to you, because it is what essentially Barack Obama campaigned on in 2008. You opposed him then. I would hope that you would come onboard and say that this is the simple and straightforward thing to do. We\u2019re asking the top 1.5 percent, including passive income, to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity. I hope you will make a decision soon on this.CLINTON: Well, Senator, look, I think we\u2019re in vigorous agreement here. We both want to get more revenue in. I have yet to see a proposal that you\u2019re describing that the \u2014 raising the cap would apply to passive income. That has not been...SANDERS: That\u2019s my bill. Check it out.CLINTON: Well, that has not been a part of most of the proposals that I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m interested in making sure we get the maximum amount of revenue from those who can well afford to provide it. So I\u2019m going to come up with the best way forward. We\u2019re going to end up in the same place. We\u2019re going to get more revenue. I\u2019m going to prioritize those recipients who need the most help first. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: We\u2019re going to move on. Secretary Clinton, your campaign has recently ramped up criticism of Senator Sanders for attending Democratic Party fundraisers from which you say he benefited. But nearly half of your financial sector donations appear to come from just two wealthy financiers, George Soros and Donald Sussman, for a total of about $10 million.WOODRUFF: You have said that there\u2019s no quid pro quo involved. Is that also true of the donations that wealthy Republicans give to Republican candidates, contributors including the Koch Brothers?CLINTON: I can\u2019t speak for the Koch Brothers, you\u2019re referring to a Super PAC that we don\u2019t coordinate with, that was set up to support President Obama, that has now decided that they want to support me. They are the ones who should respond to any questions. Let\u2019s talk about our campaigns. I\u2019m very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors, and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions. So, I\u2019m proud of Senator Sanders, and his supporters. I think it\u2019s great that Senator Sanders, President Obama and I have more donors than any three people who have every run, certainly on the Democratic side. That\u2019s the way it should be, and I\u2019m going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me, to encourage them and help me do more just as Senator Sanders is. I think that is the real key here. We both have a lot of small donors. I think that sets us apart from a lot of what\u2019s happening right now on the Republican side. The Koch Brothers have a very clear political agenda. It is an agenda, in my view, that would do great harm to our country. We\u2019re going to fight it as hard as we can, and we\u2019re going to fight whoever the Republicans nominate who will depend on the Koch Brothers, and others. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: I\u2019m asking if Democratic donors are different than Republican donors.SANDERS: What we are talking about in reality is a corrupt campaign finance system, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. We have to be honest about it. It is undermining American democracy. When extraordinarily wealthy people make very large contributions to Super PACs, and in many cases in this campaign, Super PACs have raised more money than individual candidates have, OK? We had a decision to make early on, do we do a Super PAC? And, we said no. We don\u2019t represent Wall Street, we don\u2019t represent the billionaire class, so it ends up I\u2019m the only candidate up here of the many candidates who has no Super PAC. But, what we did is we said to the working families of this country, look, we know things are tough, but if you want to help us go beyond establishment politics, and establishment economics, send us something. And, it turns out that up until \u2014 and this has blown me away, never in a million years would I have believed that I would be standing here tonight telling you that we have received three and a half million individual contributions from well over a million people. Now, Secretary Clinton\u2019s Super PAC, as I understand it, received $25 million dollars last reporting period, $15 million dollars from Wall Street. Our average contribution is $27 dollars, I\u2019m very proud of that. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Senator Sanders, are you saying...CLINTON: We are mixing apples and oranges. My 750,000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations. I\u2019m very proud. That, I think, between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country. But, the real issue, I think, that the Senator is injecting into this is that if you had a Super PAC, like President Obama has, which now says it wants to support me. It\u2019s not my PAC. If you take donations from Wall Street, you can\u2019t be independent. I would just say, I debated then Senator Obama numerous times on stages like this, and he was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations of anybody running on the Democratic side ever. Now, when it mattered, he stood up and took on Wall Street. He pushed through, and he passed the Dodd-Frank regulation, the toughest regulations since the 1930\u2019s. So, let\u2019s not in anyway imply here that either President Obama or myself, would in anyway not take on any vested interested, whether it\u2019s Wall Street, or drug companies, or insurance companies, or frankly, the gun lobby to stand up to do what\u2019s best for the American people.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: The people aren\u2019t dumb. Why in God\u2019s name does Wall Street... (APPLAUSE) But let\u2019s not \u2014 but let\u2019s not \u2014 let\u2019s not insult \u2014 let\u2019s not insult the intelligence of the American people. People aren\u2019t dumb. Why in God\u2019s name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions? I guess just for the fun of it; they want to throw money around. (LAUGHTER) Why does the pharmaceutical industry make huge campaign contributions? Any connection maybe to the fact that our people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Why does the fossil fuel industry pay \u2014 spend huge amounts of money on campaign contributions? Any connection to the fact that not one Republican candidate for president thinks and agrees with the scientific community that climate change is real and that we have got to transform our energy system? (APPLAUSE) And when we talk about Wall Street, let\u2019s talk about Wall Street. I voted for Dodd- Frank, got an important amendment in it. In my view, it doesn\u2019t go anywhere near far enough. But when we talk about Wall Street, you have Wall Street and major banks have paid $200 billion in fines since the great crash. No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, let\u2019s just \u2014 let\u2019s just follow up on this, because, you know, I\u2019ve made it very clear that no bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail, and because of Dodd-Frank, we now have in law a process that the president, the Federal Reserve, and others can use if any bank poses a systemic risk. I think that\u2019s a major accomplishment. I agree, however, it doesn\u2019t go far enough, because what it focuses on are the big banks, which Senator Sanders has talked about a lot, for good reason. I go further in the plan that I\u2019ve proposed, which has been called the toughest, most effective, comprehensive plan for reining in the other risks that the financial system could face. It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers, that contributed to our collapse. It was a big insurance company, AIG. It was Countrywide Mortgage. My plan would sweep all of them into a regulatory framework so we can try to get ahead of what the next problems might be. And I believe that not only Barney Frank, Paul Krugman, and others, have said that what I have proposed is the most effective. It goes in the right direction. We have Dodd-Frank. We can use it to break up the banks, if that\u2019s appropriate. But let\u2019s not kid ourselves. As we speak, there are new problems on the horizon. I want to get ahead of those, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve proposed a much more comprehensive approach to deal with all of these... (CROSSTALK) (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: We have to go to a break. We...SANDERS: Let me, you know, again, respectfully disagree with Secretary Clinton here. When you have three out of the four largest financial institutions in this country bigger today than they were when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, when you have six financial institutions having assets equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of America, while issuing two-thirds of the credit cards and a third of the mortgages, look, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, that great trust-buster would have said break them up. I think he would have been right. I think he would have said bring back a 21st-century Glass-Steagall legislation. I think that would have been right, as well. That\u2019s my view. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: All right. Thank you both. It is time for a break. And when we come back, we\u2019re going to turn to some new topics, including how these candidates will keep America safe.IFILL: There\u2019s a lot more to come in just a few minutes. Stay with us for more of the PBS NewsHour Democratic Debate.(BREAK)WOODRUFF: Welcome back to the Democratic presidential debate. Before we return to our questions, we have a follow-up question from our Facebook group. And it is to Senator Sanders. Senator, it comes from Bill Corfield. He is a 55-year-old musician from Troy, Ohio. And he asks: \u201cAre there any areas of government you would like to reduce?\u201dSANDERS: Hey, I\u2019m in the United States Senate, and anyone who doesn\u2019t think that there is an enormous amount of waste and inefficiency and bureaucracy throughout government would be very, very mistaken. I believe in government, but I believe in efficient government, not wasteful government.IFILL: How about you, Senator Clinton \u2014 Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Absolutely. And, you know, there are a number of programs that I think are duplicative and redundant and not producing the results that people deserve. There are a lot of training programs and education programs that I think can be streamlined and put into a much better format so that if we do continue them they can be more useful, in public schools, community colleges, and colleges and universities. I would like to take a hard look at every part of the federal government and really do the kind of analysis that would rebuild some confidence in people that we\u2019re taking a hard look about what we have, you know, and what we don\u2019t need anymore. And that\u2019s what I intend to do.SANDERS: If I could just answer that, we have also got to take a look at the waste and inefficiencies in the Department of Defense, which is the one major agency of government that has not been able to be audited. And I have the feeling you\u2019re going to find a lot of cost overruns there and a lot of waste and duplicative activities. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: We spent the first part of this debate talking about domestic insecurity. The second part, we want to talk about our foreign policy insecurities. And we want to start with a question for you, Secretary Clinton, about America\u2019s role in the world. Americans are becoming increasingly worried that attacks abroad are coming home, that they already are, in fact, here. According to exit polls from last week, from earlier this week, more than two- thirds of Democrats in New Hampshire are concerned about sending their children to fight in wars they can\u2019t win. They fret that the next attack is just around the corner and we are not ready. Are we?CLINTON: Look, I think we are readier than we used to be, but it\u2019s a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be. We have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9/11, and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks, yet we see the terrible attack in San Bernardino and know that we haven\u2019t done enough. So we have to go after this both abroad and at home. We have to go after terrorist networks, predominantly ISIS \u2014 that\u2019s not the only one, but let\u2019s focus on that for a minute. We have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from ISIS. That is principally an American-led air campaign that we are now engaged in. We have to support the fighters on the ground, principally the Arabs and the Kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from Raqqa to Ramadi. We have to continue to work with the Iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside Iraq, like Mosul, when they are able to do so. And we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters. And we have to take on ISIS online. They are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda, a celebrator of violence, an instigator of attacks using their online presence. Here at home, we\u2019ve got to do a better job coordinating between federal, state, and local law enforcement. We need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources, but from sources overseas, that can be a real-time fusion effort to get information where it\u2019s needed. But the final thing I want to say about this is the following. You know, after 9/11, one of the efforts that we did in New York was if you see something or hear something suspicious, report it. And we need to do that throughout the country. But we need to understand that American Muslims are on the front line of our defense. They are more likely to know what\u2019s happening in their families and their communities, and they need to feel not just invited, but welcomed within the American society. So when somebody like Donald Trump and others... (APPLAUSE) ... stirs up the demagoguery against American Muslims, that hurts us at home. It\u2019s not only offensive; it\u2019s dangerous. And the same goes for overseas, where we have to put together a coalition of Muslim nations. I know how to do that. I put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on Iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program. (APPLAUSE) And you don\u2019t go tell Muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the United States who insults their religion. So this has to be looked at overall, and we have to go at it from every possible angle.IFILL: Senator Sanders...SANDERS: Let me just say this. What a president of the United States has got to do \u2014 and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility \u2014 is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe, that we work with allies around the world to protect... ... president of the United States has got to do, and what is his or her major, I think, responsibility, is to, A, make certain that we keep our people safe. That we work with allies around the world to protect democratic values. That we do all that we can to create a world of peace and prosperity. I voted against the war in Iraq because I listened very carefully to what President Bush and Vice President Cheney had to say and I didn\u2019t believe them. And if you go to my Web site,berniesanders.com, what you find is not only going to help lead the opposition to that war, but much of what I feared would happen when I spoke on the floor of the House, in fact, did happen in terms of the instability that occurred. Now I think an area in kind of a vague way, or not so vague, where Secretary Clinton and I disagree is the area of regime change. Look, the truth is that a powerful nation like the United States, certainly working with our allies, we can overthrow dictators all over the world. And God only knows Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to. We got rid of Gadhafi. But the point about foreign policy is not just to know that you can overthrow a terrible dictator, it\u2019s to understand what happens the day after. And in Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gadhafi. But what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold. But this is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences. So I believe as president I will look very carefully about unintended consequences. I will do everything I can to make certain that the United States and our brave men and women in the military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just respond. Two points. One, Senator Sanders voted in 1998 on what I think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to Iraq, calling for the end of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. He voted in favor of regime change with Libya, voted in favor of the Security Council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do, which of course we followed through on. I do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat ISIS in 2016. It\u2019s very important we focus on the threats we face today, and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in. When people go to vote in primaries or caucuses, they are voting not only for the president, they are voting for the commander-in- chief. And it\u2019s important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are, and who is best prepared for dealing with them. As we all remember, Senator Obama, when he ran against me, was against the war in Iraq. And yet when he won, he turned to me, trusting my judgment, my experience, to become secretary of state. I was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, if I can, there is no question, Secretary Clinton and I are friends, and I have a lot of respect for her, that she has enormous experience in foreign affairs. Secretary of state for four years. You\u2019ve got a bit of experience, I would imagine. But judgment matters as well. Judgment matters as well. And she and I looked at the same evidence coming from the Bush administration regarding Iraq. I lead the opposition against it. She voted for it. But more importantly, in terms of this Libya resolution that you have noted before, this was a virtually unanimous consent. Everybody voted for it wanting to see Libya move toward democracy, of course we all wanted to do that.SANDERS: That is very different than talking about specific action for regime change, which I did not support.CLINTON: You did support a U.N. Security Council approach, which we did follow up on. And, look, I think it\u2019s important to look at what the most important counterterrorism judgment of the first four years of the Obama administration was, and that was the very difficult decision as to whether or not to advise the president to go after bin Laden. I looked at the evidence. I looked at the intelligence. I got the briefings. I recommended that the president go forward. It was a hard choice. Not all of his top national security advisors agreed with that. And at the end of the day, it was the president\u2019s decision. So he had to leave the Situation Room after hearing from the small group advising him and he had to make that decision. I\u2019m proud that I gave him that advice. And I\u2019m very grateful to the brave Navy SEALs who carried out that mission. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Judy, one area very briefly...WOODRUFF: Just a final word.SANDERS: Where the secretary and I have a very profound difference, in the last debate \u2014 and I believe in her book \u2014 very good book, by the way \u2014 in her book and in this last debate, she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of Henry Kissinger. Now, I find it rather amazing, because I happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country. (APPLAUSE) I am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger\u2019s actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.SANDERS: Well, it ain\u2019t Henry Kissinger. That\u2019s for sure.CLINTON: That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fine. (LAUGHTER) You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas. I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) So if we want to pick and choose \u2014 and I certainly do \u2014 people I listen to, people I don\u2019t listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it\u2019s a big, complicated world out there.SANDERS: It is.CLINTON: And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I find \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s just a very different, you know, historical perspective here. Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory. Not everybody remembers that. You do. I do. The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. That\u2019s what he talked about, the great threat of China. And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you\u2019re right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he\u2019s urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Senator, let me \u2014 let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that\u2019s Russia. On the one hand, we\u2019re aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.WOODRUFF: Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead \u2014 that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all \u2014 have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS. So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared \u2014 how hard are you prepared to be? Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions? Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe? It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.SANDERS: Well, this is what I would say. It is a complicated relationship. I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement. As you\u2019ve indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed \u2014 men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country \u2014 their own country - - it is unspeakable. It is a real horror. Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia. But let\u2019s be clear: Russia\u2019s aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO \u2014 correctly, I believe \u2014 are saying, you know what, we\u2019re going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action. I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he\u2019s trying to rally his people in support of him. But bottom line is: The president is right. We have to put more money. We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.SANDERS: Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made. The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria. The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to. You know, the Russians wanted to buy time. Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what\u2019s left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire? So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease- fire up as quickly as possible. But I would add this. You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution. At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together. This is incredibly complicated, because we\u2019ve got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia. We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view. This is one of the areas I\u2019ve disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake. Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me. Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter. So let\u2019s support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let\u2019s hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what\u2019s left of the opposition. And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups. So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like. So we\u2019ve got some real work to do, and let\u2019s try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me just \u2014 just say this. For a start, the secretary and I disagree \u2014 and I think the president does not agree with her \u2014 in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria. I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago. I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement. Let\u2019s hope that it holds.SANDERS: But furthermore, what we have got to do, I\u2019m sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow. But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba. And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well. But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve. And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations. That\u2019s how you make peace in the world. You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well, I respectfully disagree. I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program. That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement. I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran. Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos. Yes, they\u2019ve got to get out of Syria. They\u2019ve got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas. They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel. We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: We have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do. But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies. I have no illusion. Of course you are right. Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas. Everybody knows that. But our goal is, in fact, to try over a period of time to, in fact, deal with our enemies, not just ignore that reality. (CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... Senator Sanders, from a debate in 2008, quote what I said. The question was, would you meet with an adversary without conditions? I said no. And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions. That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: No, I think the idea was that president \u2014 then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents. It\u2019s easier to talk to your friends. It\u2019s harder to talk to your enemies. I think we should do both. (APPLAUSE)IFILL: Let me move on. You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya. More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015. Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day. Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean. And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing. If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this? What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they\u2019re going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union. And it\u2019s especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this. With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part. And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U. in particular.CLINTON: This is a humanitarian catastrophe. There is no other description of it. So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe. We have to stand with them. We have to provide financial support to them. We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on. And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.SANDERS: A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation. And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria. And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes. And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people. It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we\u2019ve got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all. That is not what America is supposed to be about. So I believe that working with Europe \u2014 and, by the way, you know, we\u2019ve got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world. You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia. They have a responsibility, as well. But I think this is a worldwide \u2014 that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we\u2019re seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: And we have a final question from our Facebook family. And it goes to Senator Sanders. It comes from Robert Andrews. He\u2019s a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts. He says, \u201cThe world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders \u2014 one American and one foreign \u2014 who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as \u2014 why are they influential?\u201dSANDERS: You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair. And he stood before the American people and he said, \u201cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government. You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit. So what if mass unemployment exists? So what if children are going hungry? That\u2019s not the role of the government. And when FDR said, \u201cYeah, it is,\u201d that we\u2019re going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish. And kind of \u2014 that\u2019s what I see our campaign is about right now. In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don\u2019t give up on the political process. don\u2019t listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us. If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free. We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality. In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill\u2019s politics were not my politics. He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects. But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory. Those are two leaders that I admire very much. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said. And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world. I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.CLINTON: But I want to \u2014 I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama. In the past he has called him weak. He has called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers\u2019 remorse when it comes to President Obama\u2019s leadership and legacy. And I just couldn\u2019t agree \u2014 disagree more with those kinds of comments. You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don\u2019t think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president... (APPLAUSE)The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.CLINTON: ... who got us out of that... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... put us on firm ground, and has sent us into the future. And it is a \u2014 the kind of criticism that we\u2019ve heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.SANDERS: That is... (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Madam Secretary, that is a low blow. I have worked with President Obama for the last seven years. When President Obama came into office we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, 800,000 jobs a month. We had a $1.4 trillion deficit. And the world\u2019s financial system is on the verge of collapse. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: But you know what? Last I heard we lived in a democratic society. Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job. So I have voiced criticisms. You\u2019re right. Maybe you haven\u2019t. I have. But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said? The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process. That\u2019s what I said. That is what I believe. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: President Obama and I are friends. As you know, he came to Vermont to campaign for me when he was a senator. I have worked for his re- election. His first election and his re-election. But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue. Do senators have the right to disagree with the president? Have you ever disagreed with a president? I suspect you may have. (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don\u2019t agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re- election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements. As a senator, yes, I was a senator. I understand we can disagree on the path forward. But those kinds of personal assessments and charges are ones that I find particularly troubling.IFILL: Senator, if you would like respond to \u2014 you may respond to that but it is time for closing statements and you can use your time for closing statements to do that.SANDERS: Well, one of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate. (APPLAUSE)SANDERS: All right, look, this has been a great debate. A lot of interesting issues have come together. Let me conclude by just saying this. There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone. This campaign is not just about electing a president. What this campaign is about is creating a process for a political revolution in which millions of Americans, working people who have given up on the political process, they don\u2019t think anybody hears their pains or their concerns. Young people for whom getting involved in politics is as, you know, it\u2019s like going to the moon. It ain\u2019t going to happen. Low income people who are not involved in the political process.SANDERS: What this campaign is not only about electing someone who has the most progressive agenda, it is about bringing tens of millions of people together to demand that we have a government that represents all of us and not just the 1 percent, who today have so much economic and political power. Thank you all very much. (APPLAUSE)WOODRUFF: Secretary Clinton?CLINTON: You know, we \u2014 we agree that we\u2019ve got to get unaccountable money out of politics. We agree that Wall Street should never be allowed to wreck Main Street again. But here\u2019s the point I want to make tonight. I am not a single- issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country. I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it\u2019s poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it\u2019s the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that\u2019s what I want to take on. And here in Wisconsin, I want to reiterate: We\u2019ve got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before... (APPLAUSE) ... the American middle class, and who are being attacked by ideologues, by demagogues. Yes, does Wall Street and big financial interests, along with drug companies, insurance companies, big oil, all of it, have too much influence? You\u2019re right. But if we were to stop that tomorrow, we would still have the indifference, the negligence that we saw in Flint. We would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and get fired on Monday. And we would still have governors like Scott Walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions. So I\u2019m going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of Americans fulfilling their potential, because I don\u2019t think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single American to live up to theirs.

{"Headline": "Mayor de Blasio\u2019s Carriage-Horse Plan Falters in City Council", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byMayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s peculiar and controversial crusade to limit the Manhattan horse-carriage industry abruptly collapsed on Thursday, dealing a blow to his image at the expense of a political pursuit that many of his allies had hoped he would abandon long ago.The collapse immediately overshadowed Mr. de Blasio\u2019s State of the City address, where he had planned to trumpet accomplishments and declare goals for the future. The speech, scheduled for Thursday evening to reach a wider audience, was part of an effort by City Hall to move past the unforced errors that have become an unwelcome hallmark of the mayor\u2019s tenure.Instead, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, found himself faced with defeat on another quixotic political quest of his own making.The collapse of the legislation came after the Teamsters union pulled its support on Thursday, saying its carriage-driver members believed the future of their industry would be endangered. The bill would have reduced the number of horses in the industry and devoted more than $25 million to renovating a Central Park stable as the animals\u2019 new home.Mr. de Blasio had lobbied lawmakers on the plan, occasionally in blunt terms, saying the deal was personally important to him, according to several people told of his conversations.It was a significant use of political capital on an issue that was notably distant from Mr. de Blasio\u2019s core mission of curbing inequality. But the horse carriages were a target of animal-rights activists, who spent about $1 million attacking his chief opponent in the 2013 Democratic primary for mayor, Christine C. Quinn, and who have continued to finance his endeavors.The mayor, who pledged to ban the industry on Day 1 of his administration, said he believed that it was inhumane to make horses traverse Midtown streets. He also made clear that he wanted to show he could stick to his word.But Mr. de Blasio had little support in his cause. Although the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, ultimately supported the compromise, the plan was met with wide skepticism.Parks advocates questioned the use of parkland for a private concern. Pedicab drivers said they would be ruined by a clause in the plan barring them from operating in parts of Central Park. One labor union this week said it would consider a lawsuit to stop it.In the end, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s isolation on the horse plan was underscored, in ignominious fashion, during an extraordinary scene at City Hall on Thursday morning. The mayor arrived at 11:30 a.m. in his sport-utility vehicle to find a jubilant crowd of horse-carriage drivers, celebrating the death of his plan.For about 15 minutes, Mr. de Blasio huddled inside the car, conferring with aides as reporters and television cameras gathered. When the mayor finally emerged, he pledged, defiantly, \u201cto find a way forward.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who believe that it does not make sense to have horse carriages on the streets of Midtown Manhattan, and that having them in the park was a good idea,\u201d the mayor told reporters.The Teamsters, Mr. de Blasio said, \u201cdidn\u2019t keep to their agreement \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s office said that on Thursday morning the legislation had the votes needed to pass. But many council members never quite warmed to the mayor\u2019s effort, and the backing of the Teamsters was seen as critical to secure support for a bill that would effectively eliminate some unionized jobs.\u201cThere were many members, including myself, who had always said that the only way I could ever support a compromise was if the Teamsters were a party to and supported the deal,\u201d said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Queens Democrat.Once the Teamsters pulled out, Mr. Van Bramer added, \u201cthey knew they didn\u2019t have the votes and they had to pull the bill.\u201dSome lawmakers had been prepared to support the compromise simply to move it off their plate, saying Mr. de Blasio\u2019s plan had become a painful distraction.\u201cNew York City politics is in danger of becoming just as much as a laughingstock as the presidential race,\u201d Councilman Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat, said on Thursday.Because the Council rarely votes on measures that are not assured of passage, the bill\u2019s removal from the calendar for a vote on Friday is tantamount to its defeat.For Mr. de Blasio, the defeat is also a painful reminder of another legislative fiasco: his attempt to limit the expansion of the car-service app Uber. While the Council was deliberating, the mayor flew to Italy for an environmental conference at the Vatican; the bill died while he was returning to New York.This past weekend, Mr. de Blasio spent four days in Iowa, where he knocked on doors as a volunteer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Back home, opposition to the horse plan was growing, as prominent leaders from the Transport Workers Union Local 100 and the Central Labor Council made calls opposing the legislation.Some last-minute sweeteners by the administration, including a promise that the city\u2019s tourism arm, NYC & Company, would promote the horse-carriage industry, failed to shore up union support.\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the horse and carriages,\u201d Ian McKeever, a carriage driver and spokesman for the industry, said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m from Dublin, so I\u2019m having a pint.\u201dReached on his phone on Thursday, Steven Nislick, the de Blasio donor and animal-rights activist whose group, Nyclass, pushed for a horse-carriage ban, hung up without a word. In a statement released later, he and his Nyclass partner, Wendy Neu, called the collapse of the deal \u201coutrageous and wrong.\u201dMr. Van Bramer, who as majority leader in the Council had been crucial to securing support for the deal based on the Teamsters\u2019 participation, said it was time for the city to \u201cmove on\u201d to other issues.\u201cThis has gone on for too long, and I would say that there have been several attempts to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have not been successful, and we should move on to more pressing matters and more important issues that the people of the City of New York want us to focus on.\u201dFor Mr. de Blasio, however, the quest continues.\u201cThe people of this city know what I believe,\u201d the mayor wrote in a statement, \u201cand we will work toward a new path on this issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Industry Shift, Sharp Looks Outside Japan for a Buyer", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byNAGOYA, Japan \u2014 One by one, Japan\u2019s famed consumer electronics companies have in the last five years given up on the business of manufacturing video displays, thwarted by lower-cost competition from South Korea and China.Each time, the Japanese government has been there to scoop up the unprofitable operations they could no longer afford to maintain. Toshiba, Hitachi, Sony \u2014 all of their display businesses were swept up into a state-financed investment fund.Foreign buyers that have tried to acquire Japanese companies have often failed \u2014 blocked by reluctant managers, a protectionist government or both \u2014 but this bid is looking like a deeper test for corporate Japan. It pits the sort of government-led industrial policy long favored by Japanese elites against the forces of a more open global market.Sharp\u2019s chief executive, Kozo Takahashi, said Sharp would take the month to make its decision. On the table are the offer from Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, and a competing one from the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, or INCJ, the government-backed fund that has been trying to consolidate the display industry.Foxconn is offering twice as much money \u2014 at least 600 billion yen, or about $5 billion \u2014 though the bids are difficult to compare directly. INCJ is promising to secure additional support from Japanese banks, whose emergency loans have kept Sharp from going under as its business has deteriorated.Mr. Takahashi suggested that Sharp\u2019s board favored the Foxconn offer, though he denied news reports that Sharp had granted Foxconn exclusive negotiating rights. Those reports, initially by the Japanese national broadcaster NHK, drove Sharp\u2019s share price higher before Mr. Takahashi\u2019s news conference, after the market closed.\u201cWe are putting more resources on studying the Hon Hai offer,\u201d Mr. Takahashi said. \u201cWe are considering the offers from the point of view of all of Sharp\u2019s stakeholders, its employees and shareholders.\u201dSharp has lost about $10 billion over the last half-decade as LCD prices have fallen and foreign rivals have grabbed its market share. It reported on Thursday a net loss of 24 billion yen for the latest quarter.INCJ has been courting Sharp for months, and was widely seen as the company\u2019s most likely savior. Japan Display, the company created from the operations of Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony in 2012, has struggled, and its backers hoped that adding Sharp\u2019s production volume would make it more competitive.But Foxconn\u2019s richer bid altered the script.\u201cEven Nikkei started asking whether it\u2019s O.K. to use taxpayer money to save a company that\u2019s basically a zombie,\u201d said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at Monex, a Japanese stock brokerage, referring to Japan\u2019s dominant financial newspaper. \u201cPublic opinion started to question the old collusive way of doing things, which is good.\u201dSharp has turned to Foxconn for help before. In 2012, Foxconn\u2019s billionaire founder, Terry Gou, privately bought a minority share in an underused Sharp LCD factory in western Japan. Foxconn simultaneously offered to buy a stake in Sharp itself, though that part of the deal fell apart over a price disagreement.Foxconn\u2019s current move to buy Sharp caps a long effort to expand beyond its core electronics assembly business.Over the last two decades, Mr. Gou built Foxconn by instilling militarylike efficiency on plants the size of cities where Chinese migrant laborers assemble electronics for the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Apple. Yet, as those efforts turned Foxconn into the maker of many of the world\u2019s most popular devices, it also left the company dominant in a market space where margins are low.Despite Foxconn\u2019s impressive roster of customers and mastery of the electronics supply chain, analysts have wondered whether it would be able to turn Sharp around. Fixing the company\u2019s difficulties would be a challenge for any company, but for one coming from outside Japan with less understanding about Sharp\u2019s core business, it could prove impossible, analysts argue. They point to Foxconn\u2019s failure in 2012 to close the deal as evidence of a lack of understanding of the business.Still, moves by Apple to use other Taiwanese manufacturers, like Pegatron, to put together some of its phones, and a broader weakness in electronics demand mean the deal may look like a way to find growth through efficiency as the global economy struggles.Jonathan Soble reported from Nagoya, Japan, and Paul Mozur from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Eager to Move to the City, but Stranded in the Suburbs", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported by\u201cLots of things come easily in the suburbs, but what doesn\u2019t come easily is the intellectual stimulation of being in an interesting neighborhood,\u201d said Ms. Fomerand, who has lived in Westchester County for nearly 30 years. \u201cI\u2019d like to live near the Metropolitan Museum or a place of culture.\u201dA year ago she started hunting for an apartment in Manhattan, and the search proved unnerving.For now she has decided to stay put.\u201cI don\u2019t have two incomes, but I always felt there was some upward mobility involved in my living circumstances,\u201d she said. \u201cNow everything is so crazy in price. I feel that I\u2019m stuck.\u201dLike many others in her sociological cohort these days \u2014 men and women whose children are grown and who want to trade those unused rooms in Tudor- and Victorian-style houses, as well as the steep suburban property taxes, for the city\u2019s excitement and convenience \u2014 Ms. Fomerand finds herself stranded in the suburbs.These empty-nesters have reaped the benefits of the suburbs: They sent their children to excellent public schools and raised them in safety and comfort, in backyards, playrooms and cul-de-sacs. And their houses have increased nicely in value. Now they would like to find apartments with doormen and elevators so they don\u2019t have to climb stairs, shovel snow and schlep packages. They want a place where they can \u201cage in place,\u201d as the phrase goes. But they are finding that in the past 15 years, prices for such apartments in Manhattan and Brooklyn have risen far more than the values of their suburban homes, so much that they may never make it back to living in the city they always thought they would return to. Instead, they end up staying in their houses, or downsizing to smaller suburban homes or apartments.To be sure, this is a problem largely felt by the comfortable: New Yorkers who have had the luck and income to live where they choose, who have had the luxury of planning and expecting a certain lifestyle when they grow older. These people could live less expensively in other cities, but often their family, friends and work are here, and they don\u2019t want to leave the area.\u201cThis is one of the most commonly discussed issues,\u201d said Mark A. Nadler, director of Westchester sales for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. \u201cPeople will say, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m moving to the city,\u2019 but unless they\u2019re wealthy, they end up resigning themselves to staying in the suburbs.\u201dSome calculate that with prices so high in many parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, if they relocated to the city they couldn\u2019t afford the cultural events and restaurants that they said were among the biggest reasons to move there.STEVE AND AMY NELLISSEN, who own and manage a bridge club in New Jersey, decided to sell their five-bedroom, three-bathroom contemporary in Ramsey, N.J., after their two daughters were grown. They flirted with taking an apartment in New York, where Mr. Nellissen was born and where they lived as a young married couple. But learning that modest Manhattan two-bedrooms were going for $1.5 million, they sold their house in November for $690,000 (their taxes had been almost $19,000 a year) and settled on a two-bedroom, $2,600-a-month rental in Fort Lee, N.J., with panoramic Hudson River views.\u201cI would have loved to move back to the city \u2014 to be able to walk every place, not need a car, see lots of friends in the city,\u201d said Ms. Nellissen, 55. \u201cBut at this point in my life I\u2019d rather live economically and spend my money on entertainment. To pay a Manhattan rent, I would not be able to afford all the things I moved to the city for.\u201dJames French, an agent who shows apartments in Manhattan for Douglas Elliman Real Estate, said that New York is \u201ca highly desired place for couples who are over suburban living and looking to downsize and experience a more lively energy and change of scenery.\u201d But he cautioned, \u201cA budget of $1.5 million really doesn\u2019t get you very much.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard for buyers, now more than ever, to rationalize spending that kind of money for 800 or 1,000 square feet,\u201d he added, \u201cafter sitting on property three or four times that size in the suburbs.\u201dAccording to a Queens College study of data from the United States Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey of 2009-2013, the median price of an owner-occupied house or apartment was $518,400 in Westchester; $454,500 in Nassau County; and $451,400 in Bergen County, N.J. In Brooklyn it was $557,100, and in Manhattan it was $828,100. While prices in the three suburban counties rose 34 percent, 40 percent and 39 percent since 2000, they rose 80 percent in Brooklyn and 70 percent in Manhattan.A couple living on pensions, Social Security and interest from investments might decide to rent in Manhattan or Brooklyn and use the profit from the sale of their suburban home to help finance their expenses. But they would find that on, say, the Upper East or Upper West Side, a two-bedroom apartment in a building with a doorman and an elevator would sell for more than $1.3 million (don\u2019t forget the monthly maintenance charge) or rent for $5,000 or $6,000 a month. And if they chose not to give up the car they depended on so much in the suburbs, they might pay another $500 to $900 a month for a parking space.Thirty years ago, they could have rented a spacious two-bedroom for the cost of parking that car.True, 30 years ago, they might have moved to the suburbs because of their disenchantment with living in a city where there were more than 2,000 murders a year, subways were coated with graffiti and many neighborhoods were plagued by arson and abandonment. But New York\u2019s resurgence in the late 1990s turned their thinking around and made them long to return to the city once their children were grown. And the sharp increase in suburban taxes \u2014 a $1 million house in, say, southern Westchester might demand a total of $25,000 a year in school, municipal and county taxes \u2014 added to their desire. But those ambitions have been dashed by the real estate boom.Ralph Tamlyn, 62, a retired software designer who was walking his golden retriever, Megan, on a charming snow-lined street of Tudors in southern Westchester, said that with a son about to finish college, he and his wife had been toying with moving back to Manhattan, where they lived when they were first married. They liked the \u201cthe New York lifestyle of being able to walk to so many things and not get on a train.\u201dBut when they scoured the ads for apartments and saw two-bedrooms in elevator buildings renting for $6,000, they did a brass-tacks cost analysis. They used a formula that factored in the loss of income deductions from property taxes and mortgage interest, as well as savings in expenses for heating, lawn mowing, watering and other maintenance. They concluded it would cost them more per month to live in the city. Mr. Tamlyn said the price point he arrived at was one they did not want to pay.\u201cWe can\u2019t find something that we can swap for our house,\u201d he said.RUTH KAPLAN, a 60-ish real estate broker in White Plains, grew up near Ebbets Field \u2014 then the Brooklyn Dodgers\u2019 baseball stadium \u2014 and lived in the city as a young wife for a dozen years. With three children, she and her husband moved to the suburbs, ending up in a four-bedroom house in Rye Brook, in Westchester, in a development with amenities including a swimming pool. But the children have grown and left, and she and her husband have divorced.\u201cI\u2019m basically only using a few rooms for myself and not at all benefiting from the wonderful things here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the taxes are high \u2014 $22,000.\u201dBecause she travels to Brooklyn every Friday to babysit for her granddaughter in Williamsburg, she began thinking of making her life simpler by scaling down to a place in Manhattan. She looked for ads for two-bedrooms she might buy on the Upper East Side. Stunned by Manhattan prices, she decided to settle for a one-bedroom or a studio. She even thought about renting.But she is reconciling herself to the possibility that she may just stay in the suburbs, taking an apartment near the train station in White Plains, a 40-minute commute to Grand Central.\u201cThe city is so expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cI can get more for my money in White Plains.\u201dThere are those who manage to find \u2014 and afford \u2014 an artful compromise. Three years ago, Ken and Marci Gruber downsized from a house in North Caldwell, N.J., to a two-bedroom condo in Verona, N.J. They were not ready, said Ms. Gruber, a video producer, to give up their lives in New Jersey, where among other activities they help organize the Montclair Film Festival. But not being able to quell their longing for Manhattan, they recently bought a one-bedroom co-op on Riverside Drive. It is about 650 square feet \u2014 too small, the couple said, for them to live in full time \u2014 so they use it as a pied-\u00e0-terre, splitting their time between the two apartments.\u201cAnybody who knows me knows I wanted to live in the city,\u201d Ms. Gruber said. \u201cNow we feel we have the best of both worlds.\u201dBut Myra Harris, 69, a retired teacher, is discouraged. She was raised in leafy Jamaica Estates, Queens, where Donald Trump also grew up, and as a young woman lived in Manhattan from 1968 to 1984, once paying $320 rent for a two-bedroom apartment at East 76th Street.She raised her three children in Westchester, and now she and her husband live in a four-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot townhouse in Mamaroneck. As someone who gets into the city two or three times a week to catch a play or stroll through a museum, she wants to move back and has gone online to look at apartments.\u201cWhat I would get is really depressing \u2014 very small, 900 square feet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dShe is now considering lowering her sights to an apartment in New Jersey, where her daughter lives.\u201cI always assumed I would move back into the city,\u201d she said, \u201cand now it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Xiao Gang, China\u2019s Top Securities Regulator, Ousted Over Market Tumult", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 China\u2019s top securities regulator, Xiao Gang, has been forced out, the official Xinhua News Agency announced on Saturday, after facing stinging criticism for amplifying the country\u2019s stock market turbulence.The move reflects the increasing pressure on the Chinese leadership to bolster confidence at home, as questions mount about Beijing\u2019s ability to manage the economy, the currency and the markets.Just days ago, Prime Minister Li Keqiang castigated the country\u2019s financial regulators for their handling of a steep plunge in stocks since last June and an erosion in the value of China\u2019s currency.The China Securities Regulatory Commission, led by Mr. Xiao, 57, has taken a big dose of blame for the problems.He attracted significant criticism for allowing a speculative bubble to form, in which share prices more than doubled in a year. When it burst last summer, those shares gave up all of their gains, hurting millions of families who had borrowed heavily to buy stocks.As stocks sank, the regulator also intensified the market mayhem. Two measures, intended to stabilize stocks, have been widely blamed for producing a weeklong rout in China\u2019s stock markets during the first week of January that unsettled investors around the world.Mr. Xiao defended himself in a long statement on his agency\u2019s website in mid-January, analyzing the causes of his country\u2019s recent financial sector difficulties. He said the turbulence in China\u2019s markets, including another nose dive in share prices last summer, was partly caused by the inexperience of investors and the immaturity of the local market.But he also conceded that recent troubles reflected an \u201cimperfect trading system, flawed market mechanisms and inappropriate supervision systems,\u201d together with an exodus of seasoned personnel from his agency.Mr. Xiao, who also lost his post as the regulator\u2019s Communist Party leader, will be succeeded as chairman and party leader by Liu Shiyu, 54, chairman of the Agricultural Bank of China and a former deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, according to the news agency.Mr. Liu was trained in engineering at Tsinghua University, but started a career in the state banking sector in the 1980s, according to the news agency.His task will not be an easy one.Anticorruption investigators have been scrutinizing the agency, trying to ascertain whether staff members tipped off friends about their decisions, particularly during the market\u2019s fall last summer. New rules also make it hard for the spouses and children of regulators to live overseas, even though the regulatory agency has also been widely accused of lacking workers with international experience and connections.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.But the biggest challenge for Mr. Xiao\u2019s successor may be a lack of autonomy. The senior leadership in Beijing gave little latitude to Mr. Xiao, and it is likely to vet and second-guess his successor as well.\u201cEven changing him is not going to change the system,\u201d said Hao Hong, the chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International, the overseas arm of one of China\u2019s largest banks. \u201cI don\u2019t see how someone else will want to take his job; he has a very unenviable position.\u201dMr. Xiao, who earned an undergraduate degree from Hunan University and a master\u2019s degree in law from Renmin University, spent much of his career in finance.He started at the People\u2019s Bank of China in 1981. At the central bank, he held several posts, including director general of the fund planning department and the monetary policy department, working his way up to deputy governor.Mr. Xiao took over at the securities regulator in March 2013, putting him at the helm during the rise and the fall of the Chinese stock markets.When the markets started tumbling, Mr. Xiao\u2019s agency rolled out a raft of measures to help stabilize the situation. He halted initial public offerings of stock and banned share sales by large stakeholders.The regulator\u2019s efforts worked for a while, but they started to backfire in January.Mr. Xiao\u2019s agency introduced so-called circuit breakers for its stock market on the first trading day of this year. The circuit breakers mandated that markets would close for 15 minutes if share prices fell 5 percent and would close for the day if they fell 7 percent.It was intended to provide a cooling-off period. But in practice, it added to the anxiety in the markets.As markets began sustained slides, investors rushed to sell as many shares as possible before the circuit breakers could shut down trading. The thresholds were hit in quick succession, twice during the first week of trading in January.Further policy measures only added to investors\u2019 confusion. The ban of share sales was supposed to expire, and the country\u2019s central bank was pushing down the value of the currency.As China\u2019s stock markets and the value of the renminbi tumbled faster, the country\u2019s leaders ended up scrapping all three policies in less than 24 hours. The circuit breakers were repealed, the ban on sales of shares by large stakeholders was extended, and the central bank intervened decisively in currency markets to halt any further drop in the renminbi.\u201cIt was a correct strategy to take market-stabilizing measures against unusual movements in stocks and the currency last year,\u201d Prime Minister Li said last Monday of the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, according to the government-controlled Beijing News. \u201cLooking back, the major responsible departments took inadequate actions and had internal management issues.\u201dAmie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

She\u2019s driven, idealistic, blinded, doomed.Docufiction may seem an odd fit for Mr. Murphy, known for carving the exquisite gargoyles of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cScream Queens.\u201d But Mr. Murphy, a former journalist, has a reporter\u2019s impulse to document the way we live and a moralist\u2019s zeal about society\u2019s obsession with fame and appearance. (His \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d used plastic surgery to examine self-loathing; \u201cGlee\u201d began with Rachel Berry\u2019s declaration that \u201cbeing anonymous is worse than being poor.\u201d)Like an amateur sleuth arguing that a guilty man was framed, this series believes that two seemingly opposed ideas can be true: a charge of police racism, say, can be both legitimate and cynically deployed. Its triumph is to take a case that divided the nation into teams and treat everyone, vulture or victim, with curiosity and empathy.Ms. Clark, for instance, has been lambasted for her failings \u2014 Tina Fey played her as a bumbler in \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d Ms. Paulson makes her a flawed but tragic heroine: a divorced mom, strapped for child care, battling a legal hydra made of money while the tabloids pick at her hairstyle and kibitzers tell her to smile more. Among other things, the series is a story of a feminist narrative \u2014 domestic abuse, stereotypes of women \u2014 losing to a racial one. (If the trial happened today, there would be a smoking ash heap where Twitter and Facebook used to be.)The casting is inspired, from Connie Britton as Faye Resnick (Ms. Simpson\u2019s friend turned instant tell-all author) to Larry King as himself. Robert Morse is delectable as the journalist-gadfly Dominick Dunne, who dismisses the notion that the police framed Mr. Simpson. \u201cO. J. hosted pool parties for them,\u201d he scoffs, dragging out \u201cpooool\u201d into a little catty aria.The oddest choice is how the series strains to include Mr. Kardashian\u2019s young children \u2014 notably \u201cKimmy\u201d \u2014 who now live on reality-TV Olympus. Having used his new fame to jump a line and score a table at brunch, he tells his kids: \u201cWe are Kardashians. And in this family, being a good person and a loyal friend is more important than being famous.\u201dThe line is on the nose enough to leave a mark, but it feels like more than mere name-dropping. The trial is long over, \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d tells us, but the world is still dining out on this sad story.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Education May Cut Dementia Risk, Study Finds", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported byThe risk of developing dementia is decreasing for people with at least a high school education, according to an important new study that suggests that changes in lifestyle and improvements in physical health can help prevent or delay cognitive decline.The findings have implications for health policy and research funding, and they suggest that the long-term cost of dementia care may not be as devastatingly expensive as policy makers had predicted, because more people will be able to live independently longer.Another question mark is whether obesity and diabetes, which increase dementia risk, will cause a surge in dementia cases when the large number of overweight or diabetic 40- and 50-year-olds become old enough to develop dementia.In any event, in the next few decades, the actual number of dementia patients will increase because baby boomers are aging and living longer.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to give the impression that the Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia problem is disappearing \u2014 it\u2019s not at all,\u201d said Dallas Anderson, a program director on dementia at the National Institute on Aging, one of two agencies that financed the study. \u201cThe numbers are still going up because of the aging population.\u201dStill, he added, the new research shows that \u201cwhat happens in a person\u2019s life becomes important.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s in your genes. You\u2019re going to get it,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can take steps to postpone the disease.\u201dThe decline reported in the new study was strongest in vascular dementia, which is most directly linked to cardiovascular problems. Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common form of dementia, also declined, but the trend narrowly missed what researchers consider statistically significant.Still, Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, an advocacy group, said \u201cthis tells me there absolutely is hope for Alzheimer\u2019s\u201d if a push for healthier lifestyles accompanies efforts to find dementia treatments.Dementia experts and advocacy groups have long predicted that the number of Americans with dementia, now about five million, would triple by 2050. But a burst of new research in Europe, Canada and the United States has pointed to decreases in recent decades in more educated populations with better-controlled cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart and lung health.\u201cThere\u2019s more studies suggesting that the risk is going down and we might have to rethink some of the projections of how big a problem dementia will be 30 years from now,\u201d said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. On Saturday, he will present at an international conference preliminary results from another large study, which found that the prevalence of dementia in a more nationally diverse population declined by about 21 percent from 2000 to 2010.Results like this suggest, he said, \u201cthat even without a big breakthrough in medication or a vaccine that would stop the Alzheimer\u2019s process, that we can do things that lower the risk of dementia long-term.\u201dResearchers evaluated the cognitive status of 5,025 people aged 60 and older in four time periods beginning in 1977 and found a steady decline of about 20 percent in new dementia cases each decade. They also found that on average, people were older when they were found to have dementia: 80 years old in the 1970s, compared with 85 in the group evaluated 40 years later.Significantly, the decline in new dementia cases, or incidence, occurred only with people who had at least a high school diploma. High school graduates were also the only ones whose cardiovascular health, except for obesity and diabetes, improved steadily over the same 40 years.\u201cWhether education is beneficial in itself or whether education is a marker for other things like poverty and unhealthy lifestyle, we didn\u2019t parse that out,\u201d said Dr. Sudha Seshadri, a neurologist at Boston University Medical Center and a senior investigator with the Framingham Heart Study.Dr. Seshadri said the study did not yield strong evidence that college-educated people had even lower dementia risk, but with small numbers of college graduates in the study\u2019s early groups, it was hard to tell. The study led by Dr. Langa, which compared a nationally representative survey of about 10,000 Americans aged 65 and over in 2000 with a similar group in 2010, found more college correlated with less dementia.\u201cWe find the more education the better,\u201d said Dr. Langa, whose study indicated that people in 2010 averaged almost a year more education than those in 2000 and that education explained about one-half the decline in dementia in that decade.There are many theories about why education may help stave off dementia, including that it leads to better economic opportunity, which can propel healthier habits and better access to medical care. Another theory is that learning generates more neural connections, allowing brains to compensate longer when memory and cognitive functions falter.\u201cThat\u2019s a major puzzle: What is the causal effect of education on dementia and cognitive function later in life?\u201d said Michael D. Hurd, the director of the RAND Center for the Study of Aging.Not all of the Framingham results could be explained by education or cardiovascular health, Dr. Seshadri said, a reflection of the complexity of dementia.Marie and Joe Porcello, study participants, are 86-year-old high school graduates with no significant cardiovascular problems or family history of dementia. But Mr. Porcello remains healthy, while his wife, a retired secretary, developed dementia about 10 years ago and is in an assisted-living facility.\u201cI took care of her as long as I can, and then she fell one day when she was getting out of the bathtub,\u201d Mr. Porcello said. He said his wife usually recognized him, but \u201cthe other day when I went up there, she said, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 and I said \u2018I\u2019m your husband.\u2019 Then right away she knew who I was and she puckered up like she wanted to give me a kiss.\u201dMr. Porcello, a retired phone company foreman, did attend night school for postsecondary algebra classes, but \u201cin my lifetime, you didn\u2019t really have to go to college,\u201d he said.\u201cToday, everybody has to go to college, or you end up pushing carts in supermarkets.\u201dTheir daughter Cynthia Johnson, 54, who received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and worked as a software engineer, belongs to a generation that researchers would now predict to have less dementia.But David Jones, a professor of the culture of medicine at Harvard, said history showed disease trends were rarely straightforward. Dementia, he said in an email, \u201cwon\u2019t be as bad as it would have been had incidence not begun to fall, but it will still be a very difficult problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Writers and directors delivered nonfiction books about the disaster and documentaries like the 2010 film \u201cInside Job,\u201d but by and large entertainment executives seemed to doubt that audiences would spend money to relive how they lost so much of it.\u201cMargin Call,\u201d a 2011 drama about the disintegration of an investment bank at the start of the crisis, was a critical success but not a popular one. It took in less than $20 million worldwide, and more than 70 percent of its audience was overseas, according to Box Office Mojo. (By contrast, \u201cThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part I\u201d grossed $712 million worldwide that year.)Film historians liken this lag to the ones that followed the Vietnam War and the 1929 stock market crash. Movies were made about those events in real time, but the most powerful ones came years later. \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d and \u201cComing Home\u201d were released in 1978; \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d came out in 1979. Classic films about the Great Depression, like Frank Capra\u2019s \u201cMeet John Doe\u201d and John Ford\u2019s \u201cGrapes of Wrath,\u201d didn\u2019t make it to the screen until World War II was underway.\u201cAfter a cataclysmic event, it takes a while for the collective unconscious to bubble to the surface,\u201d said Brian Koppelman, one of the creators of \u201cBillions,\u201d a new Showtime series about a hedge fund titan under investigation by a crusading United States attorney. (Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times is another of the show\u2019s creators.)\u201cBillions\u201d is set in the present, but like many other contemporary financial dramas, it is darkened by the shadow of 2008. For one thing, Mr. Koppelman noted, viewers today are more prepared to digest the details of what went wrong. \u201cWe have all learned the language. In 2008, who knew what a \u2018tranche\u2019 was?\u201d he said.\u201cThe Big Short\u201d ends with a written warning that Wall Street could be repeating its mistakes: \u201cIn 2015, several large banks began selling billions in something called a \u2018bespoke tranche opportunity,\u2019 \u201d referring to the apparent rebranding of the complex securities at the heart of the 2008 mess.The movie, which stars Brad Pitt, Christian Bale and Steve Carell, looks like a sure thing now, but Mr. McKay said it took a few years to persuade the studio to greenlight it. \u201cThey worried that the material was too esoteric and wonky, but they were more open once we found a way to make it entertaining,\u201d he said.\u201cIt also helped that \u2018Wolf of Wall Street\u2019 was a success,\u201d he added, referring to Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2013 film about a crooked 1980s stockbroker played by Leonardo DiCaprio.Hollywood executives did not exactly rush to embrace that project, either, which cost about $100 million and runs three hours in length. Red Granite Pictures, whose principal film backer is the Abu Dhabi-based businessman Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny, financed the film.But it grossed $392 million worldwide. Those returns helped embolden other studios.Washington and Wall Street are to blame in most of these works \u2014 comedies as well as dramas. But some take a particular angle that reflects the personal interests of their creators.Actresses increasingly seek roles that allow them to play strong, complex women, and several have optioned works that focus on female executives in the banking world. Sony Classics bought \u201cEquity,\u201d a film that stars Anna Gunn of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d as an investment banker brokering an initial public offering and dealing with corruption in the financial world.Last October, the Irish author Paul Murray published a satirical novel, \u201cThe Mark and the Void,\u201d about the Irish banking crisis.Michael M. Thomas, a writer and former partner at Lehman Brothers who left the firm long before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008, took a more patrician, and rococo, path in his novel \u201cFixers,\u201d which was published last month. Mr. Thomas\u2019s fictionalized account of what went wrong is an indictment of Wall Street greed and parvenus, but it also holds President Obama responsible for letting them get away with it. In the novel, a cabal of power brokers rigs the election in favor of an Obama-like candidate and steers him away from reforming Wall Street and sending bankers to jail.\u201cThe culture has become much more attuned to the financial world,\u201d said Sandy Climan, president of Entertainment Media Ventures, a movie and digital media investment company in Los Angeles. \u201cCreators are now dramatizing what people were already thinking about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Zenefits Scandal Highlights Perils of Hypergrowth at Start-Ups", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtIf you\u2019ve never heard of the human-resources start-up Zenefits, get ready to never forget it.The situation looks bad, and is likely to get worse. It\u2019s bad in ways specific to this start-up, but also in larger ways \u2014 ways that highlight how last year\u2019s enormous funding rounds and their attendant overinflated expectations may wreak havoc on Silicon Valley for years to come.In particular, Zenefits may be among the first of several cautionary tales to highlight a sobering lesson: For a start-up, growing too quickly can produce just as spectacular a failure as growing too slowly.First, the back story: Zenefits is a three-year-old company that makes software for small businesses. In its short life span, it has been called both the most unsexy company in tech, and one of the most promising.Its investors have argued that Zenefits, which makes money by acting as a health-insurance brokerage firm for its customers, has the potential to cut the red tape that small businesses have to battle to provide benefits for their employees.Then, last week, poof. Zenefits announced that Parker Conrad, its co-founder and chief executive, had resigned. In emails to employees, David O. Sacks, the former chief operating officer and new chief executive, explained that Mr. Conrad had overseen a company that had become derelict in its culture and ethics.Zenefits has sought to paint the executive changes as a new beginning. One person close to the company said when Mr. Sacks briefed employees on Mr. Conrad\u2019s exit last week, there were celebrations and tears of relief at the San Francisco headquarters of Zenefits.Yet the story is more complicated than the single instance of a founder\u2019s misdeeds. Zenefits\u2019 recklessness seems to have been merely the worst symptom of a larger sickness that infected the company, according to investors, former employees and others who worked with the management team (and who all requested anonymity because no one in Silicon Valley wants to be seen as kicking a start-up when it\u2019s down).That sickness: Zenefits was a company consumed by impossible expectations. In return for fund-raising at a stratospheric value, Mr. Conrad promised the moon to investors.Then, to reach the moon, he began to transform a tiny start-up into a mighty rocket ship \u2014 only to watch it careen out of control as it stretched to accomplish the impossible. Though many noticed trouble, neither Mr. Conrad, nor the board of directors, nor anyone else in management could afford to stop, take a breath and fix the problems. Growth was the only imperative.Many investors and former employees blame Mr. Conrad, who had pushed for the huge fund-raising, and whom they described as demanding, undisciplined and either uninterested in or incapable of building a sustainable company.Mr. Conrad did not respond to requests for comment, but some who were privy to his thinking said he should not shoulder all the blame for Zenefits\u2019 flagging fortunes.These people pointed to the dynamic on Zenefits\u2019 board, which consisted of three company executives \u2014 Mr. Conrad, Mr. Sacks and Laks Srini, a co-founder and chief technologist \u2014 and Lars Dalgaard, the Andreessen partner who led the firm\u2019s investment in the start-up.Some investors said Mr. Dalgaard was as instrumental as Mr. Conrad in pushing for steep revenue targets, and that both men\u2019s ambition pointed in the same direction \u2014 toward hypergrowth.Another person familiar with the board disputed this, saying Mr. Dalgaard, who formerly ran the cloud software company SuccessFactors, was among those asking Mr. Conrad to restrain Zenefits\u2019 growth plans and fix the culture. A representative for Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment.In either case, it\u2019s clear the board was unable to effect much change, until recently. Mr. Conrad resisted attempts to expand the board, according to one person familiar with the matter. It was only last week, upon Mr. Conrad\u2019s exit, that Zenefits added three additional directors to its board.Growth broke stuff. To increase revenue, the company moved beyond small businesses to customers with hundreds of employees \u2014 and the software struggled to keep up. Instead of pausing to fix bugs, Zenefits simply hired more employees to fill in where the software failed, including repurposing product managers for manual data entry.There was a laxity about rules and decorum. Zenefits offered beer kegs in its offices, and in the Scottsdale, Ariz., office, people freely imbibed during the workday. According to one staff member, managers had to remind employees to turn their Zenefits T-shirts inside-out before partying at local bars, so their rowdiness didn\u2019t reflect badly on the company.Despite the hordes of new workers, many felt like there was too much to do. Pay was a problem. People were given low salaries with the promise of increases when funding came through, but Zenefits didn\u2019t make good on those promises when it raised new investments.Mr. Conrad and the board were undaunted. They recently projected Zenefits would hit $150 million in recurring revenue by the end of 2016, and that it would keep doubling sales annually for years to come.Yet internal disagreements grew. Late last year, Mr. Dalgaard pushed Mr. Conrad to freeze hiring, according to one person familiar with the company. Mr. Conrad disagreed.The two men also differed over whether to address employee morale by re-pricing stock options to the new lower valuation, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Conrad favored the move, but Mr. Dalgaard believed it would train employees to expect a re-pricing any time the company\u2019s fortunes changed.Now Zenefits appears to be on a path in which growth is no longer the only goal.In a statement, the company said, \u201cZenefits now is focused on developing business practices that will ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements, and making certain that Zenefits operates with integrity as its No. 1 value.\u201d And in an email to employees last week, Mr. Sacks wrote, \u201cI\u2019m glad that Zenefits is one of the fastest-growing business software companies, but that\u2019s not our mission. It alone doesn\u2019t fill my life with any meaning, and I doubt it does yours.\u201dIn a conversation that at times resembled a therapy session, he explained that he felt his life was marked by a succession of failures. He had been forced to take a leave of absence from Harvard because he\u2019d neglected his classes while working at The Crimson, the daily newspaper, where he was managing editor. He had been asked to leave his first company, SigFig, after falling out with his co-founder.\u201cAll these things have made me absolutely petrified of failure,\u201d Mr. Conrad said. In Zenefits, he\u2019d found a chance at redemption \u2014 and the faster it grew, the faster he\u2019d find it. \u201cSlowing down doesn\u2019t feel like something I want to do,\u201d he told me.At the time, I heard this as nothing more than run-of-the-mill entrepreneurial ambition. Looking back, it was obviously something darker: a warning sign.An earlier version of this article misstated the subject of California\u2019s investigation of Zenefits. The inquiry concerns software that let the company\u2019s employees cheat on the state\u2019s online broker license course, not its online broker license exam.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes\u00ad.com; Twitter:@fmanjooAdvertisement"}

Wilson and Daniel Zilberman, \u2014 also arranged lines of credit with JPMorgan in the last year backed by collateral that includes stakes Warburg funds, according to the filings.The $12 billion Warburg Pincus Private Equity XII fund would be the first main fund the firm has closed since Mr. Geithner joined it. Before being Treasury secretary, he was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for six years.The former regulator, who oversaw JPMorgan during his time in government, is now playing his part in a common Wall Street practice. Many executives invest in funds managed by their firms, and for some, it is an executive perk.Outside investors have demanded increasingly large commitments from the partners who manage investment funds in the years since the financial crisis.\u201cThey want these people to have a lot of alignment\u201d with the interests of outside investors, said Alan Johnson, a consultant on Wall Street executive pay.Warburg closed the Warburg Pincus Private Equity XII fund in November. It is investing another $800 million of the firm\u2019s money. It said last fall that investors in the fund included pensions, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations and wealthy families, with big interest coming from investors overseas.In late 2014, the firm closed its $4 billion energy fund, which is the companion to an $11 billion general fund it closed in late 2013, just before Mr. Geithner joined the firm.Warburg specializes in investing in five sectors: energy, health care, financial services, industrial and business services and technology, media and telecommunications.Last fall, the holding company for the family of the French billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharri\u00e8re acquired a 5 percent passive stake in Warburg, with a pledge to invest as a limited partner in future funds raised by the firm.The filings do not disclose the size of the credit lines, but in some cases disclose which funds are to be used as collateral.Mr. Kagan, for example, who leads Warburg\u2019s energy group, amended his financing agreement in October to add the Warburg Pincus Energy Partners fund. An earlier filing cited a stake in the Warburg Pincus XI Partners fund.Other Warburg Pincus executives who have credit lines outstanding include David B. Krieger and James Neary, who have financing through UBS, according to filings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Thomas King, Head of Barclays Investment Bank, to Retire", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 Thomas King, the American in charge of the investment banking business at Barclays, is set to retire from the lender next month, the London-based bank said on Friday.The departure of Mr. King, the chief executive of the Barclays investment bank, is the most prominent exit in a shake-up of management at the bank under its new chief executive, James E. Staley.Barclays has been shrinking its investment bank \u2014 which has large operations in New York \u2014 and grew quickly under Robert E. Diamond Jr., who preceded Mr. Jenkins as chief executive.\u201cWhile sad to see him leave Barclays, I understand and respect Tom\u2019s decision to retire,\u201d Mr. Staley said in a statement. \u201cTom\u2019s work in particular in leading the change in our investment bank strategy before and since May of 2014 has been very important to ensuring Barclays\u2019 future success. Tom\u2019s trademark has always been his focus on the needs of clients and colleagues, and we are grateful to him for his stewardship.\u201dMr. King, who joined the bank as head of banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa and as co-head of global corporate finance in 2009, is expected to leave the bank on March 4, just days after the bank is expected to report its full-year results and update investors on its strategy.Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, spent more than 30 years at JPMorgan, serving as the top executive in its investment banking and asset management units. Mr. Staley left JPMorgan in 2013 for the hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management and joined Barclays in December.Barclays has previously announced it will bring two JPMorgan veterans in to join its management team this year.\u201cAfter nearly 25 years in my career, and having now seen the investment bank through a period of extraordinary change and on to a solid footing for the future, I feel the moment is right for me to pass the baton,\u201d Mr. King said in a news release. \u201cI am so proud of what we have achieved together at Barclays through what has been a hugely challenging period, and I shall leave the firm with fond memories of great clients and great colleagues.\u201dIn the years since the financial crisis, costly new regulations and a series of embarrassing investigations have weighed on Barclays\u2019 results. A scandal over potential rigging of a global benchmark interest rate known as Libor cost Mr. Diamond his job in 2012 after just 18 months as chief executive.Mr. Jenkins, a retail banker by trade, was brought in to change the bank\u2019s culture and return the lender to profitability.He was praised for his efforts to reshape the bank\u2019s culture, but was ousted after directors, including the new chairman, John McFarlane, lost confidence in his ability to improve returns to shareholders.Mr. King, a former Citigroup banker, also clashed with Mr. Jenkins over the strategic direction of the investment banking business ahead of Mr. Jenkins\u2019 departure last year.Despite his departure, the bank has continued many of the cost-cutting initiatives announced by Mr. Jenkins.About two-thirds of the job cuts are expected in Asia. Barclays, which had about 132,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2014, plans to focus on its home markets in Britain and the United States.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When the Public Defender Says, \u2018I Can\u2019t Help\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorNew Orleans \u2014 ON an ordinary day, the Criminal District Court here begins with a parade of handcuffed and shackled defendants being led out from cages behind the judge\u2019s bench by sheriff\u2019s deputies. They are clad in orange jumpsuits and are almost exclusively African-American men. They rattle and shuffle their way onto benches and into the empty jury box, waiting for the judge.When their case is called, a lawyer from the public defender\u2019s office will rise and say: \u201cYour Honor, we do not have a lawyer for this person at this time.\u201dEight-five percent of these defendants are unable to afford their own lawyer and will need a public defender to represent them. But in New Orleans, where I am in charge of the public defender\u2019s office, we simply don\u2019t have enough lawyers to handle the caseload. Last month, we began refusing new cases.In a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest poverty rates, the system to defend the poor is broken.To understand why, look at the other people in the courtroom sitting on benches set aside for the audience. Most of these people aren\u2019t there to watch the proceedings. Many were subpoenaed for failing to pay fines or fees for minor offenses and had to take time from work to appear in court or be charged with contempt. Those fines and fees pay for two-thirds of the Louisiana public defender system. The rest comes from the state.It is not an exaggeration to say that fines from traffic offenses, which, in Louisiana, can result in jail time, play a big part in determining whether one of those men in the orange jumpsuits receives an adequate defense required by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution.Poor people must pay $40 to apply for representation, and an additional $45 if they plead guilty or are found guilty. No other states lean so heavily on fines and fees paid mostly by the poor. And there is a reason for that. The system isn\u2019t working.Louisiana spends nearly $3.5 billion a year to investigate, arrest, prosecute, adjudicate and incarcerate its citizens. Less than 2 percent of that is spent on legal representation for the poor.Last fall, at a hearing ordered by the Criminal District Court in response to this crisis, years of underfunding by the state were chronicled. Public defenders have weathered more than $5 million in budget cuts over the last five years. For the second time in four years, we have been forced to impose a hiring freeze and, now, have begun turning down cases.In response, judges are ordering private lawyers to take poor clients. Other poor defendants have been left to represent themselves. And in some cases, judges have threatened public defenders with contempt for refusing to take a case.James Dixon, the state public defender, and members of my staff and I filed affidavits and testified about how our workloads had reached unmanageable levels. Many public defenders are unable to visit clients, file motions in a timely manner or conduct the necessary investigations. In fact, our workload is now twice the standard recommended by the American Bar Association.Ellen Yaroshefsky, a professor at Cardozo Law School in New York City and one of three experts who testified, said it was a misnomer to call the New Orleans court system a \u201cjustice system.\u201d Professor Yaroshefsky told the judge: \u201cYou\u2019re not operating a justice system here. You\u2019re operating a processing system.\u201dWhile the situation here may sound extreme, overloaded public defenders are struggling across the country. A 2013 study in Missouri provided a snapshot of the problem. For serious felonies, defenders spent an average of only nine hours preparing their cases; 47 hours were needed. For misdemeanors, they spent two hours when 12 hours were necessary. Similar studies are underway in Colorado, Rhode Island, Tennessee and here in Louisiana.\u201cThe problem of grossly underfunded public defender organizations with grossly excessive caseloads is a systemic, endemic problem going back 50 years,\u201d said Stephen F. Hanlon, general counsel for the National Association for Public Defense, who is overseeing the current studies.A 32-year-old man was arrested in the case and held on $1.7 million bond. He had immediately asserted his innocence but the police said a witness had identified him. His family hired a private lawyer who went to Houston to locate video of the suspect shopping with his girlfriend at the time of the shooting. The charges were dropped.Reading about this case, I realized my office could not have guaranteed the timely retrieval of this important evidence before it would have been routinely erased. That would have left an innocent man to face trial for his life for what was labeled an act of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d by the mayor of New Orleans.Louisiana needs fundamentally to reform its system of public defense funding. The state needs to arrange adequate and stable financing based on reasoned projections of the workload. Fines and fees, to the extent they exist at all, should act as a supplemental source of financing.The role of the public defender is to protect the innocent, defend the Constitution and demand justice and fairness. But when resources are out of balance, as they are in Louisiana, so is the system. The poor are the ones who are hurt.Derwyn Bunton is the chief district defender for Orleans Parish.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Silicon Valley, a Time-Honored Sport Looks to the Future", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOn Pro FootballSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On any given Sunday during football season, the N.F.L., a league that promotes itself as a standard-bearer of innovation, produces games that are analog at their core. The leather ball has been stitched the same way for decades, and the chain gangs hold the first-down markers like crossing guards at a busy street corner. The players smash into one another in a way a fan from a century ago would recognize.Yet the league, a $12-billion-a-year business, seems to be perpetually searching for the best and latest technology to help it deliver that analog product to its nearly 200 million fans, who are increasingly tech-savvy.The juxtaposition can be jarring.Enormous linemen push off one another in a shoving match that recalls something that could have taken place among heavyweights millenniums ago. And then those linemen head to the sideline and grab a tablet computer to scroll through high-definition photographs of their play.In a region filled with private equity titans, dreamy entrepreneurs and futurists, the N.F.L. has been eager to show off its technological chops this week.The Super Bowl host committee has also raised millions of dollars in donations from a range of technology giants, including Apple and Google, two companies not normally associated with the N.F.L. or other sports leagues.Google is paying for its shuttle buses to ferry Bay Area fans to and from the game. Apple is also running company buses to the game, and it has donated iPhones and laptops to the Super Bowl host committee. Still, neither company has pulled out the stops to throw its brand around here in the same way as many other companies.Brian Rolapp, the league\u2019s executive vice president for media, is paid to rub shoulders with the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter and any other company that will deliver the N.F.L. to fans in a way that complements, but does not dilute, its principal product: the games.While the league may be eager to deliver football to its fans on whatever device they want to use, he said, it is reluctant to let that technology bleed too far into the game.\u201cA lot of that comes from the No. 1 objective, is to keep the competition pure,\u201d Rolapp said moments after attending a panel discussion that included a description of HoloLens, a headset being developed by Microsoft that will show games in \u201caugmented reality.\u201d\u201cAll the stuff we talk about from a business perspective, if the game isn\u2019t fair, it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe focus should be on the human competition. We\u2019re very protective of that.\u201dHoloLens is in its infancy, but Microsoft was eager to demonstrate to reporters how the device works. In a faux living room with a coffee table, a sofa and football-themed pillows, company technicians showed highlights from a Seahawks-49ers game on a flat-panel television.With the HoloLens headset on, you could see additional statistics to the left and right of the screen. The entire field was in view, not just the portion of the field shown on television. And on the coffee table, a hologram of a play appeared that could be started, stopped and rotated to better analyze the players on the field.Microsoft was careful to distinguish between virtual reality, in which viewers are immersed in a digital world, and HoloLens, which they called a mixed reality, with holograms, other images and data dropped into the field of vision. This, they said, is more complementary to the game.To an older generation of fans who grew up with a few games a week on network television and perhaps a highlight show or two in between, HoloLens may seem to be a high-tech distraction from the game.But the N.F.L. is more focused on younger fans. And if those fans are watching football in new ways and on new devices, then the N.F.L. would be foolhardy not to find ways to reach them.Phil de Picciotto, the president of Octagon Worldwide, a sports marketing agency, said: \u201cFootball, as the leading sports platform, is a reflection of society, and society is more technologically dependent, so it\u2019s logical that the N.F.L. will embrace technology.\u201dInnovative technology, de Picciotto added, has been a part of the N.F.L. for decades, such as the radio headsets in the helmets of quarterbacks and the Telestrator, the device that television analysts use to diagram plays on top of video. Most of these additions did not change the game but aimed to enhance it.What technology is unlikely to do, though, is fundamentally alter the game \u2014 the collisions, the Hail Mary passes, the fist pumps and the high-fives. At least for now.Katie Benner and Conor Dougherty contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Death of Antonin Scalia, an Already Volatile Campaign Erupts", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byPresidential CampaignAn already unpredictable election pitting grass-roots activists on the left and right, unenthusiastic or flabbergasted by their presidential choices, against party leaders is suddenly erupting into a rare battle royal for control of every branch of government: the White House, Congress and the Supreme Court. Mr. McConnell\u2019s threat to block a confirmation could complicate the re-election chances of Republican senators in swing states. What is beyond doubt is that the battle will push the parties farther apart, ensuring that an already rancorous election year becomes even more contentious as Republicans and Democrats alike try to rally their voters by portraying the opposition\u2019s approach to the nomination as illegitimate.The future of the court dominated the presidential contest on Sunday, with notable differences among the Republicans in how they sought to exploit the vacancy, as each candidate sought to gain the most benefit heading into Saturday\u2019s primary in heavily conservative South Carolina.Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign said the vacancy underscored his contention that he is the only candidate prepared for the serious issues the next president will face, and questioned whether Mr. Trump could be relied on to appoint a conservative jurist. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, portraying himself as a voice of reason who could bridge the partisan divide, said he hoped Mr. Obama would refrain from nominating someone but stopped short of urging the Senate to refuse to consider an Obama nominee. And Mr. Rubio, vying for conservative support in South Carolina, said Mr. Obama could \u201cnominate whoever he wants\u201d but added: \u201cWe\u2019re not moving forward on it. Period.\u201dNone, however, sought to elevate the importance of Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement more than Mr. Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas who has portrayed himself as a defender of the Constitution.\u201cWe ought to make the 2016 election a referendum on the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Cruz, whose campaign planned to weave the issue into advertising, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201dMr. Cruz sought to use the vacancy as a political weapon, linking Mr. Trump, his most formidable Republican rival in South Carolina, to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cWe are one justice away from the Second Amendment being written out of the Constitution altogether,\u201d he said. He added that if Mr. Trump were the Republican nominee or Mrs. Clinton were elected president, there would be \u201cunlimited abortion on demand.\u201dMr. Trump said he would nominate justices in the mode of Justice Scalia and pointed to two federal appeals court judges, Diane S. Sykes of Wisconsin and William H. Pryor Jr. of Alabama.He said he did not intend to focus on the vacancy in his speeches, but he did seize the opportunity to question Mr. Cruz\u2019s judgment. Mr. Cruz, he noted, backed the appointments of David H. Souter, the retired justice who was chosen by the first President George Bush and usually sided with the court\u2019s liberals, and of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whom President George W. Bush nominated and whose vote upheld the Affordable Care Act.Jeb Bush, on CNN, washed his hands of his father\u2019s choice of Justice Souter, saying it turned out to be an \u201cunfortunate\u201d pick. On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders said Republicans calling for delay were flouting what they professed to revere. \u201cThe Republicans are going to look very, very stupid before the American people when they disrespect the Constitution,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview Sunday. \u201cThese are the people who claim they love the Constitution of the United States.\u201dFor Mrs. Clinton and her allies, the promise of a battle over Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee may reinforce a central argument of her candidacy: that she is the Democrat most capable of winning in November and best suited to work with a Republican-led Congress.\u201cIf Senate Republicans abdicate their responsibility to confirm a nominee before November, it makes the issue of electability much more important for Democrats,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, a Clinton supporter. \u201cIt elevates the importance of nominating a Democrat who has the strongest record on issues that matter to general election voters, like gun safety, women\u2019s rights and civil rights.\u201dBut Mr. Sanders said the idea that voters would see Mrs. Clinton as better suited to win in November and do battle with a petulant Republican Congress was \u201cquite a stretch,\u201d adding, \u201cThere are people supporting Secretary Clinton who will spin anything for any reason.\u201d\u201cShe cannot be trusted to appoint someone to the Supreme Court who will take the issue of campaign finance seriously,\u201d he said.But Mr. McConnell\u2019s vow not to confirm a new justice until a new president is in office \u2014 seconded by Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee \u2014 provided Mrs. Clinton with another opportunity to embrace Mr. Obama, who remains widely popular among Democratic voters, particularly in South Carolina, which holds its Democratic primary on Feb. 27.\u201cBarack Obama is the president of the United States until Jan. 20, 2017,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in Denver late Saturday. \u201cThat is a fact, my friends, whether Republicans like it or not.\u201dReporting was contributed by Yamiche Alcindor, Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Martin, Thomas Kaplan, Ashley Parker and Matt Flegenheimer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeb Bush, an Also-Ran in Iowa, May Be Pivotal in New Hampshire", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported bySpecifically, many Republicans \u2014 including some of his supporters and donors \u2014 said that Mr. Bush must finish ahead of Mr. Rubio in the primary here next Tuesday to justify continuing his campaign into South Carolina.\u201cIf Rubio beats him badly in New Hampshire, Jeb is toast,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a Bush backer who spent most of Tuesday traveling the state with him. Mr. Graham added that Mr. Bush must either \u201ctie Rubio or beat him\u201d in this state.The burden falls so heavily on Mr. Bush, who won just 2.8 percent of the vote in Iowa, because of Republican anxieties about the top two finishers there, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump: Many party leaders fear that the nomination of Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz would lead to an electoral rout this fall.Were Mr. Bush to keep campaigning into South Carolina, he could create a split among pragmatic-minded voters, denying Mr. Rubio the chance to consolidate this bloc of Republicans \u2014 and strengthening the hands of Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Many Republicans believe that if Mr. Rubio, who won an unexpected 23 percent in Iowa, right behind Mr. Trump\u2019s 24 percent, again delivers a strong performance in New Hampshire, he will have earned the right to carry the banner for the party establishment.Asked Tuesday evening by reporters how well he felt he needed to do in New Hampshire to justify staying in the race, Mr. Bush struck a defiant note.\u201cOh, I\u2019m continuing on,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m continuing on, yeah.\u201dTwo rivals, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, are appealing to the same voters and also need a strong showing in New Hampshire. But Mr. Bush is far better financed and organized and can most likely stay in the race longer than they can otherwise.Mr. Bush, by contrast, has an active network of supporters there and has tapped into Mr. Graham\u2019s organization. And perhaps most important, the super PAC supporting Mr. Bush has shown a willingness, to put it mildly, to spend millions of dollars against his rivals, particularly Mr. Rubio, whom it has spent more than $20 million attacking.The prospect of the super PAC maintaining its assault on Mr. Rubio after the New Hampshire primary leaves many Republicans uneasy about Mr. Bush\u2019s intentions. And Mr. Rubio\u2019s supporters, cognizant of these concerns, began moving on Tuesday to stoke these fears.\u201cIf Jeb doesn\u2019t do well there, and he\u2019s still got millions and millions to spend, does he stay around?\u201d mused Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, a Rubio backer. \u201cWho knows.\u201dBut, Mr. Gardner noted, \u201cmore money has been spent attacking Republicans by fellow Republicans in this election than any cycle in the history of the party.\u201dIt is not just supporters of Mr. Rubio who are dismayed. Some of Mr. Bush\u2019s major donors, including those with long ties to the family, are also growing impatient, hoping he will not go past New Hampshire absent a strong finish here.Few are willing to say so publicly, and on a Tuesday conference call the campaign held for fund-raisers, they did not even get a chance to say so privately: The Bush aides running the call did not open it up to questions.After the Iowa caucuses, the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates.It is unclear what threshold Mr. Bush might feel he must reach to continue after the New Hampshire vote. But on the conference call and in talking points the campaign emailed late Monday night to supporters, Mr. Bush\u2019s team pointed to surveys showing him in a statistical tie for second in New Hampshire.The campaign also built up Mr. Bush\u2019s effort to win the state, and trumpeted New Hampshire\u2019s recent role in determining the Republican standard-bearer. (Left unmentioned was the 2000 primary here, in which Mr. Bush\u2019s older brother, George W., lost in a landslide and still went on to claim the nomination.)\u201cThe Granite State has long been the state voters look to in choosing the nominee and next president,\u201d the staff wrote in the email to supporters, highlighting Mr. Bush\u2019s endorsements and organizational strength.In reality, Mr. Bush\u2019s top advisers know Mr. Rubio\u2019s finish in Iowa makes it harder for Mr. Bush to claim that he is the logical alternative to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz. Yet he seems torn between focusing his fire on Mr. Rubio or Mr. Trump.On Tuesday, his campaign began airing an unusually long two-minute ad in New Hampshire attacking Mr. Trump for insulting veterans, women and the disabled. And at a stop in Henniker, N.H., Mr. Bush aimed some of his most pointed language yet at Mr. Trump, who finished second in Iowa, calling him a \u201closer\u201d with \u201cdeep insecurities.\u201dYet on the same day Mr. Bush went so aggressively after Mr. Trump, he also sought to raise doubts about Mr. Rubio, incorporating Mr. Cruz for purposes of comparison.\u201cIf you look at their records, they\u2019re gifted in how they speak, but what about their life experience?\u201d Mr. Bush said at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, likening the two to President Obama, who was elected president after less than four years in the Senate. \u201cIs there something in their past that would suggest they have the capability of making a tough decision?\u201dYet there are signs Mr. Bush may still have some work to do.Speaking at the Hanover Inn near the Vermont border on Tuesday, Mr. Bush finished a fiery riff about protecting the country \u2014 \u201cI won\u2019t be out here blow-harding, talking a big game without backing it up,\u201d he said \u2014 and was met with total silence.\u201cPlease clap,\u201d he said, sounding defeated.The crowd laughed \u2014 and then, finally, clapped.Advertisement"}

Inside the budget is a detailed agenda to ease the anxieties of workers weighed down by job insecurity and income volatility.Those anxieties are among the factors that propelled two populist candidates to victory in the New Hampshire presidential primaries on Tuesday.Mr. Obama\u2019s approach has clear advantages at a moment when Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and when the business community has made clear its opposition to a greater government role in the economy.\u201cThese are policies that broadly accept the extent to which risks have shifted onto working people and they try to mitigate the impact of those risks,\u201d Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said about the president\u2019s proposals. \u201cThey have not viewed it as their job to try to change the underlying shifts in risks.\u201dWith the left invigorated by the campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, such assurances may fall flat with wide swaths of Democrats.\u201cThe president has some good messaging proposals that would have a positive impact,\u201d said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots organizing group. \u201cBut a new Democratic president winning on something like a trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal would reset the debate.\u201dPerhaps no set of budgetary ideas better illustrates the president\u2019s limited approach than those relating to worker pensions, which would cost about $18 billion over the next decade. The president is proposing a variety of changes, including making it easier for small-business employees to buy into pooled 401(k) plans, which typically have lower costs than plans offered only to employees of a single small business.Mr. Obama also wants to encourage more employers to automatically enroll workers in 401(k) programs and allow them to opt out, which yields greater participation and retirement savings than simply offering plans to those who sign up.But the proposals are a far cry from resurrecting the so-called defined benefit model that reigned during the decades after World War II, said Teresa Ghilarducci, who studies pension systems at the New School for Social Research. She has proposed a system of portable individual accounts in which contributions are pooled, workers are guaranteed a minimum 2 percent rate of return, and the benefits are doled out annually after retirement so that workers do not prematurely run down their savings.Likewise, the wage insurance proposal would provide many former manufacturing workers who settle for lower-paying service jobs with a wage supplement equivalent to half the difference between their current and previous annual pay. That supplement would total up to $10,000 per worker over two years.Still, for manufacturing workers, those efforts will seem vastly inferior to rebuilding the domestic manufacturing base, something the budget only feints at through small investments in manufacturing research and development and subsidies to help small manufacturers scale up operations. (The budget does propose a major investment in clean-transportation research.)\u201cTo me it\u2019s kind of a salve, an ointment for the consequences of trade policy and globalization,\u201d said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group jointly financed by industry and labor.But, he said, bringing back high-paying manufacturing would require large investments and tax benefits to encourage businesses to bring overseas jobs back, something the budget finances only modestly, and the kind of aggressive trade enforcement for which the administration has shown little appetite. (It says it would create disincentives for offshoring by changing how it taxes foreign profits.)The moderation of many of the president\u2019s budget proposals for workers and the economy reflect the White House belief that, even at this late date in the administration, it may be able to strike a handful of deals with Republican leaders in Congress.Wage support, in principle, could win Republican support, said Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the former domestic policy director for Mitt Romney.\u201cThe idea of targeting financial support to people who, especially later in their careers, are choosing between going back to a lower-wage job, or potentially ending up on disability or something else \u2014 it\u2019s a win-win to have them in the work force,\u201d he said.That does not entirely explain the moderation. In the same budget, the president embraced a $10-per-barrel tax on oil. That effort makes sense only as a way of shifting the debate on climate policy and infrastructure, given its dead-on-arrival prospects.But Mr. Obama may have accommodated his policies to the tectonic shifts in the economy in recent decades because he genuinely believes it can be futile to resist.As Seth D. Harris, a former deputy secretary of labor under Mr. Obama, put it: \u201cThese proposals make sense considering the trajectory of the president\u2019s agenda from 2008 until today. For him to all of a sudden become Bernie Sanders would be inconsistent with the larger narrative of his presidency.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the involvement of Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a grass-roots organizing group, in the presidential campaign. They have not endorsed a candidate; it is not that case that they support Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Advertisement"}

I saw this in a packed, stuffy auditorium at Elm Street Middle School on a warm Wednesday night, at a town hall with Senator Ted Cruz.In the row in front of me, in a pile of cardboard Ted Cruz posters, sat a young father and mother with a baby and two little boys. The baby was wriggling, the mother was trying to hear Mr. Cruz, the boys were trying to make each other laugh by putting M&M\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in their noses. One M&M went too deep, and the woman, baby in one arm, spent several tense moments squeezing her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose like a toothpaste tube until it reappeared.I thought: Cruz voters already have their hands full, on top of America going to hell. The talk-radio personality who did the warmup spoke of God, country and socialist sabotage as if it were\u00c2\u00a0 the end of days. His gags and applause lines brought responses like refrains in church, obscure to non-members. When he called Senator Elizabeth Warren \u00e2\u0080\u009cChief,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a man behind me did the fake Indian whoo-whoo cry. It was a reference \u00e2\u0080\u0094 old, but kept alive on right-wing radio \u00e2\u0080\u0094 about her claim of American Indian ancestry.When Mr. Cruz finished his stump speech and went to Q. and A., an undying truth about politics asserted itself. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this: Voters always ask better, more intelligent, more probing questions than moderators and TV reporters.\u00c2\u00a0 They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t filibuster or deliver the aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-I-smart speeches you hear in news conferences. They ask questions in search of answers.The first question: Senator, please address charges that you stole the vote in Iowa, by lying about Ben Carson quitting the race.Mr. Cruz said it was an honest mistake by aides who circulated a news article that said Mr. Carson was going home.Another: Explain your loan from the big bankers at Goldman Sachs.He said he and his wife had borrowed against their life savings for a longshot political race in Texas, framing his campaign financing difficulties as an example of selflessness and courage.A young boy asked: How are you going to defeat ISIS?Mr. Cruz, in pullover and dad jeans, suddenly was grave and deadly: the commander-in-chief as war criminal. By utterly and completely destroying them with overwhelming air power, he said. Carpet bomb them into oblivion. Do what we did in the first Gulf War, with 1,100 air attacks in 37 days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 after an assault like that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 Arm the Kurds, and then send in American troops. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tie their hands with fussy \u00e2\u0080\u009crules of engagement.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis is where things got a little frightening. Mr. Cruz is not a buffoon. He is a demagogue.An elderly man asked about the deficit. He was worried about his grandchildren living in a third-world country.Mr. Cruz spun a happy tale of growth, amazing growth, 7 percent growth. And cutting spending, eliminating entire federal departments: education, energy, commerce, housing, the IRS, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. How this was going to spur growth while Mr. Cruz was also ejecting millions of immigrants from the American economy, building a 2,000-mile Great Wall of Mexico and starting a third full-blown Middle Eastern war, he did not explain.Another question: Please talk about the changing climate, and the water crisis forcing Syrians into ISIS-controlled territory.Here Mr. Cruz exposed his most fraudulent self. He spun a long answer about a decades-long conspiracy by liberal elites and scientists to frighten the world with false theories \u00e2\u0080\u0094 first global cooling, then global warming, and now \u00e2\u0080\u009cclimate change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a unassailable lie. He said the only thing the lies had in common was the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire to control our lives.He was riffing on that idea of victimhood \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you are all being bamboozled \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when a small cluster of protesters suddenly stood up and started yelling about climate-change \u00e2\u0080\u009clies.\u00e2\u0080\u009dA man behind me jumped up and yelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cU.S.A., U.S.A.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with that war-drum cadence that to me always sounds like \u00e2\u0080\u009cIN YOUR FACE, IN YOUR FACE,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but the crowd did not join in. A man on the stage who had been holding an American flag on a pole with one hand rushed at the protesters, holding the pole in front of him like a spear. I thought he might stab somebody with Old Glory, like that man in the famous photo from the Boston busing riots of the 1970s, but he settled for merely shoving the protesters as others gave them the bum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rush.Mr. Cruz made some jokes about children in the room, Donald Trump and political correctness in college. His ad-libbing had that distinctly Cruz flavor of freeform hate; he views the world through a lens of anger, thuggishness and self-satisfaction. I found myself remembering people I knew in high school, who knew they were right and would not yield to shame or facts.The people thrilled to it, even when Mr. Cruz went deep on methanol subsidies and Medicaid expansion. When it was time to go, a host urged the crowd to tidy up the room because the middle school would be back tomorrow. Mr. Cruz said: We will, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re conservatives, not Occupy Wall Street protesters who defecate in public.\u00c2\u00a0 Mr. Cruz started to work the edge of the stage, and many in the audience went up and surrounded him, moths to a flame, while others streamed slowly out the doors and into the darkness.Advertisement"}

He was electrocuted and died when he touched a live cable.Since then, his death has inspired a new round of protests by Tunisia\u2019s youth, nearly a third of whom are unemployed and increasingly embittered that many of the promises of Tunisia\u2019s revolution five years ago remain unfulfilled. Demonstrations and violent clashes with the police have broken out in dozens of towns and have shaken Tunisia\u2019s government into ordering a nightly curfew across the country for three weeks.Most of the demonstrations petered out. But in Kasserine, an impoverished provincial capital of about 400,000, the protesters have refused to let up.Several hundred jobless youths have now occupied part of the governor\u2019s office for more than three weeks under the eyes of soldiers and black-clad police officers. For more than a week, some of the protesters have declared a hunger strike.\u201cWe have one demand: employment,\u201d said Shamseddine Tlilli, 30, who has a master\u2019s degree in computer science and was one of the organizers of the sit-in at the governor\u2019s office. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have money. We are sick with worry about food and electricity.\u201dIf the protests in Kasserine seem like an isolated dispute in a dun and dusty provincial capital, smaller things have led to bigger conflagrations here.Today, young people in Kasserine find themselves squeezed between the wilting promises of that revolt and a budding Islamist insurgency that has set up camps in the mountains just outside town.Military operations and sporadic clashes have since helped scare off investors and further depressed the local economy.Most of the protesters, like Mr. Tlilli, are well educated but have found that even advanced degrees, do not help them.They complain that the government has done little to address the problem of unemployment in Tunisia\u2019s underdeveloped regions, like this one in the west. They cannot find jobs here, they say, and they cannot afford the rent in larger cities.What they want is for the government to hire at least one member from disadvantaged families, in effect introducing a hiring quota from underdeveloped regions.They also want the government to relax conditions for young entrepreneurs seeking loans and start-up financing. Corruption has become so pervasive, they say, that the few programs designed to generate jobs have been hijacked.\u201cPeople are sick of the government\u2019s words,\u201d said Ahmed Rahali, 25, who has a master\u2019s degree in business management but remains jobless. \u201cThey are just promises.\u201dHe stood with a cluster of young men shifting their feet in the cold outside the governor\u2019s office here on a recent morning.Some of them had taken government training courses for entrepreneurs, but they complained that the banks refused to lend them start-up money and insisted on down payments that they cannot afford.\u201cThey ask you for 30 percent, but I don\u2019t have that,\u201d said Ashraf Aloui, an agriculture graduate.A textile engineer, Ibrahim Omri, said he had been turned down three times for business loans. \u201cThe government asks us to submit projects, but then there are a whole lot of obstacles,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to know someone or have money to bribe. If I had money, I would not be here.\u201dHe and the others insisted that they are not troublemakers. \u201cWe protested peacefully,\u201d Mr. Omri said. \u201cWe asked the government to negotiate with us because we have ideas and solutions.\u201dThe government, however, has expressed little sympathy. Instead, President B\u00e9ji Ca\u00efd Essebsi has warned that the far left, with which the students\u2019 demands are associated, is as dangerous as Islamist extremists who have committed terrorist attacks.Prime Minister Habib Essid promised in an address to Parliament that the government would provide more jobs, relax conditions for bank loans to entrepreneurs and push private-sector development toward the regions.But more promises have so far done little to calm the situation. The mayor of Kasserine, Ridha Abbassi, an academic who supported the 2011 revolution, described his job now as constant crisis management.\u201cI feel all the time I am walking on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe town is boiling and bubbling.\u201dMr. Yahyaoui was a well-known protester here who often climbed buildings to attract attention. Mr. Abbassi said he had often talked Mr. Yahyaoui down from his stunts, once from the roof of the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cThis time, I was not there,\u201d he said.Since the protests, Mr. Abbassi said, the local government has been issuing 4,000 birth certificates a day as people rush to prepare their documents in anticipation of a round of hiring for government jobs. They ignore official assurances that they do not need the certificates, he added.\u201cIt\u2019s a problem of trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to be near to the people and be clear with them, but it does not work.\u201d He blames the legacy of dictatorship and decades of injustice.The protesters accuse officials, including Mr. Abbassi, of making money on government contracts and caring only about that. He denies any involvement in corruption.\u201cThe fault is that of the government,\u201d Mr. Abbassi said, referring to that in Tunis, the capital.\u201cIn five years, there has been no clear vision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe manner of requesting is no different. We go to the capital and say we want a hospital or an airport. No one comes here to trace a vision for the region.\u201dFarah Samti contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But others argue that the trips could potentially create the appearance of a conflict of interest, particularly when the organizations are known for their conservative or liberal views. Some groups at times use the presence of a Supreme Court justice as a way to pull in members or other paying guests.Ethical standards prohibit judges from accepting gifts from anyone with a matter currently before the court. But those guidelines presented no barrier to John Poindexter, who invited Justice Scalia to stay at his West Texas ranch.After Justice Scalia, the second most active traveler on the current court is Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who took 185 privately paid trips from 2004 to 2014, according to a database built by the Center for Responsive Politics, based on individual reports filed by the justices.

{"Headline": "Pope Francis Wades Into U.S. Immigration Morass With Border Trip", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byCIUDAD JU\u00c1REZ, Mexico \u2014 Stepping to the concrete edge of the Rio Grande, Pope Francis on Wednesday went to a militarized divide of the United States-Mexican border and prayed for compassion toward immigrants. He never set foot in the United States, but he did step directly, and deliberately, into the acrimonious American debate over immigration.Beneath a brilliant blue sky, Francis turned the dusty no man\u2019s land of the border into a media-saturated setting for a potent symbolic moment: On one side was a crowd of 200,000 people waiting for him to lead Mass in this Mexican border city. On the other was a small group of people from the Roman Catholic Diocese of El Paso, along with police officers and border guards, some peering at the spectacle through binoculars usually used to catch migrants trying to sneak over the border.Francis slowly walked up to a sloped memorial that was built for his visit to commemorate those who have died along the Mexican border. He stood before a large cross overlooking the border fence, made the sign of the cross and prayed before laying a bouquet of flowers on a small table before the cross. Then he looked over to the United States and waved his hand to offer a papal blessing.It lasted two minutes, maybe three. But for those moments, on both sides of the border, despite the huge crowds, there was only silence.Francis has a flair for powerful gestures, but what gave his border visit special resonance was its timing. His call for compassion was injected into the contentious Republican presidential primaries, in which many candidates have sought to stake out tough positions against immigration \u2014 and in which several of the candidates are Catholics who have already expressed unease with Francis\u2019 prior criticisms of capitalism.Donald J. Trump, who has promised to force Mexico to finance the building of a wall if he is elected president, criticized the pope\u2019s border visit in advance, accusing Francis of acting as an instrument of the Mexican government. On Wednesday, Francis did not mention Mr. Trump, who is not Catholic, or American politics in general. A Vatican spokesman scoffed at any suggestion that the pope was acting at the behest of Mexican officials.Francis has sought to focus global attention on the plight of migrants since the earliest months of his papacy, when he used his first papal trip to visit Lampedusa, the Italian island besieged by desperate migrants trying to escape North Africa on rafts and rickety boats. Many have drowned. During a later trip to the Holy Land, Francis made an unscheduled stop in Bethlehem to pray silently at the wall that partitions the city\u2019s Palestinian sector from Israel.Ju\u00e1rez was the last stop on Francis\u2019 six-day visit to Mexico, one during which he spoke out on issues like inequality, corruption, drug trafficking and poverty. His final event was a huge Mass conducted on a fairground barely 300 feet from the border. It was simultaneously broadcast across the river in El Paso, Tex., where a crowd gathered in the Sun Bowl football stadium. \u201cWe cannot deny the humanitarian crisis which in recent years has meant the migration of thousands of people,\u201d he said during his homily at Mass. \u201cThe human tragedy that is forced migration is a global phenomenon today. This crisis, which can be measured in numbers and statistics, we want instead to measure with names, stories, families.\u201dTo a degree, Francis did tread carefully in his remarks, declining to assign blame, other than to denounce human trafficking. But while he did not directly criticize governments or government policies, he spoke deliberately and pointedly about \u201cforced migration,\u201d apparently using that terminology to call attention to the thousands of people who have fled violence and upheaval in Central America and to heighten an awareness of their plight. Honduras and El Salvador, for example, are now considered among the world\u2019s deadliest places outside a war zone. His arrival in Ju\u00e1rez brought large, ecstatic crowds onto the streets, and especially at the site of the Mass. Laura Luz Mart\u00ednez Coronel traveled 12 hours by bus from Coahuila with her husband and her son to attend the Mass. \u201cWe came here because he touches our hearts,\u201d Mrs. Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cSome people come because they enjoy the event. For us, we feel it.\u201dElizabeth Coello, who was sitting with her two children near the front of the stage, said that the pope\u2019s message was important, but that he needed to do more than just inspire people. She said he should allow divorced people to receive communion, a contentious issue within the church that the pope has yet to weigh in on. \u201cHe should change the laws that prevent some Catholics from entering the church,\u201d she said. Still, Ms. Coello said she agreed with many of the things Francis had said during his trip to Mexico. \u201cWe are living in an epoch where money can do anything, and we are so materialistic,\u201d she said. \u201cOn this I agree with him. There are Catholics who are very closed, and he is trying to open their minds.\u201dJosue Daniel, 26, from Guatemala, was among migrants living temporarily in a shelter in Ju\u00e1rez who arrived at 7 a.m. to get good seats for the Mass. Mr. Daniel said he was 10 the first time he tried to escape the chaos and violence in Guatemala. He tried again at 18, then at 21, then at 24, and now once more at 26.Although he had been sent back repeatedly, he kept trying because life in Guatemala had only worsened, he said, adding that he hoped to cross the border into the United States in the coming days and that he intended to keep trying until he made it.How would this visit by the pope help his cause?\u201cWe just want his blessing,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cAfter this, it will go well.\u201dFrom 1965 to 2015, more than 16 million Mexicans entered the United States, one of the largest mass migrations in history and one that continues to inflame American politics. But today Mexico is less an exporter of migrants than the highway through which hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans travel north. Under American pressure, the Mexican authorities are now cracking down, instituting Plan Frontera Sur, which has increased security on Mexico\u2019s southern border. Now migrants must take different routes through the country, at great peril, and often they are dependent on smuggling rings. In 2015, the Mexican authorities arrested more than 170,000 Central American migrants passing through the country illegally \u2014 more than double the number from two years earlier.\u201cHere in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, as in other border areas, there are thousands of immigrants from Central American and other countries, not forgetting the many Mexicans who also seek to pass over \u2018to the other side,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Francis said during the Mass. \u201cEach step, a journey laden with grave injustices: the enslaved, the imprisoned and extorted; so many of these brothers and sisters of ours are the consequence of a trade in human beings.\u201dHis border speech culminated a day when Francis also visited a penitentiary and spoke to an audience of workers and business owners. At the penitentiary, he rode through the prison yard in a motorized cart and shook hands with prisoners. His messages throughout the day hit directly on issues that resonate on both sides of the border. He said decades of locking people up to achieve security had failed. He continued his call for ethical business practices and lamented that \u201cthe prevailing mentality advocates for the greatest possible profits, immediately and at any cost.\u201d He added, \u201cThe flow of capital cannot decide the flow and life of people.\u201dFrancis has often criticized technology in past speeches as having a dehumanizing effect. But toward the end of his Mass on Wednesday, he exulted that it was being carried live across the border in the stadium in El Paso.\u201cThanks to the help of technology,\u201d he said, \u201cwe can pray, sing and celebrate this merciful love that the Lord gives us, and that no border will keep us from sharing.\u201dAlberto Arce contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

With each new delivery to his doorstep \u2014 sometimes several in a day \u2014 he faces the source of his guilt and frustration: another cardboard box.A handful of scientists and policy makers are circling the same question, grappling with the long-term environmental effect of an economy that runs increasingly on gotta-have-it-now gratification. This cycle leads consumers to expect that even their modest wants can be satisfied like urgent needs, and not always feel so great about it.The environmental cost can include the additional cardboard \u2014 35.4 million tons of containerboard were produced in 2014 in the United States, with e-commerce companies among the fastest-growing users \u2014 and the emissions from increasingly personalized freight services.Dr. Sperling said that consumers shared as much responsibility for the environmental cost of the deliveries as the companies that provided the speedy services.\u201cFrom a sustainability perspective, we\u2019re heading in the wrong direction,\u201d he said.But measuring the effect of the cardboard economy is more difficult.There are possible trade-offs, for example. As people shop more online, they might use their cars less. And delivery services have immense incentive to find the most efficient routes, keeping their fuel costs and emissions down. For its part, Amazon said that delivering to consumers straight from huge warehouses cuts down the need to distribute to thousands of stores.Ardeshi Faghri, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Delaware, said the increase of various emissions \u2014 which he estimated at 20 percent from 2001 to 2011 \u2014 \u201ccould be due to a multitude of reasons, but we think that online shopping and more delivery trucks are really one of the primary reasons.\u201d\u201cOnline shopping has not helped the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has made it worse.\u201dOther scholars say that, at least for now, online shopping appears to be complementing brick-and-mortar shopping, not replacing it.Dr. Wang and other researchers say the demand for instant delivery, in particular, creates challenges for trucking companies trying to be efficient. Instead of taking big truckloads to single retailers they now make more scattershot deliveries.Many drivers deliver just one item. This is often the case for Postmates, which has a fleet of 15,000 freelance drivers signed up to make deliveries of whatever the customer orders \u2014 an Uber-like service, but for deliveries. The cost typically starts at $5, and a 9 percent service fee applied to the cost of the item. (The company says it also has about 5,000 deliverers who go on bike or foot in dense urban areas).And the push for speed from marketers gives shoppers little incentive to wait.Such is the case for Monica Rohleder, who admits to using Amazon Prime so much that \u201cmy husband jokes we keep Amazon in business.\u201dMs. Rohleder, who lives in Los Angeles and works at a public relations firm, said she liked overnight delivery, but \u201cwithin a couple of hours is best\u201d because she is busy with work and her two young children. So she often does not order something until it\u2019s urgent. \u201cThere\u2019s the immediate gratification of getting something and checking it off your list,\u201d she said.One afternoon she received six boxes, from Amazon and Nordstrom, for a Hawaii trip, including bathing suits, workout clothes and coloring books. Some of the clothes did not fit, so she returned them.She thinks more about the cardboard that comes into her house than the truck emissions, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d she added of her mass of weekly recycling.Amazon is aware of the cardboard issue. Since 2009, it has received 33 million comments, ratings and photographs about its packaging as part of its \u201cpackaging feedback program.\u201d Amazon said it used that feedback to make sure that cardboard box size was consistent with the size of the product. It also works with manufacturers to send some products without additional cardboard packaging, said Craig Berman, a company spokesman.\u201cAnd maybe not put a box inside a box inside a box,\u201d he saidAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Credit Unions Turn Borrowers Into Savers", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserSaving money by taking out a loan may sound counterintuitive, but a program offered by some credit unions is aimed at having consumers do just that.\u201cBorrow and Save\u201d programs, which tie small loans to forced savings by the borrowers, showed promise in a recent pilot test at 12 credit unions, said Andrew Downin, managing director of innovation at the nonprofit Filene Research Institute, a consumer finance research organization.\u201cThe goal is to establish a behavior and a habit of saving,\u201d Mr. Downin said.With no cushion to draw on, consumers hit with a costly surprise \u2014 a big car repair or a medical bill \u2014 may turn to sources like payday lenders to cover the shortfall. If they cannot repay the short-term payday loan on time, they end up borrowing again and paying exorbitant interest rates and fees, often entering a cycle of debt that is difficult to break.Different credit unions may have variations of Borrow and Save. Typically, a portion of the amount borrowed is set aside in a savings account, and remains there while the borrower repays the loan in monthly installments. (If you borrowed $1,000 and the bank required a 50 percent set-aside, $500 would go into the savings account.) Once the loan is paid off, the borrower has access to the savings.\u201cIt\u2019s their money and they can make a determination of how they want to use it,\u201d said Pamela Owens, vice president for programs at the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions.In Filene\u2019s pilot program, loans ranged from $200 to $2,000, and the amounts set aside ranged from 5 percent to as high as 25 or 50 percent. Loan terms in the test ranged from 90 days to as long as one year.At Freedom First Credit Union, in Roanoke, Va., which has offered Borrow and Save since 2012, members can borrow up to $5,000, and agree to set aside half the money in a savings account until the balance is paid.Dave Prosser, senior vice president for community development at Freedom First, said the program was often used as a bridge for members who because of a poor credit history may not be ready to handle, say, a $15,000 car loan. Borrow and Save helps them establish a regular payment habit, he said, and can also help build a down payment for the car.Typically, having the lump sum set aside in a savings account encourages consumers to add to it regularly, he said \u2014 perhaps by having a small amount automatically transferred into the account when a paycheck is deposited. \u201cOnce they have the nest egg started,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s easier to contribute.\u201dThe lump sum in the savings account also helps reduce the credit union\u2019s risk. In the pilot, fewer than 2 percent of borrowers defaulted, Ms. Owens said.In the Filene pilot, the participating credit unions made loans to more than 3,000 borrowers, for an average amount of just under $1,000. The average savings was $290. That may not sound like a large amount, but for many people, it can provide at least a minimal safety net.In a survey of 146 of the borrowers from nine credit unions, 94 percent said the loan helped with an emergency, and 89 percent said they would use the program again if the need arose.But the longer-term impact is less clear. About a quarter of the participants said they might still need to use payday loans \u2014 perhaps because the loan limits for Borrow and Save are too low.Still, nine of the 12 pilot credit unions said they would continue offering the loans. Filene hopes the product will be adopted more broadly, perhaps by a major bank, Mr. Downin said.Here are some questions and answers about Borrow and Save loans:Rates in the pilot program ranged from nearly 10 percent to as much as 28 percent. Those rates may seem high compared with those for more traditional loans, but they are lower than the rates for most payday loans, which can charge fees that equate to annual percentage rates in the triple digits.The average credit score of borrowers in the pilot was 562, but the Filene report recommended that credit unions use the scores as background information rather than as qualification criteria, since many people who would benefit most from the program have low scores or no credit history. The borrower\u2019s payments are reported to the major credit bureaus, so they can help improve credit scores if monthly payments are made on time, Ms. Owens said.Availability is still limited, and some credit unions reserve the loans for existing members, rather than promoting them to attract new members. A list of the participants in the pilot program is available in the Filene report.yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market for Fixer-Uppers Traps Low-Income Buyers", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byAKRON, Ohio \u2014 Hundreds of broken-down houses still dot the streets of this onetime tire capital of the world, a scar from the financial crisis and housing bust.The wood has rotted in some; others have black mold, broken windows or failing foundations. Many lack working electrical systems or are missing water pipes and furnaces. The unpaid property taxes mount.Dozens of these houses were scooped up after the financial crisis by investors, who then make deals with low-income home buyers unable to get traditional mortgages. The arrangement is something like buying a home on an installment plan, with a high-interest, long-term loan called a contract for deed, or land contract.But for buyers lured by the dream of homeownership, these seller-financed transactions can become a money trap that ends with a quick eviction by the seller, who can flip the home again. Before the housing crisis, low-income buyers got too much of a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. Now, they are getting too little of a house that they can\u2019t afford to repair.It is a scene playing out across the Midwest and the South, where many of the derelict houses have been sold to private investors by government mortgage firms at knockdown prices.Nationwide, more than three million people are estimated to have bought a home through a contract for deed. After the financial crisis, as banks retreated from lending to those with poor credit, this odd corner of the housing market began to draw interest from deep-pocketed investors who sometimes sell the homes for four times the price they paid.\u201cThere is this whole other way that people buy homes. It is very much under the radar and hidden,\u201d said Heather K. Way, a professor of law at the University of Texas. \u201cHomeowners go into this without knowing that this is such a high-risk contract fraught with perils.\u201dNow, complaints are piling up in cities across the country, according to dozens of court records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as interviews with housing lawyers and home buyers in Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota.Examples of contracts for deeds and reports by housing code officials in Akron, Ohio, citing problems with some homes sold by one of the larger contract sellers.In Akron, some investment firms aim at residents \u201cwho do not have the financial ability to comply, nor the savvy to realize that they are being taken advantage of,\u201d said Duane Groeger, the city\u2019s housing administrator, whose office oversees code violations.One of several firms Mr. Groeger\u2019s office has fielded complaints about is Harbour Portfolio Advisors of Dallas.One of the larger firms in this market, Harbour has bought more than 6,700 single-family homes in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania and a handful of other states since 2010 \u2014 most of them from Fannie Mae, according to the mortgage finance firm and the foreclosure research firm RealtyTrac.Ten of the more than 50 homes Harbour bought in Akron have been torn down after being condemned and two others are slated for demolition, Mr. Groeger said.Swimming in DebtLacking the means to fix up the homes, those who enter into contracts with Harbour often end up swimming in debt, a review of lawsuits shows.Kevin Franklyn, 46, of Detroit said he struggled with making repairs on a $44,925 Harbour house in 2011. After falling behind on the payments, he recently agreed to forfeit the contract to the house. The roof, plumbing, electrical system and drywall all needed serious repairs, he said.His fianc\u00e9e, Lisa Micou, 46, said the home was in greater disrepair than the couple had anticipated.\u201cEverybody wants that part of the American dream \u2014 everyone wants a piece of that pie,\u201d she said.In Battle Creek, Mich., Patricia Howard entered into a contract for deed with Harbour for $28,800 in April 2014. Soon after, she fell behind on her monthly payment of $280, excluding taxes and insurance.Ms. Howard, 54, said she had to spend thousands of dollars on critical house repairs.\u201cI\u2019m behind because I had to fix the plumbing, and now the gutters on the side,\u201d said Ms. Howard, whose main source of income is her monthly disability checks. \u201cIt\u2019s like one thing after another is falling apart.\u201dIn December, she reached a court settlement with Harbour that gives her until March to make up the 10 missed payments. If she cannot come up with the money, Ms. Howard will have to forfeit the contract and leave the house.Harbour bought the home from Fannie Mae for $7,691. A lawyer for Harbour and its founder, Charles A. Vose III, said the firm was not responsible for renovating homes it sells under contracts for deeds.\u201cHarbour\u2019s business model is to purchase unproductive residential properties and sell them to other people who will make them productive again,\u201d the lawyer, Jacqueline Mallett, said.Ms. Mallett added, \u201cContract for deeds are a lawful financing tool sanctioned by state laws\u201d and said Harbour \u201cdoes not target prospective buyers.\u201dMr. Vose, 46, who would not comment directly, is a familiar figure on the social and arts circuit in Dallas. He and his wife, Merry, live in a multimillion-dollar home where they hold lavish fund-raisers. In November, they were some of the hosts of a fund-raiser for the Perot Museum of Nature and Science.Harbour, which raised more than $60 million from wealthy investors, was the single largest buyer of foreclosed homes from Fannie Mae\u2019s bulk sale program from 2010 to 2014, which the mortgage giant used to unload more than 20,000 homes that were hard to sell. The homes were bought by Harbour for an average of $8,000 each in cities like Akron, Detroit and Flint, Mich.Representatives for Fannie Mae, which was effectively taken over by the federal government, said it had an obligation to minimize losses to taxpayers by selling homes first to residents and nonprofits, and then to investors. Fannie Mae notes the bulk sale program for hard-to-sell homes accounted for a small fraction of the 900,000 homes it has sold since the financial crisis.More than a dozen Harbour contracts reviewed by The Times \u2014 including Ms. Howard\u2019s \u2014 all ran for 30 years, carried a 9.9 percent interest rate and required buyers to bring their property into \u201chabitable condition\u201d within four months. The contracts also contained an arbitration clause to settle disputes between seller and buyer, a stipulation that consumer advocates contend strips buyers of the right to litigate onerous clauses in a courtroom.Fewer Protections for BuyersProvisions in a contract for deed are enforceable as long as they do not conflict with state law. The home dweller has more limited protections than a person buying a house with a mortgage, and evictions are quicker than a foreclosure. The residents are typically responsible for repairs and paying all property taxes, but the legal title under a contract for deed does not transfer until the final payment is made \u2014 an end result that rarely happens.Robert Doggett, Texas RioGrande Legal Aid\u2019s general counsel, says contracts for deeds \u201ctake advantage of people\u2019s desperation\u201d and can worsen neighborhood blight.Some municipalities seek to hold the sellers of contracts for deeds liable for correcting housing code violations, but that can be difficult. In some states, like Michigan, there is no requirement that a contract for deed be recorded, making the market hard to monitor.Consider the case of a house at 950 Independence Avenue in Akron. Harbour sold a contract on it in September 2011 after a private inspection firm it hired prepared a report that said the home was not in need of repairs. The contract was bought by a local couple for $34,725. A few months later, the house was condemned by Akron officials and the couple, who operated an auto repair company on the premises, was forced to leave.The city razed the house in 2014. It is now a vacant lot, with about $11,000 in taxes owed on it.Mr. Groeger said getting Harbour to respond to outstanding code violations on homes had been \u201can exercise in futility.\u201dMs. Mallett, a lawyer with Bricker & Eckler in Columbus, Ohio, said Harbour began using new contracts a year ago that were \u201ccompliant with state law\u201d and made clear the buyer\u2019s obligations. She said that it was not Harbour\u2019s \u201cintention to frustrate city officials\u201d and that the firm\u2019s asset manager \u201cresponds to all of the code violations.\u201dA sample revised contract provided by Ms. Mallett eliminated some of the provisions legal experts found problematic, like one that required a buyer to make necessary repairs within four months of purchasing the property.Each house Harbour sells in a contract for deed is inspected by a third party and it discloses any outstanding tax liens and housing violations, she said.The home at 950 Independence Avenue, she said, should not have been razed and could have been rehabilitated. Ms. Mallett said many of the 300 homes in Detroit listed as being delinquent on taxes by Wayne County were sold, to other investors or individuals, a while ago.Harbour, she added, has stopped buying new homes across the country. In Detroit, the firm owns eight homes outright; 53 others were sold in a current contract for deed, she said.Still, Harbour spends a good deal of time in court seeking to foreclose on those who default on contracts or seek relief in bankruptcy proceedings. Over the last five years, Harbour appeared as a creditor in nearly 100 personal bankruptcy cases. Court records also show that Harbour sold homes and bankruptcy claims to other firms.Sometimes It WorksNot all contracts for deeds are as contentious.Pete Flom, an executive with the program, said the contract was \u201cjust the vehicle to get someone in the house.\u201dThe initiative, by Dayton\u2019s Bluff Neighborhood Housing Services and the Greater Minneapolis Housing Corporation, requires financial coaching and one-on-one counseling for buyers.Carolyn Olson, of the housing corporation, and Jim Erchul, of Dayton\u2019s Bluff, started the program during the financial crisis, buying more than 400 homes in foreclosure. The program uses financing from U.S. Bancorp and wealthy investors, and some of its achievement stems from the fact it can buy homes that need fewer repairs.The average home sold in the Bridge to Success program goes for around $145,000, with a monthly payment of $1,100, which includes interest payments of 7.5 percent. The contracts run for 10 years, but the expectation is that buyers will graduate out of the program by either refinancing the deal with a bank mortgage, or by selling the home.One program participant, Betty Jo Zepeda, 46, was sleeping in cars and on friends\u2019 couches after her marriage broke up.\u201cI found myself in a place that I had never been in my adult life,\u201d Ms. Zepeda said. \u201cNo home, no job. Nothing.\u201dShe got a full-time job in 2014 as an administrative assistant at a local school and bought a $180,000 house through the program. In November, she qualified for a mortgage through Mid-Country Bank.\u201cI ate a lot of peanut butter and jelly, a lot of beans, a lot of rice just to be able to refinance and to have this be my home,\u201d she said.Even one Wall Street figure argues that seller-financed programs can help consumers.Jeremy Healey, a former executive at the hedge fund Eton Park Capital Management, says his new firm, Battery Point Financial, rehabilitates all the homes it sells in a contract for deed.Mr. Healey said his firm had structured its 20-year contracts to be compliant with new federal guidelines for high-interest mortgages. \u201cWe never want anyone to default,\u201d he said.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the private equity giant, has committed up to $40 million to Battery Point.To date, Battery Point has bought more than 300 homes in 16 states and intends to resell the properties for around $72,000. It is completing sales contracts for about 20 homes. It has sold three homes in Akron \u2014 which has had no complaints about Battery Point \u2014 including one near the city\u2019s airport, where the Goodyear airships were once housed.Some seven miles away, the vacant lot at 950 Independence Avenue remains for sale.Advertisement"}

She had just landed as part of a trip intended to show support for the protesters.She seemed to speak their language. Stay calm, she told them. \u201cThe world is watching.\u201dBefore long, the occupiers agreed to turn themselves over to agents of the F.B.I. on Thursday \u2014 accompanied by Ms. Fiore and the evangelist Franklin Graham.Shortly after 11 a.m. on Thursday, she tweeted the news:Who Is Michele Fiore?Ms. Fiore is a second-term assemblywoman representing Nevada\u2019s fourth district. But she might be best known nationally for a Christmas card.\u201cIt\u2019s up to Americans to protect America,\u201d the accompanying text read. \u201cWe\u2019re just your ordinary American family.\u201c-With love & liberty, Michele.\u201dMs. Fiore first made her foray onto the political stage in 2010, as the Tea Party was rising to prominence, by running for Congress. She lost badly, but won an open Assembly seat in 2012. She was re-elected two years later.What Is Her Link to the Standoff in Burns?Ms. Fiore has been a well-known supporter of the family of Cliven Bundy, the rancher who had a standoff with the federal government in 2014 over cattle grazing in Nevada. The F.B.I. arrested Mr. Bundy late Wednesday in Portland.An armed protest at a remote federal wildlife refuge was the latest flare-up in a decades-long struggle over control of federal land.Asked by Mr. Hayes whether she recognized the authority of the federal government, she said: \u201cI recognize the authority that they believe that they have. I just question it.\u201dSince the antigovernment action began in Oregon on Jan. 2, she has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the land-use stances that have radicalized the group, led in part by two of Mr. Bundy\u2019s sons, Ammon and Ryan.After a member of the group was shot dead by police officers during a traffic stop on Jan. 26, Ms. Fiore expressed condolences for the family of the dead man, LaVoy Finicum, on Twitter.She has since portrayed Mr. Finicum\u2019s killing as an unprovoked murder by the police, claiming he had his hands in the air when he was shot.In recent weeks, Ms. Fiore has communicated with members of the armed occupation in Oregon, her executive assistant, Cassidy McGowan, said Thursday.Ms. McGowan said the assemblywoman was able to change the tenor of the standoff because of her unique connection with the occupiers.\u201cPart of their concern was if they got arrested they\u2019d just be forgotten about,\u201d Ms. McGowan said. \u201cAnd she was able to reassure them that will not happen. \u2018I will fight for you. I will fight to make sure that this ends safe. We are here. We care.\u2019 \u201dWhat Are Her Political Views?Ms. Fiore appears to lean strongly libertarian.Her social media accounts are suffused with protestations over claims of government overreach and posts about gun control, an issue she often addresses with images of herself holding weapons.Her public comments have sometimes drawn outrage and, in one case concerning her views on cancer, bafflement.\u201cI\u2019m about to fly to Paris and shoot them in the head myself,\u201d Ms. Fiore said. \u201cI am not O.K. with Syrian refugees.

The sexual assaults that are occurring would go down once these sexual predators get a bullet in their head.\u201dShe added, \u201cWe\u2019re in 2015, and we have a black president, in case anyone didn\u2019t notice, so the color and the race issue \u2014 I think it\u2019s time that we put that to rest.\u201d\u201cIf you have cancer, which I believe is a fungus, and we can put a pic line into your body and we\u2019re flushing with, say, salt water, sodium carbonate, through that line and flushing out the fungus,\u201d she said, according to The Post. \u201cThese are some procedures that are not FDA-approved in America that are very inexpensive, cost-effective.\u201dWhat Else Is There to Know About Her?

{"Headline": "Bombardier to Cut 7,000 Jobs as New Airliner Struggles to Draw Buyers", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byOTTAWA \u2014 Bombardier, the Canadian transportation company, said on Wednesday that it would lay off about 7,000 employees over the next two years, as it struggles to find buyers for a new series of planes that for the first time put it in direct competition with the aviation giants Boeing and Airbus.After a prolonged drought in sales announcements, Bombardier said that Air Canada, which has its headquarters in Montreal, had signed a letter of intent to buy 45 of the new CSeries planes, with options for 30 more. Bombardier expects to start delivering the aircraft within three years and estimated that all 75 planes could cost up to $6.4 billion.While the Air Canada sale provided important help for the CSeries, sales of the aircraft remain below levels that analysts generally view as assuring the project\u2019s success. Including the 45 planes for Air Canada, Bombardier now has 288 firm orders.While the CSeries airplanes have won praise for their technical abilities, their development has been plagued by delays. That allowed Airbus and Boeing to adapt their smaller airliners to use the unusually fuel-efficient and quiet engine technology that Bombardier had hoped to introduce to the market. The larger companies have also been aggressive in offering airlines deals to keep them from buying Bombardier\u2019s planes.Air Canada has not signed formal contracts for the 45 planes, which will be the larger CS300 version. Neither it nor Bombardier offered details about sales prices, financing or other terms of the sale.Alain Bellemare, chief executive of Bombardier, confirmed in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that the first CSeries planes would begin service this year with Swiss International Air Lines, a unit of Lufthansa. But he warned that costs resulting from the move to full-scale production of the airliner would be a drain on Bombardier\u2019s financial performance this year.\u201cOur liquidity position will remain strong,\u201d he said.Despite that, Mr. Bellemare also said that obtaining a similar investment from the government of Canada remained \u201cvery critical\u201d for the company. Such an infusion, he said, would give airlines further confidence in the future of the CSeries and provide Bombardier with added financial flexibility.While the Liberal government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not clearly indicated its plans, the idea of federal assistance to Bombardier is unpopular in Western Canada, partly because no such aid is being proposed for its struggling oil and gas industry.The layoffs will affect Bombardier\u2019s thriving rail operations, as well as its aviation business. The company said nearly half of the announced job cuts would take place in Europe, where nearly 3,400 jobs would be affected. A further 2,800 jobs will be cut in Canada.Advertisement"}

Those decisions can make the difference between being a small-business owner and a business executive with significant wealth.Of course, which of those decisions matter most is generally clear only in hindsight.\u201cThere is no bright-line test when a company gets to a certain size or age to do these things,\u201d said Kevin M. Harris, head of the family business group at Northern Trust. \u201cIt is based on where the company wants to go.\u201dDetermining which decisions were the ones that made the difference is sometimes not an easy task, and the stories that are retold are often the ones that turned out well. Yet it is worth considering what can go wrong.Entrepreneurs who failed to find success were often resistant to change, said David Reimer, chief executive of Merryck & Company, which uses former chief executives as coaches.\u201cThe reason tends to boil down to self-awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of C.E.O.s and entrepreneurs develop a Teflon coating in order to cope. That\u2019s not a bad thing. The bad thing is when there is no longer a distinction between your Teflon coating and who you are, and you can\u2019t take on any other input.\u201dSo from the vantage point of hindsight, what were crucial decisions for a selection of business people whose wealth was tied to the businesses they started or inherited?The decisions were generally of an operational nature, rather than part of a great innovation, these business owners said: a way of propelling their company forward and their net worth up.Boot-strapping, the term given to starting a business with an idea, passion and little else, is as much a necessity as a badge of honor for many entrepreneurs. And part of that do-everything ethos is a desire to run the business cheaply, with an awareness that lack of cash has killed many small businesses.Fourteen years ago, when Tom Bernthal got the idea for a market research firm that is today Kelton Global, he and his partner, Gareth Schweitzer, expected to crisscross the country from their base in Los Angeles. \u201cAll of a sudden we realized what we had as a business was our people, and it was all we had to sell,\u201d Mr. Bernthal said. \u201cSo we went out there and started being willing to pay for this really top-notch talent.\u201dThe firm now has 70 employees, he said. In addition to increasing the founders\u2019 overhead, that decision in 2010 to make those hires freed Mr. Bernthal, 42, and Mr. Schweitzer to focus on the higher-level projects that would expand the business.\u201cIf you don\u2019t hire those types of people, the client always wants you,\u201d he said, joking that this insight came after his 14th overnight flight for a meeting in three months.For Mr. Greenblatt, the growth of his background-checking company had been steady but slow. He credited the company\u2019s faster growth to hiring a president in 1999 to help him expand. To afford it, he was prepared to halve his own pay.\u201cI never had to take that cut because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized every single person you hire has to be amazing.\u201dBut such leaps can be daunting because they lock the entrepreneur into a higher payroll, which in many new economy businesses is the largest cost.Charles R. Barrett, president and managing direct of FZ Media Design, a digital marketing company outside Philadelphia, said he faced such a prospect in 2009. He had been doing projects for various small companies and relying mostly on freelance designers when extra work came in. But after doing a small job for CareerBuilder.com, he was given the opportunity to do a lot more work for the jobs site.\u201cIt was that first \u2018put up or shut up\u2019 moment,\u201d he said. \u201cI just saw tremendous opportunity there. The door was open. How could I kick this door down? I needed bodies.\u201dHe took the chance and began building a full-time team, which is now eight people. It paid off. More and more jobs came in from CareerBuilder.com, including the recent introduction of the worldwide jobs portal for Hilton Hotels. He has also been able to step back and focus on the larger strategy.\u201cI\u2019m really proud of the life it\u2019s afforded me,\u201d Mr. Barrett, 48, said. \u201cWe have a nice house that I\u2019ve rebuilt and a beach house in New Jersey that my wife loves. I bought a new Mustang and a 1967 Mustang coupe that I\u2019ve completely rebuilt. You carry the stress load of everything, but it also gives you the freedom to reap the reward.\u201dMike Cagney, 45, a co-founder of Social Finance Inc., also known as SoF, an online lender focused on student loan refinancing, personal loans and mortgages, said he wanted to make the company\u2019s customer service the best it could be.When he looked into setting up a call center in Sonoma County, Calif., an hour north of San Francisco, the going wage for such work was $12 an hour. \u201cI looked at that and said there is no way I can pay $12 an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one can live on $12 an hour.\u201dHe considered the decision an investment. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the front line of your business talking to your members worrying about making rent that month,\u201d he said. \u201cI said we needed to pay people a living wage. I committed to paying $20 an hour, and some members of my board said, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 \u201dThe result has been low turnover rates for workers and high satisfaction scores from customers. The company, which started four years ago with $80 million in financing, recently raised $1 billion and is now valued at $4 billion. It has been profitable for two years.Larry Perkins, 38, applied three times for a job at Alvarez & Marsal, a top corporate restructuring firm, before he was hired in its Los Angeles office in 2006.\u201cThat was a huge achievement in my life to get the job there,\u201d he said. But 15 days into his dream job, he said, \u201cI was on a jog and I said, \u2018What am I doing here?\u2019 \u201dIt wasn\u2019t the restructuring business, which he loved, that bothered him, but the job itself. So in 2007, at 29, he decided to start his own firm. Three years later, his company was bought by another restructuring firm. A year into that arrangement, he was miserable all over again.\u201cI got into a position that is not my favorite one,\u201d he said. \u201cI was working for someone, trying to do all the right things, but at the end of it I didn\u2019t feel like I was building the thing I wanted to build.\u201dSo with five core members, he bought the firm back, a long, messy process that cost him most of the money he made on the initial sale. Since becoming independent again in 2013, the firm has grown to 20 people and business has increased sixfold, he said.\u201cThe challenges I had as a small firm were the same problems I had at a big firm,\u201d he said. \u201cA big chunk of the problem I was having was with the guy in the mirror.\u201dMr. Cagney said he had a similar revelation about his leadership skills. In his first venture, a wealth management technology firm he started in 2000, he thought he was a great chief executive.\u201cNo one left the company, which I took as an endorsement of my management style,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize there weren\u2019t any other jobs out there. Then my board sat me down and said, \u2018You\u2019re the worst C.E.O. ever.\u2019 \u201dTo his credit, he listened and came to agree with the board. So when he started SoFi, he brought in a former colleague 10 years his senior to handle management and other technical roles. \u201cIt was a great thing to do because I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI could worry about other parts of the business.\u201dNo account of wealth accumulation can ignore tales of risk-taking. But these entrepreneurs who built wealth did what could be called responsible risk-taking.For Paul Darley, 53, it was a mathematical problem: The business could not support the people in the next generation of his family if they joined the company at the same rate as his generation. So after nearly 100 years of focusing on the firefighting business, he decided that W.S. Darley & Company should expand into military contracting.\u201cThe driver was making the company big enough to support the next generation,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the defense business when we went into it, so we had to surround ourselves with good people.\u201dIt worked, though not without fits and starts. But he said he listened to advisers and was willing to modify his strategy.Blaine Vess, who 16 years ago founded StudyMode, a college note-sharing site, in his dorm room, ran it as a hobby business until 2005, he said. Then, five years after starting the company, he switched it from an advertising model to a subscription model.He was worried that it would lose customers, but almost at once its revenue spiked, going from $60,000 a year in 2004 to more than $1 million a year in 2007, with just Mr. Vess and his co-founder involved. A third partner they took on in 2008 pushed them to expand internationally. Last year, they hired a chief operating officer.\u201cWe could have kept running this thing the way we were running it even a year ago and get it to higher levels by asking more questions,\u201d Mr. Vess, 34, said. \u201cBut getting someone in who\u2019s been through it before and getting comfortable that this person is doing an awesome job and better than I could do, this has been great.\u201dFor those risks, the company has pushed its annual revenue to more than $20 million today.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rising Call to Promote STEM Education and Cut Liberal Arts Funding", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byFrustrated by soaring tuition costs, crushing student loan debt and a lack of skilled workers, particularly in science and technology, more and more states have adopted the idea of rewarding public colleges and universities for churning out students educated in fields seen as important to the economy.\u201cThere will be more incentives to electrical engineers than French literature majors, there just will,\u201d Mr. Bevin, a Republican, said after announcing his spending plan. \u201cAll the people in the world who want to study French literature can do so; they\u2019re just not going to be subsidized by the taxpayers like engineers will be, for example.\u201dDemocrats have, for the most part, avoided denouncing the humanities, but they have argued that education and training should be better aligned with the job market.But the particular focus on jobs and earnings \u2014 originally limited to vocational programs and community colleges \u2014 is gaining momentum.Education tends to be justified in terms of personal exploration and fulfillment, as well as creating informed citizens who make a functioning democracy possible. The humanities have traditionally been seen as crucial to both endeavors.\u201cThe problem is that education is now the principal determinant of earnings, and we pay no attention to it at all. That\u2019s gone too far,\u201d Mr. Carnevale said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers\u2019 regret out there.\u201dMr. Carnevale argues that there should be much more information available to students about employment and wage prospects before they choose a major so that they can make informed choices. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take away Shakespeare. We\u2019re just talking about helping people make good decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a lifelong learner if you\u2019re not a lifelong earner.\u201dA graduate with a higher-earning degree could make up to $4 million more in lifetime earnings than other college graduates, Mr. Carnevale said. Most of the top earners in the liberal arts end up matching only the bottom earners in science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2014 known as the STEM fields \u2014 and some will earn less than high school graduates who have vocational skills, like welders and mechanics.The average salary for new graduates who majored in humanities \u2014 including French literature \u2014 is projected to increase slightly from last year to $46,065, up from $45,042. Although data is more limited, these graduates seem to attract the most interest from employers in finance, insurance and real estate, the survey found. The average for social science majors is $46,585.But informing students better is one thing. Penalizing certain majors in the form of reduced funding is another.Not surprisingly, humanities professors were among the most vocal critics of Mr. Bevin\u2019s remarks. In an op-ed article last month in The Lexington Herald-Leader, Jeffrey N. Peters, who teaches French literature at the University of Kentucky, noted that Mr. Bevin graduated from the liberal arts university Washington and Lee with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Japanese and East Asian Studies after studying abroad in Japan.\u201cI would like to thank Bevin for drawing on that formative experience to remind Kentuckians during his Tuesday budget presentation that the study of world languages, literatures and cultures is a valuable pursuit that has led countless college students to successful careers in education, business, international relations, the arts and \u2014 as his own story demonstrates \u2014 public service,\u201d Mr. Peters wrote.Other critics expressed concerns about allowing government officials to pick work force winners and losers.\u201cWe are not good at predicting what jobs are going to be required in five years and 10 years down the road,\u201d said Debra Humphreys, a senior vice president at the Association of American Colleges and Universities. She worries that underfunding the humanities will not only undermine educational quality but be bad economic policy. \u201cYou run a huge risk when you say you are going to divert money from this major to that major.\u201dThe question of whether to reward colleges for turning out STEM graduates or for higher job placement rates has generated a lot of debate in Tennessee, where all of the state\u2019s higher education funding is tied to various performance measures, said Russ Deaton, the interim executive director of Tennessee\u2019s Higher Education Commission.\u201cI\u2019m not sure I trust myself to decide which degree programs or which fields deserve that premium and what that premium should be,\u201d Mr. Deaton said.\u201cA lot of the feedback we get from employers is not only about the necessity of technical skills, but the soft skills as well \u2014 the ability to think creatively, to work in groups, things that you traditionally get in the liberal arts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as STEM is valued and worthy of incentives and everything else is not.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @PatcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Roadblocks on the Route From Wall Street to Washington", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byDealBookFor some at the top of Wall Street, there is only one job considered better: a top job in Washington.Every presidential election cycle, financiers jockey for position among the candidates to become their biggest fund-raisers and, more important, close advisers.The conventional view is that these investment bankers and money managers enter politics to influence policy. But that\u2019s only part of it. For Wall Street\u2019s elite bundlers and consiglieres, the endgame is a senior role in a White House administration \u2014 the most prestigious of which is secretary of the Treasury.Speculation has long been rampant that a small group of Wall Street executives, including Hamilton E. James of Blackstone Group, Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock and Roger C. Altman of Evercore, would love the top Treasury post if Hillary Clinton won the election. Warren E. Buffett once suggested that Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase should be Treasury secretary.But this little parlor game has a big problem: No matter who wins the presidency this fall, chances are slim that anyone connected to Wall Street has a prayer of securing a top post in the administration.Over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton was asked whether she would appoint a Wall Street executive as Treasury secretary. She did everything but say the word no.\u201cI think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury secretary,\u201d than Wall Street, she said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Chuck Todd pressed her about whether the country can \u201chave a Treasury secretary who isn\u2019t familiar with how Wall Street works,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd I say this because I think there\u2019s so much distrust right now of Wall Street.\u201d She replied, \u201cYes, there is, there is.\u201dOf course, Mrs. Clinton is battling accusations from Bernard Sanders that she is too cozy with Wall Street, citing as an example her accepting $675,000 for three speeches made to Goldman Sachs. \u201cThe business model of Wall Street is fraud,\u201d Mr. Sanders has said repeatedly on the campaign trail. If Mr. Sanders wins the election, it\u2019s hard to imagine him appointing anyone to his cabinet who has any connection to a bank beyond having a checking account.The Republican candidates, if you take their campaign rhetoric at face value, seem hardly more inclined to name a Wall Street executive to a senior finance post. Ted Cruz has spent much of his campaign criticizing the banks and trying to distance himself from his wife\u2019s job at Goldman Sachs. He has gone so far as to say that if a major financial institution like Bank of America required a government bailout to avoid collapse, he\u2019d let it fail.Even Donald J. Trump, perhaps the candidate with the closest ties to Wall Street, has adopted a populist tone during his campaign and has described a bit of a love-hate relationship with financiers.\u201cThe hedge fund guys didn\u2019t build this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said last fall, as he talked about his plan to tax them more. \u201cThese are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky. And, by the way, when the market collapses, like it is now, the market is going down, they\u2019re losing a fortune.\u201d He added, \u201cThe hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They\u2019re making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of naming his friend Carl Icahn, a hedge fund manager, to run the Treasury. Mr. Icahn\u2019s reply? \u201cNo way.\u201d When Mr. Trump mentioned Henry Kravis, the private equity billionaire, as a possible Treasury secretary, Mr. Kravis said at a conference, \u201cThat was scary when he said that.\u201dBut in recent years, Wall Street executives have either shied away from working in Washington or been impeded by lawmakers hostile to their nominations.Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, and former chief financial officer of Morgan Stanley, was up for a deputy secretary position at Treasury three years ago but pulled out of the running, in part to avoid the harsh spotlight of the confirmation process. Antonio Weiss, a senior executive at the investment bank Lazard, withdrew his name after Senator Elizabeth Warren threatened to block his confirmation; he instead became a special adviser to the Treasury secretary, a job that did not require Senate confirmation.In a post-financial-crisis world, most bankers have avoided Washington either by choice or by default. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m suited to it,\u201d Mr. Dimon told me in 2012 when I asked him whether he would be a good Treasury secretary. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe a Wall Street C.E.O. could get confirmed.\u201dThat remains the prevailing view.The DealBook column on Tuesday, about the diminished possibility that a Wall Street banker will be named Treasury secretary in the next administration, erroneously attributed a distinction to Henry M. Paulson Jr. While he was the last long-serving Wall Street executive to be appointed Treasury secretary, he was not the last Wall Street executive to serve in that post. The current Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, who spent nearly his entire career as a government official in Washington, was an executive at Citigroup from 2006 to 2008.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abbott to Acquire Alere, a Maker of Medical Diagnostics Tests", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe want to offer our customers the best and broadest diagnostics solutions,\u201d Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive of Abbott, said in the statement. \u201cAlere helps us do that.\u201dAlere, which was founded in 2001, said it delivered more than 1.4 billion tests last year, producing annual sales of $2.5 billion \u2014 half of that from the United States. The company provides tests for H.I.V., tuberculosis, malaria and dengue, as well as the flu and strep.Some analysts were concerned that the acquisition of Alere could weigh on Abbott\u2019s growth. In the 12 months through December, Alere\u2019s revenue declined 3.6 percent, according to estimates compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s Capital IQ, while Abbott\u2019s increased 0.8 percent over that period.Abbott will pay $56 a common share of Alere, and it will assume, or refinance, $2.6 billion of Alere\u2019s net debt. Abbott also plans to finance the deal with debt, Brian J. Blaser, the executive vice president of diagnostics products at Abbott, said in the company\u2019s conference call on Monday.The offer represents a premium of more than 50 percent over Alere\u2019s closing stock price on Friday, and its shares were up 45 percent in morning trading on Monday.Thomas C. Freyman, Abbott\u2019s executive vice president of finance and administration, said in the call that the process for acquiring Alere was \u201ccompetitive.\u201d It was the \u201cfair premium\u201d and the \u201cstrategic fit\u201d that allowed Abbott to prevail, he said.Point-of-care tests represented about 10 percent of Abbott\u2019s total diagnostic sales of $4.6 billion last year. In addition to diagnostics, Abbott also makes medical devices, nutritionals and generic pharmaceuticals.The transaction will be accretive to Abbott\u2019s earnings per share when the deal closes, and is expected to add about 12 to 13 cents a share in 2017 and more than 20 cents a share in 2018. The combined company is expecting to extract $500 million in savings by 2019 through sales and operational benefits.Medical testing was not the only health care sector announcing a deal on Monday. The Stryker Corporation agreed to acquire Sage Products, which makes products for the intensive care unit, from the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners for $2.8 billion in cash.As a result of the deal, which the company said was accretive, Stryker raised its full-year 2016 adjusted earnings guidance by $0.05 a share to a range of $5.55 to $5.75 a share.Evercore is providing financial advice to Abbott, while JPMorgan Chase is working with Alere. Kirkland & Ellis is providing legal counsel to Abbott, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore is serving Alere.JPMorgan also served as Stryker\u2019s financial adviser, while Barclays worked with Sage.

{"Headline": "Dividends, Wall Street\u2019s Battered Status Symbol", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cInvestors look at that record, and they count on it,\u201d said Douglas J. Skinner, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cAfter a while, the dividend becomes sacrosanct.\u201dCompanies hate to cut dividends because they know that such an announcement would hurt their reputation with investors. Yet in a difficult financial environment, startlingly large numbers of corporations are slashing dividends anyway. That trend is disturbing.Look at the statistics: In 2015, 394 companies trimmed dividends, according to data provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. That was a whopping 38 percent increase over the previous year, and it was 23 percent more than in 2008, an awful time for the stock market and for the economy.They were happy exceptions. A host of other major companies \u2014 like Alcoa, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Macy\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 decided, under considerable pressure, that it was time to capitulate. They all cut their dividends.You may recall 2009 with a shudder. The market hit bottom that March, before beginning a long climb upward. That upward trajectory has now been interrupted. And the ebb and flow of dividends is an important part of the story.The situation today isn\u2019t nearly as dire for most companies as it was in 2009, and the stock market and the economy generally appear to be much stronger. Nor are all companies cutting dividends. In fact, over all, corporate dividends rose last year and, barring a severe economic shock, they are likely to do so in 2016. So are stock buybacks, the other widely used method of returning cash to investors. But as a market indicator, a wave of dividend cuts is an indication that many companies are troubled.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re in another 2009, or that the bottom is falling out,\u201d said Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. But it\u2019s hard to put a positive spin on it: So many companies cutting dividends is not a good thing.\u201dPockets of pain have become more apparent, especially in the energy and commodities sectors. Battered by falling oil prices, for example, ConocoPhillips and Anadarko Petroleum announced this month that they were cutting most of their dividends. And on Thursday, Rio Tinto, the Anglo-American mining giant, said that the prospects for commodity prices remained dim \u2014 and it, too, slashed its dividend.But he warned that others wouldn\u2019t be able to do the same: \u201cIn the volatile years, especially if you look at some of the high-paying dividend stocks today, I think you\u2019re going to see quite a few companies are going to have to lower their dividends.\u201dQuite a few are likely to cut their share buybacks, too. Depending on the size of their cash hoards, companies tend to turn buybacks on and off much more rapidly than they do dividends. For example, the value of buybacks exceeded that of dividends in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index before the financial crisis, but by the second quarter of 2009, that reversed. With the return of corporate prosperity, buybacks surged and by 2015, the value of buybacks was roughly 50 percent greater than that of dividends.That is a puzzle for academics. As a fundamental economic proposition the two modes of payouts amount to the same thing, Professor Skinner said.While there may be different practical consequences, both return economic value to shareholders. Yet the reality is that investors tend to drive up the shares of companies that raise dividends and punish companies that reduce them, while reacting much less to shifts in buybacks.The explanation may come from signaling behavior. When a company can keep its dividends steady, it may be signaling that it is managed more deftly and more conservatively than its peers. At least that\u2019s often the way it\u2019s seen in the markets.By the same token, investors may see buybacks as inherently transitory, so they don\u2019t get as riled when they lose them. In any case, as a practical matter, buybacks are often a more flexible tool for corporate financial officers. Consider ExxonMobil\u2019s moves early this month. They were drawn from the classic corporate finance playbook. It said that dividends were a \u201cpriority,\u201d and unlike Conoco, it said that it would maintain them and preserve its ability to make important capital investments during the oil price downturn.Once the biggest practitioner of buybacks in the stock market, Exxon has been paring them for the last two years, and announced that it would reduce them more radically to conserve cash. Exxon\u2019s shares have actually risen slightly this month while Conoco\u2019s have fallen sharply.For investors, these corporate maneuvers are just another indication that the stock market is operating under duress. In the long run, it is the financial and earnings strength of companies that matters, not whether they are paying dividends or buying back shares. The problem, of course, is determining whether a specific company is merely being prudent by paring payouts, or whether it is revealing that its business is seriously troubled.If you have long-term investments in broad index funds, and not in individual stocks, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about particular companies, and even if dividend cuts portend market declines, you can prosper if you can endure some pain.Even with recent declines, the S.&P. 500 index has returned more than 200 percent \u2014 17.5 percent annualized \u2014 since the market bottom of March 2009. Indexes of stocks with high and stable dividends did even better. That may be because steady dividend payers are more solid. It may simply be that investors prefer dividends. We don\u2019t really know.But people who have truly relied on dividends for income may have to face a sad truth. Dividends aren\u2019t bonds, and they may be cut at a company\u2019s discretion. So love dividends if you must. Just don\u2019t count on them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sushil Koirala, Ex-Premier of Nepal Who Fought for Democracy, Dies at 77", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byHis doctor, Karbir Nath Yogi, said the cause was respiratory failure from pneumonia. Mr. Koirala had survived tongue and lung cancer, Dr. Yogi said.Mr. Koirala was leader of the Nepali Congress, the country\u2019s largest political party, which is considered the founding party of democratic Nepal. In a country that had been ruled by a monarchy for 239 years, he fought for democracy throughout his political career.His death left uncertain the future leadership of the Nepali Congress, which is currently in the opposition, as it prepares for a general convention in March.As prime minister, Mr. Koirala presided over the adoption of the Constitution, which established seven provinces and sought to reinforce Nepal as a secular, democratic republic while protecting religion. Long delayed, it emerged from a tumultuous period in Nepalese history, including a decade-long civil war led by Maoists, the overthrow of the monarchy in 2008 and a devastating earthquake in April.The Constitution was adopted over the objections of the country\u2019s minorities, whose leaders say that a system of proportional representation in Parliament and the size and borders of the provinces have conspired to deny them a political voice. Demonstrations erupted in particular in the minority Madhesi community in Nepal\u2019s southern plains.The Madhesis have ethnic and cultural ties to India, and at the major trade crossing between the two countries there were sit-ins that blocked fuel deliveries into Nepal, creating severe fuel shortages.Nepali officials blamed India, saying it had sanctioned an unofficial blockade in response to the way the Constitution had been pushed through the legislature. India said the sit-ins had made the passage of fuel impossible.On Monday, Madhesi leaders called off the sit-in after Parliament passed an amendment to the Constitution addressing some of their demands.Mr. Koirala was born in the city of Biratnagar, in eastern Nepal, to one of Nepal\u2019s most influential political families. Sources differ on his date of birth, but a nephew, Ramesh Bhandari said he was born in December 1938.Mr. Koirala took an interest in acting before entering politics. Inspired by the anti-monarchy movement, he joined the Nepali Congress in 1954. He was related to B.P. Koirala, the Nepali Congress\u2019s founding father and its first elected prime minister.Mr. Koirala spent 16 years in political exile in India after King Mahendra expelled all anti-monarchy protesters in 1960. He was jailed for six years in India and Nepal after he and fellow party members hijacked a plane flying from Biratnagar to Kathmandu and forced it to land in India. Mr. Koirala was arrested, but the others made off with three million Indian rupees to finance the party.Mr. Koirala became the president of the Nepali Congress in 2010 and was elected prime minister in February 2014. He had agreed to step down after the Constitution was adopted, to pave the way for new leadership, but had a change of heart and decided to seek re-election in October. He was defeated by K.P. Sharma Oli, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal.Mr. Koirala, who had a staid demeanor and lived austerely, never married. His survivors include his brothers Bijaya and Ashok and his sisters Abhadevi Sharma and Sashi Sharma.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Citigroup to Sell Retail Units in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Citigroup announced on Friday that it would sell its retail businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, countries in which it has been trading for more than a century.Determined to quash any perceptions that the move was related to the struggling economies of these South American nations, the bank said it was streamlining its operations so it could place greater emphasis on its corporate arm, which is larger and more profitable.Just 10 percent of Citigroup\u2019s operations in the three countries involve its retail businesses, according to rough estimates at Citi Latin America. Its share of the countries\u2019 retail banking markets is less than 5 percent, while its share of their corporate banking markets is about 15 percent to 20 percent.Citigroup wants to sell the retail divisions, where local banks and competitors like Santander R\u00edo are stronger, so that it has more capital to expand corporate lending, an area that it already leads. The retail divisions include about $6 billion of assets.\u201cWe allocate our resources where they can generate the best possible returns for our shareholders,\u201d Michael L. Corbat, Citigroup\u2019s chief executive, said in statement.Argentina was the first country in which Citigroup opened a branch outside of the United States, in 1914, although it is unclear whether that branch offered retail services. The group has often drawn attention to this history in local marketing campaigns. It expanded into Brazil in 1915 and Colombia in 1916.The move fits into Citigroup\u2019s broader maneuvers to shrink its international retail banking division, according to Nicholas Watson, who monitors Latin America for Teneo Intelligence, a global advisory firm based in New York.But sweeping market-oriented economic changes by the country\u2019s new president, Mauricio Macri, which were intended to foster a healthy investment climate, are being viewed favorably by banks. The steps include a devaluation and the scrapping of export taxes and currency controls. Citigroup is looking to strengthen its corporate arm so it is in place to pounce on the opportunity to provide financing to a potential wave of investors and public institutions, said Juan Pablo Ronderos, an economist at Abeceb, an economic analysis firm in Buenos Aires.Citigroup has not spoken yet to potential buyers for the retail businesses and closing out a deal could take most of the year. It has 71 branches in Argentina and 71 in Brazil.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Reaches Debt Deal With 2 Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byArgentina has offered to pay $6.5 billion to a group of hedge funds holding bonds it defaulted on 14 years ago in a historic effort by the nation to put a bitter legal battle behind it.Montreux Partners and Dart Management, two of the hedge funds, have accepted the proposal, which would pay three-quarters of a $9 billion claim on defaulted bonds, according to emailed statements from Daniel A. Pollack, a court-appointed arbiter, and Argentina\u2019s finance ministry.The news comes after a week of high-profile talks between senior Argentine government officials and principals at a group of holdout hedge funds, so named for their refusal to partake in Argentina\u2019s debt restructurings after its 2001 default and who have sought billions in bond repayments, according to a statement from Mr. Pollack.Noticeably absent from the deal on Friday was NML Capital, a hedge fund owned by the billionaire Paul E. Singer, which has led the holdouts in years of litigation. Without the agreement of all six hedge funds, Argentina will continue to be locked out of international markets and foreign investment.\u201cThe negotiations were intense, but civil, and I am pleased to report that enormous progress has been made,\u201d Mr. Pollack said.The legal fight has pitted a larger group of hedge funds against Argentina, a nation of about 43 million people. They have sought Argentina\u2019s assets around the world, at one point seizing a navy ship in Ghana as collateral. At a low point of the standoff, neither side would talk to the other.Earlier this week, Argentina struck a deal to pay $1.35 billion to another group of holdouts \u2014 Italian investors who had held onto defaulted bonds, paving the way for an agreement with some of the hedge funds. The fact that Argentina has been able to settle with some of the holdout hedge funds could apply pressure on the remaining hedge funds to resolve the dispute.The legal battle harks back to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on billions of dollars in debt. Bondholders were given two chances to exchange the defaulted bonds for new, cheaper ones over the years, but some rejected the restructurings.\u201cThis litigation has gone on for nearly 15 years, since the original Argentine default of 2001, and the proposal by Argentina is a historic breakthrough, which, if the conditions mentioned above are met, will allow Argentina to return to the global financial markets to raise much needed capital,\u201d Mr. Pollack said. He added that he hoped the other hedge funds and Argentina would be able to \u201cresolve their differences\u201d and also reach an agreement.Mauricio Macri, Argentina\u2019s newly elected president, has pledged to resolve the dispute with the hedge funds as part of a broader plan to reform his nation\u2019s economy.It is unclear how soon Argentina would complete the offer, which requires congressional approval. Argentina\u2019s Congress does not reconvene from a summer recess until March 1, although Mr. Macri has called special sessions in the Senate for Feb. 11 to expedite his appointment of Supreme Court judges and other officials.If there is significant progress between the government and creditors over the proposal in the coming days, there is a chance the offer may also be debated during these special sessions, said Juan Cruz D\u00edaz, a director at the Cefeidas Group, a political risk analysis firm in Buenos Aires.Mr. Macri does not have a majority in either the Senate or the lower house, but he was bolstered this week when a group of lawmakers once loyal to former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a political opponent of Mr. Macri, defected from her bloc in the lower house. They have promised to be collaborative, making Mr. Macri\u2019s negotiations to pass pivotal legislation an easier task. Mr. Macri has also been maneuvering to gather cross-party support in the Senate.Dart Management could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Elliott Management, which owns NML Capital, declined to comment. Michael Straus, a principal of Montreux Partners, said he had nothing to add to the publicly issued statements of the special master and the government of Argentina.Senators respond largely to the interests of state governors. Across the political spectrum, these governors are keen to increase funding by issuing their own debt in international markets, Mr. D\u00edaz said. \u201cI believe Macri is very close to securing congressional support for the offer,\u201d he added.Twelve years ago, NML Capital sued Argentina seeking full repayment \u2014 principal and interest. In 2011, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that whenever Argentina paid one group of bondholders, it would also have to pay the holdouts.The deal with New York creditors hit rock bottom under Ms. Kirchner, after the country defaulted on its debt again in 2014, after it failed to make a $539 million interest payment on newer discounted bonds.\u201cDefault is not a mere technical condition, but rather a real and painful event that will hurt real people,\u201d Mr. Pollack said at the time, after failed attempts to get NML Capital and the administration of Ms. Kirchner to sit down together.The move left Argentina largely cut off from the international markets. Mr. Macri\u2019s pledge helped usher in new talks and raised hopes for an agreement.In addition to senior government officials, Luis Caputo, Argentina\u2019s finance secretary, traveled to Manhattan this week for the talks. It was not always apparent that a deal would emerge. To start, Mr. Macri promised to publicly announce a proposal for the hedge funds this week. But those holdouts had requested that Argentina sign a nondisclosure agreement to not to reveal the details of the negotiations publicly.Another sticking point for both sides has been just how much interest Argentina would be willing to pay to the hedge funds.Earlier this year, Argentina\u2019s economic minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, foreshadowed potential friction between the two parties. Speaking at a news conference with reporters in Buenos Aires, he estimated that the debt owed to holdout bondholders \u2014 including NML Capital and the Italian bondholders \u2014 totaled $20 billion, adding that 60 percent of that amount fell under New York jurisdiction.For holdout creditors who want Argentina to pay significantly more in interest than on the original amount of the debt owed, Mr. Prat-Gay said, \u201cYou\u2019d perhaps have to go before Christ to get a such a big return.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Those props have now eroded.Mr. Sanders translates stagnant middle-class incomes and rising inequality into outrage against Wall Street \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d who prosper in a global economy under rules they\u2019ve written. His message is attractive to liberals, especially young Democrats facing large college debt and lackluster earning prospects.\u201cTonight we serve notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy,\u201d he declared in New Hampshire. \u201cWe will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top 1 percent.\u201dMr. Trump voices similar sentiments, his own wealth notwithstanding. He invokes his experience as a donor to highlight campaign finance corruption, accuses hedge fund managers of dodging taxes and joins Mr. Sanders in denouncing various industries for what he says are undeserved profits.But Mr. Trump\u2019s message, targeted toward the swelling Republican ranks of working-class whites, points more toward external threats on immigration and trade policies.\u201cWe are going to make America great again,\u201d he declared as the returns rolled in. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to do it the old-fashioned way. We\u2019re going to beat China, Japan. We\u2019re going to beat Mexico at trade. We\u2019re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s challenge will be to maintain his edge after the field of rivals narrows, allowing the large cadre of anti-Trump Republicans to coalesce their support.The hurdle facing Mr. Sanders is largely demographic. Hillary Clinton begins the next phase with a big advantage among African-American and Hispanic voters, who represent a much bigger share of the Democratic electorate than in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire.Yet regardless of how the candidates finish, their populist messages will continue to influence the White House race \u2014 and President Obama\u2019s final year in office.Mr. Trump has offered a tax-cut plan that, like those of his Republican rivals, would provide disproportionate benefits to the wealthy. But his call for higher taxes on income for hedge-fund managers and for curbs on the influence of campaign donors has lent bipartisan legitimacy to longstanding Democratic arguments. So has his support for competitive bidding to cut government health care payments to pharmaceutical companies.All four winners in the opening Iowa and New Hampshire contests \u2014 Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz \u2014 have opposed Mr. Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. That diminishes the likelihood that Congress will approve it this year.Business and political leaders backing the trade deal question how it could stall as the economy grows steadily enough to drop unemployment below 5 percent. The answer lies in the anxiety revealed by New Hampshire election exit polls: Fewer than one in five voters in both the Democratic and Republican contests believe their families are getting ahead financially.That\u2019s enough to make a voter angry.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rubio Tax Cut Got Bigger and Bigger", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byTax PolicyIf you want an insight into what Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s instincts on policy are, just look at what happened when he got his hands on another senator\u2019s tax cut plan: It became about three times larger, and way more tilted toward the rich.In March 2015, Mr. Lee teamed up with Mr. Rubio to develop a revised version of the tax plan. As Mr. Rubio got involved, the price started to soar. The plan was rebranded as the Economic Growth and Family Fairness Tax Plan, and as usual, \u201ceconomic growth\u201d was code for large tax cuts for owners of capital.The original Lee tax plan imposed a 20 percent tax rate on income from capital gains and dividends; the Rubio-Lee plan cut this rate to zero. Rubio-Lee also introduced new tax breaks for businesses: a cut in the corporate tax rate to 25 from 35, and a preferential rate of 25 percent for business income taxed through the individual tax code.Rich people with capital income weren\u2019t the only big winners under the Rubio-Lee plan; there was also a large new benefit for people with low incomes. The original Lee plan had included a $2,000-per-person tax credit replacing the standard deduction, but you could take the credit only against income tax you actually owed. The Rubio-Lee plan generously revised this credit to be \u201crefundable,\u201d meaning it could lead to a negative income tax bill for people with low incomes.The expansiveness of the Rubio-Lee plan led James Pethokoukis, an economic policy researcher at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, to invoke Oprah Winfrey. \u201cShe was like, \u2018You get a car, you get a car.\u2019 Well this is \u2018You get a tax cut, you get a tax cut,\u2019 \u201d he said in an interview last spring.But Mr. Rubio apparently was not yet done with his Oprah act.In October, now running for president, Mr. Rubio announced his own stand-alone version of the tax plan, with a crucial change. His joint plan with Mr. Lee had included just two tax brackets for regular income: 15 percent on the first $150,000 for married couples, and 35 percent on income above that. Mr. Rubio is now calling for three tax rates instead of two: 15 percent on the first $150,000, 25 percent on the next $150,000, and 35 percent only on income above that.This change avoids a pitfall of the Rubio-Lee plan: It would have imposed higher marginal tax rates on many taxpayers with high but nonastronomical incomes. If they did not have children to take tax credits against, they would have seen little benefit from Rubio-Lee. Adding the 25 percent bracket allows Mr. Rubio to play Ms. Winfrey to this group as well.The tax cut has grown on all dimensions, at the top and at the bottom. Because of the partial refundability of the $2,000 tax credit, Mr. Rubio\u2019s plan would cut taxes for the bottom fifth of taxpayers by $251 a year on average, compared with just $79 under Mr. Lee\u2019s original plan. (To calculate this figure, the Tax Policy Center assumed Mr. Rubio would allow the credit to be applied against Social Security payroll taxes, as Mr. Rubio and Mr. Lee had already proposed for their child credit.) Mr. Rubio is proposing a nearly 2 percent boost in annual income for this group.But Mr. Rubio\u2019s biggest tax cuts, by far, are at the top. His new plan would raise incomes for the top one-thousandth of taxpayers by 8.9 percent \u2014 that is, an average tax cut of more than $900,000 per year \u2014 because of its sharp cuts in tax rates on business income and capital income.Of course, all that assumes Mr. Rubio could find a way to finance a 16 percent overall cut in federal taxes. Mr. Rubio is counting on strong economic growth, induced by his capital tax cuts, to pay for his plan to cut taxes sharply on nearly everyone. But recent experience with tax cuts on capital income \u2014 no apparent economic boost came from the Bush tax cuts of 2003 \u2014 does not suggest that will be possible.Advertisement"}

They use 10,000 gallons of paint a year. It is crazy that people repaint a bridge all year \u2026 The Golden Gate Bridge, which is orange, is the best-known and best-loved bridge in the world. It is best known because it is bold and courageous and unusual and even strange. It is best loved because it is bold and courageous and unusual and even strange.\u2014 Dave Eggers, \u201cThis Bridge Will Not Be Gray\u201dAwe.American infrastructure is deferred home maintenance on a massive scale. We just keep putting it off until something major \u2014 and often catastrophic \u2014 happens, and then it ends up costing twice as much as it would have had we taken care of it proactively. This is a bad strategy \u2014 yet it\u2019s the strategy that seems to define United States infrastructure.A century later, we\u2019ve lost our collective faith in the power of great projects like the Golden Gate, not to mention our trust in the government to fix a pothole on time and on budget, let alone create an inspiring bridge. How can we restore that faith in possibility?Let\u2019s take some inspiration from Atlanta \u2014 yes, Atlanta! \u2014 which is putting the finishing touches on the Atlanta BeltLine, one of the largest, most wide-ranging urban redevelopment programs currently underway in the United States.The BeltLine is a 22-mile loop of old railroads encircling downtown Atlanta that connects 45 neighborhoods. The project repurposes this historic rail corridor as a new transit greenway, featuring streetcars that connect to existing rail and 11 miles and counting of trails for running, walking and biking. Mostly underutilized industrial properties surround it. These are now becoming perfect sites for new mixed-use, dense projects, including 5,600 units of affordable housing.Ryan and his expanding group of partners were able to develop an unprecedented community-oriented grass-roots movement around the project, which got the attention of other elected officials, regional planners and developers. With their support, the project took on a life of its own, expanding beyond transit, trail and economic development to include new parks, affordable housing, an arboretum and more. This further empowered political leadership, who then enabled the creation of a tax increment finance district in 2005 and a new agency assigned to build it.The timing and politics were right. Atlanta, which had been losing population until the 1990s, was growing faster than any of the suburban neighborhoods. \u201cPeople saw the change coming, saw new apartments coming, saw it was bringing a better economy to the city, so they were excited about the project,\u201d says Gravel. \u201cThe BeltLine became the tool for that change. It would help protect quality of life in the face of growth. In the south or west, where there was nothing new, this was a great new source of investment.\u201cBeltLine was a compelling vision,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a trail, wasn\u2019t just a transit line. It was a catalyst. Everybody could be part of it. It tapped into the ambition that the city had for itself, that it could be a great city.\u201dThis level of enthusiasm seemed utterly foreign to me, living as I do in the Bay Area, which is having trouble coming to any agreement on how to manage growth and address change (and the success or failure of that growth has a lot to do with investing in not just new, but the right, infrastructure). Nimbyism and dissent are ascendant. Gravel\u2019s description of working together toward a common goal was enviable \u2014 so full of awe, so short on arguing.\u201cIt\u2019s an added layer of beauty to the BeltLine that it is built on railroad,\u201d Gravel says. \u201cAtlanta is a railroad town, it\u2019s why it exists. It\u2019s a loop, it ties people together across divides and there\u2019s something beautiful about it.\u201dYet engineers, planners and policy makers tend to focus on wonky stuff like percentage of parkland per person. They\u2019re awash in acronyms like V.M.T. (vehicle miles traveled), too reliant on planning terms like modeshare that don\u2019t resonate with the general public. These things may be useful in measuring the metrics of a city, but they sure don\u2019t get to the reasons people want to live there. You don\u2019t move to one city because it has 35 percent more parkland per person than another city. You move there because you fall in love with it, or with someone there, or you get a job there, or your family is from there. We need to address metrics, but the bigger goal is to make cities that we love.In an age of cost overruns, project delays, safety risks and the other, seemingly infinite obstacles to infrastructure, this all might sound awfully reductive, even na\u00efve. But keeping our eye on what\u2019s possible is certainly as important as fixating on what isn\u2019t.A writer on architecture and design and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Kids Sell Lemonade. He Starts a Chain.", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byPrototypeTwo summers ago, Jack Bonneau started a lemonade stand to earn some cash. Instead of setting it up on a street corner in his Broomfield, Colo., neighborhood, he and his father, Steve, came up with a more ambitious plan. Jack, then 8, would peddle cups of lemonade at the local farmers\u2019 market throughout the summer.The strategy was a success.\u201cI had sales of around $2,000, and my total profit was $900,\u201d Jack said, adding that the experience increased his confidence in school. He also enjoyed learning \u201cfinancial literacy,\u201d by which he meant \u201cadding and subtracting, and profit and loss, and subtracting expenses from revenue, and just learning about margins, and all of that stuff.\u201dThe Bonneaus also recruited a sales team. Other children eager to earn a buck, and whose parents saw this as a good learning opportunity, volunteered for shifts at Jack\u2019s Stands.Jack was excited to teach other children what he had learned. He taught them how to operate the stand, and at the end of each shift, he showed them how to count money and calculate profits and losses. The children, ranging in age from 7 to 11, walked away with tips and a cut of the profits, usually $30 to $50.Jack, now 10, is among thousands of children in the Denver area who have enrolled in courses at the Young Americans Center for Financial Education or have taken out loans from Young Americans Bank. The center teaches financial literacy and personal finance to people ages 6 to 21. It also runs entrepreneurship programs at 420 schools in Colorado and runs a summer camp for children in second through sixth grade.When he was 6, Jack got his first account at the bank, which offers checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, lines of credit, credit cards and business loans to people 21 and under. It charges low service fees.Earning money was Jack\u2019s initial motivation for the stand because he longed for a $400 Lego Star Wars Death Star set that his father insisted he pay for himself. But there was an important nonfinancial perk to the project, too: \u201cIt was really fun,\u201d Jack said.From the start, Steve Bonneau wanted the lemonade stand to be a learning experience for Jack. Mr. Bonneau is a former nuclear engineer who has been an entrepreneur for more than 20 years. His current company, Buybak, buys and resells used consumer goods.\u201cWe wanted to make sure that Jack wasn\u2019t getting out the Country Time Lemonade, using cups we already had in our kitchen and ice from the refrigerator,\u201d Mr. Bonneau said. \u201cAnd then at the end of the day, whatever was sold was his profits, without taking out any expenses or learning the other side of it.\u201dEarly on, Mr. Bonneau taught his son business basics. Now that Jack is in fifth grade and studies seventh-grade math, the lessons are more advanced. Mr. Bonneau said he guided Jack through wholesale pricing, applying for a sales tax license and establishing business relationships.\u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative effort,\u201d Mr. Bonneau said of Jack\u2019s Stands, acknowledging that his son\u2019s age and the complexity of the business means there are things Jack is not yet capable of doing. These range from carrying and assembling the 40-pound wooden lemonade stands to solving business challenges like finding organic, locally made lemonade or meeting the requirements of new farmers\u2019 markets they work with.In 2015, sales for the business were $25,000. This year, it plans to add several new stands in the Denver metro area, and one in Detroit; this expansion will be financed by a crowdfunding campaign.A priority for the Warrens is to encourage and mentor other children. \u201cWhether it\u2019s business or sports, or whatever kids want to pursue, they can totally do it,\u201d Lily Warren said.So when Jack approached them a year ago to ask if he could carry their products at his lemonade stands, they agreed. They felt that his business ethos was similar to theirs, Ms. Warren said. When he showed or sold their products to other children, his message was: \u201c\u2018Hey, I\u2019m not the only kid out here doing this. You definitely can join this bandwagon,\u2019 \u201d she said.The bandwagon gained more momentum last winter when Jack set up two new stands in a crafts marketplace at a Littleton, Colo., shopping mall. One is a stand that sells apple cider and hot chocolate instead of lemonade, and the other, called Jack\u2019s Marketplace, features products made by other children.Sweet Bee Sisters and about eight other child-run businesses sold their wares at the marketplace stand during the holiday season. Two girls who started out selling apple cider and hot chocolate quickly caught the entrepreneurial bug and began making their own products \u2014 scarves, headbands and decorated picture frames and magnets \u2014 and selling them at Jack\u2019s Marketplace.Very young business owners have the advantage of abundant curiosity and resilience, traits coveted by older entrepreneurs. They\u2019re also \u201cyoung, ambitious, adorable,\u201d said Maura McInerney, program coordinator for the Young Americans Center for Financial Education. But their youth can be a liability. \u201cThey\u2019re not always taken seriously at first,\u201d she said.That hasn\u2019t been a problem for the entrepreneurs at the Jack\u2019s Marketplace stand in the shopping mall.

{"Headline": "No End to Scrutiny Over Millions Sent to Malaysian Leader\u2019s Accounts", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported by\u201cThe matter has been comprehensively put to rest,\u201d he said last week. \u201cIt is time for us to unite and move on.\u201dThat has not happened.\u201cIt\u2019s not logical at all,\u201d said Azral Shah, 28, a computer network analyst taking a cigarette break outside a Kuala Lumpur high-rise this week. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what is the true story, but most of the nation doesn\u2019t think that what they are telling us is true.\u201dThe attorney general, Mohamed Apandi Ali, said the largest sum in question, $681 million, was \u201ca personal donation\u201d from the Saudi royal family, most of which \u2014 $620 million \u2014 was later returned because it was not used.In Saudi Arabia, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that he accepted the attorney general\u2019s opinion that there had been no wrongdoing, but he also said that he did not think that the money had come from the Saudi government or that it was a political donation.\u201cIt is a private Saudi citizen, I believe, and the funds went to an investment in Malaysia,\u201d he said in an interview on Thursday.One member of the royal family and one associate of the family, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the money had come from a Saudi prince and confirmed that it was not a donation. The associate questioned the reported sum but said the funds were part of a business deal.The attorney general\u2019s decision shut down an investigation by Malaysia\u2019s anticorruption commission, leading the panel to seek a review of the ruling, and the country\u2019s former law minister filed suit to reverse it.The decision has not stopped international inquiries. Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States are investigating transactions involving the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. Mr. Najib set up the fund and is the chairman of its advisory board.The announcement said the Swiss were looking into several business deals between United Arab Emirates state-owned companies and 1MDB, as well as allegations involving a small oil company called PetroSaudi that carried out a joint venture with 1MDB.On Monday, Singapore said it had seized \u201ca large number of bank accounts\u201d in connection with the investigations.Opposition politicians in Malaysia have demanded that Mr. Apandi, the attorney general, prove that 1MDB was not used as Mr. Najib\u2019s political slush fund.The question for Mr. Apandi was \u201chow did he satisfy himself that, even if the funds deposited into the prime minister\u2019s personal bank accounts came from the mysterious Arab donor, the money did not originate from 1MDB?\u201d said Tony Pua, an opposition member of Parliament from the Democratic Action Party.Mr. Apandi has said that his office will cooperate with the Swiss inquiry, though some Malaysian officials complained that the Swiss announcement could strain bilateral ties and create bias in the news media. 1MDB says that it has not been contacted by foreign legal authorities, but it would cooperate with any investigation.But if Mr. Apandi\u2019s version of events is true, that raises other troubling questions.A political donation of $681 million, equal to about 2.6 billion Malaysian ringgit, would be an exorbitant sum in Malaysian politics. An American presidential campaign costs about $1 billion. Malaysia has less than a tenth the population of the United States.Such a large donation would not necessarily be illegal. Malaysian law restricts candidates for Parliament to about $50,000 a campaign, but there are no limits on spending by political parties or curbs on overseas funding.The funds arrived in 2013, when Mr. Najib\u2019s party, which has led Malaysia since its independence from Britain in 1957, faced a powerful election challenge. What some analysts have described as an orgy of campaign spending helped the party win a tight race.Members of Mr. Najib\u2019s cabinet have previously described the funds as political donations, and at least one prominent party member has acknowledged receiving funds from Mr. Najib.\u201cBy the very fact that his party members have admitted they got a lot of money from the prime minister to run their campaigns, it\u2019s an admission that they are privy to sources of funding, which they have not disclosed,\u201d said Terence Gomez, a professor at the University of Malaya who researches money in the nation\u2019s politics. \u201cNow it\u2019s been exposed, and we find out that a foreign country is supporting the prime minister and the party.\u201dAt the same time, the attorney general suggested that Mr. Najib did not need $681 million for the election since he returned most of it. Mr. Apandi did not say how, when or to whom the money was returned, nor what Mr. Najib did with the remaining $61 million.In his news conference, the attorney general also addressed another deposit in Mr. Najib\u2019s account, about $13 million that was transferred from SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1MDB now owned by the Finance Ministry, which Mr. Najib controls. Mr. Apandi said that there was no evidence Mr. Najib \u201chad any knowledge\u201d of the deposit.Mr. Najib has not commented on the transaction.Mr. Apandi raised more questions after he briefly waved a copy of his investigative report before reporters. Cameras flashed, photographs were scrutinized, and it appeared that an additional $8 million from SRC flowed into one of Mr. Najib\u2019s accounts in 2014.Neither the attorney general nor Mr. Najib have explained that transaction.\u201cThey\u2019ve stopped caring about whether the story makes any sense,\u201d said Ambiga Sreenevasan, a lawyer and former president of the Malaysian Bar Council. \u201cThey just want the image of closure.\u201dDespite public concerns, Mr. Najib seems to have consolidated his position, last year dismissing a deputy prime minister who raised questions about the 1MDB scandal. Likewise, Mukhriz Mahathir, the son of Mr. Mahathir and a leading critic of Mr. Najib, was ousted on Wednesday as the top official of a federal state, in what he called retribution for publicly criticizing Mr. Najib.But the slowing economy, the low price of oil and a recently introduced tax on goods and services as well as the continuing 1MDB scandal have dampened broader public support, said Ibrahim Suffian, director of the Merdeka Center, an independent polling agency in Malaysia. Mr. Najib is likely to face a tough challenge to retain his position in elections expected in 2018.Ben Hubbard contributed reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financing ChemChina\u2019s Bold Play for Syngenta", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsNever mind Frankenfoods: The China National Chemical Corporation\u2019s takeover of Syngenta will need Frankenfinancing.If successful, the Chinese company\u2019s near-$44 billion purchase of Syngenta, the world\u2019s top agribusiness company, would be a real milestone, even by the increasingly acquisitive standards of the People\u2019s Republic. It will also call for a monstrous funding package both in Switzerland, where Syngenta is based, and back home.ChemChina, as the company is known, is moving fast under its chairman, Ren Jianxin. Last year, he invested $7.7 billion in Italy\u2019s Pirelli. Already this year, he has taken a stake in Mercuria, the commodity trader, and acquired the German machinery maker KraussMaffei. Now, Mr. Ren is offering 480 Swiss francs a share for Syngenta. The outlay would total roughly $46 billion, including $2.6 billion of net debt.To get a sense of Mr. Ren\u2019s boldness, consider this: Thomson Reuters data records just a handful of cash takeovers that have topped $40 billion, including Anheuser-Busch, AT&T Wireless, Genentech, TXU and Alcan. And there have been just three $40-billion-plus deals involving private buyers: Dell-EMC, Heinz-Kraft and the disastrous leveraged buyout of the American utility TXU. Excluding acquisitions in Hong Kong, the Syngenta offer is also worth nearly as much as China\u2019s four biggest outbound takeovers to date combined.Though HSBC and Citic Bank are providing acquisition financing, the question is how to fund the deal in the long term. Syngenta itself could shoulder some of the burden. Analysts expect earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, for the coming year to total a little more than $2.8 billion. Cranking debt up to a buyout-style 6.5 times those earnings would let the target assume $15.8 billion more in bonds and loans. That looks doable, if not cheap. Seven-year bonds issued by Platform Specialty Products, a similarly indebted chemicals group, yield about 12 percent.That just leaves ChemChina needing to scrape together the remaining $28 billion to complete the deal, which values Syngenta at more than 16 times the pretax earnings. The group had cash of 29.8 billion yuan, or $4.5 billion, as of the end of September, and total debt of roughly 232 billion yuan, filings show. So it will need the help of China\u2019s big banks. These lenders in turn can tap the Shanghai bond market or wealthy individuals through so-called wealth management products. Banks will draw comfort from the fact that the buyer is wholly owned by China\u2019s central government. Even then, its financing package looks genetically modified.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Look Closely Before Leaping From a Steady but Unfulfilling Job", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byWealth MattersWITH bonus checks now sitting in bank accounts and the malaise of winter settling in over the holiday weekend, some people may be dreaming of leaving their career to follow a latent passion.For a dose of reality, though, consider the tale of DeJuan Stroud, a former Wall Street broker and compliance officer.Mr. Stroud said he had a true existential crisis sitting in a car late one night 20 years ago. After more than a decade working on Wall Street, he was miserable.\u201cEverything was negative,\u201d he said. \u201cA lawsuit. Brokers complaining. Clients losing money. It was that constant negative. It just began to wear you down. I couldn\u2019t imagine feeling fulfilled.\u201dBut he had four children and a wife who stayed home to care for them.\u201cMy wife and I sat down and said, \u2018Can we? Should we?\u2019\u201d Mr. Stroud said.They decided they could, and he gave up his well-paid job and put their modest savings at risk to turn a hobby \u2014 floral design, which he had learned from his grandmother growing up in Alabama \u2014 into a business.Now, two decades later, Mr. Stroud is one of the most sought-after floral and event designers in New York City.His is a success story. But there are big risks in following a similar path \u2014 giving up a regular salary and losing your savings for one; throwing away the security of a career is another. For those who go forward, the payoff may be more psychic than monetary, and they need to feel comfortable that the chance of a more modest lifestyle is worth it.\u201cWe have this myth that is still following us that you prepared for one career, you got a job in it and you stayed there for 30 years,\u201d said Helen Harkness, founder of Career Design Associates, near Dallas. \u201cWe\u2019re still dealing with that with midcareer people even though most know it\u2019s a dead myth.\u201dMyth or not, trading a well-paying, secure career for the chance to try something different is not an option for a lot of people, particularly for those who do not have wealth, or at least a hefty bank account, as a backstop.\u201cWe financed the business with some savings we had and a small-business loan guaranteed by our home,\u201d Mr. Stroud said. \u201cIt was kind of scary. But when you reach that point of, \u2018I can\u2019t do this another day,\u2019 you choose that fear over that misery.\u201dWhile most people take similar jobs at other companies, Dr. Harkness said, the executives who work with her firm have realized that jumping to another company will not satisfy them.\u201cThe people who come to me who have the easiest time are people who recognize this is an opportunity for them to gain what they didn\u2019t have before,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re accepting the fact that life will be better after this. It\u2019s their expectation. They don\u2019t doubt it, even though this is not an easy process.\u201dThose who stay put, Dr. Harkness said, may not realize the opportunity. But some are perfectionists, she said, paralyzed by trying to get everything right before moving.\u201cWhen you\u2019re changing careers, you can\u2019t be a perfectionist,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to get insight and counseling and then you have to take some risks. You have to identify that risk and be prepared to deal with it. Some people who have been very careful, they can\u2019t turn loose of that.\u201dRobert Cox, a former bond salesman, is on his second big switch. When he turned 40, in 2000, he left Wall Street to go into real estate in the Hamptons, the wealthy summer haven on Long Island. He and his wife bought and renovated homes. But in 2012, they divorced, and he began looking for another career change.He had been a vegan since 2000, and he said he struggled to find good, quick vegan food when he moved back to Manhattan. That gave him the idea for a fast vegan chain, VBurger, which opened its first restaurant in Manhattan last fall.Mr. Cox said his newest career was driven as much by a humanitarian aspect of not eating animals as it was about serving what he sees as an untapped niche in the fast-food world.\u201cI am mindful of the fact that restaurants don\u2019t always work out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have some sort of backup plan. I do have some reserves that I can fall back on, but I would breathe a lot more easily if it was profitable at a certain amount of time.\u201dFear of financial failure keeps many people from taking these risks.Mr. Stroud, who recently designed a wedding in Hawaii where the ceremony moved through a series of tents created to evoke the homes the couple owned or loved in Las Vegas, Paris, London and Hong Kong, said it wasn\u2019t clear for at least the first seven years that he was going to keep his business afloat. And he counsels others thinking of making a similar switch to be sure they understand the risks.\u201cCareer and financially, are you really at that place where you\u2019re that unhappy with what you\u2019re doing that the remembrance of that unhappiness keeps you pushing ahead?\u201d he said. \u201cIn 13 years on Wall Street, I interviewed with other firms and thought I\u2019d go somewhere else. But it was still the same unfulfilling day-to-day job.\u201dThat was how Kathy Andersen felt 16 years ago. She had risen quickly within Ford Motor in Australia and was earning a six-figure salary and living in a nice apartment in Sydney.\u201cI realized I was really suffering and not happy and I needed to make a change,\u201d she said.She sold most of her possessions and had enough money for six months of travel.In Miami, near the end of her trip, she heard about a nonprofit organization that helped children by teaching them sailing. She sailed, so she volunteered. That led to work in Haiti and eventually to the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard for graduate school.\u201cI needed to see life differently,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw it like a chessboard. If I made this move, I\u2019d get here. It gave me a sense of security. I was a planner.\u201d\u201cWhen I stopped, when I saw life as a piece of art that takes shape with each step we take, something happens that we can never plan for,\u201d she added.After years of working at various nonprofit groups, Ms. Andersen is now a life coach in South Florida where she helps people leave their jobs \u2014 or at least find something they can enjoy in their present career.\u201cPeople say, \u2018How could you leave your job? I could never do that,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMy work with people is to say, \u2018Start where you are and write down the things you want. It gets you to the things you need. Then it gets to what one thing could you do today.\u2019 \u201dThese are people for whom a second or third career has paid off \u2014 and who had the luxury of trading one highly paid job for another. That\u2019s not always the case.And even Mr. Stroud, who said he now earned far more than he ever did on Wall Street, struck a cautious note.\u201cMy wife and I say all the time, \u2018Thank goodness we didn\u2019t know what we didn\u2019t know,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt was truly such a jump.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a woman who left her job at Ford Motor in Australia to change careers.

{"Headline": "Seoul\u2019s Colonial Boomerang", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorWhile foreign media organizations praised the deal and a minority of South Koreans accepted it, there was a strong backlash here across the political spectrum. The main opposition Minjoo Party condemned \u201cPresident Park Geun-hye\u2019s complacent historical consciousness\u201d for calling on the public to accept the agreement. One survivor, speaking to the left-leaning outlet OhmyNews, was blunt, \u201cWe need to replace the president \u2014 that pro-Japanese collaborator\u2019s daughter, Park Geun-hye.\u201d Even some conservative papers normally supportive of Ms. Park grumbled that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s apology felt insincere. Protests continue at the Japanese Embassy.The reaction to the agreement from both the right and left shows how much the history of the colonial period continues to shape South Korea\u2019s domestic politics. Politicians and ideologues of all stripes have long fanned anti-Japanese sentiment simply to further their own agendas. They don\u2019t appear to care that this obsession with the past is holding their country back.South Korea has become an economic powerhouse, but much of the postwar era has been dominated by poverty and dictatorial rule. External entities like North Korea, the United States and Japan are routinely blamed for the nation\u2019s ills. But feelings toward Pyongyang and Washington are more complicated; the anti-Japanese sentiment, however, is shared by almost everyone and informs the national narrative: Korea\u2019s glory was thwarted by Japan, a morally and culturally inferior country.The anti-Japanese sentiment serves the left particularly well in discrediting the right. Many wartime collaborators morphed into pro-American, pro-business, anti-Communist figures in the post-independence era and became active in conservative politics. It\u2019s easy to make the charge \u2014 perhaps fairly \u2014 that today\u2019s conservatives and business elites are the biological and ideological offspring of collaborators.In an era when the occupiers forced Koreans to adopt Japanese names, Ms. Park\u2019s father, Gen. Park Chung-hee, who served in the Japanese Imperial Army, allegedly changed his name a second time to make it sound even more authentically Japanese. During the war, the father of Kim Moo-sung, the current leader of the governing Saenuri Party, was a collaborator who reportedly urged Koreans to make donations to finance Japan\u2019s war machine.This game of who-better-confronts-Japan contributes to the breakdown of our politics. While certain Japanese politicians provoke South Koreans by questioning established historical truths, Japan provides a convenient excuse for politicians to ignore more important matters.The opposition sunk Ms. Park\u2019s nominee for prime minister in 2014 for once remarking that the colonization of Korea was \u201cGod\u2019s will,\u201d and that Japan wasn\u2019t obliged to compensate comfort women, based on a 1965 bilateral treaty. Even though the nominee later withdrew under pressure, the government had to counter the accusation that he was pro-Japanese, which it did by spending 15 months investigating the man\u2019s grandfather simply to prove that he had fought for independence.The last general election in 2012 was also muddled by a focus on certain candidates\u2019 links to Japan. A ruling party candidate was grilled over the fact that, years ago, he had written that colonial-era Koreans \u201cmight have thought of the Japanese Empire as their fatherland.\u201d An opposition candidate, in turn, had his fitness to run for office questioned because he was the grandson of a collaborator. This unfortunate trend is expected to worsen in the run up to the general election in April.Other domestic issues are getting sidelined. The administration and opposition bicker over what the government really meant by offering to \u201csolve\u201d Tokyo\u2019s concerns over the memorial statue to comfort women in front of the Japanese embassy. South Korean media assailed Mr. Abe\u2019s insistence in Parliament on Jan. 18 that there had been no forcible recruitment of comfort women during the colonial era. Two survivors flew to Tokyo on Jan. 25 to argue for nullifying the deal. Again, more recriminations ensued.The victims of the colonial regime should continue to press their claims, and Japan ought to try making better apologies. There is ample evidence that the system was a crime against humanity. But after decades under a political class that has pointed its fingers at Japan for myriad problems, anti-Japanese sentiment has taken on a life of its own. South Korea stands in a perpetual state of heightened emotions. Its leaders constantly cater to these feelings, seemingly at the expense of all else. All that hate boomerangs to hurt South Koreans.

{"Headline": "With No Unified Refugee Strategy, Europeans Fall Back on Old Alliances", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byROME \u2014 Roughly five weeks ago, Donald Tusk, one of the European Union\u2019s most powerful political figures, issued a blunt warning to its 28 countries: Come up with a coherent plan to tackle the refugee crisis within two months, or risk chaos.Surprisingly, given the plodding pace of European Union policy making, many of Europe\u2019s national leaders are now moving swiftly, announcing tough new border policies and guidelines on asylum \u2014 even with three weeks remaining on the deadline set by Mr. Tusk, president of the European Council.The problem is that the leaders are not always adhering to European rules, possibly not sticking to international law and not acting with the unity envisioned by Mr. Tusk. In some cases, they instead seem to be reverting to historical alliances rather than maintaining the European Union\u2019s mantra of solidarity.Mr. Krastev added, \u201cThe basic question is, which country turns into a parking lot for refugees?\u201dFor many months, European Union officials, joined by Ms. Merkel, have tried to share the burden by distributing quotas of the refugees already in Greece and Italy to different member states. Many states have balked, and the program is largely paralyzed.European Union leaders also agreed to pay 3 billion euros, roughly $3.3 billion, to aid organizations in Turkey to help stanch the flow of migrants departing the Turkish coast for the Greek islands. But record numbers of migrants keep coming.Without an effective Europe-wide policy response, and facing growing public anger in many countries, Europe\u2019s national leaders have splintered, searching for allies.Only months ago, Austria, like Germany, symbolized Europe\u2019s welcoming embrace to Syrians and other refugees fleeing war and poverty. Now, Austria is defying European Union officials \u2014 and frustrating Ms. Merkel \u2014 by placing a cap on refugees.Austria also convened a meeting on Wednesday in Vienna with many of the Balkan states that last year had allowed migrants to cross their borders while traveling north toward Germany and Sweden.Poland and Hungary are also providing help to Macedonia. Earlier, police chiefs in Austria, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia established tighter rules for screening migrants.Taken together, these moves threaten to turn Greece into the so-called refugee parking lot. Already, the Greek police have had to relocate several thousand migrants from the border checkpoint with Macedonia to refugee centers on the outskirts of Athens.\u201cThis is not a Greek problem,\u201d said Megan E. Greene, chief economist for Manulife Asset Management and a longtime analyst of Europe.\u201cIt is a European problem, and it needs a European solution. We are seeing \u2018solidarity\u2019 go out the window.\u201dAnalysts say that if the deal struck this week in Austria becomes integrated into a broader European Union policy, with Macedonia effectively becoming the bloc\u2019s outer edge, it would redraw the external borders of the group. Greece would be left outside the bloc\u2019s de facto borders, despite being a European Union member. Yet Macedonia and Serbia, neither of which are members, would be inside.The European Union will hold a pivotal March 7 meeting with Turkey to discuss the flow of refugees. European leaders will then gather in Brussels on March 17-18 for a summit meeting intended to achieve a unified migration policy \u2014 the session that represents Mr. Tusk\u2019s deadline.Leaders like Ms. Merkel have long argued that migration demands a Europe-wide solution and is too big for any single country to adequately address. Yet it will not be easy.Hungary is now planning to hold a public referendum on whether to accept or reject refugees. Italy \u2014 which has been dealing with migration for years \u2014 is calling for the creation of so-called Eurobonds to finance the response to the migration crisis \u2014 even as Germany and other countries remain wary.Moreover, Ms. Merkel\u2019s own re-election campaign next year could be in doubt. She has criticized Austria and the other countries for acting outside European Union parameters, and for potentially isolating Greece. Yet a policy to tighten borders and stem the refugee flow could likely help her politically.\u201cFor Germany, it is vital to bring the numbers down,\u201d said Almut M\u00f6ller, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, and Alison Smale from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Carolina and Nevada Takeaways: Messages Get Results", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byDonald J. Trump came into South Carolina with momentum after a big win in New Hampshire \u2014 and he seemed to try his best to undercut himself. He attacked George W. Bush, a popular figure in the state, for his handling of terrorism and the Iraq war. He repeatedly picked fights with the well-liked Gov. Nikki R. Haley. He held forth on national television about his friendships with Howard Stern and Michael Jackson.All that may have cost him some support: Exit polls showed late-deciding voters were more likely to back other candidates. But Mr. Trump still finished 10 percentage points ahead of his nearest rivals.Republicans have been frustrated by Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming imperviousness to the usual rules of politics. But after he blundered and blustered his way to victory in South Carolina, it is clearer than ever: Nothing short of a broad onslaught is likely to derail him.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has long declined to go after Mr. Trump, and he did not shift into attack mode on Saturday. But he drew an implicit contrast with the man who has defined the Republican race with his heated language about immigration and Islamic terrorism.Standing with Ms. Haley, who is of Indian descent, and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who is black, Mr. Rubio sketched a tableau of the Republican Party as he might represent it. He promised to lead a conservative movement made up of the children of immigrants and single parents.It is unclear whether his vision for the party is one that its activist base, enamored so far of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Mr. Rubio, will embrace. Mr. Rubio won over a fairly upscale coalition \u2014 college graduates and relatively moderate conservatives \u2014 but as the race barrels toward Super Tuesday, he will need to do more than that.The fifth- and sixth-place finishers in South Carolina have no apparent path to winning the Republican nomination, but Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Ben Carson showed why their presence in the race remained significant.Mr. Kasich won a little less than 8 percent of the vote after campaigning in a moderate tone and stressing his Washington experience. He almost certainly drew support away from Mr. Rubio and Jeb Bush. As long as he persists in the race, he will be a roadblock for Mr. Rubio in middle-of-the-road primary states, where Mr. Trump might be vulnerable.Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon whose campaign organization has crumbled, pulled about 7 percent of the vote. A Christian whose faith defines his political persona, Mr. Carson likely undermined Mr. Cruz\u2019s efforts to corner the evangelical vote. He has vowed to press on, just as Mr. Cruz prepares to compete across a number of Bible Belt states on March 1.Many African-Americans were loyal and enthusiastic supporters of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, and black New Yorkers helped elected Hillary Clinton to the Senate in 2000 and 2006. But black Democrats abandoned her in droves during the 2008 presidential race as they embraced Barack Obama and contributed to her ultimate defeat.On Saturday in Nevada, Mrs. Clinton got her groove back with African-Americans: According to entrance polls by Edison Research, she won 76 percent of black Nevada voters, compared with 22 percent for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.No other result from the Nevada caucuses bodes better for Mrs. Clinton as she heads to South Carolina for its primary next Saturday and then competes through the South on Super Tuesday, since many of those states have large numbers of black voters.After Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat in the New Hampshire primary, she sharpened her political message to focus on breaking \u201cbarriers\u201d that keep black and Hispanic Americans from rising in society and earning a high-quality education, good jobs and fair treatment from police officers and the criminal justice system.Mrs. Clinton, her campaign surrogates and her television commercials repeated these themes throughout Nevada, and her campaign aides portrayed Mr. Sanders as preoccupied with attacking the political system and Wall Street rather than helping real people.According to entrance polls, Mrs. Clinton won among women and low-income voters \u2014 two groups she lost to Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire. Moreover, she seemed to hit on a message that showcased her caring side, a quality that some voters have wanted to see.Mr. Sanders has been delivering the same message about America\u2019s \u201ccorrupt\u201d economic and political system since April. Most politicians would have expanded and refined their themes over time, but his constancy has been held up as a sign of authenticity. Even when he faced a new challenge in Nevada \u2014 winning over black and Hispanic voters \u2014 he did not markedly change his stump speech. And he lost.In South Carolina, more than half the Democratic electorate is African-American. Mr. Sanders still expresses confidence that his tirades against Wall Street and the campaign finance system will resonate with those voters. But he is planning to campaign in Massachusetts and Virginia next week.By only campaigning part-time in South Carolina and not honing his message to black voters, Mr. Sanders risks being seen as writing off a core constituency of the Democratic Party and narrowing in his appeal at a time when a leading candidate ordinarily would be trying to grow his base of support.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2 More Top Executives to Step Down at A.I.G.", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byAfter joining the American International Group nearly two decades ago, Brian Schreiber became a major executive in building the insurance giant up \u2014 and then, after the financial crisis, in helping it shrink.But as A.I.G. continues to overhaul its management after avoiding a prolonged fight with two big investors, Mr. Schreiber will be the latest executive to depart.A.I.G.\u2019s chief executive, Peter D. Hancock, disclosed in an internal memorandum late Monday that Mr. Schreiber, who was named chief strategy officer last year, and Seraina Maag, who led the company\u2019s regional management operations, will leave A.I.G.The moves, which were accompanied by news of a reorganization of A.I.G.\u2019s top leadership, are the latest changes by the insurer as it grapples with improving its operations and its stagnant stock price.The company\u2019s financial performance drew the ire of two big investors, the billionaires Carl C. Icahn and John Paulson, who received seats on A.I.G.\u2019s board last week as part of a settlement meant to forestall a potentially noisy board fight.The departures of Mr. Schreiber and Ms. Maag signal the latest shake-up/shake up after A.I.G. reviewed its internal operations.Since joining A.I.G. in 1997, Mr. Schreiber rose from a portfolio manager in the insurer\u2019s global investment group to chief of the company\u2019s strategic planning, putting him in charge of many of its acquisitions. Among them was the roughly $23 billion takeover of American General, another huge insurance provider.In that role, he played a prominent part in efforts to save A.I.G. during the financial crisis. Mr. Schreiber and Robert Willumstad, then the company\u2019s chief executive, sought out different options to bail out the insurer, including a brief effort to woo Warren E. Buffett as the linchpin of a rescue effort led by private investors.Ultimately, however, the Federal Reserve stepped in with an $85 billion bailout.After that, Mr. Schreiber helped A.I.G. sell off nonessential businesses as it sought to become more focused and pay back its taxpayer-financed lifeline.He later served as deputy chief investment officer of the insurer. He was promoted last year to chief strategy officer, overseeing long-term planning, mergers and communications.\u201cBrian has demonstrated his deep knowledge of the company and industry expertise at every turn, and most recently, was instrumental as chief strategy officer in developing and driving the rollout of our new strategy,\u201d Mr. Hancock wrote in the memo.Mr. Schreiber previously worked for Taylor & Company, a part of the Bass brothers\u2019 financial empire, and Booz Allen and Hamilton.Ms. Maag, who joined A.I.G. in 2013, oversaw the management of all countries in which the insurer operated. She joined the company from the XL Group.Below is the text of the memo announcing the departures of Mr. Schreiber and Ms. Maag.Dear Colleagues,As we focus with enthusiasm on creating the A.I.G. of the future, we must not lose sight of those who played an important role in bringing us to this point. Today, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the many and lasting contributions made by Seraina Maag and Brian Schreiber, two of our senior leaders who will be leaving the company.Seraina joined A.I.G. in 2013 as the chief executive officer of EMEA and has consistently proven herself as an invaluable asset to my leadership team, and toward the success of EMEA. Seraina has been highly respected for her creative leadership and strong commitment toward helping further initiatives throughout the region, and most recently, in A.I.G.\u2019s organizational design work. Throughout his almost two-decade career at A.I.G., Brian served with passion and dedication in several key operating and transactional roles, including as deputy chief investment officer, as treasurer, and as head of strategic planning. As a key member of the leadership team that designed and executed A.I.G.\u2019s restructuring plan, he helped the company navigate through some of its most challenging days to successfully repay America with a profit. Brian has demonstrated his deep knowledge of the company and industry expertise at every turn, and most recently, was instrumental as chief strategy officer in developing and driving the rollout of our new strategy.We owe both Seraina and Brian a debt of gratitude for their leadership and many contributions to this company. Their work will have a lasting impact on A.I.G. for years to come.Please join me in thanking Seraina and Brian and in wishing them success in the future.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eddie Einhorn, a Creator of College Basketball on TV, Dies at 80", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byEddie Einhorn, who created a sports network that propelled national interest in college basketball, laying a foundation for the immense popularity of the annual tournament known as March Madness, died on Wednesday in Norwood, N.J. He was 80.The cause was complications following a stroke, said his wife, Ann. He lived in Alpine, N.J.In recent decades, Mr. Einhorn was known as a baseball executive. In 1981 he and his law school classmate Jerry Reinsdorf led a group of limited partners in buying the Chicago White Sox. He was the team president until 1990.Mr. Einhorn made a more consequential contribution to sports as a television executive. He was in his 20s, a law student at Northwestern University in Chicago, when, working out of his dorm room, he put together a network from a handful of radio stations to broadcast the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament.This was the late 1950s; college basketball had little more than a regional following for local teams, and Mr. Einhorn was able to purchase the radio rights for a tiny fee.By the early 1960s, he was broadcasting games on television. But as he recalled in \u201cHow March Became Madness,\u201d a 2006 book written with Ron Rapoport, interest in college basketball was still so circumscribed that the telecast of the 1962 national final, in which Cincinnati defeated Ohio State, was seen only in Ohio.The breakthrough came on Jan. 20, 1968, when U.C.L.A., with Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) at center, took a 47-game winning streak into the Houston Astrodome \u2014 then just three years old and still thought of as a glamorous building \u2014 to face the also undefeated University of Houston and its star center, Elvin Hayes.More than 52,000 people attended, an extraordinary number for a basketball game even today, and they saw a captivating, tight contest dominated by Hayes, who scored 39 points in a 71-69 Houston victory.The invincible reputation of U.C.L.A. was punctured, and so was the dominance of Alcindor, who had recently been sidelined with an eye injury. (In a rematch in the N.C.A.A. tournament that year, U.C.L.A trounced Houston, 101-69, holding Hayes to 10 points. Alcindor scored 19.)The contest in the Astrodome, which came to be called the Game of the Century, was the first college basketball game to be televised nationally in prime time.Millions watched on TVS \u2014 for television sports \u2014 as Mr. Einhorn had named his network, reportedly of some 150 stations in 49 states. Many of the stations were affiliated with CBS, ABC or NBC and angered the parent companies when they broadcast the game instead of the regular network programming.It turned out to be the college basketball equivalent of the 1958 National Football League championship game between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants, an overtime contest, won by the Colts, that acquired its own hyperbolic nickname, \u201cThe Greatest Game Ever Played,\u201d and ushered in the modern era of pro football on television.NBC began broadcasting the N.C.A.A. tournament in 1969, and CBS seized the rights in 1982. In 2010, CBS and Turner Sports paid the N.C.A.A. nearly $11 billion for rights to broadcast the tournament for 14 years.As a baseball executive, Mr. Einhorn was presiding over the White Sox when, in 1983, the third season of his tenure, they won the American League Western Division championship \u2014 the team\u2019s first championship of any kind since 1959, when they captured the American League pennant but lost to the Dodgers in the World Series.The 1983 team won 99 regular-season games, more than any White Sox team in 66 years (the 1917 club won 100), and more than any since then, with the exception of the 2005 Sox, who also won 99 as well as the World Series.By 2005, Mr. Einhorn was no longer involved with the day-to-day operation of the club, but as vice chairman, a title he held at his death, he returned to Houston, the site of his greatest triumph in basketball, to celebrate the World Series victory over the Astros.Edward Martin Einhorn was born in Paterson, N.J., on Jan. 3, 1936. His father, Harold, owned an insurance agency. His mother was the former Mae Lippman.He went to the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a radio announcer for basketball games, and moved to Chicago for law school.For a time, he worked as a vendor at Comiskey Park, the South Side home of the White Sox that he would have a hand in replacing some 30 years later. (In the late 1980s, with the team threatening to move to St. Petersburg, Fla., the state agreed to help finance a new stadium, now known as U.S. Cellular Field, which opened in 1991.)Mr. Einhorn sold TVS to the Corinthian Broadcasting Corporation in 1973, though he continued to run it for several years afterward. For a time in the late 1970s, he was executive producer of \u201cCBS Sports Spectacular,\u201d which featured a variety of sports events.He negotiated lucrative television contracts for Major League Baseball and was an architect of baseball\u2019s own early television venture, The Baseball Network. Mr. Einhorn was a television consultant to the United States Olympic Committee and the United States Figure Skating Association.In 1982, he founded a cable sports network in Chicago and put White Sox games on it, an enterprise that did not fare too well at a time when Chicago Cubs games were on free television.In the mid-1980s, he also took over the Chicago franchise of the fledgling United States Football League, which was trying to move from a spring schedule to a fall schedule to compete directly against the N.F.L.Mr. Einhorn was unable to negotiate a satisfactory television contract, and the league filed an antitrust suit against the N.F.L., claiming it had monopolized the fall schedule of the major networks, unfairly thwarting competition. The suit was decided in favor of the U.S.F.L., but the victory was a Pyrrhic one. Nominal damages were awarded, and the league folded after the 1985 season.Mr. Einhorn married Ann Pelachik in 1962. In addition to her, his survivors include a brother, William; a son, Jeff; a daughter, Jennifer Jacobson; and a grandson.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Start-Up Lessons From the Once-Again Hot Field of A.I.", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byBitsIn 2010, Kris Hammond, an experienced artificial intelligence researcher, and a few partners founded Narrative Science. The Chicago start-up\u2019s software ingests and interprets numbers for things like investment holdings, billing records and sports statistics and transforms them into written summaries or stories.From the outset, the company\u2019s technology was promising, but the timing was tricky. It opened its doors the year before IBM\u2019s Watson publicly demonstrated the potential of machine intelligence with its \u201cJeopardy!\u201d victory.\u201cAt the start, we didn\u2019t call it artificial intelligence because A.I. was still in disrepute,\u201d recalled Mr. Hammond, chief scientist for Narrative Science.Today, a start-up that can lay claim to doing artificial intelligence has increased its odds of getting attention and funding. A.I. efforts, scientists agree, are far more advanced than in past boom and bust cycles for this type of technology.Yet if the technology seems almost magical at times, success, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs say, will rely on basic business virtues like focus, flexibility, speed and resilience.That is particularly true for start-ups. \u201cBig companies like Google can make A.I. investments with a 10-year horizon, but a start-up has to release a product in a year or two,\u201d said Chris Dixon, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz.In past cycles, research advances in A.I. generated excitement but not much business. \u201cIt was a long, long way from being practical,\u201d said Forest Baskett, a computer scientist and partner at New Enterprise Associates. \u201cWhat makes it investable now is there are applications, things you can do with these tools.\u201dThe technical ingredients behind modern A.I., he noted, were vast new sources of data, machine-learning software and powerful, inexpensive computing delivered over the so-called computing cloud.When asked about investable applications in N.E.A.\u2019s portfolio, Mr. Baskett pointed to three examples that exploit data and machine-learning: DataRobot, which evaluates math models to predict which will work best on a particular kind of data; Dato, whose machine-learning tools analyze the graphs of online users\u2019 social connections; and Qbotix, which makes specialized robots for optimally tilting and maintaining the panels that absorb the sun\u2019s rays on solar farms.\u201cToday, we can measure so much more,\u201d Mr. Baskett said.His comment underlines the fact that there is no bright line separating big data analytics and A.I. In both cases, data is the fuel and machine-learning algorithms are the engine of pattern recognition and classification. Yet A.I. technology, propelled by advances in so-called deep-learning techniques, is moving up the ladder of perception, becoming far better at mimicking the humanlike tasks of seeing and hearing \u2014 image recognition and speech recognition, in computing terms.Cognitive Scale concentrates on short sprints with small teams, getting a working application up and running within 90 days. Speed to market is its product. Cognitive Scale is working first with customers in the health care, finance and retailing industries.\u201cOur approach is small bets, brought to market quickly for better decisions and better customer engagement in your industry,\u201d said Mr. Saxena, the chairman. \u201cWe bring practical A.I. into businesses.\u201dWhat the market wants has been the lesson learned at Narrative Science. Its founding team included professors from Northwestern University\u2019s computer science and journalism departments.A Pulitzer Prize is still a worthy, if more distant, goal, Mr. Hammond said recently. But Narrative Science, which is growing briskly and has 80 employees, has built its business outside the financially challenged news media industry.Its 70 customers are mainly in mainstream businesses like financial services and consulting, including Nuveen, USAA, Credit Suisse and Deloitte, which use the Narrative Science software to generate reports that explain the numbers in investment portfolios, trading records and market statistics.Advertisement"}

It is an inferno captured in cloth: the blackened silhouettes of trees, engulfed in a blaze of intricate, swirling stitches.Other quilters take a more sobering tack. In a piece titled \u201cHands Up Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d Jackie Houston, 61, addresses race and police brutality, anchoring her piece around a haunting oversize image of her 7-year-old grandson, his raised hands dramatically, extending beyond the quilt\u2019s edge. Ms. Houston said she used her grandson to evoke the perils of being an African-American boy. Speaking of recent deaths around the country, she added, \u201cThis could be anybody\u2019s child.\u201dHistorically, quilting has been an art form accessible to marginalized people, especially women, who \u201cvisualize their thoughts in cloth,\u201d said Carolyn L. Mazloomi, a quilt historian and independent curator who founded the national nonprofit Women of Color Quilters Network.\u201cIt\u2019s the first thing we\u2019re swaddled in at birth and the last thing that touches our bodies when we leave the earthly realm,\u201d she said.At home, Fran Porter, the guild\u2019s 91-year-old grande dame, keeps a \u201cstash\u201d of threads and fabrics in neatly stacked plastic shoe boxes, and a notepad on her night stand to jot down concepts at any hour. She chose to depict graffiti in her quilt because \u201cit both fascinates and repels me,\u201d she said. Mrs. Porter took up quilting at 82. \u201cI thought it was for old ladies,\u201d she said. \u201cI finally had to acknowledge I was one.\u201dMrs. Porter spent 20 years as a social worker. The guild\u2019s ranks also include a Haitian dance teacher, a retired litigator, a Postal Service auditor and a retired newspaper editor. The current president, Marie Taylor, is a former nun who spent 35 years in a convent. (\u201cI decided I wanted to be in control of my own life,\u201d she said, explaining why she left.)The group spans Oakland\u2019s socioeconomic divide, with some members barely scraping by, and others living in spacious aeries with killer views. \u201cSome have advanced degrees, some didn\u2019t graduate from high school,\u201d noted Patricia A. Turner, a professor of African-American studies and world arts and culture at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is also a guild member. Though the group is primarily composed of blacks, it also includes whites, Latinos and \u201cpeople who don\u2019t know what to put on the census forms,\u201d she said.The quilts are a walking tour in textiles. \u201cOaktown Blues,\u201d a quilt by Niambi Kee, celebrates the city\u2019s blues history. \u201cOakland Key System Map,\u201d by Dolores Presley, resurrects the nitty-gritty details of a defunct transportation system. Jeanette Robinson quilted the image of a clock tower at Mills College designed by the architect Julia Morgan, while Marsha Carter commemorates Delilah Leontium Beasley, a pioneering black journalist and historian. Blanche Brown\u2019s \u201cGeisha\u201d is a homage to the city\u2019s Japanese community.The emotional resonance of quilting is perhaps best embodied in the life and art of Ora M. Knowell, 70, a guild member and the daughter of sharecroppers, who has lost two sons to gun violence in Oakland. Ms. Knowell grew up in a shotgun house on a Mississippi plantation. As a girl, she slept by the fire beneath a heavy quilt made by her mother from old wool and cotton clothes.She hated quilting. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a thimble, and our fingers were pricked and sore for having to quilt to keep warm,\u201d Ms. Knowell recalled.But her knack for making stick and cornhusk dolls eventually expanded into an affinity for quilts. When her first son, Christopher, died in 1995, at 25, she channeled her grief into a seven-foot-long quilted panel that included a photo transfer of him at the age of 13 and pink knit gloves \u2014 her own symbol of the need for mothers to protect their children. When a second son, Daniel, 34, was killed in 2002, Ms. Knowell responded with a 16-yard-long quilt honoring the year\u2019s 113 homicide victims in Oakland.\u201cPeople say the more death comes, the more immune you are,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d But eventually, Ms. Knowell said she concluded that \u201cI\u2019m not going to let the killer kill me by being fearful.\u201d Her latest quilt, \u201cBlack Justice Matters,\u201d is a hand- and machine-stitched commentary on what she sees as an unbalanced justice system.She invites the children to help create sock dolls and other art projects, stitching a loved one\u2019s face on the cotton fabric \u201cfor comfort.\u201d\u201cWatching other victims suffer in the same way as myself, unable to speak out and be heard, motivated and inspired me to use my artwork as a voice,\u201d Ms. Knowell said.Hers is the soul of a quilter \u2014 healing through stories that perhaps only the cloth can tell.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Finance Leaders Meet as Economic Skies Darken", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 The global economy looks shaky. Markets for things as diverse as oil and European bank shares have plumbed new lows. The tried-and-true cures no longer seem to work.The task for global leaders this week: Come up with Plan B.Finance ministers and central bank governors from the world\u2019s biggest industrialized and developing economies now arriving in Shanghai face their toughest task since the worst days of the global financial crisis. Europe is mired in low growth and Japan is teetering on the brink of recession, even though the Bank of Japan and a lengthening list of European central banks are pushing interest rates ever deeper into negative territory.China, the world\u2019s leading engine of economic growth in recent years, is struggling with heavy debts, a slowdown in manufacturing, stagnant exports and a flood of money leaving its borders. Countries that depend on selling oil and other resources are struggling under persistently low prices. The United States is facing a drag on growth as the strong dollar makes it cheaper for many consumers and companies to import goods instead of buying them from American businesses.That leaves a difficult situation for the economic policy makers of the Group of 20 nations, who will be hard-pressed to come up with solutions during their meetings in Shanghai.\u201cWhat to do about the increasing risks to the recovery is perhaps the single most important question before the finance chiefs in Shanghai,\u201d the International Monetary Fund said this week. It added: \u201cThe G-20 must plan now and proactively identify policies that could be rolled out quickly, if downside risks materialize.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.During and right after the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the Group of 20 produced broad agreements on many financial regulations, most notably a tightening of international capital standards. But in the years since, the disparate collection of economies from Argentina to the European Union has been known mostly for agreeing on generalities and making few changes, culminating in an unproductive series of meetings in Turkey last year.\u201cThe Turkish presidency of the G-20 led to no progress on any front,\u201d said Ken Courtis, a prominent international economist and fund manager.China, which holds the Group of 20 presidency this year, is one major concern. In August, China devalued its currency, the renminbi, by 4 percent with no warning, setting off sharp sell-offs in global markets. China now faces pressure to weaken the currency further as money leaves the country because of slowing growth \u2014 a prospect that could further hurt the global economic outlook.\u201cWhat we\u2019re concerned about is China. Could there be a break on China\u2019s currency that could tip the global economy into recession?\u201d said Charles Collyns, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury for international finance in the Obama administration who is now the chief economist of the Institute of International Finance.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, held a rare news conference Friday morning, frankly acknowledging that borrowing in China\u2019s corporate sector and by local governments was high.But Mr. Zhou also said that China\u2019s overall economy was still strong, and that a recent decline in the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, still the world\u2019s largest by far at $3.2 trillion, was not a cause for worry.The Shanghai stock market was up 0.4 percent late Friday morning, steadying after a plunge of 6.4 percent on Thursday..China\u2019s devaluations put pressure on rival exporters to do the same or risk losing their competitiveness. Many emerging markets, like Russia and Brazil, have allowed their currencies to fall steeply against the dollar or been forced into it, raising fears of devaluations of the sort seen in the 1930s, which led to a collapse of international trade. Countries with currencies that have stayed strong as safe havens, including the dollar and the Japanese yen, have seen growth suffer.One of the biggest question marks over the group lies in how much it might do on currencies, beyond a general call for more stable exchange rates. But Chinese officials have worked to deflate expectations that the Shanghai meeting could be a reprise of the Plaza Accord, a deal between major economies in 1985 to fix volatile currency markets.As the most prosperous communities in the United States have gotten richer since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, economic conditions in many distressed areas have deteriorated even further.A senior United States Treasury official said that he expected countries to reiterate previous commitments to manage their currencies responsibly, rather than shift their value. \u201cI see those commitments as being a strong indication from G-20 members that they will manage their currencies in ways that are globally consistent,\u201d he said.The official, who insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic considerations, said that the United States would push instead to call on countries with broadly measured surpluses on trade and royalties to stimulate domestic spending, particularly by consumers.Yet China has already stepped up infrastructure spending so much in the last decade that it is becoming harder to find projects that justify the investment. In Europe, the longstanding caution of the German government about large-scale spending has been a deterrent. In the United States, Republicans in Congress have been leery of the extra borrowing that could be needed to finance additional roads, bridges and rail lines.One question is whether China\u2019s presidency this year can make the group more productive.Except on climate change, for which it made a large commitment to slow down emissions before the Paris agreement in December, China has sought to be recognized as a leader of global diplomacy without taking responsibility for specific results. In Syria, in South Sudan, and at times even on its own border in North Korea, it has been leery of trying to dictate any resolution to longstanding international concerns.In the Group of 20, China has to cope not only with its own reluctance to take strong stands but also with the lack of a strong international consensus among the disparate nations on what the world should do to strengthen economic growth.\u201cIt\u2019s hard in the context of a G-20 communiqu\u00e9 to get really concrete initiatives,\u201d Mr. Collyns said. \u201cSo what I would expect is some kind of framework.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Securities Regulator Is Out, but Little May Change", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byUnderperforming officials in China often get shuffled to less-influential jobs or are allowed to resign quietly. Most officials who have been fired of late have been ensnared by the broad crackdown on corruption by Mr. Xi.Mr. Xi appears to be betting now that in heeding public opinion and replacing Mr. Xiao in such a high-profile fashion he can buy time to limit damage to the party\u2019s reputation from the stock market mess and the broader economic slowdown. But if the problems continue, he risks further undermining faith in his leadership and his government\u2019s ability to navigate a difficult economic transition.For decades, the party oversaw spectacular growth, buttressing its authoritarian rule and cementing China\u2019s role in the global economic hierarchy. Now growth has fallen to its slowest pace in a quarter-century and the party\u2019s failed attempts to control the markets and the currency are unnerving investors around the world. Mr. Xiao\u2019s dismissal came days before global finance ministers are to meet in Shanghai, expecting answers from China\u2019s leaders on how they will restore confidence in their ability to competently manage the economy.Replacing Mr. Xiao is only a first step to cleaning up the mess in the markets. His successor will need to follow up with swift action, to improve the functioning of China\u2019s equity markets and wean them off state intervention, without doing further damage to the economy\u201cThis will be a positive for the stock market, but the key will be the economic policies issued by the government in the next few months,\u201d said Chen Bo, an Beijing-based investor and independent political scholar. Without them, he said, the \u201cshort-term gains in the stock market in the next couple of months could be followed by another serious slump.\u201dBut Mr. Xiao\u2019s replacement, Liu Shiyu, may not necessarily offer the bold change the markets need. Mr. Liu, chairman of the Agriculture Bank of China, has little experience in equity markets.The shake-up also does little to solve the underlying problem: a government increasingly under the control of one man, President Xi, who is trying to subdue economic turbulence. It is this penchant for control, investors and analysts say, that is driving talent away from the technocratic bureaucracy and rewarding officials who fall in line.\u201cThat\u2019s the problem of a very top-down policy style that\u2019s emerging in China now,\u201d said Victor Shih, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the confluence of finance and politics in China. \u201cNo one dares to challenge whatever preconceived notion the top leadership has.\u201dChina has a wealth of talented financial professionals, many educated at top universities in the United States, who are now entering the prime of their careers. But unlike in the United States, where talented people rotate in and out of government, few of them may be willing to take jobs in the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China\u2019s equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission.The pay is too low and the risks are too high. Mr. Xi\u2019s anticorruption drive in recent months has focused on the financial sector and the securities regulator itself, making it a difficult environment even for officials free of graft, said Mr. Chen, the investor.\u201cThe professional makeup of the C.S.R.C. is really not even up close to that of the big brokerages,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cThis problem isn\u2019t found only in the equities sector. It\u2019s much more widespread than that.\u201dMr. Liu is typical for a top financial official. He spent his career working in government committees and at the central bank.Fred Hu, the chairman of Primavera Capital Group and the former chairman of Goldman Sachs for China, called Mr. Liu a \u201chighly experienced and results-oriented financial official,\u201d but said he would \u201cfind himself in a challenging position,\u201d like his predecessor.\u201cOver and time again the regulators have struggled to meet some of the difficult tasks \u2014 modernizing securities markets, engineering rising equity prices, while protecting investors and ensuring market stability,\u201d Mr. Hu said in an email.While Mr. Liu has little experience with markets, he does have connections. In the mid-1990s, he worked the state-owned China Construction Bank. The bank, at the time, was headed by Wang Qishan, who is now overseeing the anticorruption campaign as one of seven members of the Communist Party\u2019s ruling Politburo Standing Committee.\u201cHe\u2019s definitely not a bold reformer,\u201d Mr. Shih said of Mr. Liu.The new securities chief may be in an impossible position, expected to control inherently uncontrollable markets and take the blame if the efforts fail. The push by Mr. Xi\u2019s to assert state control over the markets and the economy go against the philosophy of China\u2019s early reformers under Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who sought to give more space to the market.\u201cThe approach that they took toward the stock market is telling me that they are not willing to let go control,\u201d Yasheng Huang, a professor of political economy and international Management at M.I.T., said of China\u2019s current leaders in a December interview.One former Chinese financial official, who requested anonymity so he could freely discuss personnel issues, said Mr. Xiao, the former securities chief, might be heading to a new post to help oversee economic policy under China\u2019s cabinet. The influential magazine Caijing also reported that Mr. Xiao may be moving to a new government position.The shake-up at the securities regulator is also likely to result in renewed questions about the eventual retirement of Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of China\u2019s central bank since 2002.When Prime Minister Li Keqiang criticized the government\u2019s handling of financial markets at a meeting last Monday of the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, he cited management of the currency. The currency falls under the direct purview of the People\u2019s Bank of China.Mr. Zhou, 68, was widely revered as the man who spearheaded considerable financial deregulation. He also led the country\u2019s currency, the renminbi, to recognition by the International Monetary Fund last November as one of the world\u2019s main reserve currencies.Three years ago, said Minxin Pei, a specialist in Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College, it would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d for anyone to suggest that Mr. Zhou retire.\u201cHe would be a good scapegoat now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What It\u2019s Really Like to Risk It All in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byBefore Nathalie Miller decided to walk away from Instacart, the grocery delivery start-up now worth more than $2 billion, she made a spreadsheet to analyze how much money she was leaving on the table.She had been Instacart\u2019s 20th employee, managing operations during a period of extremely rapid growth, and the sum could have been huge. She quit anyway. Like many strivers in Silicon Valley, she had a bigger plan: to start her own company that could not only make millions, but also fulfill a mission she believed in.Then, six months later, Ms. Miller discovered that she was pregnant with her first child. A baby wasn\u2019t something she and her husband, Isaak Le, had been planning quite yet, but they were excited. Still, a sliver of doubt began to undercut her confidence about starting her own company. \u201cHow high can I stack the cards against myself \u2014 a pregnant brown woman?\u201d said Ms. Miller, who is of Vietnamese and European descent.Silicon Valley can seem like the land of overnight success. College dropouts show up and become billionaires a few years later. Mark Zuckerberg was a billionaire by the time he was 23, and Facebook paid $19 billion for WhatsApp when it was just five years old.But despite their hold on the imagination, these examples aren\u2019t typical. Much more representative are the companies you never hear about because they never get off the ground.In recent months, the fund-raising atmosphere has cooled as venture capitalists react to the poor stock market performance of some public tech companies and question whether the recent fast pace of investment is sustainable. Venture capitalists are making fewer investments at lower valuations.Nonetheless, Silicon Valley keeps seducing people. For those who come, the risk is worth the potential reward \u2014 not just riches, but also the more dreamy belief that tech entrepreneurialism is a force for good. Ms. Miller was not immune.\u201cI want Doxa to exist in the world,\u201d she told me in July, \u201cbecause it will make the world a better place.\u201dMs. Miller, who turns 34 on Sunday, grew up in Berkeley, and after graduating from Harvard, moved to Vietnam. There, she started a microfinance nonprofit, expanding it to 92 employees. When she returned to the United States, she began a doctorate program in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, but was soon drawn into the tech industry.She joined Instacart in 2013, and saw some of tech\u2019s biggest challenges firsthand. In a year, the company grew to 120 employees from 20, and had 4,000 independent contractors. Hiring well at that kind of speed, she found, is hard to get right.Ms. Miller also experienced the challenges of being a woman in tech. One day, a new employee told her that he had ranked the hottest women at the company, and she was No. 1. She reported the comment to managers, and the employee was fired the next day.Though she was satisfied with Instacart\u2019s response, she knew women in many industries faced much worse, and started ruminating about how she could change workplace culture more broadly.That is when she came up with Doxa. The name comes from a Greek term that sociologists use to describe the things that people take for granted but that don\u2019t necessarily have to be that way.The idea was for a site that would collect data about the sorts of things applicants really want to know but don\u2019t ask in job interviews: Do you feel as if co-workers value your opinions? Do people actually take their vacation days? How often do you work nights and weekends? It would offer online personality tests, then use psychometric data to match candidates with employers more effectively. It would make money from companies paying for information about candidates and to post job ads, as they do on LinkedIn. Sam Meder, who had run engineering at a start-up acquired by Pinterest, agreed to start it with her.Ms. Miller thought Doxa could help by offering data that research shows is important to women \u2014 the gender pay gap and the percentage of women on the executive team \u2014 as well as factors like whether women felt they were given credit for their ideas. But first, she needed to raise money.Venture capitalists, who hold the keys to success in Silicon Valley by providing start-up money, are even more likely to be white and male than tech company employees are. Theirs is an insular business. Most investors accept pitches only from entrepreneurs who come through an introduction, and they tend to finance people who have succeeded before, or who remind them of those who did.\u201cAll she had to do before she said that was get on the phone with 10 black men or women and eight or nine would have said, \u2018This is an issue I\u2019ve had to deal with my entire life,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walker said.Ms. Herscher, who has two and a half decades of experience as a software executive, was introduced to Ms. Miller through a colleague and had agreed to become a kind of mentor. Ms. Miller had unveiled Doxa three weeks before. The site had 820 active users, and 300 companies on a waiting list to be included.Now it needed money. Ms. Miller had calculated that $2 million in venture capital would enable her to hire the people she needed and keep the company running for 18 months. But time was tight. She needed to start paying salaries.She had made her pitch to three small, mission-driven funds that wanted to invest in female and minority founders. Ms. Herscher said she should be aiming instead at well-known venture capital firms.\u201cThe thing is, no real investor is going to invest in you because of the mission,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to invest in you if they think you\u2019ll make a lot of money.\u201d\u201cThe feedback we\u2019re getting from the big guns is we\u2019re too small now,\u201d Ms. Miller told her.\u201cThey didn\u2019t wait for Google to have a prototype before they invested,\u201d Ms. Herscher said.The first time they met to discuss Doxa, Ms. Miller had worn jeans and a sleeveless shirt. The look was too unprofessional, Ms. Herscher told her. She should dress like Yahoo\u2019s chief executive, Marissa Mayer (whose uniform is crew neck, knee-length dresses with cardigans). Ms. Miller said that everyone she had worked with at tech companies wore jeans and T-shirts, and surely no venture capitalist cared if Mark Zuckerberg showed up in a hoodie. Ms. Herscher was uncompromising: Like it or not, the standard is different for women.This time, Ms. Miller wore a dark cardigan over a dark blouse.Ms. Herscher asked if she had been hit on yet by venture capitalists. She hadn\u2019t. Ms. Herscher told her own horror stories \u2014 the investor who slipped his hand under her hair and massaged her neck, the one that rubbed her knee.Ms. Miller was more worried about the investors\u2019 reaction to her pregnancy. She broke the news to Ms. Herscher.After congratulations, they plotted strategy. Wait until the second meeting to mention it, Ms. Herscher said. \u201cThen say: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant. And I\u2019m so well organized that my baby\u2019s due on Christmas Day, which will be a slow time. I don\u2019t expect it will faze me at all. I\u2019m married to a man who will be a primary caregiver, and this is no different from investing in a man whose wife is pregnant.\u2019\u201dThen her tone shifted. She wasn\u2019t talking about business anymore.\u201cHaving your first child is just physically hard, emotionally hard,\u201d said Ms. Herscher, who has two children. \u201cI would never discourage you or say you can\u2019t do it, because you absolutely can. Just be very clear why you\u2019re doing it and what price you\u2019re willing to pay, because the price is time with your baby.\u201dAfter the conversation, Ms. Miller talked with her husband, who works in advertising and was then a freelancer, about being the primary parent. He was on board. She figured she would take off a few weeks and get right back to work.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a lot more nuanced and sometimes it\u2019s subconscious,\u201d said Julia Hu, the founder and chief executive of Lark, which makes a health and weight-loss app. \u201cV.C.s are pattern matchers, and they\u2019re just used to seeing men like themselves.\u201dMany women convey confidence and leadership in a different way than men do, she said. As an Asian woman, she said, she was raised to be humble and quiet and felt uncomfortable promoting her skills. \u201cTo try to be who I thought they wanted me to be, which was another Mark Zuckerberg, was actually very difficult for me without feeling inauthentic.\u201dLater, she realized that describing business partnerships she had made, like one to preinstall Lark on new Samsung phones, was a more effective way for her to demonstrate her leadership skills than boasting about herself.People in Silicon Valley say new motherhood is particularly difficult, because competition moves at hyperspeed. Ms. Mayer, for example, felt the need to announce that she would be \u201ctaking limited time away and working throughout\u201d her leave after giving birth to twins late last year.A few weeks later, Ms. Miller was back at Ms. Herscher\u2019s office, practicing her pitch while Ms. Herscher played the part of skeptical venture capitalist.Ms. Miller had been working 70 hours a week managing Doxa, recruiting companies, trying to raise money and working nights with the engineers who had day jobs.Though her pregnancy had been relatively easy \u2014 at one point she vomited on the sidewalk after meeting an investor, and she was down to a single professional-looking dress that was loose enough to hide her growing belly \u2014 she had not told any investors that she was pregnant, though two had obliquely asked if she was planning to have children.Ms. Miller began her practice pitch to Ms. Herscher: \u201cDoxa is a platform to match qualified people to the right companies. Once this platform exists, we\u2019re going to wonder how we ever found jobs before.\u201d She talked about the team and showed a diagram of how the service worked.\u201cAt this point I have no idea if this is important,\u201d Ms. Herscher said. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me there\u2019s a problem but not if it could make money.\u201dThey ran through some more slides, including her go-to-market strategy \u2014 aiming at women in tech.\u201cI\u2019m immediately turned off and lost, because what you\u2019re telling us is you have this fantastic technology and star team, and you\u2019re going to go after this itty-bitty market and a bleeding heart cause,\u201d Ms. Herscher said.Ms. Miller finished her pitch. It needed to be crisper and more confident, Ms. Herscher said: \u201cIt\u2019s an art to speak in bullet points. It takes practice. Sit in the car and say it over and over.\u201d\u201cO.K., wear cardigans, speak in bullet points,\u201d Ms. Miller said.A week later, she met with Ms. Yuan at Cowboy Ventures. Her tone was more confident and her pitch faster, and she had broadened it beyond women in tech. \u201cThe tools can be used by anyone \u2014 the recruiting market is gigantic,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat people want is not gender-specific, it\u2019s very millennial-specific.\u201dMs. Yuan pushed back. \u201cThere\u2019s this inherent tension in the way we monetize,\u201d she said. Doxa was asking companies to pay to use the service for recruiting while at the same time the site would publish potentially negative employee comments about the companies\u2019 culture.\u201cIt enables companies to be responsive: \u2018Let\u2019s get a maternity policy because we don\u2019t want to be up on your platform without that,\u2019\u201d Ms. Miller said. Smiling, she added, \u201cI love that you\u2019re saying \u2018we.\u2019\u201dBut a few days later, both venture capitalists declined to invest. NEA said Doxa didn\u2019t show enough traction with users yet. Cowboy said it wasn\u2019t clear that Doxa\u2019s technology was different enough from that of other hiring websites.\u201cI really thought it was a good idea,\u201d Ms. Yuan said later. \u201cBut there were really well funded start-ups in this space, and it was hard to tell because it was so early.\u201dMs. Miller told Mr. Meder that she was scaling back her ambitions from raising $2 million and hiring a full team to raising $500,000 for just the two of them. But things had changed for him. He had been given more responsibility at his day job, and it didn\u2019t feel fair to leave for Doxa, with its uncertain prospects.Ms. Miller canceled her coming pitches and told potential investors that Doxa was on pause. She had talked to more than 40 venture capitalists. But without her co-founder, who was building the technology while Ms. Miller built the business, venture capitalists were unlikely to provide financing.The flip side of overnight success in Silicon Valley is overnight failure. Start-ups can be so dependent on a single investor or partnership that a turn of events can change their fates.In 2011, Jason Shen helped found a start-up called Ridejoy, for connecting people who were driving long distances. For a time, it seemed as if it had the golden touch \u2014 entry into Y Combinator, $1.3 million in venture capital and traffic pouring in from Craigslist, where it posted its services. Vanity Fair did a photo shoot with the founders, and a writer profiled them for a book.Then, Craigslist sent a cease-and-desist letter, forbidding Ridejoy to post on the site. By the time Vanity Fair came out, Ridejoy had laid off nearly all its employees and stopped working on the site.\u201cNow I see companies who raised $10 million, and I\u2019m like, did we just not have guts? Did we just not follow through? Did we just not believe in our thing enough?\u201d said Mr. Shen, who now works at Etsy. \u201cFunding is such a confidence game.\u201dHe is saving his money to try to play the game again.As her baby\u2019s Christmas due date neared and she approached a year of living off savings, Ms. Miller began to get an unfamiliar feeling: the desire for stability.A couple of months later, Code 2040 offered Ms. Miller a full-time job, as the director of partner programs. She accepted. Building a new business focused on diversity fulfilled some of the hopes she\u2019d had for Doxa. She imagined keeping Doxa alive as a side project, once she had more time.Ms. Miller\u2019s plan was to take a month off and get back to work. Then, right on time, on Christmas Day, she gave birth to a girl, Zadie Mai, and changed her mind. The baby took over her thoughts. \u201cI feel a mixture of intense love and protectiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to hang out with the baby forever. There are my real physical needs and the physical dependence of the baby, all this stuff I didn\u2019t expect to be so consuming.\u201dShe said she had an entirely new perspective on how undervalued caregivers are, and how people judge women for taking time off work for their families.She decided to take at least six months off, doing some work from home after three or four months, and Code 2040 agreed. Her husband, meanwhile, had found a full-time job in advertising.Ms. Miller said the transition from start-up founder to employee and mother had given her a new perspective on success in Silicon Valley and, more broadly, on what her generation wanted from work, something she wanted to address in her new job.\u201cI wasn\u2019t na\u00efve,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cI knew when I quit Instacart that going on this entrepreneurial journey wouldn\u2019t be like \u2018The Social Network.\u2019 \u201d\u201cBut for me, this was a lesson that it\u2019s not always a straight shot from idea to financing to taking over Silicon Valley and taking over the world,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe this was just a lesson that being entrepreneurial and taking risks and jumping into new things you\u2019re excited about sometimes is not linear at all.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump Escalates Rhetoric Before South Carolina Primary", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Donald J. Trump, whose presidential campaign has doused the Republican Party with the verbal equivalent of napalm, has escalated his rhetoric to new levels of intensity before the crucial South Carolina primary this week. It is a vote that, if he wins, could erode the prospects of Republican leaders\u2019 stopping his candidacy.But Mr. Trump did not stop there: He shredded Mr. Bush as a poor leader who let the World Trade Center come down during his watch. In the process, Mr. Trump both challenged Republican orthodoxy and picked at old, sensitive scabs within the party over the war, all in the final days of the primary campaign in a military-heavy state that has been instrumental to the success of the most dominant family in Republican politics for the last 25 years.However late he began doing it, Jeb Bush has been the only candidate who has consistently taken on Mr. Trump. In a Sunday afternoon email to supporters, Mr. Bush pressed the case he\u2019ll make over the next week. The subject line said, \u201cDonald crossed a line.\u201dIn a round of interviews and on the Sunday morning programs, Mr. Trump, who has spent the entire campaign defying predictions that his comments would come back to bite him, responded to questions about his comments in the debate with an across-the-board \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He dismissed complaints that he had gone too far, or that his remarks could hurt him in a state where the former president remains highly popular.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it does, it does \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I have to tell the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times.\u201cI could be very quiet,\u201d he added. \u201cI could say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s wonderful,\u2019 or I could say, \u2018Excuse me, the World Trade Center'\u201d came down during Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tenure.Mr. Trump headed into the final week in South Carolina with a crescendo of orthodoxy-challenging pronouncements, including criticism of the home-state Senator Lindsey Graham. He also defended his previous comments about the work of Planned Parenthood, saying during the debate, when challenged by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, that he did not approve of abortion but that the organization did \u201cwonderful work\u201d for women\u2019s health more broadly. That remark could be toxic for Republican primary voters; it had made its way into an ad from Mr. Cruz by late Sunday afternoon.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the former president overshadowed those about Planned Parenthood. But even some former advisers to George Bush did not believe that the remarks about the Iraq war and the World Trade Center would do much damage to Mr. Trump.\u00e2\u0080\u009cOverwhelmingly, most Republicans disagree with his criticisms of George W. Bush, but most Republicans also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to debate\u201d Mr. Bush\u2019s legacy, said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who was a top adviser to Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2004 campaign.Most people share Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view that the war was a mistake, Mr. Schmidt added, and in a state heavy with military members, many families have grown weary of repeated deployments.Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who advised Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presidential campaign, also saw little peril for Mr. Trump, even if one of his opponents puts the remark into a television or radio ad.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could potentially bring down his margin, but when you\u2019ve got a guy who wins by double digits, does it matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Fabrizio said.For Mr. Trump, standing by even his contentious comments has been a hallmark of his appeal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the electorate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been responding to is strength,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Schmidt said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Trump once again last night showed what many Republican voters will regard as strength.\u201dMore problematic for Mr. Trump, Mr. Fabrizio said, could be his Planned Parenthood comments.Mr. Trump made noises before the Iowa caucuses about being a \u00e2\u0080\u009chealer\u00e2\u0080\u009d and aligning with the Republican establishment. In a crucial debate in New Hampshire, his approach was to avoid torching his opponents for the most part. But when he had a dust-up with Mr. Bush during the final debate in New Hampshire and the audience booed Mr. Trump, he made the most of it, saying they were against him because they were major donors and he could not be controlled.He has since used that line repeatedly on the campaign trail, even singling out Mr. Bush\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finance chairman, the billionaire Woody Johnson, as an example of the type of donor who is working against Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0094 never mind that Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson are actually friends.When the crowd at the South Carolina debate on Saturday night also began to boo, Mr. Trump again sought to use it to his advantage, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only tell the truth, lobbyists!\u00e2\u0080\u009d At another point, he criticized Mr. Graham for polling poorly in his presidential race.

But as for South Carolina, even those who would like to see him disappear from the race struggled to suggest that, after so many predictions of his demise, his latest comment would be the one to prove debilitating.

Chris Christie of New Jersey are locked in an increasingly bitter fight in New Hampshire. Both men have anchored their presidential campaigns in the state, holding dozens of town hall meetings and spending most of their money in an effort to seize momentum here.The latest round of campaign finance filings revealed just how high the stakes are in New Hampshire for Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie. Mr. Christie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign reported that it had only $1.1 million in the bank at the start of January. Mr. Kasich fared a bit better, with $2.5 million in reserve.Without a standout performance in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, it may rapidly become difficult for either governor to pay for the fundamentals of campaigning in the next round of elections in South Carolina and Nevada, and beyond.Neither Mr. Kasich nor Mr. Christie is expected to fare well Monday night in the Iowa caucuses, a contest they have both effectively bypassed as Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have dominated the campaign in that first voting state.In New Hampshire, Mr. Trump has held a wide lead over a pack of opponents in every public poll, with no clear second-place favorite.Mr. Christie said in appearances on ABC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Morning America\u00e2\u0080\u009d and MSNBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning Joe\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Monday that his goal was to emerge from the first two states as the leading candidate among the governors in the race \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mr. Kasich and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s who we beat, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behind us, that matters the most,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Christie said on MSNBC.Two other candidates embraced by the political establishment have invested significant resources in New Hampshire: Mr. Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But they have enough financial power arrayed behind them to persist in the race even after an unimpressive New Hampshire finish.While both Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio have looked to New Hampshire as an opportunity to gain steam in the campaign, they have both also laid the groundwork for a longer fight, spending time and money in South Carolina, Nevada and other states, where Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie have not focused their attention.Mr. Rubio finished last month with $10.4 million in the bank, and a \u00e2\u0080\u009csuper PAC\u00e2\u0080\u009d supporting his campaign had about $14 million more.

{"Headline": "Small Gifts to Bernie Sanders Challenge Hillary Clinton Fund-Raising Model", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported by\u201cIt was, obviously, a big day,\u201d said Mr. Pennington, who found himself jumping up and down as the contributions rolled in.Mr. Sanders has no official finance director, but with the help of people like Mr. Pennington, who built his first website at age 12, he has created a fund-raising juggernaut that has fueled his unexpectedly competitive race for president. The network his team built now threatens the once-daunting Clinton fund-raising model, which the family perfected over years of Beverly Hills dinners, Hamptons summer parties, and rewards for donors like nights in the Lincoln Bedroom.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, has raised some $96 million to Hillary Clinton\u2019s $127 million, but he is gaining ground after raising $5 million more than she did last month. His operation is also highly efficient \u2014 Mr. Sanders simply asks his small donors to give online, and they do, while Mrs. Clinton has left the campaign trail repeatedly to fly to other cities for receptions with bigger contributors.In the 48 hours after his 22-point victory in New Hampshire, for example, the senator\u2019s campaign raised $8 million online.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like a finance director, but it may have turned out that way,\u201d said Mr. Pennington, who taught himself how to build websites as a middle school student in El Dorado Hills, Calif.The competition between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton is as much about a collision of fund-raising cultures as it is about dollars: The Sanders team runs a heavily digital, bare-bones operation, stoked by social media and credit-card transactions. The Clinton camp also has a substantial digital fund-raising operation, but so far has relied more on in-person appeals to richer individuals, an approach that requires more elaborate planning, travel, invitations, handshakes and picture taking.Mrs. Clinton has spent the past 10 months crisscrossing the country and attending more than 230 fund-raisers, asking for checks of up to $2,700, the maximum contribution allowed in the primary campaign. Some 24,000 people and political action committees have given that maximum, providing her with a base of about $65 million for her campaign.The Clinton campaign acknowledges that Mr. Sanders has excelled at small-donor solicitations, but says the former first lady is catching up. Smaller donors may have assumed early on that Mrs. Clinton did not need checks for $1 or $5, but after her stinging loss in New Hampshire, they may decide to give.\u201cIt has been a problem,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign\u2019s communications director. \u201cI think there was a view she would probably have a lot of resources available to her, and I do think that hurt fund-raising early on.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily part of the campaign narrative,\u201d she added. \u201cBut we have a lot of very committed supporters and a small-dollar base that you would like to be the engine of your support.\u201dAccording to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.The Sanders and Clinton fund-raising teams are strikingly different: Mr. Pennington heads a team of three young digital operatives. They are glued to their laptops in a Washington office all day, usually dressed in T-shirts or cozy sweaters. One of them gets lunch at Chipotle every day.Mrs. Clinton is eager to show that she has generated money from small donors even if she trails Mr. Sanders. Contributions under $200 each accounted for almost 20 percent of the total given to the Clinton campaign in 2015.But as a result of her reliance on traditional fund-raising events, she has been forced to interrupt campaigning to fly off to entertain potential contributors. A trip to an event hosted by an investment firm in Philadelphia just before the Iowa caucuses, for example, played into Mr. Sanders\u2019s critique of her as someone who is too cozy with the financial industry and corporate elites.A generation gap is emerging over the importance of electing a woman to the White House. We invite you to share your opinion. The Times may follow up with you.Still, Andy Spahn, a major Los Angeles fund-raiser for Barack Obama who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said a balanced approach was best. Mr. Spahn likened Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign model to Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2008. In that election, Mr. Obama shattered fund-raising records, bringing in roughly $750 million, peeling away wealthy donors like the music producer David Geffen from the Clintons, but also tapping small-dollar donors online.\u201cHillary has a healthy mix of traditional bundlers and online, low-dollar donors, which will be necessary to win in November,\u201d Mr. Spahn said.But in an interview, Mr. Pennington suggested that depending on affluent donors was anachronistic. The Clintons pioneered that path some 30 years ago, building an expansive network of Southern trial lawyers, Hollywood producers and Wall Street executives who found a gracious recipient in Bill Clinton and became the powerhouses of Democratic giving in their generation.\u201cIf we elect Bernie Sanders, I think this kind of high-dollar fund-raising will be extinct,\u201d Mr. Pennington said, \u201cbecause if we are able to get serious campaign finance reform, they will no longer be able to go out and beg for money from multimillionaires at white-tablecloth dinners. They should be scared of this.\u201dNot every candidate has the mass youth appeal of Mr. Sanders, however, and as long as the current campaign finance system exists, bigger donors are likely to maintain a role.Alan Patricof, a New York investor who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Clintons\u2019 races over the years, criticized Mr. Sanders, saying he was making big promises to potential donors, like free college, that he is unlikely to fulfill. Mr. Patricof compared the pitch to a race for student-body president. \u201cYou are sitting in a fifth-grade classroom and someone walks in and says: \u2018I\u2019m running for president of the school. Everybody gets a fudge sundae,\u2019 \u201d he said.Mrs. Clinton, he added, \u201ccomes in and says we have to brush up on our capitals and memorize the Constitution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Supreme Court Vacancy Has Left and Right Ready to Pounce", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s senior adviser and his top lawyer were blunt with liberal activists on a strategy call as they jumped into what political professionals in Washington expect to be one of the hardest-fought Supreme Court battles in a generation. The White House hardly needed to prod the interest groups during the Tuesday call. The outcome of this battle could determine the fate of a vast array of contentious issues for decades to come: immigration, climate change, gun rights, campaign finance, health care, affirmative action, gay rights and abortion.So in record time, the liberal and conservative Washington lobbying and advocacy machines have roared to life as both sides prepare for a fight on a battlefield that includes the White House, Congress and the campaign trail. Advocacy groups are vowing to spend millions of dollars.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the entire progressive movement up against the entire conservative movement,\u201d said Frank Sharry, an immigration activist whose organization was represented in Tuesday\u2019s White House call. \u201cI do think it\u2019s going to be a battle of a different order.\u201dSince 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.On Wednesday, White House officials responded to Republican accusations of hypocrisy by Mr. Obama, who voted to filibuster President George W. Bush\u2019s nomination of Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the court. Mr. Obama, who is now demanding a quick hearing and vote for his next nominee, regrets that vote, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. Mr. Earnest said the president did not believe Democrats should have been \u201clooking for an opportunity to throw sand in the gears.\u201dThat admission is unlikely to satisfy conservatives. Like their liberal counterparts, the leaders of conservative groups have jumped to reorder their priorities as they begin dividing up the tasks: raising money, lobbying senators, firing up constituents, planning radio and television ads, writing letters to editors and creating talking points for television appearances.Moments after Justice Scalia\u2019s death became public, the American Center for Law and Justice, a conservative organization, organized a team of five lawyers to scour the backgrounds of potential nominees, and another team to research the Senate\u2019s procedural rules. The group has so far sent out a million emails to its members and is preparing videos to post on its Facebook page early next week.\u201cThe stakes are as high as anything we have dealt with in Washington in a decade,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, the chief counsel for the law center. \u201cThis is not even the beginning of what this fight will be. It\u2019s full-media, full-legal research, full-government affairs, full-throttle on this.\u201d\u201cScalia was only dead a couple of hours when the rhetoric was already heated,\u201d Mr. Levey said Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we avoid a Borkian experience.\u201dIn an election year, action often shifts away from Washington\u2019s K Street lobbying corridor to the campaign headquarters for presidential candidates. But that changed instantly with the prospect that a sitting Democratic president could deliver a liberal Supreme Court majority by replacing the court\u2019s leading conservative voice.Mr. Obama\u2019s adversaries are determined to stop that from happening, and the stakes are just as high for his supporters.The players are familiar: On the left, the court campaign will be run by groups like the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Alliance for Justice, American Bridge, Americans United for Change, People for the American Way and labor unions. On the right, FreedomWorks, the Judicial Crisis Network, the Family Research Council and the American Center for Law and Justice have begun to take up the fight.The empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.The struggle to shape the court\u2019s future is also drawing combatants from groups that have not typically played central roles in Supreme Court fights. The League of Conservation Voters, for example, which sees the court\u2019s outlook on environmental issues as critical, has begun calling and emailing its 1.5 million members, asking them to reach out to their senators and urge them to confirm Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee this year.\u201cIt\u2019s hugely important that the president nominate someone and the Senate acts,\u201d said Gene Karpinski, the president of the league. \u201cWe will be more engaged in this effort than we ever have before in a Supreme Court nomination. We\u2019ll urge our members to create pressure on the Senate. We want to make sure that message is heard loudly and clearly.\u201dBoth sides agree that the battle will be long, with many advocates using words like \u201cincredible\u201d and \u201cmonumental\u201d to describe it. They also say it will play out in at least three distinct phases, the first of which is underway.Phase 1 will last for the next several weeks, activists on both sides say, and will continue until Mr. Obama announces a nominee. During this phase, the sides will focus on establishing a process that works to their benefit.Republicans, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and supported by the outside groups, will make the case that a nomination should be made by the next president, not Mr. Obama. The president\u2019s coalition will argue that the process should move forward this year.A three-page document of talking points distributed to the progressive groups after the White House call on Tuesday suggested lines like \u201cin America, we have one president at a time\u201d and \u201cthere is plenty of time for Congress to fulfill its responsibility to give the president\u2019s nominee a fair hearing and timely vote.\u201dPhase 2 will begin the moment the president announces his pick. At that point, the arguments over procedure are likely to give way to an intense focus on the nominee.On the conference call, the liberal groups were urged to stick together once a nominee is announced, to defer to the president and to coalesce behind his pick. But there is already some evidence that not all groups will view Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee through the same lens.Some environmental organizations are expressing concerns about one possible candidate, Sri Srinivasan, an appeals court judge who cleared the Senate with a 97-to-0 vote. As a corporate lawyer, he defended Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron, the energy company that went bankrupt after an accounting and fraud scandal. He also represented Exxon Mobil after a human rights group sued the company, accusing it of complicity in human rights abuses committed by state security forces that protect a large natural gas field in Indonesia.\u201cWe think that any potential Supreme Court nominee that has clear ties to big oil and clear ties to two of the worst companies \u2014 Enron and Exxon \u2014 given the issues of climate change and other environmental safety issues that are percolating would be one of the worst picks,\u201d said Jane Kleeb, the head of Bold Nebraska, a group that has lobbied against the Keystone XL oil pipeline.Phase 3 will probably begin in earnest after the Republican and Democratic Parties pick their nominees this summer and the fall campaign begins.\u201cThis is a monumental fight,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said. \u201cIt will be the biggest political fight of the year. It will be huge.\u201dCoral Davenport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Sysco plans to finance the acquisition with new debt and cash, and expects it to be immediately accretive to earnings.The deal comes less than a year after Sysco terminated its $3.5 billion deal with US Foods after regulators determined that the combination would be harmful to consumers by leading to higher prices and lower service.

The Brakes Group itself is nearly six decades old, having been started by three brothers in 1958, to sell poultry to caterers in Britain.The company expanded into producing ready-made meals for the pub market in Britain, eventually growing large enough to list on the London Stock Exchange in 1986 until taken private in 2002.

{"Headline": "Harper Lee Is Memorialized as She Lived: Quietly and Privately", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byMONROEVILLE, Ala. \u2014 Friends and family from around the corner and across the country gathered here on Saturday to pay final respects to Harper Lee, the author whose Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about racial inequality in the South during the Jim Crow era inspired generations of readers.A dense fog that had shrouded this small town lifted as mourners filed into the First United Methodist Church, which Ms. Lee attended for many years, for a simple, private service that lasted about an hour.The relatively small guest list of perhaps 40 people included nephews and other relatives of the publicity-shy author, as well as friends from her hometown and places afar like New York City, where she once lived and had written her celebrated book, \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d\u201cShe controlled what world she wanted to live in,\u201d said Joy Brown, a close friend from New York who, with her husband, financed Ms. Lee\u2019s writing pursuits during the period when she wrote \u201cMockingbird.\u201dThe mood in this town of about 6,300 was muted, like Ms. Lee\u2019s approach to celebrity, which she eschewed. She may have written a book that has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide since its publication in 1960, but there were no news trucks and no police officers outside the church as her coffin, adorned with a spray of red and white roses, was wheeled into the church.\u201cShe wanted to be buried before anyone knew she was dead, and we\u2019re getting as close to it as possible,\u201d said George Landegger, an industrialist and philanthropist, who attended the service.In addition to the private memorial service, the church opened in the afternoon to allow people to offer their sympathies and best wishes to Ms. Lee\u2019s extended family and her lawyer, Tonja B. Carter.Ms. Lee, known here as Nelle, was a Methodist, and Alice Lee held a number of prominent positions with the church and was also its lawyer.Harper Lee was a different story, recalled the Rev. Thomas Butts, who was pastor from 1993 to 1998. \u201cShe did not want to do anything that put her in the public eye,\u201d he said, though she attended church regularly, typically sitting in the fourth or fifth pew with her sister.Ms. Lee was the most celebrated resident in town, private but not a recluse and was often seen out at the restaurants with her sister. But she kept an apartment in New York, even after she moved back to the town where she had grown up.\u201cNelle loved New York,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cShe could keep her privacy intact in New York; she could hide in the open. You see, living in Monroeville is like living in a fishbowl.\u201dHer impact on Monroeville was evident everywhere, from the mockingbirds that adorn some buildings in the town square to the black funereal bows placed on the doors of the old courthouse, now a museum, where Ms. Lee set the scenes for her novel about a lawyer\u2019s fight for justice and tolerance.Outside the old courthouse on Saturday, Jared Anton, a lawyer from Florida, said the character of Atticus Finch had partly inspired his choice of profession, but he said he was disappointed at how reticent some people in town were to talk about Ms. Lee, even after her death.\u201cI have no problem if the lady wants a private funeral,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the impact of this book goes far beyond Monroeville or Monroe County.\u201dAt the service, the eulogy was given by Wayne Flynt, a friend of Ms. Lee\u2019s and professor emeritus of history at Auburn University, who said she had asked him to speak only about her art. \u201cWe gather today to honor a person, a writer, her father, her mother, her siblings and her novel,\u201d Mr. Flynt told the church. \u201cThat is a bit more than I can manage in 15 minutes so I will stick with the novel.\u201dAfterward Hank Conner, Ms. Lee\u2019s eldest nephew, said of Mr. Flynt: \u201cHe delivered the most concise, accurate and fair assessment of \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019 I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201dWhile living at the Meadows, Ms. Lee grew to be nearly blind and deaf and had to rely on a magnifying machine to read. The roster of people who were allowed to visit her shrank over time, which worried some people who felt that Ms. Lee was being isolated by her lawyer, Ms. Carter, who is also the trustee of her estate.Ms. Lee\u2019s will is expected to be probated in Monroeville within the next few weeks. She never married and had no children.Even in death Ms. Lee seemed capable of remaining understated, as her own funeral was overshadowed by that of Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, whose funeral Mass was celebrated on Saturday.One mourner on the website of the Johnson Funeral Home here, which handled the funeral, noted Ms. Lee\u2019s style in a note she wrote for the online guest book.\u201cHey, Boo, you left your mark without a lot of fanfare,\u201d the woman, Sue Dietterle, wrote, referring to a character from her famous novel. \u201cThe recognition and praise seemed to roll off you like water from a duck\u2019s back. I\u2019m pleased you disavowed the limelight of fame, in favor of the familiar company of your true friends and hometown waters. Paddle on, Nelle.\u201dJennifer Crossley Howard and Katherine Webb reported from Monroeville, and Serge F. Kovaleski from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A College Education for Prisoners", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byEditorialStates are finally backing away from the draconian sentencing policies that swept the country at the end of the last century, driving up prison costs and sending too many people to jail for too long, often for nonviolent offenses. Many are now trying to turn around the prison juggernaut by steering drug addicts into treatment instead of jail and retooling parole systems that once sent people back to prison for technical violations.But the most effective way to keep people out of prison once they leave is to give them jobs skills that make them marketable employees. That, in turn, means restarting prison education programs that were shuttered beginning in the 1990s, when federal and state legislators cut funding to show how tough they were on crime.President Obama pointed the country in the right direction last year by creating a pilot program that will allow a limited number of inmates to receive federal Pell Grants to take college courses behind bars. The program will include colleges that either run prison education programs or want to start them. So far, more than 200 schools in 47 states have expressed interest.New Yorkers pay about $60,000 per inmate per year \u2014 a considerable burden given that 40 percent of those who are released return within three years, most for economically driven crimes. But inmates who attend privately financed college classes before release fare much better. A prison education program created by Bard College in 2001 boasts a remarkable recidivism rate of 4 percent for inmates who merely participated in the program and 2.5 percent for those who earned degrees in prison. In addition, research has shown that the public saves $4 to $5 in reimprisonment costs for every $1 it spends on prison education.New York lawmakers who should have jumped at the governor\u2019s proposal ridiculed it instead. Mr. Cuomo has devised a new plan \u2014 paid for partly with private funds \u2014 that does not require legislative approval. But such funding is unreliable and probably unsustainable over the long run. Moreover, the case for full public financing of prison education is stronger than it has ever been.The bar association report calls on all colleges in New York to refrain from using criminal history information in admissions, which has been shown to have virtually no value in predicting lawbreaking on campus. Applicants who check \u201cyes\u201d are now pushed into a supplementary application process that costs them more money and often asks them to produce court and legal documents that do not exist.Nineteen states and 100 cities and counties prohibit public agencies \u2014 and in some cases, private employers \u2014 from asking applicants about criminal convictions until later in the process, when they have had a fair chance to prove their qualifications. The New York State Bar Association wisely calls for colleges to take that same prudent approach in the interest of giving qualified former inmates a better chance at a college education.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Burke, Ex-Suffolk County Police Chief, Pleads Guilty", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byThe former chief, James Burke, 51, who was known for his swaggering confidence as the leader of one of the region\u2019s largest police departments, was subdued in Federal District Court here as the charges against him were read aloud.\u201cI plead guilty, Your Honor,\u201d said Mr. Burke, wearing a drab khaki prison uniform.Since the federal inquiry into Mr. Burke\u2019s actions began some three years ago, investigators have expanded their inquiries and are now examining the workings of the Police Department and the district attorney\u2019s office.Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the investigation was continuing and would seek out those who might have been involved in wrongdoing.\u201cThe defendant violated his oath and responsibilities as a law enforcement officer by exacting personal vengeance, assaulting a handcuffed suspect and abusing his authority as the highest ranking uniformed member of the Suffolk County Police Department,\u201d Mr. Capers said in a statement. \u201cDespite the efforts of the defendant and his co-conspirators to obstruct the federal investigation, he has been brought to justice.\u201dJoseph Conway, Mr. Burke\u2019s lawyer, later told reporters that he planned to argue for a sentence of less than five years in prison for violating the suspect\u2019s civil rights and conspiring to obstruct justice. The maximum possible sentence for the civil rights charge is 10 years in prison; for the obstruction charge, it is 20 years.\u201cHe realized what he did here, and he wants to own up to it,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cHe\u2019s very remorseful.\u201dThe charges against Mr. Burke stemmed from an episode in December 2012 when Christopher Loeb, a heroin addict who financed his $100-a-day habit by breaking into cars, was arrested on suspicion of stealing a duffel bag stuffed with cigars, pornographic DVDs and sex toys from Mr. Burke\u2019s police car.He was brought to a precinct house and shackled to the floor.In a 2013 court hearing, Mr. Loeb testified that when he asked for a lawyer, one detective told him, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Law & Order\u2019; you\u2019re not going to get an attorney.\u201dWhen Mr. Burke entered the interrogation room, Mr. Loeb \u201cwas handcuffed and chained to an eyebolt fastened to the floor,\u201d according to prosecutors.\u201cChief Burke grabbed me by my cheeks and hit me on the top of my head,\u201d Mr. Loeb testified during his 2013 trial, during which he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison.Mr. Loeb responded to the thrashing by calling Mr. Burke \u201ca pervert\u201d and mocking him for the pornography he found in his car, according to federal prosecutors.At that point, prosecutors said, Mr. Burke \u201cwent out of control, screaming and cursing at Loeb and assaulting him until a detective finally said, \u2018Boss, that\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201dAfter the interrogation, Mr. Burke pressured the detectives who witnessed the assault to conceal it.\u201cThose efforts continued even after the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office opened an investigation of the assault in May 2013,\u201d according to a statement released by prosecutors announcing Mr. Burke\u2019s indictment in December.\u201cI find the corruption of an entire department by this defendant is shocking,\u201d Judge Wexler said in December.Investigators are looking into the conduct of two of Mr. Spota\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u2014 Mr. Burke and the district attorney\u2019s top anticorruption prosecutor \u2014 and any role they may have had in what federal prosecutors have described as a conspiracy to obstruct justice, three officials familiar with the investigation told The New York Times earlier this year.The new Suffolk police commissioner, Tim Sini, is a former assistant United States attorney from the Southern District of New York, and he has hired a former federal corruption investigator, John Barry, to review the department\u2019s internal affairs files.At a court hearing after Mr. Burke\u2019s arrest, a federal prosecutor, James Miskiewicz, described a pattern of abuse, including the use of a contractor for the district attorney\u2019s office to install a GPS device on a deputy police commissioner\u2019s car.Mr. Burke was hoping to \u201cto dig up blackmail dirt on her,\u201d Mr. Miskiewicz testified, calling the episode \u201csomething out of the K.G.B.\u201dMr. Spota and Mr. Burke have been close for decades, and the district attorney helped Mr. Burke secure his job as the top officer for much of Long Island, despite a sometimes checkered history.Mr. Burke not only survived that incident but also thrived. He was named chief in 2012, the highest-ranking uniformed position in the department, which, like New York City\u2019s, is led by a civilian commissioner.With some 2,700 sworn officers and over 600 civilian members, the department is one of the largest in the region.Compared with those in other departments, officers in the Suffolk agency are well paid, making $125,000 in base pay. That is about $50,000 more than their counterparts in New York City, and it does not include overtime pay, which can be substantial, or the extra money officers receive for each year on the job.An earlier version of his article misstated James Burke\u2019s appearance when he was in court on Friday. He was wearing a prison uniform, but not ankle chains.An earlier version of this article misstated what Mr. Burke\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Conway, said about his client\u2019s prison sentence.

{"Headline": "HSBC to Keep Headquarters in London Instead of Hong Kong", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byLONDON \u2014 HSBC said on Sunday that it would keep its headquarters in Britain after announcing plans last year to review whether to move its home.The bank, which is based in London but generates more than half of its earnings in Asia, announced a formal review in April, citing increasing regulatory requirements and a tax that had hit banks based in Britain particularly hard.The political environment, however, has shifted. The Conservative Party won full power in the May election after five years in a coalition, and the British government has softened its tone on the banking industry as it hopes to keep London an attractive home for the financial industry.HSBC, Britain\u2019s largest bank by assets, said that the board\u2019s decision was unanimous and that Asia remained \u201cat the heart of the group\u2019s strategy.\u201dStuart T. Gulliver, HSBC\u2019s chief executive, said, \u201cHaving our headquarters in the U.K. and our significant business in Asia Pacific delivers the best of both worlds to our stakeholders.\u201dHSBC, which was founded as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865 in Hong Kong, moved its headquarters to Britain in 1993.The lender had reviewed whether to shift its headquarters in the past, but chose to stay in Britain. On Sunday, the bank said it would revisit the matter only if there were a material change in circumstances.Some shareholders and analysts suggested last year that HSBC would be better off with its headquarters elsewhere, particularly as the costs of the changing regulatory environment in Britain continued to mount.By 2019, banks in Britain will be required to shield their retail operations here from the effects of investment banking and other activities in the event of another financial crisis \u2014 a process known as ring fencing. That is one of several added costs that lenders are facing as part of structural reforms after the financial crisis.HSBC and other lenders based in Britain have also faced a stiff tax known as a bank levy. The levy was put in place in 2010 to help finance efforts to rescue the financial system, but it has also generated revenue for other programs.Under the levy, banks based in Britain have been taxed on their global balance sheets, while overseas competitors are taxed only on their British operations.HSBC\u2019s payment had more than doubled since 2012. The tax cost the bank about $1.1 billion in 2014, when HSBC reported a profit of $13.7 billion. It amounted to $472 million in 2012.Before HSBC announced job cuts last year as part of a reshaping of the bank, it employed about 46,000 people in Britain.Sunday\u2019s announcement had been telegraphed in British newspapers as the government tempered its statements when it came to the banking industry.In June, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, promised a \u201cnew settlement\u201d in the government\u2019s approach to the financial industry, reflecting somewhat of a change in tone after years of escalating fines and tough regulatory overhauls.Mr. Osborne also promised to reduce the bank levy beginning this year, and to change the way it is calculated in future years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan by Institute in Princeton Clashes With a Park\u2019s Revolutionary War Past", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byPRINCETON, N.J. \u2014 The Battle of Princeton, which some historians say changed the course of the Revolutionary War, unfolded on Jan. 3, 1777, when Gen. George Washington rallied his troops to defeat the British Redcoats. The battle was fought in difficult conditions, and though it was fierce, the fighting ended quickly.The construction site is next to the state park. But the problem, according to preservationists and some historians, is that the site sits on land that happens to be the precise location of the battle\u2019s climactic moment, the spot where Washington staged a daring counterattack.Instead of bayonet charges and musket fire, this conflict has unleashed more modern means of warfare: legal briefs and wetland studies, public hearings and dueling historical assessments.\u201cThe place where the charge first struck and broke the British lines occurred right where they want to put the development,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s right on top \u2014 there\u2019s no sugarcoating it.\u201dThe project has raised philosophical questions of how best to honor historic events \u2014 whether to preserve the land on which they occurred or to focus instead on education while allowing the land to be put to new uses.For its part, the institute has enlisted historians who say, in essence, that the Battle of Princeton was sprawled across a huge area. While some fighting may have occurred on the seven acres where the housing development is proposed, there is no evidence that Washington led the decisive charge in that spot.\u201cThe shooting actually takes place for several miles west of town and through the center of town, where Princeton University is today,\u201d Professor Peterson said. \u201cThe idea that this Battlefield Society is saying that this set of acres was the centerpiece of the battle is a misunderstanding on its face of what the whole thing was.\u201dFounded in 1930, the institute, which is not affiliated with Princeton University, was conceived as a sort of academic village \u2014 an intellectual oasis where scholars could pursue research in history, mathematics and the natural and social sciences without the distractions of teaching or the pressure to publish. In recent years, as housing prices in Princeton have soared, some faculty members have had to live far from campus.The institute\u2019s 800-acre campus \u2014 nearly three-quarters of which is protected from development \u2014 has some housing, though it is primarily for visiting scholars from around the world. The institute also wants to accommodate its 25 full-time faculty members, to enable, as its website explains, \u201cfrequent opportunities to personally interact, either intentionally or by chance.\u201dThe institute has already altered its plan in several ways. Instead of 15 single-family houses each on about an acre, as the institute originally proposed, the plan now calls for eight attached townhouses and seven homes on seven acres, thus preserving more open space.At the suggestion of experts, including two historians, James M. McPherson and David Hackett Fischer, the institute is moving the planned housing farther from the battlefield park\u2019s border, using more natural materials and colors on the facades and creating a screen of vegetation.Perhaps the most striking adjustment in plans was the institute\u2019s decision to create a 200-foot-wide buffer between the faculty housing and the battlefield park. When combined with adjacent land, it is the equivalent of more than 14 acres adjoining the 74-acre battlefield park that will be protected from future development.\u201cWe believe that, quite apart from the legal issues, that we have always paid attention to what impact the project might have on the battlefield,\u201d said John Masten, the institute\u2019s associate director for finance and administration.Rather than using the project\u2019s link to history to try to stop it, opponents are now turning to land-use law, including the federal Clean Water Act. The housing development, they say, infringes on protected wetlands, though state officials say they have found no evidence of that.\u201cI firmly believe it\u2019s sacred ground,\u201d said State Senator Kip Bateman, a Republican who has worked with the Princeton Battlefield Society. \u201cOur forefathers fought on that field and died. It should not be developed. I don\u2019t know how the people at the institute can live with themselves. That was one of the battles that turned the Revolution around.\u201dThe Civil War Trust said the institute rejected an offer last year of $4.5 million for the 22 acres surrounding the housing site. \u201cThey said this project was a critical need,\u201d Mr. Campi recalled. \u201cTo us, it is astounding that faculty housing is a critical need.\u201d Mr. Masten said the location best suited the institute\u2019s needs.Professor Peterson acknowledged that preserving vast acres to honor the victims of a battle may make sense in the case of the Civil War, when thousands of men perished in a single conflict, many of them unidentified. In the Battle of Princeton, however, only a few dozen men were killed.\u201cMost historians aren\u2019t trying to stand in the way of historical commemoration,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this one seems so wrongheaded to me in the face of an organization that has really good reasons for doing what it wants to do. This is one of the great centers of learning in the country. I\u2019m not in a position to think that that\u2019s chopped liver.\u201dAn earlier version of a home page headline for this article could have been read to suggest incorrectly that Princeton University was a party to the dispute.

There have been coding lessons in schools, so-called weekend hackathons for students to code together for as long as 24 consecutive hours and training institutes for teachers across the borough as educators, leaders and others aim to help students navigate an increasingly digital world and better prepare for jobs in the future.\u201cThe problem is there aren\u2019t enough quality, free programs out there,\u201d said Brandy McNeil, the library\u2019s associate director of technology training programs. She added that the library, which currently has 10 technology instructors teaching coding, was seeking financing to expand the program and to hire additional instructors.For students like Joshua Lee, 17, learning to code is another way to address issues in daily life. Joshua, who said he grew up watching young black men in his Harlem neighborhood get roughed up by the police, was part of the group of students who built the Protect & Swerve website and app during a Bronx hackathon in January.\u201cIt creates a community for teens to gather together and learn and read about the topic and see it\u2019s not overhyped,\u201d he said.Coding has taken on particular importance in the Bronx, which has lagged behind every borough except Staten Island in attracting technology jobs, according to census data compiled by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation. Of the estimated 148,598 people employed by technology companies across the city in 2014, just 3,093 of them, or 2 percent, worked in the Bronx. In contrast, Manhattan had the largest share, with 123,687 technology workers.Tom O\u2019Connell, program director for Code/Interactive, says his organization has taught coding to more than a thousand Bronx middle and high school students since 2013 through classroom lessons and hackathons that regularly draw more than a hundred students. Code/Interactive has also helped place 61 students in paid technology internships and taught coding to 47 teachers at a summer institute with the goal of helping them bring those lessons back to their classrooms.\u201cIt\u2019s the students who know how to program that can have an impact on their world,\u201d Mr. Grossman, who supports the city\u2019s efforts to bring computer science to all schools, said.Steph Taveras, 14, a ninth grader at the Bronx Academy for Software Engineering, said she did not know what HTML was when she started school. But to her surprise, she found coding languages easy to learn.\u201cI thought it would be really hard and pointless because I wouldn\u2019t understand anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually really enjoy it.\u201dFor her birthday in October, she chose to attend an all-day hackathon rather than go out with friends.\u201cMy parents were like, \u2018Is that what you really want to do?\u2019\u201d she recalled.It was.

At times it snowed so hard I could hardly see anything out there at all. A wood hut. A concrete wall. When the storm finally broke three days later, some 40 inches of snow had fallen and everything sprang to life.The timing was ideal. A few hours earlier, I had arrived in Pristina, the red-roofed capital of Kosovo, just as the first flakes corkscrewed their way to earth. It was February, frigid, and a worsted wool blanket stretched across the Balkan sky. I threw my skis into the back of a 4Runner with two Serbs I had hired to pick me up, and we rode south in silence toward the Sharr Mountains along the Macedonian border. In an hour we\u2019d be at Brezovica, the most delightfully dysfunctional ski resort in Europe.There near the Serbian enclave of Strpce about 35 miles south of Pristina, storms slam into the 8,000-foot Sharr Mountains that rocket out of the Metohija basin with abrupt ridges and mighty shoulders cupping some of the continent\u2019s most extensive pasturelands. Back in the \u201980s, the resort\u2019s hey-decade, 10 lifts, including five surface tows, serviced nine named runs, though the real magic happened in the go-anywhere terrain of the open north-facing bowls. D.J.s from Belgrade and Skopje kept the parties going until dawn. In the morning you might awake to find so much snow had fallen that even the wild chamois were stuck.Brezovica survived the wars but not the peace that followed. Throughout the early 2000s, INEX, the Serbian socially owned enterprise that managed the resort, stopped investing in Brezovica and everything began to crumble. One of the main hotels, a graceless rectangular prism, became a drafty concrete husk. The disco floor went cold. One by one the lifts failed, and by 2013 none of them worked. The storied resort was all but dead.The scope of the proposal is mind-boggling. The consortium has until May to put the financing in order, meaning work could begin this summer. When complete, the resort, at 8,000 acres, will be the size of one and a half Vails, nearly all of which is skiable and inside a national park. It will have the vertical drop of a Crested Butte, about 2,600 feet. The number of hotel beds will grow from 700 to 7,000 \u2014 three times as many currently available across the entire country. Visitors will have 100 miles of slopes, high-speed lifts and three gondola-linked villages. Two international airports, Pristina and Skopje, are no more than a 90-minute drive. One day Brezovica might even provide a more budget-friendly alternative to skiing in the Alps.Skeptics abound, of course. Can the next greatest place to ski in Europe really be in a tiny war-weary country so obscure it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone vacationing there at all? Is a mega-resort the most sustainable way to attract tourists? Will they even find enough snow on a warming planet? Never mind Kosovo\u2019s rampant corruption and politics that are so cantankerous that politicians themselves have lobbed tear gas canisters in their own chambers at least six times in the last few months to disrupt their own proceedings.And yet there is hope.\u201cIf we can do this, we can do anything,\u201d said Manik Begolli, an Albanian Kosovar who worked on a public-private partnership team contracted by the United States Agency for International Development to help find an investor.Maybe. For the moment, though, I just hoped I could ski.Seven-Elevens have bigger parking lots than Brezovica\u2019s but that\u2019s where the Serbs dropped me off just after dark as the storm gathered intensity. Igor Nikolcevic met me there in a camouflage snowboard jacket. He was 42, a Serb with closely cropped hair and soulful eyes. He grabbed my ski bag and led me up an icy path to a pizzeria that he started with his wife, Draginja, and which he named after his daughter, Tina. Tina now lives in Pristina. I could have her room, fuzzy kitten posters and all.I followed Igor into the heart of the village, a collection of mostly hand-built cottages run by hangers-on who have eked out a living by offering basic services to the few who make it this far. There was the Cafe Braca and Restaurant Ljuboten. Skis lined the racks in a shop called Dane. The main chairlift out of the village, an ancient double chair, stood eerily quiet, the seats glazed in ice.\u201cWhat time will the lifts start running?\u201d I asked.\u201cYou mean, if they start running,\u201d Igor replied.That was actually an improvement over the last time I was here, in 2013, when INEX was hundreds of thousands of euros behind on its power bill and the utility company had cut electricity to the lifts. All was not lost. Instead, for \u20ac7 \u2014 about $9 at the time \u2014 the Dane guys would give you a ride to the top in a snow-grooming machine, where an entire resort\u2019s worth of untracked powder tugged at my tips.It was some of the best skiing I\u2019d ever had for less than a nickel a turn: an unlimited supply of deep, creamy snow on a steep, consistent fall line. Others just hiked up a small rise with sleds or sipped brandy outside while music pumped from competing loudspeakers. I loved the vibe and vowed to return.This time, two years later, there was at least the possibility that the lifts might run. Sometime in 2014, as the French were quietly studying the resort\u2019s prospects, a cadre of groups, including the Kosovo Electricity Corporation, local officials and the minister of trade and industry, hashed out a deal to get two of the chairlifts spinning again. The equipment was still old, maybe even from the 1970s, and too unsafe to operate in a blizzard. I would have to wait for fairer skies to ride them.Igor pushed open a door and the pizzeria sighed a breath of warm air. Christmas lights hung from the log cabin frame and spilled a molten glow on the snow outside. Snowshoes, wooden skis and photographs of wintry scenes from the resort\u2019s early days decorated the walls. A fire crackled in the wood stove. A pizzeria in Kosovo is one of the coziest places I know.I took a seat at a long wooden table next to a local with an even longer face. His house two doors down had just succumbed to a chimney fire. With no firefighters to navigate the winding, snowy road up from Strpce in time, the men of the village had rallied to form a bucket brigade and fell a flame-licked tree. That saved the village but the house, a lovely wood and stone cottage, was a loss.\u201cIt went up like paper,\u201d said the owner, Andrej Kavcic. He poured two shots of slivovitz, the plum brandy, and handed me one. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou pick yourself up and move on. What else.\u201dStoicism seems to be a national trait in Kosovo, but there is no mistaking that the country is picking itself up. Some 80 percent of the population was displaced during the war. Now new furniture stores sit along new highways lined with new gas stations. The Pristina airport underwent a \u20ac180 million expansion in 2013 and is now the third-busiest airport in the old Yugoslavia after Belgrade and Zagreb. Problems persist, but the country is making strides to protect its landscape, integrate into Europe and normalize relations with Belgrade, the reason behind parliament\u2019s self-tear-gassing attacks.The resort\u2019s rebirth comes at a time when Kosovo could really use jobs. Drive around the country and you\u2019ll see smartly dressed people in cafes, in parks, in front of stores, anywhere but at work. The resort could provide as many as 3,000 jobs, some temporary, many permanent, in a country where half the population is under 30 and 58 percent of the work force is \u201cinactive.\u201dBut more than that, travel insiders around the Balkans have long yearned to trade the region\u2019s oily image of strife for that of the crisp fabric of an emerging adventure-travel destination. The efforts appear to be working. In 2014, 3.7 million international tourists visited Albania, up from about 645,000 in 2004. And in Montenegro, you can sea kayak through the watercress on Skadar Lake or catch feisty trout in green Macedonian streams, both with guides.Few Balkan countries beyond Croatia and Greece can entice transoceanic travelers as stand-alone destinations at the moment but, collectively, places like Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania can make for a wildly fascinating itinerary. Kosovo wants in on that action. Brezovica may be its best shot.\u201cKosovo is absolutely ready for something like this,\u201d said Pascal Roux, the chief executive of MDP Consulting and leader of the French consortium. \u201cBrezovica could be the pearl of the Balkans.\u201dMaybe so, but \u201cit\u2019s just hugely important to be sure it\u2019s done right,\u201d said Christopher Doyle, executive director for Europe of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, which champions sustainable adventure travel markets. What is needed, he said, are \u201cthoughtful supporting efforts to engage the local community and protect the environment.\u201dAcross the Balkans, there is little doubt that skiing is having a moment. Ecosign, a Canadian mountain resort planning firm that has designed Alpine skiing venues for five Winter Olympics, has completed 15 master plans for new or drastically reorganized resorts, including three in Macedonia, four in Serbia and two in Greece. A Dubai-based firm in December announced plans to build a $5 billion \u201ctourist city\u201d with thousands of holiday homes near Bosnia\u2019s Bjelasnica mountain, where the Olympics were held. Kopaonik, Serbia\u2019s most developed ski resort, added a new six-person heated chairlift last year and a new hotel. Poiana Brasov in Romania recently spent \u20ac30 million expanding its terrain, adding snow-making and upgrading lifts.If anyone stands to lose on the Brezovica deal, it\u2019s Igor. His grandfather, Radojko Nikolcevic, was the ski area\u2019s first general manager after the resort opened in 1954. In the \u201970s he built a hut that would become Tina\u2019s pizzeria under Igor in 1993. Today the Nikolcevices earn enough money selling pizzas in winter to last them the rest of the year. Now the consortium will level almost everything \u2014 the hotels, the village, the lifts. The Nikolcevices will get about $250,000 in expropriation fees, but money isn\u2019t the issue.\u201cWe\u2019re happy people want to invest in the resort but never in my life have I been as afraid for my future as I am right now,\u201d Igor said. \u201cThe mountains are in me.\u201dOver the next three days a frustrating pattern emerged. Each morning I awoke to another foot of snow, and each morning the lifts weren\u2019t running. The Dane guys weren\u2019t offering the seven-euro special. Hiking up alone would be misery. Still, I hoped for the best.I lounged around Tina\u2019s watching the snowflakes hit the windows or took naps under a shaggy blanket in Tina\u2019s old room. The Nikolcevices treated me like family. We sat near the fire talking about life in Kosovo. On the war: \u201cStupid politicians caused it.\u201d On being Serbs surrounded by Albanians: \u201cWe never have an argument.\u201d On why I should not clear the table: \u201cThis is Balkans,\u201d Draginja said. \u201cWomen do this.\u201dI helped anyway and then serviced my macho deficits by grabbing a shovel to clear snow off the pizzeria\u2019s roof. The electricity flickered on and off.\u201cThere is something beautiful when everything is broken,\u201d Draginja told me later over a meal of tangy mountain cheese, winter cabbage and a Serbian dish of shredded pork called duvan cvarci. \u201cEveryone comes together.\u201dOn the fourth day, the storm thinned into a delicate fog, and, miracle of miracles, the lifts creaked to life. At last I could ski.I raced out the door. Classic rock blared from the Che & Fox cafe. Vendors jammed folding tables into the snow to peddle Serbian beer, Austrian juices and Lucky Strikes. A man in the parking lot sat next to a delivery truck with a cardboard sign: ski rentals \u20ac5. I clicked into my own skis and scooted up to a double chair called Livada, or \u201cmeadow\u201d in Serbian. It rose lazily over an abandoned stone mansion called Stojko\u2019s house, one of the few buildings that will remain. A man stood next to the entrance ready to check my lift ticket. I didn\u2019t have one. I asked where to buy it.\u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t need a ticket,\u201d said a voice in English behind me. I turned to see two men on skis. One of them in a red jacket shuffled forward, said something in Serbian and pressed about $3 worth of coins into the attendant\u2019s palm. \u201cCome, come,\u201d my new friend said, and off we went.Rexhep Krasniqi, 58, had fled Kosovo 23 years ago as a refugee and now worked as a contractor in London. He had returned to ski with his younger brother, Isak, who had run a refugee camp in Macedonia before landing a job in finance. Isak was now unemployed but not worried. \u201cWe are good at surviving,\u201d he said.I spent most of the day skiing with the Krasniqis, who explained the ticket system. A price list said I could buy anything from a single ride to 10 days of unlimited rides, but almost no one consulted it. Instead they negotiated rates with the attendant. A single ride cost about $3.25, though Rexhep had bargained to get both of us at least two rides for that. As best as I could tell a day pass cost about $11.Now, new for this winter, workers have installed an electronic ticket-reader and day passes have jumped to about $21, a fortune when the average worker earns about $380 a month. \u201cNo more corruption,\u201d a local told me later, \u201cbut less skiers.\u201dWe picked our way through a steep notch called the Lion\u2019s Gate and found untracked lines through the trees. Wind-powered snow roared off the ridge behind us in great white flames. The snow hissed violently off the bottoms of my skis to form blue contrails. Most of the terrain was intermediate to expert-only. The revamped resort will have more beginner runs.Eventually we stopped for lunch on a patio at a slopeside hut called Cafe Collmar, where a waiter brought us coffee, brandy and cheesy bread. Rexhep refused to let me pay the $5 bill. \u201cNo Albanian in Kosovo will ever let you pay,\u201d he said, politely but firmly. \u201cYou are American, and to us Americans are like Jesuses.\u201dMy last day dawned a piercing blue and the air shimmered with suspended snow crystals. This time Igor and a friend from Belgrade, Marko Nikolic, showed me a wild backcountry run that dropped through miles of open powder into a tight stream bed. Marko, a mountain guide, then invited me to climb to a high point in the resort, 8,274-foot Pribreg mountain, where we could find the longest, most challenging runs back to the base.We rode Livada up as high as it went, then I slung my skis over my shoulder and kicked steps up the sastrugi beyond the top station. We gained an easy ridge and made the summit after 45 minutes. A lift once came all the way up here but it hadn\u2019t worked in years, and the top wheelhouse was completely entombed in tons of feathered ice. The slope below was so steep it gave me vertigo.Soon all of this would be very different. I tried to picture a brand-new lift stitched into the rock, the sprawling village where Tina\u2019s once stood, and the legs I\u2019d need to ski all those new runs. I had one foot in Macedonia, the other in Kosovo, and five more countries in view.It may have been selfish, but Brezovica felt perfect as is. We have so many polished resorts already but so few that can foster skiing at its most authentic without any flash. Even more selfish: What do you do when you know one of your favorite places to visit, a secret, is about to blow up? Don\u2019t you long for it to stay the way it is?Brezovica has to change, of course. As anyone in Kosovo knows, stop moving for long enough and someone will come bury you.Marko wasted no time. He strapped on his snowboard. I lowered my goggles. Then we both pushed off and floated through a beautiful, broken world.Expect to pay about 50 euros each way for transfers from Pristina. Lift tickets now cost \u20ac20 a day.Tim Neville, who lives in Oregon, writes frequently about the outdoors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton, \u2018Smart Power\u2019 and a Dictator\u2019s Fall", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "The Libya GambleThe president was wary. The secretary of state was persuasive. But the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi left Libya a failed state and a terrorist haven.Supported byIn her suite at the Westin, she and Mr. Jibril, a political scientist with a doctorate from the University of Pittsburgh, spoke at length about the fast-moving military situation in Libya. But Mrs. Clinton was clearly also thinking about Iraq, and its hard lessons for American intervention.\u201cShe was asking every question you could imagine,\u201d Mr. Jibril recalled.Mrs. Clinton was won over. Opposition leaders \u201csaid all the right things about supporting democracy and inclusivity and building Libyan institutions, providing some hope that we might be able to pull this off,\u201d said Philip H. Gordon, one of her assistant secretaries. \u201cThey gave us what we wanted to hear. And you do want to believe.\u201dHer conviction would be critical in persuading Mr. Obama to join allies in bombing Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s forces. In fact, Mr. Obama\u2019s defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, would later say that in a \u201c51-49\u201d decision, it was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support that put the ambivalent president over the line.The consequences would be more far-reaching than anyone imagined, leaving Libya a failed state and a terrorist haven, a place where the direst answers to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s questions have come to pass.This is the story of how a woman whose Senate vote for the Iraq war may have doomed her first presidential campaign nonetheless doubled down and pushed for military action in another Muslim country. As she once again seeks the White House, campaigning in part on her experience as the nation\u2019s chief diplomat, an examination of the intervention she championed shows her at what was arguably her moment of greatest influence as secretary of state. It is a working portrait rich with evidence of what kind of president she might be, and especially of her expansive approach to the signal foreign-policy conundrum of today: whether, when and how the United States should wield its military power in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.From the earliest days of the Libya debate, Mrs. Clinton was a diligent student and unrelenting inquisitor, absorbing fat briefing books, inviting dissenting views from subordinates, studying foreign counterparts to learn how to win them over. She was a pragmatist, willing to improvise \u2014 to try the bank-shot solution. But above all, in the view of many who have watched her up close, her record on Libya illustrates how, facing a national-security or foreign-policy quandary, she was inclined to act \u2014 in marked contrast to Mr. Obama\u2019s more reticent approach.Anne-Marie Slaughter, her director of policy planning at the State Department, notes that in conversation and in her memoir, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly speaks of wanting to be \u201ccaught trying.\u201d In other words, she would rather be criticized for what she has done than for having done nothing at all.\u201cShe\u2019s very careful and reflective,\u201d Ms. Slaughter said. \u201cBut when the choice is between action and inaction, and you\u2019ve got risks in either direction, which you often do, she\u2019d rather be caught trying.\u201dThe New York Times\u2019s examination of the intervention offers a detailed accounting of how Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deep belief in America\u2019s power to do good in the world ran aground in a tribal country with no functioning government, rival factions and a staggering quantity of arms. The Times interviewed more than 50 American, Libyan and European officials, including many of the principal actors. Virtually all agreed to comment on the record. They expressed regret, frustration and in some cases bewilderment about what went wrong and what might have been done differently.Was the mistake the decision to intervene in the first place, or the mission creep from protecting civilians to ousting a dictator, or the failure to send a peacekeeping force in the aftermath?Mrs. Clinton declined to be interviewed. But in public, she has said it is \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d how things will turn out in Libya and has called for a more interventionist approach in Syria.Libya\u2019s descent into chaos began with a rushed decision to go to war, made in what one top official called a \u201cshadow of uncertainty\u201d as to Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s intentions. The mission inexorably evolved even as Mrs. Clinton foresaw some of the hazards of toppling another Middle Eastern strongman. She pressed for a secret American program that supplied arms to rebel militias, an effort never before confirmed.Now Libya, with a population smaller than that of Tennessee, poses an outsize security threat to the region and beyond, calling into question whether the intervention prevented a humanitarian catastrophe or merely helped create one of a different kind.A growing trade in humans has sent a quarter-million refugees north across the Mediterranean, with hundreds drowning en route. A civil war in Libya has left the country with two rival governments, cities in ruins and more than 4,000 dead.\u201cWe had a dream,\u201d said Mr. Jibril, who served as Libya\u2019s first interim prime minister. \u201cAnd to be honest with you, we had a golden opportunity to bring this country back to life. Unfortunately, that dream was shattered.\u201dPresident Obama has called failing to do more in Libya his biggest foreign policy lesson. And G\u00e9rard Araud, the French ambassador to the United Nations during the revolution, is deeply troubled by the aftermath of the 2011 intervention: the Islamic State only \u201c300 miles from Europe,\u201d a refugee crisis that \u201cis a human tragedy as well as a political one\u201d and the destabilization of much of West Africa.\u201cYou have to make a moral choice: a blood bath in Benghazi and keeping Qaddafi in power, or what is happening now,\u201d Mr. Araud said. \u201cIt is a tough question, because now Western national interests are very much impacted by what is happening in Libya.\u201dIt was late afternoon on March 15, 2011, and Mr. Araud had just left the office when his phone rang. It was his American counterpart, Susan E. Rice, with a pointed message.\u201cShe says, and I quote, \u2018You are not going to drag us into your shitty war,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Araud, now France\u2019s ambassador in Washington. \u201cShe said, \u2018We\u2019ll be obliged to follow and support you, and we don\u2019t want to.\u2019 The conversation got tense. I answered, \u2018France isn\u2019t a U.S. subsidiary.\u2019 It was the Obama policy at the time that they didn\u2019t want a new Arab war.\u201dIn the preceding weeks, a series of high-level meetings had grappled with the escalating rebellion, and some younger White House aides believed the president should join the international effort.But a far more formidable lineup was outspoken against an American commitment, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Tom Donilon, the national security adviser; and Mr. Gates, the defense secretary, who did not want to divert American air power or attention away from Afghanistan and Iraq. If the Europeans were so worried about Libya, they argued, let them take responsibility for its future.\u201cI think at one point I said, \u2018Can I finish the two wars I\u2019m already in before you guys go looking for a third one?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gates recalled. Colonel Qaddafi, he said, \u201cwas not a threat to us anywhere. He was a threat to his own people, and that was about it.\u201dSome senior intelligence officials had deep misgivings about what would happen if Colonel Qaddafi lost control. In recent years, the Libyan dictator had begun aiding the United States in its fight against Al Qaeda in North Africa.\u201cHe was a thug in a dangerous neighborhood,\u201d said Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time. \u201cBut he was keeping order.\u201dThen there was Secretary Clinton. Early in Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, she had worked hard to win the trust of the man who had bested her in a tough primary campaign in 2008, and she sometimes showed anxiety about being cut out of his inner circle. (In one 2009 email, she fretted to aides: \u201cI heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go?\u201d)Mrs. Clinton had cultivated a close relationship with Mr. Gates. Both tended to be more hawkish than the president. They had raised concerns about how rapidly he wanted to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. More recently, they had argued that Mr. Obama should not be too hasty in dropping support for Hosni Mubarak, the embattled Egyptian leader, whom Mrs. Clinton had known since her years as the first lady.But they had lost out to the younger aides \u2014 \u201cthe backbenchers,\u201d Mr. Gates called them, who he said argued that in the moral clash of the Arab Spring, \u201cMr. President, you\u2019ve got to be on the right side of history.\u201dIn Libya, Mrs. Clinton had a new opportunity to support the historic change that had just swept out the leaders of its neighbors Egypt and Tunisia. And Libya seemed a tantalizingly easy case \u2014 with just six million people, no sectarian divide and plenty of oil.But the debate was handicapped by sketchy intelligence. Top State Department officials were busy trying to evacuate the American Embassy, fearing that the Libyan leader might use diplomats as hostages. There was no inside information on whether, or on what scale, Colonel Qaddafi would carry out his threats.\u201cWe, the U.S., did not have a particularly good handle on what was going on inside Libya,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a State Department aide who moved to the National Security Council as the Libya debate began. American officials were relying largely on news reports, he said.\u201cOf course, he would have lined up the tanks and just gone after folks,\u201d said David H. Petraeus, the retired general and former C.I.A. director.Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top foreign-policy aide at State and now in her campaign, said her view was that \u201cwe have to live in a world of risks.\u201d In assessing the situation in Libya, he said, \u201cshe didn\u2019t know for certain at the time, nor did any of us, what would happen \u2014 only that it passed a risk threshold that demanded that we look very hard at the response.\u201dSo, after some initial doubts, Mrs. Clinton diverged from the other senior members of the administration.The comparison with Mr. Biden was revealing. For the vice president, according to Antony J. Blinken, then his national security adviser and now deputy secretary of state, the lesson of Iraq was crucial \u2014 \u201cwhat Biden called not the day after, but the decade after.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Mr. Blinken continued. \u201cThere is going to be some kind of vacuum, and how\u2019s it going to be filled, and what are we doing to fill it?\u201d Former Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s famous adage about Iraq \u2014 if \u201cyou break it, you own it\u201d \u2014 loomed large.\u201cThe thing about Rwanda that\u2019s important is it showed the cost of inaction,\u201d said James B. Steinberg, who served as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deputy through July 2011. \u201cBut I think the reason Bosnia and Kosovo figured so importantly is they demonstrated there were ways of being effective and there were lessons of what worked and didn\u2019t work.\u201dOn the same March afternoon when Ambassador Rice was telling her French colleague at the United Nations to back off, President Obama and his security cabinet were arrayed in the White House situation room. Speaking on the video screen from Cairo was Secretary Clinton, just arrived from Paris.The day before, at lunch with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, she \u201cwas tough, she was bullish\u201d on the idea of intervention in Libya \u2014 the \u201cperfect ally,\u201d recalled Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s senior diplomatic adviser, Jean-David Levitte.But now Mrs. Clinton did not directly push Mr. Obama to intervene in Libya. Nor did she make an impassioned moral case, according to several people in the room.Instead, she described Mr. Jibril, the opposition leader, as impressive and reasonable. She conveyed her surprise that Arab leaders not only supported military action but, in some cases, were willing to participate. Mostly, though, she warned that the French and British would go ahead with airstrikes on their own, potentially requiring the United States to step in later if things went badly.He recalled her saying: \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t see what the mood is here, and how this has a kind of momentum of its own. And we will be left behind, and we\u2019ll be less capable of shaping this.\u2019\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s account of a unified European-Arab front powerfully influenced Mr. Obama. \u201cBecause the president would never have done this thing on our own,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.Mr. Gates, among others, thought Mrs. Clinton\u2019s backing decisive. Mr. Obama later told him privately in the Oval Office, he said, that the Libya decision was \u201c51-49.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that Hillary\u2019s support for the broader mission in Libya put the president on the 51 side of the line for a more aggressive approach,\u201d Mr. Gates said. Had the secretaries of state and defense both opposed the war, he and others said, the president\u2019s decision might have been politically impossible.Having decided to act, Mr. Obama questioned military leaders about the effectiveness of a no-fly zone, the Europeans\u2019 favored military response. When they told him that it could not prevent a massacre, Mr. Obama directed his staff to draft a new, tougher United Nations resolution.There remained only one real obstacle: Russia could block a Security Council resolution with a veto. Mrs. Clinton had done her best to develop a relationship with Russia\u2019s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, listening to his tales of tagging polar bears and tracking Siberian tigers.\u201cHer theory on Putin is, this is a person with some passions \u2014 if you get him going on those passions, your capacity to try and deal with him is improved,\u201d one Clinton aide said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want another war,\u201d she told Mr. Lavrov, stressing that the mission was limited to protecting civilians.\u201cI take your point about not seeking another war,\u201d she recalled him responding. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t get one.\u201dIn the end, Mrs. Clinton would acknowledge that Colonel Qaddafi himself had helped win over the Russians, by giving a fiery speech just before the Security Council vote calling his opponents \u201cthe rats\u201d and vowing to hunt them \u201chouse by house, alley by alley.\u201dTwo days later, Mr. Sarkozy met with Mrs. Clinton and David Cameron, the British prime minister, at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris to discuss the next move. The French president emphasized that within a day or so, Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s troops would be inside Benghazi, mingling with civilians, making it difficult or impossible to use air power against them.Then he played his trump card. French fighter jets were already in the air, he said. But, he added, \u201cthis is a collective decision, and I will recall them if you want me to,\u201d Mr. Levitte said. Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s maneuver had abruptly pushed forward the timing of the operation, but for all of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s irritation, she was not prepared to object.\u201cI\u2019m not going to be the one to recall the planes and create the massacre in Benghazi,\u201d she grumbled to an aide. And the bombing began.About the time the air campaign began, Charles R. Kubic, a retired rear admiral, received a message from a senior Libyan military officer proposing military-to-military negotiations for a 72-hour cease-fire, potentially leading to an arranged exit for Colonel Qaddafi and his family.But after he approached the American military command for Africa, Admiral Kubic said, he was directed to end the talks. The orders, he was told, had come from \u201coutside the Pentagon,\u201d though aides to both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton said the offer had never made it to their level. He was baffled by the lack of interest in exploring an option he thought might lead to a less bloody transition.\u201cThe question that stays with me is, why didn\u2019t you spend 72 hours giving peace a chance?\u201d he said.The answer, at least in part, was that the two sides had started from positions of mutual mistrust.There was \u201cenvoy proliferation,\u201d said Mr. Chollet, who monitored such exchanges from the National Security Council.The Americans did not believe that the Libyans purporting to speak for the leader could actually deliver a peaceful transfer of power. Colonel Qaddafi, the Americans thought, would simply use a cease-fire as an opportunity to regroup.\u201cMy view is that there was never a serious offer from Qaddafi to step down from power,\u201d said Gene A. Cretz, who preceded Mr. Stevens as the American ambassador in Libya. \u201cI firmly believe that none of those characters around him ever had the gumption to raise the issue with him personally.\u201dFor the Libyan leader and his inner circle, episodes like the one Admiral Kubic described were proof that the Americans had no desire to negotiate, said Mohamed Ismail, a top aide to Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s son Seif and frequent envoy to the West. \u201cThey just wanted to get rid of Qaddafi,\u201d he said.The Libyans saw the threatened intervention not as a noble act to save lives, as Mrs. Clinton portrayed it, but in far darker terms. After all, Colonel Qaddafi, fearing the fate of Saddam Hussein, had abandoned his nuclear program and was sharing intelligence with the C.I.A. in the fight against Al Qaeda. Mrs. Clinton herself had publicly welcomed one of the leader\u2019s sons to the State Department in 2009.Now Colonel Qaddafi saw deep treachery, ingratitude and mercantile revenge. He railed to anyone who would listen that he was Libya\u2019s only bulwark against extremism, that without him the country would become a terrorist haven.\u201cWe were open to power sharing, but the minute that happened it was hard to go forward,\u201d Mr. Ismail said. A top American diplomat agreed, saying that the threat of prosecution \u201cboxed Seif into a corner.\u201dOver the years, Mr. Ismail noted, Colonel Qaddafi had certainly found ways to offend nearly every country now allied against him. He had financed political opponents and been accused of plotting the murder of the Saudi king. And, Mr. Ismail said, he had recently reneged on oil and arms deals with the British and the French.Then there was Lebanon and the matter of the missing Shiite cleric.In an interview with The Times, Mr. Ismail confirmed the Lebanese suspicions. \u201cWe said he left to go to Italy,\u201d Mr. Ismail said of Mr. Sadr. But that was a lie.\u201cHe was killed,\u201d Mr. Ismail said, offering a chillingly succinct explanation: \u201cThere was an argument with the leader.\u201dMr. Ismail said he had learned of the cleric\u2019s fate long after the fact, and stressed that Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s family, including a son now imprisoned in Lebanon, had no involvement or knowledge.The cleric\u2019s body, he said, was thrown into the sea.Early on, President Obama had declared that Colonel Qaddafi had lost his legitimacy and had to go. But the president was careful to point out that this was the administration\u2019s political position, not its military objective.\u201cWe are not going to use force to go beyond a well-defined goal, specifically the protection of civilians in Libya,\u201d he said. Mrs. Clinton echoed that five days after the Security Council resolution was adopted. \u201cThere is nothing in there about getting rid of anybody,\u201d she told ABC News.The president directed the Pentagon to use its unique military capabilities to stop the feared massacre and, within 10 days, turn the operation over to European and Arab allies. An unnamed aide described this approach as \u201cleading from behind,\u201d handing the president\u2019s Republican opponents an enduring talking point. But Mr. Obama was adamant that Libya would not become another protracted American war.In fact, his limited goal was achieved far faster than planned. \u201cWe basically destroyed Qaddafi\u2019s air defenses and stopped the advance of his forces within three days,\u201d recalled Mr. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.But the mission quickly evolved from protecting civilians in Benghazi to protecting civilians wherever they were. As the rebellion swelled and bystanders became combatants, the endgame became ever more murky. The United States and its allies were increasingly drawn to one side of the fighting, without extended debate over what that shift portended.\u201cI can\u2019t recall any specific decision that said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s just take him out,\u2019\u201d Mr. Gates said. Publicly, he said, \u201cthe fiction was maintained\u201d that the goal was limited to disabling Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s command and control. In fact, the former defense secretary said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a day that passed that people didn\u2019t hope he would be in one of those command and control centers.\u201dTwo of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top Libya advisers said in interviews that they had harbored misgivings about the intervention precisely because of fears that the coalition would not be able to stop short of regime change, with no ability to manage the aftermath.One was Mr. Gordon, the assistant secretary. The other was Jeremy Shapiro, who handled Libya on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy planning staff.Mr. Shapiro said he had expressed his concerns to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top policy aide, Mr. Sullivan. \u201cOnce you get into a fight where we basically say, \u2018We have to stop a madman from killing tens of thousands of people in his own country,\u2019 how do you stop?\u201d Mr. Shapiro said.\u201cUltimately the logic becomes, Jesus, the Qaddafi regime is a real threat to civilians,\u201d he added. \u201cIt required nothing to escalate to that. It would have required an amazing force of will not to.\u201dPractical military considerations also complicated Mr. Obama\u2019s in-and-out strategy. Though he had directed that the United States provide only unique capabilities that its allies did not possess, that turned out to be quite a bit: a continuing supply of precision munitions, combat search and rescue, and surveillance, Mr. Petraeus said.By April, the president had authorized the use of drones, and, according to a senior rebel commander, C.I.A. operatives began visiting rebel camps and \u201cproviding us with intercepts of Qaddafi\u2019s troop movements.\u201dThe incremental escalation ran against Mr. Obama\u2019s instincts, and he did it reluctantly, said Mr. Ross, the former National Security Council official. Mrs. Clinton, he said, was less concerned that \u201cevery step puts you on a slippery slope.\u201d\u201cHer view is, we can\u2019t fail in this,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cOnce we have made a decision, we can\u2019t fail.\u201dWhen Mr. Jibril and his Libyan entourage showed up in Rome in May to meet with Mrs. Clinton, they expected a 10-minute check-in. Instead, they talked for nearly an hour.The opposition leaders had already given her a white paper setting out a spectacular future: Political parties would compete in open elections, a free news media would hold leaders accountable and women\u2019s rights would be respected.In retrospect, Mr. Jibril acknowledged in an interview, it was a \u201cutopian ideal\u201d quite detached from Libyan reality. But Mrs. Clinton had been enthusiastic, according to those in attendance, and now she wanted to talk in greater depth about how to turn the vision into reality.\u201cShe said, and I remember this, \u2018Let us brainstorm about Libya,\u2019\u201d said Mahmud Shammam, the rebel council\u2019s chief spokesman.The opposition leaders wanted something more immediate. They wanted weapons.Despite hundreds of coalition airstrikes, the fighting was at a stalemate. Every time the rebels gained some ground, government forces retook it. The rebels seemed unable to get past Brega, an oil port on the way to Tripoli, and they hoped more sophisticated weapons from the Americans would tip the balance.The secretary of state heard them out. She \u201cwas very patient, very charming,\u201d Mr. Shammam said. \u201cAlways had a smile.\u201d In the end, though, she demurred.But back in Washington, where a low-grade panic over the stalled fighting was setting in, Mrs. Clinton pressed the rebels\u2019 case, according to three senior White House officials and two State Department officials involved in the secret debate.Onetime advocates of the intervention, including Ms. Slaughter, the secretary\u2019s former policy planning director, had grown disillusioned over the rebels\u2019 human-rights abuses.\u201cWe did not try to protect civilians on Qaddafi\u2019s side,\u201d said Ms. Slaughter, who at the time called for a deal in which Colonel Qaddafi would have turned over power to one of his sons.The international coalition that Mrs. Clinton had stitched together was also unraveling. Russia accused the United States and its allies of a bait-and-switch, and the Arab League called for a cease-fire and settlement.\u201cRegime change \u2014 that was not our business at all,\u201d Amr Moussa, who headed the organization at the time, said in an interview.\u201cThere was a moment, around about June or July,\u201d recalled Mr. Shapiro, the State Department\u2019s Libya policy adviser, \u201cwhen the situation on the ground seemed to settle into a stalemate and we weren\u2019t sure we were winning, or at least winning quickly enough.\u201dMoreover, the United States\u2019 strategy of letting other countries arm the opposition was backfiring, creating a regional power imbalance that could come back to haunt Libya if the rebels did win.She could hardly tell Qatar to stand down if the United States was unwilling to step in with lethal assistance of its own, one State Department aide said, \u201cbecause their answer would be, \u2018Well, those guys need help \u2014 you\u2019re not doing it.\u2019\u201d Her view, often relayed to her staff, was that to have influence with the fractious opposition and Arab allies, you had to have \u201cskin in the game,\u201d Mr. Ross said.Former President Bill Clinton had publicly noted in April 2011 that the United States should \u201cnot rule out\u201d arming the opposition, and in emails with Mr. Sullivan, her policy adviser, Mrs. Clinton discussed using private contractors to do just that. Mr. Ross, speaking generally, said she had frequently consulted her husband: \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Here\u2019s what I think we should do.\u2019 She\u2019d say, \u2018That\u2019s what Bill said, too.\u2019\u201dNow Mrs. Clinton took what one top adviser called \u201cthe activist side\u201d of the debate over whether to counter Qatar by arming more secular fighters.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Ross recalled her arguing, \u201cwhatever happened, your options would shrink, your influence would shrink, therefore your ability to affect anything there would also shrink.\u201dBut other senior officials were wary. NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander, Adm. James G. Stavridis, had told Congress of \u201cflickers\u201d of Al Qaeda within the opposition. Mr. Donilon, Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, argued that the administration could not ensure that weapons intended for \u201cthe so-called good guys,\u201d as one State Department official put it, did not fall into the hands of Islamist extremists.In fact, there was reason to worry. Mr. Jibril himself described in an interview how a French shipment of missiles and machine guns had gone awry. At a June meeting, President Sarkozy had agreed to \u201cask our Arab friends\u201d to supply the Transitional National Council with the weapons, Mr. Jibril said. But, he said, the acting defense minister diverted them to a militia led by Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a militant Islamist who had once been held in a secret prison by the C.I.A.Mrs. Clinton understood the hazards, but also weighed the costs of not acting, aides said. They described her as comfortable with feeling her way through a problem without being certain of the outcome.President Obama ultimately took her side, according to the administration officials who described the debate. After he signed a secret document called a presidential finding, approving a covert operation, a list of approved weaponry was drawn up. The shipments arranged by the United States and other Western countries generally arrived through the port of Benghazi and airports in eastern Libya, a Libyan rebel commander said.\u201cHumvees, counterbattery radar, TOW missiles was the highest end we talked about,\u201d one State Department official recalled. \u201cWe were definitely giving them lethal assistance. We\u2019d crossed that line.\u201d\u201cThat very day, our troops had started to get inside Brega,\u201d Mr. Shammam recalled. \u201cWe told that to Mrs. Clinton, and she said \u2014 I remember her smiling \u2014 \u2018Good! This is the only language that Qaddafi is understanding.\u2019\u201d\u201cFor the first time we have a NATO-Arab alliance taking action, you\u2019ve got Arab countries who are running strike actions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is exactly the kind of world that I want to see where it\u2019s not just the United States and everybody is standing on the sidelines while we bear the cost, while we bear the sacrifice.\u201dMr. Panetta spoke of a \u201csense that Qaddafi\u2019s days are numbered.\u201d\u201cBrava!\u201d Mr. Blumenthal exclaimed. As always, he was thinking about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential ambitions. \u201cYou must go on camera. You must establish yourself in the historical record at this moment.\u201d She should be sure to use the phrase \u201csuccessful strategy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou are vindicated.\u201dJo Becker reported from Cairo; Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey; Tunis; Paris; New York; and Washington, and Scott Shane from New York and Washington.

{"Headline": "Time to Take North Korea Seriously", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byEditorialSince the first of the year, North Korea has conducted another nuclear weapons test and launched a satellite on a rocket. Both acts further advance North Korea\u2019s quest to acquire the ability to fire a nuclear-armed missile against another country, while serving as a reminder of the world\u2019s lamentable failure to shut the program down.Especially striking has been China\u2019s impotence. President Xi Jinping has repeatedly urged North Korea to show restraint. At the same time, he has refused to endorse tough international sanctions that might have an impact on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Beijing recently agreed to work on new United Nations sanctions, but there is no indication that those sanctions would go far enough.The Chinese are probably right when they say they have less influence over Mr. Kim than many people think. But as the North\u2019s only ally and economic lifeline for food and fuel oil, China has more leverage than any other country to steer Mr. Kim toward a less hostile course. Beijing is understandably concerned that tough sanctions could cause people to flee North Korea for China. But even relatively modest gestures, like preventing Mr. Kim from obtaining whiskey and other luxuries, could force him to think twice about continuing North Korea\u2019s provocative behavior.Tougher sanctions alone are not enough to get North Korea to reconsider its weapons programs. The Iran nuclear deal showed that sanctions can be a useful tool only in negotiations toward some mutually acceptable end. President Obama, Mr. Xi and the leaders of Japan and South Korea have erred in not putting forward a proposal that can induce the North into serious talks.North Korea\u2019s full disarmament, while long the goal, is unrealistic at this point. To have any chance of success, the negotiations should aim for constraint. That means persuading the North to end all testing and to forsake technology transfers to other parties. This is a formidable challenge, but neglecting it only guarantees that the threat will get worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Bush Campaign", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byLetter From WashingtonThe biggest stories of this young political year are the surprising surges of the outsider presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic senator from Vermont. Close behind is the possible collapse of the once-formidable front-runner, Jeb Bush.Only a year ago, the Washington cognoscenti, the less politically sophisticated big donors and the London oddsmakers all figured that the son and brother of presidents was a solid favorite to clinch the Republican nomination. Six months ago, Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida, thought that he had a real shot at winning Iowa, the first nominating contest. But as the state\u2019s voters prepare to gather for the traditional caucuses on Monday night, he barely registers in the polls.There is already a debate in Republican circles over what went wrong: Was he just a bad candidate? Was he ill served by the chief strategist of the richly funded Bush \u201csuper PAC\u201d? Or was this just a bad year for any establishment figure?In the first half of 2015, when Mr. Bush could have dominated the agenda, his campaign essentially had one message: financial shock and awe, with more money than anyone ever. Little effort went into defining the candidate, or reminding voters that Mr. Bush, who had been out of office for almost a decade, was a conservative reform governor. Policy expertise, including that from influential social right leaders, was brushed aside.The campaign then decided that the super PAC, Right to Rise, run by Mr. Bush\u2019s longtime confidant Mike Murphy, would be the prime player. The PAC has spent $70 million on broadcast, cable and radio advertising, almost 30 percent of the total spent by all Republican and Democratic candidates and their political action committees.The returns, the numbers suggest, have been minimal. Even ads that created buzz \u2014 attacks on Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that poked fun at his fancy boots or pointed out his flip-flopping on issues \u2014 didn\u2019t help Mr. Bush or hurt their target.They did create bitterness among establishment Republicans, who complained, privately, that while Mr. Bush insisted that he was the only one who was taking on the front-runner, Mr. Trump, Mr. Murphy was going after Mr. Rubio.The tension with Mr. Rubio, who had been a Bush prot\u00e9g\u00e9, also illustrated Mr. Bush\u2019s weakness as a candidate. In an early debate, he sought to attack Mr. Rubio\u2019s spotty attendance in the Senate. Mr. Rubio turned the attack back on a flat-footed Mr. Bush.Mr. Bush also stumbled over whether he would have supported the ill-fated war in Iraq waged by his brother, President George W. Bush. He should have anticipated this potential pitfall, but he was never able to effectively deal with the legacy of his brother, who some top Iowa Republicans say is a big albatross in their state. (The Bush camp hopes that won\u2019t be the case elsewhere. They are reportedly planning to have the 43rd president campaign for his younger sibling in South Carolina.)But Jeb Bush suffered most from being savaged by Mr. Trump, the billionaire developer, who derided him, insulted his family ties and mocked him with the lasting epithet that he was \u201clow energy.\u201dMr. Bush has improved as a candidate. In Iowa last week, he was more substantive than most of his rivals on domestic issues and national security. But when he riffs on topics such as Civil Service reform, the Trump shot echoes.If his showing in the caucuses is no better than what the polling predicts, he would need a strong showing in New Hampshire next week against the other establishment candidates in order to retain a plausible path to the nomination.In the debates and on the campaign trail, Mr. Bush and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio have exhibited a depth on policy and government experience that in a more normal campaign cycle might have allowed them to stand out.But right now they can only hope that the polls have been misconstruing the appetite of Republican primary voters for something very different from what they have to offer.Advertisement"}

Trump has led in statewide polls on the Republican side, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has led on the Democratic side.Everything else looks like a big question mark.A decisive victory by Mr. Trump could restore his momentum after his deflating second-place showing in the Iowa caucuses last week.Among Democrats, Mr. Sanders\u2019s lead over Hillary Clinton here has fluctuated widely, but a Clinton victory would be a staggering upset. She continues to lead in nationwide polling and will be looking for stronger showings as the campaign moves on to other states.With the race here up in the air, here is a quick guide to what to look for:New Hampshire has an unusual system that allows voters who are not affiliated with a party to cast a ballot in either primary. Under the state\u2019s rules, independents can basically choose to become a member of a party for just long enough to vote, and then re-register as an independent as soon as they are finished.The independents here are not some small cluster of voters in the middle of the electorate. They are a big, heterogeneous and potentially decisive bloc.The more mainstream candidates on both sides end up competing across party lines for this crowd: A moderate voter who votes for Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic primary, for instance, may be a vote taken away from Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio on the Republican side.New Hampshire is a high-turnout state in general, and the primary is a normal election, rather than an arcane process like the Iowa caucuses. Campaigns don\u2019t have to work as hard to drag their supporters to the polls.But a campaign that lacks a well-organized operation to communicate with voters and turn them out might still leave a decisive sliver of votes on the table. That is more likely to matter on the Republican side, where four or five candidates are competing closely for second place and below.New Hampshire\u2019s population is overwhelmingly concentrated at the bottom end of the state, within an hour or so of the border with Massachusetts.Watch the state\u2019s more rural western border with Vermont for evidence of Mr. Sanders\u2019s home-field advantage. The last time a Vermont candidate ran in a Democratic primary here was 2004, when Howard Dean lost to John Kerry. But even in losing, Mr. Dean handily won three counties along the Vermont border: Grafton, Sullivan and Cheshire.The Republican map is likely to be more muddled, but watch Hillsborough and Rockingham \u2014 home to more densely settled, conservative-leaning suburbs \u2014 for evidence of which mainstream Republican might pose the greatest threat to Mr. Trump.There are relatively few delegates up for grabs here. Each party requires a presidential candidate to amass well over a thousand delegates to clinch the nomination. In New Hampshire, there are just 23 at stake on the Republican side, and 32 for the Democrats.New Hampshire awards more to candidates in the form of momentum. Traditionally, candidates must perform well in the early primary states to show voters and political donors across the country that they have a message and a political organization capable of winning elections.On the Republican side, especially, the state is likely to play an important role in determining which of Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents is best positioned to challenge him in the Southern primaries coming this month and in early March.In 2012, the Republican primary here was called for Mr. Romney almost immediately after polls closed. But a closer contest could take much longer: In 2008, when Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Obama here, The Associated Press did not declare her the winner until around 10:30 p.m.The candidates were already slogging through the snow on Monday, and an afternoon storm warning from the National Weather Service predicted a total accumulation overnight of 5 to 8 inches, with the heaviest buildup along the coast.Conventional wisdom states that candidates with more casually committed supporters would suffer most in extreme weather. Beyond that, it\u2019s hard to game out the consequences.Does it hurt Mr. Sanders, whose supporters are younger and in many cases newer to the political process, or Mrs. Clinton, who has not seemed to inspire revolutionary zeal in her voters?Is the snow more likely to undermine Mr. Rubio, whose support has been fluid after the Iowa caucuses and Saturday\u2019s debate, or Mr. Trump, whose fans may like watching him perform on television more than they enjoy driving through the snow?It\u2019s just unpredictable. That\u2019s why they have to hold an election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Little Separates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in Tight Race in Iowa", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byThe close results were deeply unnerving to Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, as well as her advisers, some of whom had expressed growing confidence in recent days that they had recaptured political momentum after weeks when Mr. Sanders was drawing huge crowds and rising in the polls. The Clintons had appeared optimistic at rallies over the weekend, thanking Iowans for their support as much as urging them to turn out to vote.The Clinton team was counting on its huge, well-trained army of volunteers, covering all of Iowa\u2019s 1,681 voting precincts, to counter the enormous enthusiasm of voters who jammed into events to hear Mr. Sanders. But his well-financed Iowa organization was able to convert the energy of his crowds into voters on Monday night, as he drew huge numbers of first-time caucusgoers, young people and liberals who responded to his rallying cry against the nation\u2019s \u201crigged economy.\u201dThe virtual tie between the two candidates instantly raised the stakes for their next face-off, the primary next Tuesday in New Hampshire. Mr. Sanders holds a solid lead in polls there and has the advantage of being from Vermont; candidates from neighboring states have won the state\u2019s primary in recent decades, and Mr. Sanders is admired in the state.Clinton advisers said late Monday night that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton were discussing bringing on additional staff members to strengthen her campaign operation now that a pitched battle may lie ahead against Mr. Sanders. The advisers said they did not know if a significant staff shakeup was at hand, but they said that the Clintons were disappointed with Monday night\u2019s result and wanted to ensure that her organization, political messaging and communications strategy were in better shape for the contests to come.At her caucus night party here, Mrs. Clinton sought to put the best face on a tight result that had nearly half of Democrats voting against her. \u201cAs I stand here tonight breathing a big sigh of relief \u2014 thank you, Iowa!\u201d she said, joined on stage by Mr. Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.Mr. Sanders, who spoke shortly after she finished, laughed as his crowd chanted \u201cfeel the Bern,\u201d his campaign\u2019s unofficial slogan. \u201cThank you \u2014 Iowa, thank you!\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Noting that he began his Iowa campaign with \u201cno name recognition\u201d and \u201cno money,\u201d Mr. Sanders drew ecstatic cheers as he said he took on the Clintons \u2014 \u201cthe most powerful political organization in the United States of America\u201d \u2014 and drove them into a tie.\u201cI think the people of Iowa have sent a very profound message to the political establishment, to the economic establishment, and by the way, to the media establishment,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThat is, given the enormous crises facing our country, it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.\u201dThe results suggested that Mr. Sanders would be a strong opponent of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s for a long time. The voters sent a clear message that income inequality weighed on their minds, with more than one in four Democratic voters saying the issue was the most important facing the nation, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls.Mr. Sanders\u2019s strong performance in Iowa was a significant milestone in a campaign in which he began 40 percentage points behind Mrs. Clinton when they both declared their candidacies last spring. Many Democrats privately dismissed Mr. Sanders as a left-wing fringe candidate who had no real chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton anywhere other than his home state of Vermont, where his democratic socialist politics were not as exotic as many Democratic Party leaders found them.But Mr. Sanders proved to be a rigorously disciplined candidate, delivering the same powerful message inveighing against establishment politics, Wall Street and the benefits enjoyed by the wealthy and the well-connected.The Clintons are now hoping for a surprise performance in New Hampshire, where they have campaigned and connected with voters since 1992, when Mr. Clinton came in a strong second place in the state\u2019s primary, and Mrs. Clinton won the 2008 primary over Barack Obama, then a senator who had earlier won the Iowa caucuses.Steve Duprey, a Republican national committeeman from New Hampshire, said if Mrs. Clinton ekes out a clear victory in Iowa, however small, it would give her \u201csome much-needed momentum in New Hampshire \u2014 and if she can build that into a New Hampshire win, I think it will start the death rattle of the Sanders campaign.\u201dGeorge Maglaras, a Clinton supporter who is a commissioner of Strafford County, N.H., predicted that Mrs. Clinton would have a lock on the Democratic nomination if she won New Hampshire on top of a close race in Iowa.\u201cAny other combination means we are in for a longer nomination process than many had anticipated early on,\u201d Mr. Maglaras, a former mayor of Dover, N.H., added. Referring to New Hampshire residents, he said, \u201cIf they vote with their heads it will be Clinton. If they vote with their hearts it will be Sanders.\u201dAfter losing the Iowa caucuses in 2008 to Mr. Obama, another insurgent candidate who she led in the polls for months, Mrs. Clinton vowed to campaign differently here this time around, holding small events with handpicked voters to learn about the lives and issues for voters here \u2014 and to be shown doing so, humbly and thoughtfully, in Iowa television newscasts. While she long said that Iowa would be a tight race, and improved upon her 2008 performance when she won 29.5 percent and fell to third place behind John Edwards, Mrs. Clinton nonetheless hoped that she would start exorcising the ghosts of 2008 with a victory here, and she campaigned hard for it.Mrs. Clinton, 68, performed well on Monday night among women, moderates and older Iowans who rallied behind her promises to build on President Obama\u2019s policies and fight for the needs of families. Her shifts to the left on trade, the environment and gay marriage helped her win over Democrats, though not the many liberals and young people who mistrusted her pragmatic style of politics and her ties to wealthy interests and Wall Street.11 PhotosMr. Sanders, 74, drew strong support from first-time Democratic caucusgoers, who accounted for more than four in 10 voters, according to polls conducted by Edison Research of voters as they entered caucus locations throughout the state Monday evening. But these voters made up a smaller share of the Democratic electorate on Monday than they did in 2008, when 57 percent of Democratic caucusgoers were first-timers. Mr. Sanders was also widely supported by younger voters and independents, but voters 65 and older accounted for about three in 10 Democratic voters and they strongly favored Mrs. Clinton.As the results trickled in, the third candidate in the Democratic contest, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, announced that he was pulling out of the race.With Iowa accounting for only 1 percent of the delegates at stake in the Democratic nomination race, Mrs. Clinton is already far ahead of Mr. Sanders in the delegate count that matters most, given her support from several hundred superdelegates who count toward the nomination. The Clinton campaign has expressed confidence to allies that she can afford to lose Iowa, as well as the New Hampshire primary because of her strength in big-state, delegate-rich primaries and in the South .Both candidates planned to fly to New Hampshire overnight and planned to resume campaigning there on Tuesday.Mr. Sanders developed a better-financed operation here than the Clinton team expected, thanks to robust online fund-raising that netted $20 million in January alone, compared with $37 million for Mrs. Clinton in the last three months of 2015. (The Clinton campaign on Monday declined requests for its January fund-raising number.)Sanders advisers say he now has both money \u2014 $28.3 million on hand, compared with $38 million for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 and the political momentum to compete vigorously not just in New Hampshire but in upcoming primaries in South Carolina, Massachusetts, and Georgia and caucuses in Nevada, Minnesota, and elsewhere.Amy Chozick contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Court Gives Deadline to Fix Kansas School Financing", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byThe Kansas Supreme Court on Thursday gave the state until June 30 to fix its system of financing public schools, or face a court-ordered shutdown before the next school year begins.Rather than improve the way it doled out state money, the court ruled, the Republican-controlled Legislature has failed to cure inequities between rich and poor school districts.\u201cThe legislature\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to equitably, i.e., fairly, allocate resources among the school districts not only creates uncertainty in planning the 2016-2017 school year but also has the potential to interrupt the operation of Kansas\u2019 public schools,\u201d the court said.The decision is the latest blow to Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, and the state Legislature, which will probably have to find tens of millions of dollars in its budget for additional education funding.Kansas is already facing deep fiscal woes in the wake of Mr. Brownback\u2019s decision to cut taxes, which he predicted would help bolster the state economy. Revenue has fallen short of projections and he and lawmakers are scrambling to fill a roughly $200 million budget gap before the close of the session.John S. Robb, a lawyer for the school districts and parents who are suing the state, estimated that the Legislature would have to add $73 million to the system to satisfy the court.The Legislature\u2019s \u201cchosen path during the 2016 session will ultimately determine whether Kansas students will be treated fairly and the schoolhouse doors will be open to them in August,\u201d the ruling said.\u201cIt really came down to our Supreme Court saying, once again, that the state has not done enough to address the inequities in our finance system,\u201d Mark Tallman, a lobbyist with the Kansas Association of School Boards, said in an interview. \u201cWe hope that the Legislature will respond to the court in a timely fashion.\u201dIn Topeka, the state capital, Republican lawmakers accused the court of judicial overreach.\u201cThe court has once again demonstrated no misgivings on interjecting itself in legislative proceedings and holding Kansas taxpayers and Kansas schoolchildren hostage,\u201d Ray Merrick, the Republican speaker of the House, said in a statement.In a statement, Mr. Brownback said, \u201cKansas has among the best schools in the nation and an activist Kansas Supreme court is threatening to shut them down. We will review this decision closely and work with the Legislature to ensure the continued success of our great Kansas schools.\u201dThe ruling extends a longstanding battle in Kansas over public education. A similar showdown between the Legislature and the Kansas Supreme Court in 2005 resulted in lawmakers agreeing to increase per-pupil spending in schools, but the additional funding stopped amid the national financial crisis.Their temporary solution was to pass a bill that replaced a previous formula with one that used block grants to allocate funds. Supporters of block grants say that they give school districts flexibility to spend where they need it most. But the plan was immediately criticized by education advocates for essentially cutting money intended for poorer districts.Tom Burroughs, the House minority leader, said in a statement that Mr. Brownback and his allies were guilty of mismanaging the state. But \u201crather than take responsibility for our state\u2019s stagnant economy and self-inflicted budget crisis, Republicans chose to blame public education,\u201d he said.Mr. Robb said the ruling was \u201ca great day for the kids in Kansas.\u201d\u201cThe court keeps telling the Legislature to follow the Constitution, and the Legislature keeps wiggling out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now the court has put an absolute line in the sand.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Everything-in-One Promise of a Continuing Care Community", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byRetiringIs it possible to have it all in retirement? That\u2019s what so-called continuing care retirement communities promise.These hybrids offer independent living apartments (and sometimes free-standing cottages) along with assisted-living support, home care, a nursing home and often specialized memory care, all within one complex. The idea is for a resident to \u201cage in place\u201d and obtain additional services as that person becomes more frail and dependent, without having to move.It\u2019s a concept that appeals to Eve O\u2019Brien, 72, who retired from her job in a community pharmacy last year.She and her husband, Mike, 76, moved from New York to their summer home in East Moriches on Long Island. But they yearned for \u201ca warmer climate,\u201d she said, while \u201censuring that we would never be a burden or concern to our children.\u201dShe has other objectives in mind as well. \u201cAn active retirement, ending the responsibilities of homeownership with its unpredictable expenses and ensuring our health care as we age,\u201d she said.\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard all my life.\u201d Ms. O\u2019Brien added. \u201cI want to be on vacation and can cook when I want to.\u201dSo they are looking for a new locale that pairs flexibility, leisure and some degree of health care security.Healthy, engaged retirees are increasingly drawn to continuing care communities. As they downsize, they look ahead to when they might need help with everyday activities and have health problems or mental disabilities, as many older people eventually do.But there are important issues to consider before taking the plunge.The major drawback in evaluating continuing care communities is the complexity of their contracts, which come in a number of variations. Some may require a deposit of up to $1 million, while others may charge only monthly fees. Refunds may be difficult to obtain and depend upon the length of stay and other requirements. Contract details have to be read carefully and financial statements reviewed.While 80 percent of continuing care communities are run by nonprofit religious and fraternal groups, it\u2019s difficult to compare facilities side by side since there is no national, government-sponsored rating system.There are different ways to finance a stay in a continuing care retirement community.The majority require a \u201cbuy-in\u201d or large, lump-sum entrance fee for a \u201cLife Care\u201d contract, mostly as a financial reserve for potential future care. Often, part of the upfront payment is refunded to the estate after the resident dies. Such facilities usually charge additional monthly fees, which cover food, maintenance, cleaning and other basic services. Health care or home care expenses are also extra, sometimes paid for out of the deposit.Another model \u2014 \u201cfee for service\u201d \u2014 does not require a lump-sum buy-in, although these facilities may require rental deposits. They also cover essential services like room and board and may hire outside contractors for home care.And most communities offer some form of \u201cbenevolence care\u201d for those who run out of money.Keep in mind that few of these contracts involve direct, conventional purchase of a housing unit. In most cases, the resident buys only the lifetime right to live in a community, take advantage of its range of amenities and services, and receive care there. The units generally are not bought and sold on the open market.The average buy-in amount is about $250,000, according to Stephen Maag, director of residential communities for LeadingAge. Entrance fees \u201chave a direct relationship to local housing market prices,\u201d he said, which means residents usually pay much more to join in the Northeast and on the West Coast than in the South and Midwest.Thirty states have regulations that govern continuing care retirement communities. But the independent living sections rarely have rigorous oversight.\u201cThe nursing homes in some C.C.R.C.s are not Medicaid certified,\u201d said Dr. Stuart Shapiro, a former chief executive of the Pennsylvania Health Care Association, a group that promotes long-term care for the state\u2019s elderly and disabled. Pennsylvania has the most continuing care retirement communities in the country.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what C.C.R.C.s have to disclose,\u201d Dr. Shapiro said. \u201cWith the independent living part of C.C.R.C.s, there\u2019s virtually no regulation.\u201dWhat happens if a facility goes bankrupt, as about 20 companies have done in the last 15 years? While it\u2019s rare for anyone to be evicted \u2014 usually a new company takes over a failed facility \u2014 there is a continuing problem with financial disclosure, according to experts.\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of transparency with C.C.R.C.s that\u2019s resulted in weaker trust,\u201d said Katherine C. Pearson, a professor at the Dickinson School of Law of Pennsylvania State University who has testified before Congress on the issue. \u201cYou need to visit several facilities, talk to residents, look at past cost increases and five years of financial records.\u201dProfessor Pearson, who talks with continuing care community residents around the country, said there was no one rule of thumb to use when evaluating these communities. A prospective resident generally wants a community that is active and engaged and \u201csupports healthy living,\u201d she said. But given the magnitude of the decision (after all, it is often the last major purchase someone will ever make), it deserves very careful consideration.\u201cGet as much financial information as you can,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not an impulse buy.\u201dContract review is a must, ideally with an accountant, lawyer and financial consultant. How does a resident qualify for a refund? Most communities apply a prorated formula. If someone doesn\u2019t like a community, what is the grace period to receive all of the money back? How is the company\u2019s business model going to be sustained for decades as residents need more care?When visiting a continuing care retirement community, talk with residents and the staff. Ask about food services and health care support, and explore the entire facility, not just the more spacious and inviting independent living units. Is a dietitian on staff? Is the community well maintained? Are a hospital and other amenities nearby? Do residents seem happy? What happens if someone needs a higher level of care? What about security? Are the recreational activities appealing?It\u2019s wise to compare several places and check with state agencies to see if there are any complaints. Go to local senior centers to see if they have heard anything about the facilities.\u201cSince there\u2019s no government agency clearinghouse on C.C.R.C. reviews, unfortunately, you may have to rely upon anecdotal information,\u201d Dr. Shapiro said.Continuing care communities are not for everybody. But by planning ahead for the myriad challenges of aging, many older people (and their families) are able to enjoy their final years of life more fully.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Britain, a Green Utility Company Sees Winds of Change", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byKEADBY, England \u2014 A wind farm here, along the River Trent, cranks out enough clean electricity to power as many as 57,000 homes. Monitored remotely, the windmills, 34 turbines each about 400 feet high, require little attention or maintenance and are expected to produce electricity for decades to come.\u201cThey\u2019re very well behaved,\u201d said Sam Cunningham, the wind farm\u2019s manager, as she drove around the almost three-square-mile site.But instead of doubling down, the utility is rethinking its energy mix, reconsidering plans for large wind farms and even restarting a mothballed power plant that runs on fossil fuel.The moves reflect the existential debate faced by many major power companies, as they grapple with real-world energy economics and shifts in government policy. The calculus for fossil fuels can be more favorable at a time when energy prices are low and countries like Britain are rethinking subsidies on renewables to keep electricity prices down.In this environment, it might be hard for even the most clean-minded power companies to help countries meet the goals set in the landmark Paris climate deal.\u201cThe profitability of renewables is lower than a few years back,\u201d said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utility analyst at Bernstein Research in London. \u201cIf power prices fall, their revenues fall.\u201dUnder the deal agreed to in December, 195 countries committed to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Utilities will have to play a major role, by shifting from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas to renewable sources of energy.Even before the deal, SSE was at the forefront of the shift, producing about 43 percent of its power from clean sources. That proportion could grow, as the company plans to shut down almost all of its remaining coal-fired production this year.But sharp declines in energy prices have forced the utility and others to think twice before beating a hasty retreat from fossil fuels. In SSE\u2019s case, lower natural gas prices have resulted in a 20 percent fall over the last year in the price it charges for one of its main products, wholesale electricity.\u201cWe obviously need to be pragmatic,\u201d said Lee-Ann Fullerton, an SSE spokeswoman. \u201cIt\u2019s for government to set the policy and us to get on with delivering.\u201dAcross its portfolio, SSE is making adjustments.Adjacent to the Keadby wind farm is a 1990s gas-fired power plant that the company closed in 2013 when cheap coal and high natural gas prices made it a money loser. Now gas prices are plummeting and coal is being phased out in Britain under a government mandate.So the company is bringing the gas plant back into service and is considering doing the same with others. Last summer, it also agreed to spend 915 million pounds, or $1.3 billion, for a 20 percent share of Laggan-Tormore, a giant gas field off the Shetland Islands near Scotland\u2019s north coast. The field is operated by the French energy company Total.An even bigger factor in SSE\u2019s decision making is the British government\u2019s shifting stance on renewable energy.For years, London has subsidized various forms of clean power, including onshore wind farms, to wean the country off its heavy dependence on high-pollution coal-fired power plants. In response, SSE invested about \u00a34 billion from 2007 on wind and other low-carbon sources. Partly as a result of those subsidies, about 11 percent of Britain\u2019s power is now generated by wind, compared to 1 percent in 2006, according to Renewable UK, a trade group. Germany, which has made a major commitment to renewables, generated about 13 percent of its energy from wind in 2015, compared with about 5 percent in the United States.But since winning an outright majority in parliamentary elections last spring, the Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron has been shifting focus. It has talked up the benefits of natural gas as a cleaner-burning replacement in power generation for the coal-fired plants it wants to close and backed nuclear power as a long-term source of low-carbon energy.The government is also trimming subsidies for renewables, and onshore wind farms and other clean sources like solar power are taking a direct hit. Subsidies for new onshore wind projects will be halted this spring, a year earlier than planned, as the Conservatives look to please their rural constituents by honoring election pledges to halt support for land-based windmills.The government instead wants to focus on offshore wind projects, which are usually less contentious because they are out at sea, and often out of view. Offshore projects also offer enormous scale by deploying bigger turbines in larger numbers than is practical on land. Britain is the world\u2019s largest market for offshore wind, and the government views the industry as a source of jobs, especially along the northern coast, where the oil and gas industry is faltering because of falling prices.According to Amber Rudd, the minister for energy and climate change, there is already enough onshore wind capacity built or in the pipeline to meet the government\u2019s targets. Wind subsidies also cost \u00a3800 million a year.\u201cWe could end up with more onshore wind projects than we can afford,\u201d she said.SSE is not abandoning wind energy. It is proceeding with three onshore projects under construction, and it is planning a vast offshore wind farm in the Moray Firth, a large bay off northeast Scotland that could have as many as 84 turbines and cost \u00a31.8 billion.But the economics are rapidly changing.Even without subsidies, onshore wind is the cheapest of the major renewable technologies to build in Britain, costing around $85 per megawatt-hour for the power generated over the life of a project, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a market research firm. By comparison, building a natural gas power plant in Europe costs almost 40 percent more.Offshore wind is far more expensive to build and operate because of the difficulties of sinking pilings on the sea bottom and keeping equipment functioning in a hostile marine environment. The estimated costs are more than double that of onshore wind.The subsidies can often make or break a project.The government has guaranteed a price above the $175 per megawatt-hour offshore costs for a Danish company that is going ahead with a multibillion-pound project off northeast England. The three onshore wind farms that SSE is building in Scotland will also still qualify for subsidies.Two other large onshore facilities the company is planning \u2014 including a giant 67-turbine farm called Stronelairg \u2014 probably would not.So far, having a large renewable portfolio is working in SSE\u2019s favor. For the six months to the end of September, operating profit for the power-generating unit, which includes both renewables and fossil fuel plants, increased to about \u00a3142 million from \u00a311.8 million in the comparable period in 2014.Neil Richardson, a company spokesman, said SSE agreed with the government that \u201coffshore wind and gas have a major role to play\u201d in Britain\u2019s transition to a lower-carbon energy mix, but he said issues including a guaranteed price for power and the future price of carbon were still unsettled. \u201cWe want to continue to invest,\u201d he said, \u201cbut need certainty.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Walters, 83, was playing but also worrying the time.He cut off the game (low-stakes, which keeps the mood convivial) at 10:30, and this night, he and his wife, Irene, were presenting Mr. Cranston with a cake for his best actor nomination in \u201cTrumbo.\u201dAround 10, the game stopped and everyone sang \u201cHappy nomination to you.\u201d Mr. Cranston, abashed, began to make a faux acceptance speech. \u201cYou know, when I was a child \u2026\u201d Mr. Phillips repeated a joke, slightly raunchy, that Harvey Korman used to tell at the game. Mr. Walters asked Mr. Cranston if he would like a glass of milk.On Sunday, Mr. Walters will host another gathering: an annual Oscar viewing party that he calls Night of 100 Stars.Let us get this out of the way: Night of 100 Stars (estimates vary) is not as hot a ticket as Graydon Carter\u2019s party for Vanity Fair (outside the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills) or Elton John\u2019s with InStyle at the Pacific Design Center.Mr. Walters\u2019s event occupies the grand International Ballroom at the Beverly Hilton (after years at the Crystal Ballroom at the Beverly Hills Hotel), and the party\u2019s publicist, Edward Lozzi, is this year confirming Vince Vaughn, Rumer Willis and Cloris Leachman.Mr. Nygard is among the more outr\u00e9 figures strutting a red carpet that tends also to feature Oscar royalty (Jon Voight, Shirley Jones, Martin Landau), actor stalwarts, former sitcom parents (Alan Thicke), a gadfly civil rights lawyer (Gloria Allred), a man who went to the moon (Buzz Aldrin), and qualified eye candy \u2014 because a party without beautiful women is a dud, Mr. Lozzi said.Mr. Walters not only advertises his Oscar party, now in its 26th year, as the longest-running one in town, but also the most accessible: to civilian interlopers willing to spend $1,000 for a seat at the table and as much as $25,000 for a V.I.P. table package. \u201cYou can\u2019t get into the Vanity Fair party unless you\u2019re Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks or Tom Mix,\u201d he pointed out pragmatically.Harry Hamlin attended the Norby Walters 25th Annual Night of 100 Stars Oscar viewing gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in 2015.Night of 100 Stars\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 charitable until an investigation of the financing by the California attorney general\u2019s office in 2004 \u2014 is now, for all intents and purposes, Mr. Walters himself.His particular place in the entertainment industry constellation eludes easy metaphors, the shorthand of \u201csuperagent\u201d or \u201cuber manager.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m bottom of the totem pole, to them,\u201d Mr. Walters said. \u201cBut I know who I am, and I know what I am.\u201d He added: \u201cAs I always say to my wife, \u2018I used to be important.\u2019\u201dMr. Walters\u2019s son, Gary Michael Walters, chief executive of Bold Films, which had \u201cWhiplash\u201d in Oscar contention last year, called his father a cult figure in Hollywood. \u201cYou\u2019re in a town of strivers who are looking for the next job,\u201d the younger Mr. Walters said. \u201cNorby is never going to give you a job. He\u2019s going to give you a cookie.\u201dIn late January, in his living room, Mr. Walters offered not cookies but reminiscences about his life, surrounded by pictures of his actor friends in 8-by-10 frames, alive (Lolita Davidovich, Mimi Rogers, Bruce Davison) and no longer with us (Rod Steiger, Charles Durning). In every group picture, someone was holding a straight flush.The weekend before, from a disadvantaged table at the back of the same ballroom he will command on Oscar night, Mr. Walters had attended the Golden Globes. \u201cI got ahold of Jon Hamm and reminded him to come to the poker game,\u201d Mr. Walters said. \u201cI got ahold of Terrence Howard, whose number I had lost. Who is one of my players.\u201d Also Mark Ruffalo.Another recent poker lineup included Richard Dreyfuss, Jason Alexander, James Woods, Diane Lane and Joe Bologna. \u201cI mean, everybody there is Academy Award winners and nominees,\u201d Mr. Walters said.The stakes are lower, as it were, for Night of 100 Stars. \u201cIt\u2019s my party, that\u2019s all it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the stars, it has nothing to do with the Oscars.\u201dIt\u2019s just: \u201cThat\u2019s the night that everybody\u2019s hot to go out.\u201dIn the 1960s, Irving Paul Lazar, the famed literary agent and dealmaker known as Swifty, had the same thought, inviting a coterie of the Hollywood elite to dine with him while watching the Oscar broadcast live. Lasting nearly three decades, until Lazar died in December 1993, and long residing at Wolfgang Puck\u2019s original Spago restaurant above Sunset Boulevard, this party is now held up as a bygone example of true Oscar glamour.On the night Lazar was holding what turned out to be his last Spago party, Mr. Walters was a dinner chairman (along with Donald J. Trump and Anthony Quinn) of a rival Oscar party in Century City put on by Michael Bass, the son of a Beverly Hills dentist.The previous year, Mr. Bass had promised a cultural moment: the Oscar-winning actor Jack Lemmon helping to bestow a humanitarian award on Boris Yeltsin, then president of Russia. Mr. Lemmon didn\u2019t show. Mr. Yeltsin beamed in.But Mr. Walters has accumulated more respect. His actor associates invariably recall meeting him at some party or charity function. Mr. Landau couldn\u2019t remember what the occasion was. Mr. Hamlin figured it must have been an awards show. Mr. Thicke thought it probably had something to do with a golf or tennis charity tournament.\u201cThere are so many promoters, as you know, in Hollywood, people who round up celebrities for one purpose or another,\u201d Mr. Thicke said. \u201cAnd you come to know who the good ones are and who the fly-by-night ones are. And you put the good ones on your calendar every year. You know that if a certain promoter calls you to come and do a charity golf tournament, it\u2019s going to be done first class, and it\u2019s going to be what they promised, and no surprises. Norby delivers that way.\u201dNorbert Meyer came of age in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. His father, a Polish immigrant, served and boxed in the Army through World War I and then opened a bar and nightclub in the neighborhood. When Mr. Walters and his brother, Walter Meyer, took it over, they rechristened the place Norby & Walter\u2019s Bel Air. As Mr. Walters tells the story, the sign lacked the ampersand. Norby Walters was born.In the 1950s and \u201960s, Mr. Walters opened a series of mambo joints and pizzerias and a Chinese restaurant named House of Wong in Howard Beach, Queens.He soon took over a small, struggling nightclub in the shadows of Manhattan\u2019s Copacabana on East 60th Street, calling it Norby Walters\u2019s Supper Club. \u201cWhat was I going to do?\u201d Mr. Walters said. \u201cBecome a bank robber?\u201d He and his wife had \u201cthree rabbits at home,\u201d all boys.Mr. Walters says the club was forced to shut down after two mobsters began harassing an African-American patron, who returned and shot both mobsters dead. \u201cEverybody hit the floor,\u201d Mr. Walters said. \u201cAnd this guy was very calm about it. He sat down at the bar, put the pistol down and waited to be taken.\u201dMr. Walters, down again but never out, gratefully left what he calls \u201cthe saloon business\u201d and went into the music business as a booking agent. At first, he built his roster with regional lounge acts, until a singer from New Jersey, Gloria Gaynor, soon to reach the stratosphere with \u201cI Will Survive,\u201d scored her first hit record with \u201cNever Can Say Goodbye.\u201d Mr. Walters, more a jazz and standards man than a disco man, followed the money nonetheless. He became a \u201cchart chaser,\u201d hustling disco-era track dates.With two young partners, Jerry Ade and Sal Michaels, he formed Norby Walters Associates, later General Talent International. \u201cIt was a mentoring situation in the early days, and then it was more me mentoring him, trying to hold on to him because he was a wild man,\u201d Mr. Ade said of Mr. Walters.The hip-hop pioneers Eric B. & Rakim would name-check Mr. Walters in a lyric. The booking agency had Teena Marie, Frankie Beverly, the Bar-Kays, Peaches and Herb, the Commodores, the Four Tops, Luther Vandross, Patti LaBelle, George Clinton, Rick James, Kool and the Gang and the Gap Band.According to Mr. Ade, General Talent represented 80 percent of the R&B and funk charts. \u201cIf they wanted to make it big and get on the right tours and grow their business,\u201d he said of the performers, \u201cthey had to be with us.\u201dMr. Ade said he wanted to expand the business into the white mainstream charts, while Mr. Walters had his sights set on a different kind of black entertainers: athletes. With trademark flamboyance, Mr. Walters and a young partner named Lloyd Bloom barnstormed the world of big-time college sports, flashing cash at dozens of star football players under their World Sports & Entertainment banner.Signed to postdated contracts to circumvent National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations, many of the players abandoned Mr. Walters and Mr. Bloom for more established agents when it came time to go professional. Mr. Walters, not to be outdone, sued six of the players for breach of contract.When players reported being threatened over their betrayals and an associate of a rival agent was found beaten in her Chicago office, the F.B.I. initiated a criminal investigation that came to paint Mr. Walters and Mr. Bloom as mob-connected arrivistes despoiling the college game.In 1988, both were charged with racketeering and fraud (unrelated to the beating of the agent). Mr. Walters denied being in business with mafia figures; if anything, he saw himself as the victim of his own success.While the convictions were later overturned on appeal \u2014 cleared of racketeering, Mr. Walters and Mr. Bloom entered conditional guilty pleas to mail fraud, also later overturned \u2014 Mr. Walters sold his share of the booking agency to Mr. Ade and came to Los Angeles for early retirement.As it happened, Mr. Bloom was already in Los Angeles, trying his hand at movie industry dealmaking. In the summer of 1993, he was shot to death in his rented Malibu home.But with apologies to his onetime client, Ms. Gaynor, Mr. Walters has survived. In transforming what used to be Mr. Bass\u2019s party into Night of 100 Stars, he adroitly borrowed the name and charitable concept of a trio of network TV variety specials put on by the theatrical impresario Alexander H. Cohen at Radio City Music Hall.The contemporary Night of 100 Stars cannot claim such luster. In 2004, around the time the fund-raiser was being looked at by a state attorney general\u2019s office that was toughening disclosure rules for charitable organizations, Martin Scorsese\u2019s Film Foundation cut ties with Night of 100 Stars. Mr. Walters subsequently settled a lawsuit for failing to register as a commercial fund-raiser and file financial reports with the state.This matters not a whit to those who find in it a blessed refuge from Instagramming and mani-camming, or just Somewhere to Be on a night as fraught for Hollywood as New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201cIt\u2019s a party that\u2019s being thrown by Norby for his own reasons,\u201d Mr. Hamlin said. \u201cI\u2019ve never even gotten into trying to figure out what they are. But I can go to that party and I can look at a table next to me and I\u2019ll see somebody that I worked with 25 years ago. Or I\u2019ll see somebody I worked with a year ago.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this articlemisspelled the given name of an actress shown with Norby Walters. She is Stefanie Powers, not Stephanie.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Gates, the \u2018Impatient Optimist,\u2019 Lays Out his Clean-Energy Innovation Agenda", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "I recently had a 45-minute conversation with Gates in the Seattle headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to explore what drove him to focus so much time and money in pursuit of energy breakthroughs.Andrew Revkin talks to the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s richest person about his plan to tackle global warming with a new multibillion-dollar fund.Do you have a vision for the energy and climate norms that the world could have in 2100, given what you know about the climate system and the energy system?Well, I have a strong goal that the price of energy should be lower because of the work of the foundation and looking at the lives of the poorest. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very big deal that we not push energy prices up too much, so that things like fertilizer, lighting, refrigeration, air conditioning eventually \u2014 the kinds of things we take for granted \u2014 by 2100 should be available to everyone on the planet. So we need affordable energy.To me it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 70 percent of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poor people are farmers, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re barely getting by. And a bad year means that their kid doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough nutrition. And so unless we can get their productivity and their resilience up quite dramatically, the increased variance in the weather, including lots of precipitation all at once, they just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the ability to deal with it. When you have resilience, which you have in rich countries, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re likely to be able to make adjustments.Well for me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty easy to think of research and innovation as the thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going change the framework. And my interest in getting that on the agenda goes back quite a ways. I had talked to the United States and France about saying, hey, shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this be on the agenda? And in fact, in terms of having Paris be novel for driving solutions, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do the world a service by getting this onto the agenda. After all, raising R&D is a global public good, to invent something that can solve this problem.So it really belongs on this agenda, particularly because the big emitters are pretty much one and the same as the countries with research capacity. They can respond by tilting their R&D budget in the right direction. And energy is so unique in terms of how little is spent on R&D, because if you invent something, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be deployed in big amounts within a 20-year period.So yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wonderful that the countries made that commitment. And at first we thought, you know, if we get five or six countries, including the U.S. and a few big countries, that would be phenomenal. As it was, we ended up with 20 countries, and this is in a time of extremely tight budgets \u2014 every European country, Japan, the U.S.It is very tough. There are very few things that are getting more money. Most of the dialogue is about which things will get less money. So it takes a pretty compelling cause. You know, like when the Ebola epidemic came along. Okay, things related to that got more money.But only things that really get people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention in a big way are allowed to fit that special category. So it was a great announcement. And it was interesting, the idea that the private sector, in terms of high-risk venture investing, would come in and be there so that all we were asking for in this case was the basic research piece. Now, some countries may help with non-research pieces. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic. But this ask was about the piece that really can only be done at the government level. And we said the group of private investors \u2014 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add a lot of institutional investors as well \u2014 would bring several billion in so that we can nurture these companies up to a pretty large stage, so that more non-venture type financing would then grab onto them and help with the scale-up.Is it anticipated that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going to operate like an endowment?What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning now is the first five years. And the spending will somewhat grow over the years, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have more companies that are at a later stage. We are going to look at all the companies that are out there, because there are a few that have promising technologies, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a place where getting financing is a little bit difficult. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just going to do start-up companies. We may find a few that are at the stage where getting $50 million or even $100 million would be valuable. And then over the five years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fully invest money, and then, like most venture funds, we would turn around and say to the investors, hey, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy with this, yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do another fund.Are you saying, we wealthy individuals with an investment plan here, we need a hand-off. We need you to work on this, too. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of like a quid pro quo thing?It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as fast. But we do expect to make money out of this thing. If you can drive a new approach, then the energy economy is absolutely gigantic. Now, getting it scaled up fast enough, so that you benefit from your invention or your trade secrets, that is tricky. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great that we have that incentive. The financial incentive is to get it out and scaled quickly, and the climate benefit requires that same mentality.Is there a way to make that case to the American people that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been made? You talk to people of all political stripes, I assume. Have you found a way to get traction with the logic of that?Well, research hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been discussed much, but I do think it has a lot of appeal. Everyone wants great companies that are leading the way. We do have amazing universities where the basic technology, the material science, the simulation. You know, the I.Q. around the world large is very strong on this \u2014 to make the case to the U.S. that it should be a leader in doubling its budget. That was pretty important. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think if the U.S. wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t participating, it would be easy to get critical mass. Because even though we underspend, we are about 50 percent of all of the energy R&D spending that gets done.I think everybody can get excited when they hear there are really ideas out there. And when you talk about basic research, you get away from the somewhat partisan divide about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the role of government. Nobody would say it was zero, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d get quite a range of views of how much the government ought to try and help out at that later stage.And so I think this one, now that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been highlighted as being so important, it you know, creates jobs in the company that allocates the R&D, it creates business opportunity in the country. And as you say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not relative to the size of the energy market or what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at risk here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually very, very small. You know, capitalism in general underinvests in research because the benefits to society are way more than whoever takes the risk and does the invention gets. And energy is just particularly dramatic in that. In fact, I.T. and health, people are spoiled by those, because those have pretty strong research models, both at the government level and at the private level.Circling back to Paris, could you lay out the general sectors you personally are interested in, and inevitably these investments will be in? Can you remind people what some of the basic concepts are that are out there?The range of possibilities for getting an energy breakthrough that is something that will be cheap and clean, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a few ways to do that. Ah, in the nuclear space there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fusion; there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fission.Within wind, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got high [altitude] wind that only a little bit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done in. You have offshore wind, you have whatever improvements you can do to onshore wind, which you know, will likely be a workhorse of the overall system. Then in solar, you have solar electric, which has gone the furthest. You can do a lot more there. You have solar thermal, which has some nice characteristics, because storing heat is easier than storing electrons.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a paradigmatic example because it is not ready for a start-up, but there are some particular problems in terms of material structures and simulation that, if the right research was done, even over the next two or three years, then you could have a set of start-ups that would go into that area.High wind is another one where the challenges are, to some degree, control and materials challenges. This is the golden age of actually rationally designing materials, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for tensile strength or for catalytic capabilities. And if you can look at that area and say, okay scientists, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we need, then you can stimulate a lot of good work. And for us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit like what we do at the foundation where we take a disease problem and then we try and make sure the scientists who might \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have some tool that would help stimulate them to get involved.Biofuels is a category where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re either taking natural photosynthesis or modifying natural photosynthesis to get much higher efficiencies, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a few, you know: trees, grasses, algae. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking current photosynthesis, then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s many ways to do cellulosic processing, none of which should have gotten into the large-scale mainstream, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of promise that that might happen.And when we think about climate, we have to think about more than electricity. We have to make materials. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steel, aluminum, cement, plastic, paper \u2014 all of which are big processes we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dependent on, some of which directly generate CO2, like cement production, and a lot of which are big industrial users of electricity or energy. We also have the entire land use, agricultural, livestock area, which is a very significant CO2 emitter.A little bit of the trap people get into is they think, okay if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re meeting some 2030 goal, we must be on the way, because we just do more of what we did. Well, a lot of things you do, like, take [away] coal and build natural gas, for your 2050 goal, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a step backwards because that gas plant is at a higher CO2-per-kilowatt-hour than you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to want to have in 2050. So you thought, oh what a great thing we just did. But in fact it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t scale to the sort of near-zero [emissions technology] that we need to achieve.So when you think of the industrial economy, getting 20 or 30 percent out of that by pushing up recycling, labeling things, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy. But you have to plan today for meeting the large target. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just get to get partway there and say, oh well someone else will figure out how to make steel or, you know, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretend we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to make a lot of steel.Well there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a couple ways that it could come in. Poor countries, even if we figure out how to take livestock and land use in rich countries and get that down to zero, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going be a lot of emissions out of poor countries. And we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t force them not to use hydrocarbons. People actually get confused in climate and think this is bad for poor countries so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get them to do expensive intermittent energy systems and then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay.No, developing and truly poor countries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not China or India \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are a rounding error. So anything you do with their energy systems is a hobby, unrelated to climate change. I mean, maybe you could bring some power there, but they should grab onto the cheapest solution.So doing carbon sequestration out of a natural gas [power plant] flue is a lot easier than out of a coal flue, because there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the sulfuric acid. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very little going on with that, but we may need that as part of a solution for that backup peaker 20 percent. Or if you have emissions taking place far away, in the poor countries, the idea that you could do free air capture, like Carbon Engineering is trying to do and a few other people are trying to do \u2014 that would have to be part of the mix.So actually, building prototypes now and saying, okay, how hard is it to do that carbon capture at scale, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great that that work is going on. The initial plants will be at very high prices \u2014 on the order of $100 per ton, which is way above even the highest CO2 tax in the world.I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like them to be more visible, more integrated perhaps into how kids are learning.You and I grew up in the space race, you know, it was a no-brainer. Science was all around us. But do you see a way to make this story more pervasive?And I would like a boiler room tour in every school in America. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to charter buses. There are no permission slips, and you start to understand an energy system within a school. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be great to see innovation on that front. Maybe not as much as the innovation in laboratories for photovoltaics. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a communicator and an educator, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m biased \u2014 but I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of potential in that arena for innovation, as well. You should go on that boiler room tour. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great template.Not really. Not if your electricity coming in is zero CO2. If the electricity system isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about zero CO2, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to get there. I mean, just ignore the U.S. Assume we could cut some dramatic amount. Just look at India. They will be using over 10 times as much energy. And, yes, some of those light bulbs will be more efficient. Some of those refrigerators will be more efficient. But they will be using more kilowatt-hours. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not any doubt. A lot more. The more the better. And so the generation system really has to do the magical work here.And there are generation systems. I mean, nuclear has got lots of lots of problems, but it does not emit CO2. Hydro, if you manage it properly and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with a reservoir and everything, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to emit CO2.But I certainly agree with you that this is a problem that you can go from thinking it will be solved to thinking that it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be solved.And even some of the people who think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to be solved can be frustrating to me, because then the idea of oh no we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to invent anything, we just need to get rid of evil utilities that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t paying 50 cents a kilowatt-hour for rooftop solar, and as soon as we get them to just realize they should go bankrupt, you know, boom, this thing is solved. It is a very hard problem to solve, because energy systems have to be reliable. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a utility, you are supposed to buy low-cost energy on behalf of those consumers. Utilities are not there to spend money on global public goods, which is what CO2 reduction is.Well India is paradigmatic. And you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only 1.4 billion people. So they have to electrify. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why children don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die. They need to be able to refrigerate their food and heat and cool. And so if you think you have a solution that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t slow down India improving the lives of their people to be almost as good as what we take for granted, if you think today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology solves the India problem with no price premium, no reliability problem, then great. Go to India, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a capitalistic market there. Go ahead and do that. That is when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on our way.Then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not saying to them, trade off between these two things. Yes, the United States could afford for energy to cost a lot more than it does today. Europe can afford for energy to cost a lot more. Japan can afford for it to cost a lot more. But the future CO2 emitters are not going to pay some meaningful premium, nor are they going to give up total reliability. Their hospitals want energy; their factories want energy all the time.Well I call myself the impatient optimist, because I want things to go faster. With something like an HIV vaccine, you know, there are a lot of dead ends. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to believe that eventually you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to find one and you want to pursue a lot of different things. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very optimistic, you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting smarter all the time, ah, about how to do that. So it really won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen overnight.Well, in software, nobody at Microsoft is sitting there saying, oh yeah, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 2040 thing going look like? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a ridiculously long time period, even for a health-care type intervention, to try and think, hey we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing this great work so that we have this tool for 25 years from now.But for good reason \u2014 safety tests and capital costs and just the time it takes to build large-scale things \u2014 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time frame that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in. If that is part of the solution, which is hard to say, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really glad the work is being done. It has some meaningful chance of being able to help us with the climate problem.~ ~ ~ ~ReflectionsThis is mainly because I so often see\u00c2\u00a0a natural human bias toward the here and now \u2014 the low fruit \u2014 that tends to downplay the need to work now to build the intellectual and technical capacity for bigger changes later.With that in mind, one result of Gates\u2019s research campaign appears to be some constructive competition from other wealthy investors pursuing financial, instead of technological, breakthroughs.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRadical innovation in low-carbon energy technology is critical to long term climate mitigation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wolfensohn said. But he said he and others are exploring the creation of an investors\u2019 coalition, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplementary to the Gates initiative,\u00e2\u0080\u009d aimed\u00c2\u00a0at overcoming a different set of barriers to progress.\u201cFinancing renewables is fundamentally different than fossil energy,\u201d he said, noting, for example, that different investment vehicles are needed when there is a high capital cost up front and extremely low costs for energy in the end.\u00c2\u00a0\u201cEnergy efficiency,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is such a key part of the solution, is financed from avoided cost as opposed to revenue, which is its own challenge.\u201dHe described a host of new tools and approaches to financing that could, with an innovative push, \u201covercome those barriers to deployment that lie solely with the financing market, not with the technology.\u201dHere\u2019s an excerpt from the Gates Letter that helps define terms \u2014 a vital first step before debating the merits of different policies:Defining terms good start in hashing out clean-energy paths. @BillGates\u2019s take on \u201cmiracles\u201d https://t.co/E3suy2dIKy https://t.co/W3UORWRUosSolar and Livelihood \u2013 Solar Powered Sewing Machine being used in Manipur, India //t.co/iXzHVX1QfZ\u201cBill Gates Is Wrong That We Need \u00e2\u0080\u0098Energy Miracles\u2019 \u201d by Joe Romm for @ClimateProgress: https://t.co/BNbrBIUrRm.@BillGates Can oil majors be part of the clean-energy innovation agenda, directly or indirectly, or are they hopeless dinosaurs? @RevkinGood interview, but that\u2019s absurd.

{"Headline": "After South Carolina, Cruz and Rubio Vie to Become Top Rival to Trump", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported by\u201cLast night was truly the beginning of the real Republican primary,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on CNN.Mr. Cruz continued to remind people that he had handed Mr. Trump his only defeat so far, in Iowa.Mr. Trump, who owns a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, is widely seen as a favorite in the Nevada caucuses. From there, the race heads toward Super Tuesday on March 1, when 595 delegates will be at stake in a patchwork of 11 states, where Mr. Trump\u2019s large rallies and ability to command free television time will help him.A candidate needs 1,237 delegates for the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump, who won South Carolina by 10 percentage points, has more than 65 delegates; no other candidate has more than a dozen.Mr. Rubio\u2019s allies, who have been pushing for Mr. Romney\u2019s endorsement, believe that his eventual backing is all but certain. Some thought the endorsement was imminent on Saturday.But Mr. Romney, who strongly considered a 2016 presidential campaign of his own before bowing out as Mr. Bush made a show of fund-raising force, is not ready to make an endorsement, according to three people close to him,Mr. Bush\u2019s backing will most likely be tougher to secure. He and Mr. Rubio clashed heatedly over the last few weeks of the campaign, and Mr. Bush was plainly wounded by the experience of being upstaged by a candidate who was once his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Rubio praised Mr. Bush as a visionary governor and a good man. But it may take a more concerted effort at fence-mending to persuade Mr. Bush to join forces with Mr. Rubio.Another obstacle for Mr. Rubio is the presence of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. The two are fighting for some of the same voters, and Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign openly pushed for Mr. Kasich to leave the race in a memo sent to reporters on Sunday.\u201cJohn Kasich has no path to the nomination,\u201d Mr. Rubio\u2019s advisers wrote, asserting that there was no way for Mr. Kasich to accrue the needed delegates.Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Mr. Kasich, responded in kind. \u201cRubio has consistently underperformed throughout this nominating process. He has the same number of second-place finishes as Governor Kasich despite spending at least $45 million more,\u201d Mr. Schrimpf said. \u201cHis candidacy has not lived up to its promise despite all the hype. Rubio can\u2019t beat Trump in Florida, while we will beat him in Ohio.\u201dMr. Kasich, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio each sought to recruit Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign donors. But some of Mr. Bush\u2019s financial supporters were not receptive to the idea of opening their wallets for another campaign.Republicans aware of the conversations taking place among many of the party\u2019s biggest financiers on Sunday described a wariness from many Bush supporters who felt burned by having given so much to a losing cause. Mica Mosbacher, a Cruz fund-raiser based in Houston and New York, said she had begun placing calls to friends \u201cwho liked Cruz but stuck with Jeb out of family loyalty.\u201d She had resisted calling members of Mr. Bush\u2019s steering committee, she said, because \u201cthey need a moment of silence.\u201dThere was little evidence of either a partywide distress call or donors moving off the bench en masse toward Mr. Rubio, who has positioned himself to be the most palatable and electable remaining option for the Republican elites.Fred Zeidman, a major Republican donor and longtime Bush family friend who backed Mr. Bush, said he planned to take a breath and see how things played out.The same was true for Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets football team, who was Mr. Bush\u2019s national finance chairman. An aide to Mr. Johnson pointed out that he had invested a lot of time in helping Mr. Bush, even knocking on doors in early-voting states, and that he was not ready to shift allegiances so soon.Mr. Johnson, long a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, has nonetheless found himself used as an object lesson over the last week by the Republican front-runner, who mentioned Mr. Johnson at rallies as an example of special-interest donors who supported candidates like Mr. Bush.In a sign of how gingerly Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents continue to treat him, Mr. Rubio declined to attack him aggressively on Sunday. Asked about taking a more forceful approach, Mr. Rubio would say only that Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of foreign policy knowledge was worrisome.Time is running short for Mr. Rubio to demonstrate that he can achieve a victory and thwart Mr. Trump: His home state of Florida will vote on March 15.Mr. Trump was magnanimous in a round of television interviews Sunday. He argued that he was best suited to draw support from Democrats and independents in a general election against Hillary Clinton. And he went easy on his Republican opponents, even offering kind words about Mr. Bush, whom he had attacked viciously before.\u201cI wish him well \u2014 he\u2019s a nice person, he fought really hard,\u201d Mr. Trump said on MSNBC, adding that his son Eric was friendly with one of Mr. Bush\u2019s sons.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.As soon as the polls closed in South Carolina on Saturday night, Mr. Rubio\u2019s supporters began firing off emails to Mr. Bush\u2019s backers, many of whom the Rubio supporters had remained in close contact with over the last few months in anticipation of Mr. Bush\u2019s campaign ending.Some of Mr. Rubio\u2019s associates circulated data from recent polls showing that he would defeat Mr. Trump if the Republican contest narrowed to a two-man race.\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it plays out,\u201d Mr. Rubio said Sunday as he was boarding a flight to Tennessee, which holds its primary as part of the Super Tuesday slate and is a place where Mr. Rubio hopes to pick up crucial delegates. \u201cWe feel like a lot of people that were on Jeb\u2019s team are people we\u2019re going to welcome onto our team, people we\u2019ve known for a long time.\u201dBut as the candidates projected confidence, members of the Republican establishment were filled with increasing anxiety about Mr. Trump\u2019s prospects.\u201cAfter Trump has won in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Republicans are crazy and about to blow the White House if we don\u2019t rally to stop him,\u201d Mr. Barbour said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly time that we have to consolidate the race.\u201dHe predicted that Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination would mean a loss in the presidential race and a threat to the party\u2019s hold on the Senate.Some political strategists argued that too little had been done to take on Mr. Trump directly. Stuart Stevens, the top strategist to Mr. Romney in 2012, took issue with complaints that anti-Trump ads had failed to derail him. He pointed out that when Mr. Romney faced a challenge from Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, it was a focused effort.\u201cNo one is running a modern, focused, coordinated campaign against the front-runner as if they want to win,\u201d Mr. Stevens said.Reporting was contributed by Ashley Parker, Jeremy W. Peters, Alexander Burns, Thomas Kaplan and Matt Flegenheimer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iowa Results Signal Long Nominating Contests for Both Parties", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisA pair of presidential primary battles that just days ago seemed to have heavy favorites now present the prospect of protracted and expensive contests for both parties, as the candidates who survived the Iowa caucuses surged on Tuesday toward the New Hampshire primary to be held next week.No candidate in either party appears to have an easy path to capture consecutive victories in the next two contests, in New Hampshire and South Carolina. No one left Iowa with a convincing, rival-crushing win.And for the first time in recent history, insurgent candidates on both the left and the right are emerging from the caucuses with enough money to finance a strong offensive in the weeks ahead, across electoral terrain that will vary from famously flinty New Hampshire to conservative, middle-class upstate South Carolina to the post-recession suburbs of Las Vegas.What remains for the surviving contenders \u2014 particularly on the Republican side \u2014 are convoluted and extended paths to their parties\u2019 nominations. As of the end of December, the candidates and their allied \u201csuper PACs\u201d had more than $288 million in cash on hand, according to Federal Election Commission reports filed through Sunday evening.First they must persuade New Hampshire voters, many of whom have yet to settle on a candidate.\u201cIn New Hampshire, I still think about half the voters are undecided or prepared to change their mind,\u201d said John H. Sununu, the state\u2019s former governor.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida must quickly consolidate voters uneasy about the credentials and electability of the two candidates who finished ahead of him in Iowa, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and the blustery businessman Donald J. Trump.Mr. Rubio hurriedly declared a moral victory Monday night. And on Tuesday, after weeks of emphasizing his conservative credentials and sometimes aping the apocalyptic language of Mr. Trump, he struck a more upbeat tone in seeking to appeal to a very different electorate in New Hampshire, where independent voters are allowed to participate in either party\u2019s primary.\u201cI think people realize on the Republican side that we cannot afford, this country cannot afford, to lose this election, and that I give the party the best chance not just to unify the conservative movement but to grow it,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on the ABC program \u201cGood Morning America.\u201dBut to solidify his position as the consensus choice for establishment donors and conservative activists, Mr. Rubio must get past a thicket of center-right candidates who largely steered clear of Iowa\u2019s evangelical-dominated caucuses and have instead focused time and money on the more middle-of-the-road voters in New Hampshire: Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Jeb Bush. Each, like Mr. Rubio, is backed by groups fielding millions of dollars worth of television advertising.More money could surge into the race from other groups, as well. At a gathering in California last weekend, officials at the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch held preliminary discussions with donors about the possibility of a major intervention in the Republican primary against Mr. Trump, according to a participant in the conference. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz both have significant support among the network\u2019s allied donors.And for all the talk of Mr. Rubio\u2019s late surge in Iowa, it remains unclear in which of the next few primaries and caucuses on the calendar he could score an outright victory.After the Iowa caucuses, the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates.\u201cWhere does Rubio ever win?\u201d said Dave Carney, a New Hampshire-based Republican strategist. \u201cAnswer that and I can give you a better feel for how long this takes.\u201dMr. Trump leads in New Hampshire by more than 20 points in most credible polls, and by double digits in South Carolina. Yet after losing in Iowa, Mr. Trump \u2014 who spent more on giveaway hats and T-shirts last year than on identifying and targeting actual voters, according to campaign disclosures filed on Sunday \u2014 now faces the unsettling possibility that a winning campaign will require more than big rallies and social-media celebrity.His Twitter account, dark after his defeat was announced Tuesday morning, was unusually subdued when Mr. Trump did re-emerge on social media Tuesday morning \u2014 at least for a while.\u201cThe media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly,\u201d Mr. Trump posted, sounding both surprised and sulky. \u201cBrought in record voters and got second-highest vote total in history!\u201dThe state of play in the Democratic campaign is hardly more clear. Hillary Clinton, who was initially a heavy favorite over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, fought him to a draw in Iowa after a fierce campaign, saved in part by a finely tuned get-out-the-vote effort that studied and plied Iowa voters for months.She is widely considered to have the advantage in South Carolina, where black voters are a solid majority of the Democratic electorate, and in Nevada. But first she must contend with Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire \u2014 a state that neighbors Vermont, which Mr. Sanders has represented in Congress for decades \u2014 where he enjoys a strong lead.Candidates in both parties are grappling with an unpredictable electorate, whose anger at Washington and at their declining economic fortunes drove record turnout in the Iowa Republican caucuses. But instead of propelling a single candidate to a clear victory, it split among several different candidates, leaving Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump in something resembling a three-way tie.And money, often a long-term barrier for outsider candidates who eke out victories in Iowa, is no longer limited to candidates beloved by the well-heeled. Mr. Cruz, despised by the Republican Party\u2019s donor establishment, emerges from Iowa the best-funded insurgent Republican in recent history, with almost $19 million in cash on hand at the end of December, the most recent figures available.Similarly, while Mrs. Clinton has raised more money than any non-incumbent Democratic presidential candidate in history in an off-year, Mr. Sanders has managed to nearly keep pace entirely on the strength of small donors. More people have given to Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign so far \u2014 more than 1.3 million people, according to his campaign \u2014 than any other candidate at the same point in the campaign.He has more than enough money to survive Clinton victories in South Carolina and New Hampshire. In January alone, his campaign announced this week, Mr. Sanders pulled in $20 million. And his campaign reported raising more than $1 million in the 90 minutes after his speech Monday night.\u201cIt\u2019s historic that we\u2019re able to have this sort of grass-roots support for the campaign,\u201d said Michael Briggs, a Sanders spokesman. \u201cVirtually all of the people who have donated to us have not \u2018maxed out,\u2019 unlike those giving to Secretary Clinton. They can donate again and again.\u201dMr. Briggs added: \u201cPeople are going to be there for him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also remained unclear what effect any new assistance would have on the battlefield, or even how many ministers would be able to deliver on their commitments.\u201cThere\u2019s just a great deal going on,\u201d Mr. Carter said at a news conference after the meeting. He added that he was \u201chappy to see so much going on\u201d but that \u201cwe\u2019re also impatient.\u201d\u201cWe want the pace to accelerate,\u201d he said.Mr. Carter said on Thursday that Saudi Arabia \u2014 which has not participated in airstrikes in several months \u2014 was \u201creinvigorating its commitment to the coalition air campaign\u201d and had agreed to \u201ccontributing in other critical ways on the ground.\u201dHe added that the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Denmark had promised to make contributions, but the defense ministers from those countries still needed to get approval from their governments. He did not say what those countries had pledged.The Dutch, who have been carrying out airstrikes in Iraq, were prepared to now extend them in Syria, Mr. Carter told reporters. He praised the Canadian government for its announcement on Monday that it would expand its training, advisory and surveillance programs in northern Iraq. He did not mention that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, fulfilling a campaign promise, had also announced that his government would no longer participate in the bombing campaign against the Islamic State.Mr. Obama, who ran in 2008 on promises to end the United States military presence in Iraq, has urged other countries to do more in the fight. He has said he does not want to increase the number of American troops in Iraq beyond the 3,800 already in the country.The American public has been skeptical that the administration has a plan to defeat the Islamic State.Mr. Obama also does not wish to give the appearance that the United States is once again \u201cgoing it alone\u201d in the Middle East, and American diplomats and defense officials have made strong efforts to convince Arab countries to assume larger roles in the campaign. Those countries \u2014 including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 had been a part of the anti-ISIS campaign when it began in the summer of 2014, but their participation fell off as they got more deeply involved in the conflict in Yemen.Mr. Carter described the Saudi recommitment as \u201cvery welcome news,\u201d adding that \u201cSaudi Arabia and its regional partners have a clear stake in this fight, and I hope its neighbors in the Gulf also intensify their counter-ISIL campaign in the coming days.\u201dThe meeting was held at NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. As it began, Mr. Carter provided the defense ministers with an upbeat assessment of the military achievements against the Islamic State in recent months, and he predicted more in the coming weeks.Mr. Carter said that by the time the ministers meet next month in the United States to discuss the campaign, \u201dWe should begin to see tangible gains from the additional capabilities the coalition is bringing to bear against ISIL.\u201dWhen he was asked what those gains might be, he said that there were some expectations and details he could not discuss.\u201cThere\u2019s too much to enumerate,\u201d he said.Mr. Carter said that there were new efforts to cut off the Islamic State\u2019s financing. He added that a number of Iraqi military units were scheduled to finish their training and would then be deployed to the northern part of the country for the expected battle to retake the city of Mosul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Black America and the Class Divide", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byIn 1903, W.\u2009E.\u2009B. Du Bois, the leading scholar of the first half of the 20th century, defined the urgency of black social responsibility in his famous essay \u201cThe Talented Tenth\u201d \u2014 10 being the percentage of the African-American demographic needed to lead the race into an integrated, equal America. In \u201cThe Talented Tenth,\u201d Du Bois called for \u201cintelligent leadership\u201d directed by \u201ccollege-trained men\u201d devoted to a \u201cthorough understanding of the mass of Negroes and their problems\u201d for the purpose of solving these problems, still so deeply entrenched a half century after the abolition of slavery.Forty-five years later, Du Bois would lament, this call had been largely ignored. He worried aloud about the growing class divide within Black America and how the consequences of that divide might affect the task of \u201clifting as we climb,\u201d the motto of the National Association of Colored Women\u2019s Clubs, describing the privilege and burden of the middle class to facilitate black upward mobility.Indeed, by 1948 Du Bois felt that the new black middle class had forgotten this noble calling. There had been, even during his college days at Fisk, troublesome warning signs: \u201csharp young persons, who received the education given very cheaply at Fisk University, with the distinct and single-minded idea, of seeing how much they could make out of it for themselves, and nobody else.\u201dDu Bois knew, of course, that any black person at that time had to struggle to tear down barriers just to lift oneself and one\u2019s family. But that was not enough: Successful black people, he said, must recognize that their place in life was merely a matter of opportunity. \u201cIf such opportunity were extended and broadened, a thousand times as many Negroes could join the ranks of the educated and able, instead of sinking into poverty, disease, and crime.\u201dDu Bois also knew that Black America had never consisted of one social or economic class. Even before the outbreak of the Civil War, about 11 percent of Black America was free, some born into families that had been free for generations. And in 1899, when Du Bois published his seminal sociological study, \u201cThe Philadelphia Negro,\u201d he was already noting that these two classes had morphed into four: the middle class and above, working people (\u201cfair to comfortable\u201d), the poor and, in terms his Victorian contemporaries would have approved of, the \u201cvicious and criminal classes.\u201dDu Bois would probably be astonished to see how these classes have fared, especially since the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, just as new affirmative action programs were beginning to expand drastically the ranks of black students on white campuses and thus to affect the class structure of Black America.A review of campaigns since 1900 provides linear and ideological connections to today\u2019s racial unrest.The Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson calls the remarkable gains in black income \u201cthe most significant change\u201d since Dr. King\u2019s passing. When adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars, the percentage of African-Americans making at least $75,000 more than doubled from 1970 to 2014, to 21 percent. Those making $100,000 or more nearly quadrupled, to 13 percent (in contrast, white Americans saw a less impressive increase, from 11 to 26 percent). Du Bois\u2019s \u201ctalented 10th\u201d has become the \u201cprosperous 13 percent.\u201dBut, Dr. Wilson is quick to note, the percentage of Black America with income below $15,000 declined by only four percentage points, to 22 percent.In other words, there are really two nations within Black America. The problem of income inequality, Dr. Wilson concludes, is not between Black America and White America but between black haves and have-nots, something we don\u2019t often discuss in public in an era dominated by a narrative of fear and failure and the claim that racism impacts 42 million people in all the same ways.What effect, many of us have worried, would this unprecedented rise in prosperity have on the New Millennials? Would they heed Du Bois\u2019s call, as students like John Lewis and Julian Bond, Charlayne Hunter and Diane Nash did under the leadership of the \u201cNegro Gandhi\u201d presciently predicted by Du Bois back in 1948?The class divide is, in my opinion, one of the most important and overlooked factors in the rise of Black Lives Matter, led by a new generation of college graduates and students. I hear about it from my students at Harvard, about the pressure they feel to rise, yes, but also the necessity to then look back to lift others.I asked Kimiko Matsuda-Lawrence, a senior, what was behind the racial unrest on campus. Ms. Matsuda-Lawrence is co-founder of \u201cI, Too, Am Harvard,\u201d a multiplatform campaign that gives voice to students who often go unheard and that brought the concept of micro-aggressions into the light. She described the motivation as \u201cour sense of responsibility to the black communities who do not have access to the universities we attend.\u201d The goal: \u201cto call out the ways our own institutions participate in and perpetuate structures of racism that affect the black communities we represent through our presence at places like Harvard.\u201dThat is, the college campus is a microcosm of practices at work in the larger society, something of a laboratory in which America\u2019s racial experiment might be altered.Unlike the way they are framed in so many op-eds, modern-day activists, Ms. Matsuda-Lawrence says, are anything but \u201ca bunch of oversensitive, privileged and coddled black college students complaining and whining that they don\u2019t feel safe because of building names and house master titles.\u201dNew York Times journalists, student activists and college administrators discussed race on college campuses on Feb. 4.Consider them, instead, the grandchildren of Du Bois\u2019s \u201ctalented 10th,\u201d taking their cues, wittingly or unwittingly, from the challenge that he and the civil rights activists of the \u201960s issued to black leadership. Many of today\u2019s black activists are the children of middle- and upper-middle-class parents \u2014 the affirmative action generation \u2014 and may be realizing, as Charlayne Hunter-Gault put it to me, \u201cthat privilege doesn\u2019t always translate as they thought it would.\u201dDespite the highs \u2014 the escalating successes in finance, business, public service, education and entertainment (think beyond President Obama and sports figures to the American Express C.E.O. Kenneth Chenault, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, and the queen of Thursday-night TV, Shonda Rhimes) \u2014 there have been far too many lows, too many moments in which we as a country have come face to face with the deprivation, disenfranchisement, marginalization and flat-out abuse of African-Americans at the socioeconomic bottom.The disparity of opportunity plagues Black America perhaps even more starkly now, given its extremes, than the economic reality that motivated Dr. King to transfer the focus of his movement from civil rights to economic justice, as exemplified in his last, tragically aborted effort to mount a \u201cPoor People\u2019s Campaign.\u201dThe childhood poverty rate for African-Americans remains stubbornly close to what it was the day Dr. King was assassinated; unemployment for black Americans runs nearly double that of the national average; and the distrust between impoverished communities and the police continues to spiral (helped in no small part by the fact that blacks make up more than a third of the prison population, compared to only 13 percent of the overall population).And we still confront the question that arose the moment the first slave ships arrived: Do black lives matter?It is into this whiplash environment of economic inequality that college students have come of age. They were youngsters when Hurricane Katrina engulfed New Orleans \u2014 for a time the ultimate symbol of inequality of income and opportunity \u2014 and teenagers when George Zimmerman killed Trayvon Martin. They have been consumed by a roster of recorded police killings of unarmed black men and boys since August 2014, when Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., followed by similar assaults in Staten Island, Cleveland, Chicago and North Charleston, S.C.Black women and girls haven\u2019t escaped injustices, either. We need think only of the young girl in the Mall of America who was restrained by a security guard or the teenager in South Carolina who was thrown from her desk by a school resource officer, or the 13 black women who testified against the former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, who was convicted of rape.The nation\u2019s African-American students are searching profoundly and visibly for a definitive end to racial injustice. College campuses, Du Bois\u2019s proving grounds for the training and testing of social responsibility and leadership, have once again become a primary front in the battle against inequality \u2014 from \u201cI, Too, Am Harvard,\u201d a concept that has spread from Berkeley to New York University, to the principled protest of football players at the University of Missouri against racial insensitivity, to demonstrations at Brown and Brandeis, Princeton and Yale.A number of administrators have voiced strong support for these protests as well as an institutional will to change, be it renaming buildings or re-evaluating the makeup of their student body and faculty.Change, even at the symbolic level, is difficult, of course, and it remains to be seen what this current wave of protests will accomplish. Will the fight against police brutality, symbols of the Confederacy and society\u2019s plethora of micro-aggressions become the basis of a broader movement for the improvement of underfunded public school education, for the right to a job with decent wages, and for the end of residential segregation that relegates the poor to neighborhoods with murder rates as alarming as those on the South Side of Chicago?What is certain is that the outrage that led to Black Lives Matter and its spinoffs will be with us for years to come unless these legacies of slavery and Jim Crow become remnants of a racist past.Henry Louis Gates Jr. is co-author of \u201cAnd Still I Rise: Black America Since MLK,\u201d host of \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d on PBS and director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India to Change Its Decades-Old Reliance on Female Sterilization", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byMAHENDRAGARH, India \u2014 This is what family planning in India often looks like: Women in their 20s, mostly farmers\u2019 wives, gather at dawn on the stairs of a district hospital. Hours later, a surgeon arrives. His time is short. He asks the women to sit in a row on the floor of the operating room and then, in operations lasting a few minutes apiece, uses a laparoscope to sever their fallopian tubes, ensuring they will never again bear a child.The number of lives touched by such policies is enormous and growing. India will soon surpass China as the world\u2019s most populous nation, and by 2050 it is expected to gain 400 million new citizens, more than the population of the United States.\u201cI thought it was incumbent on the government to provide it as a choice,\u201d said C. K. Mishra, additional secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, of the contraceptive Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate, or DMPA, which has been used in the private sector since 1993. Still, the method will be introduced gingerly, limited at first to select district hospitals and medical colleges and then expanded next year to hospitals throughout the country. Implanted contraceptives may follow.\u201cWe want to be very careful,\u201d Mr. Mishra said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put a single step wrong.\u201dIn the context of India\u2019s recent history, it is no wonder officials have been risk-averse and advocates mistrustful. In 1975, the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi led an aggressive campaign, in some cases forcing young or childless men to undergo vasectomies to meet quotas. More than six million sterilizations were performed, igniting a widespread protest movement.More than a decade later, when India began exploring the public use of injectable contraceptives, activist groups filed cases with the country\u2019s Supreme Court seeking to ban the drugs, contending that they had not been proved safe and could be used coercively.The court forwarded the matter to India\u2019s Drug Technical Advisory Board, which in 1995 allowed private use to continue but recommended against offering them in government clinics. The decision was not revisited for 20 years, even as use of the method became widespread in neighboring Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.\u201cInvariably these new methods are tried on women who have no infrastructure to fall back on, who have no other resources to go for private health care,\u201d said Navsharan Singh, a senior program specialist at the International Development Research Center, which is financed by the government of Canada. She said the current plan, to deliver the drugs through major hospitals, improved the prospects for follow-up.In 2010, K. Sujatha Rao, then the union secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in the Congress-led government, recommended lifting the ban on injectable contraceptives. But she left her post shortly thereafter, she said, and \u201cbecause of civil society pressure, when I left, the government didn\u2019t push it at all.\u201dThe atmosphere around injectable contraceptives began to shift after Mr. Modi\u2019s party took over in May 2014, and it gained momentum after the Chhattisgarh catastrophe, about six months later. Last year, \u201cAll the stars aligned,\u201d said Dr. Jyoti Vajpayee, a gynecologist who oversees family planning programs here for the Gates Foundation.\u201cThis government has come back in a majority, so they can afford to take risks,\u201d she said.She and others had long sought to convince officials that existing options \u2014 male and female sterilization, the pill, IUDs and condoms \u2014 were insufficient for millions of Indian women who marry in their late teens and spend years carrying back-to-back pregnancies.Research has shown that, globally, 30 percent of maternal deaths and 10 percent of child deaths could be prevented if women spaced their pregnancies two years apart.At a meeting in August, the Drug Technical Advisory Board recommended that DMPA be included in the family planning program, saying 20 years of private use and studies of similar drugs by the Indian Council for Medical Research had established that they were safe to introduce without a pilot program.Dr. C. N. Purandare, past president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India and a proponent of the drugs, praised the government for what he called \u201ca bold step.\u201dNot that the traditional method is being phased out. At a recent sterilization camp about 90 miles west of Delhi, a time-honored system was chugging along.The women here, many of whom had traveled from their villages, said that they were eager to go for \u201cthe operation,\u201d and that the cash incentive of 1,400 rupees, about $20, had not affected their decision. They had been urged on by outreach workers who had accompanied them to the camp, older women from their own villages.These women are paid 1,000 rupees for each patient with two or fewer children who comes in for sterilization and 240 rupees for each patient with three or more. They admitted that there were drawbacks to sterilization, especially for young women who might someday want to have another child.\u201cWe have to tell them a lot of things to convince them,\u201d said Sudesh Wati, 50.Young women often listen to the outreach workers.\u201cAfter she spoke to me, I made up my mind that in today\u2019s times, nobody wants more than two children,\u201d said Krishna Yadav, 35, gesturing at an amiable gray-haired woman standing nearby. \u201cShe has been telling me this for the last two months.\u201dAsked about injectable contraceptives, the women mostly looked blank. They had never heard of them.In any case, said Lalit Sharma, a nurse who trains outreach workers, when a new method comes online, women will almost certainly accept it.\u201cWhatever method it might be,\u201d he said, \u201cif the government implements it, they blindly trust it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congresswoman\u2019s Long Quest: Bringing Pandas to New York", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byIt is an obsession that has taken her to the other side of the world, one that has turned casual conversations into arm-twisting negotiations, and innocuous radio chitchat into a stealth attack on the mayor of New York.And yet, Ms. Maloney has been undeterred.Her efforts carry all the marks of a lawmaker practiced in the art of hardball, and illustrate the surprising forms political advocacy can take.Needing the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, Ms. Maloney castigated him on the radio, declaring on a program on WNYM-AM last winter that the mayor plainly \u201cdoesn\u2019t like pandas.\u201d She won the backing of another Democrat, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who often jousts with Mr. de Blasio.Her office sent letter after letter to Chinese officials soliciting support, and in summer 2014 she traveled to China to visit a panda preserve in Chengdu.And in a fund-raising coup, Ms. Maloney recently secured the support of Maurice R. Greenberg, the billionaire former chairman of A.I.G., who has agreed to help gather money for the project. Mr. Greenberg said he will host a breakfast in March to help initiate a fund-raising campaign for a panda exhibit.\u201cOur city,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cwould benefit in numerous ways from this project.\u201dBut the congresswoman\u2019s enthusiasm for pandas is deeply personal, she said, dating back decades to when one of her young daughters aspired to become a panda scientist. That daughter is now in business school.Ms. Maloney, 69, said she had found that pandas have a unique power to bring people together. She recalled, for instance, a tense meeting with Chinese officials after NATO forces inadvertently bombed China\u2019s embassy in Belgrade in 1999, during the war in Yugoslavia.The coiled tension in the room eased, she said, only after she \u201cfinally broke the ice with pandas.\u201dDavid Towne, the chairman of the United States-based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation, said a project of the scale envisioned in New York would require \u201csupport at the $50 million level.\u201dMr. Towne, who said he had spoken with Ms. Maloney, warned that even if backers raised that much money, a New York panda project would face uncertain prospects, given that zoos in Atlanta, Memphis, San Diego and Washington already have giant pandas on display.\u201cChina has been very vocal in saying, no more pandas to North America, or to the U.S., specifically,\u201d Mr. Towne said.For those reasons and others, Ms. Maloney has faced deep skepticism from officials in City Hall and conservation leaders in New York. An initial proposal to bring pandas to the Central Park Zoo foundered after she grudgingly conceded that the zoo did not have the necessities required for a panda habitat \u2014 as zoo officials had insisted all along.In fall 2014, Ms. Maloney\u2019s office drafted a letter, directed at Chinese officials, for the mayor to sign. City Hall left it without a signature for over a year \u2014 a particular sticking point, since China would not consider lending pandas to the city without Mr. de Blasio\u2019s support.At times, Ms. Maloney\u2019s indifference to the obstacles in her path has generated friction on its own. In summer 2014, a senior official at the conservation society appealed to City Hall, writing in an email that things had reached \u201ca new level of absurdity\u201d as Ms. Maloney intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo.\u201cI think a statement saying that we appreciate her passion but we are not interested in pandas would be helpful,\u201d the official wrote. \u201cClearly she doesn\u2019t hear it when we say it to her respectfully.\u201dNevertheless, Ms. Maloney received a message in October from the Chinese ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, agreeing that China\u2019s forestry authorities would enter preliminary talks with New York and would \u201cconsider the formal initiation of cooperation when conditions are mature.\u201dAt the white-tie Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in November, Ms. Maloney cornered Mr. de Blasio to further plead her case, and this time she brought reinforcement: John A. Catsimatidis, the billionaire political donor and owner of the supermarket chain Gristedes.Gradually, Ms. Maloney and her negotiating partners approached a point of consensus. City Hall agreed to sign her letter, with the understanding that private funds would be required, and that the 265-acre Bronx Zoo would be a more appropriate site.Ms. Maloney has also smoothed relations with the conservation society, and agreed during her visit to the Bronx Zoo to back a bill the group supports, designating the bison as the nation\u2019s official mammal.Mr. Catsimatidis, a candidate in 2013 for the Republican nomination for mayor, said he intended to lead a fund-raising drive and estimated that he could collect the money for a panda exhibit in 90 days.More support has come from an even less likely source: the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican and a zoo enthusiast, who said in an email that New York would benefit from \u201cthese remarkable animals.\u201d\u201cSurely the greatest American city ought to have pandas,\u201d Mr. Gingrich wrote.Ms. Maloney said she felt closer than ever to her ultimate aim. She said she envisioned a bamboo forest upstate, to secure a reliable food supply for the pandas, and she has begun to brainstorm what kind of animals New York could give to China as a token of appreciation and cultural exchange.\u201cMaybe,\u201d she mused, \u201cthe upstate deer are so sweet, and they\u2019re sort of a symbol of peace.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alan Grayson\u2019s Double Life: Congressman and Hedge Fund Manager", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The hedge fund manager boasted that he had traveled to \u201cevery country\u201d in the world, studying overseas stock markets as he fine-tuned an investment strategy to capitalize on global companies\u2019 suffering because of economic or political turmoil.But the fund manager had an even more distinctive credential to showcase in his marketing material in June 2013: He was a \u201cU.S. congressman,\u201d Representative Alan Grayson, Democrat of Florida, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Now he is also among the leading Democratic candidates for one of Florida\u2019s United States Senate seats.The inquiry has become public, but emails and marketing documents obtained by The New York Times show the extent to which Mr. Grayson\u2019s roles as a hedge fund manager and a member of Congress were intertwined, and how he promoted his international travels, some with congressional delegations, to solicit business.Interviews and the documents show that Mr. Grayson told potential investors in his hedge fund that they should contribute money to the fund to capitalize on the unrest he observed around the world, and to take particular advantage when there was \u201cblood in the streets.\u201dKen Scudder, a spokesman for Mr. Grayson, disputed that account. \u201cThere has never been any time when Representative Grayson\u2019s investment activities have disrupted any of his work, whether official or campaign-related,\u201d he said.Mr. Grayson says he has done nothing wrong. \u201cHere is something that is not true: that I somehow traded on my membership as a U.S. congressman to get clients for this fund,\u201d Mr. Grayson said in an interview. He added that in the last year he had refunded the full original investments put in by his two outside investors in a fund that had faced steep losses \u2014 leaving only Mr. Grayson and a family trust invested in the fund.Mr. Grayson has closed the Cayman Islands branches of the hedge fund, and in September, after the ethics complaint was filed, he changed the name of the fund from the Grayson Fund to the Sibylline Fund, LP. He did so, he said, to try to assuage critics who said he was violating congressional ethics rules by naming a professional business after himself. Although Mr. Grayson said he did not agree that the name was a violation, \u201cthere was no point in arguing about it any longer.\u201dEmail correspondence from June 2015 between Representative Alan Grayson and his campaign manager at the time involves concern among his staff about the political damage Mr. Grayson\u2019s hedge fund could cause his Senate bid.But Mr. Grayson\u2019s activities have long concerned his campaign aides. In private emails in June, Mr. Grayson\u2019s aides pleaded with him to close the hedge fund, convinced that its focus on investing in nations hit by political or economic strife, and its ties to the Cayman Islands, a notorious tax haven, sharply conflicted with his image as a scold of Wall Street \u2014 even if he had not done anything wrong.Mr. Grayson rejected the advice, the emails show. \u201cI still think that it would be taken, wrongly, as an admission of guilt,\u201d he wrote back.More recently, David Keith, finance director for Mr. Grayson\u2019s Senate campaign, was being paid about $1,000 a month, in part to help Mr. Grayson in a search for new investors in his hedge fund, Mr. Keith said in an interview. He worked for Mr. Grayson from early 2014 to late 2015, he said.As for the marketing materials that appeared to solicit outside business, in the interview Mr. Grayson questioned whether they had been publicly distributed.Some prominent Washington ethics lawyers who examined hedge fund documents obtained by The Times said he might have violated House ethics rules.\u201cOn its face, what he has done here seems to be problematic,\u201d said Stanley M. Brand, a former House general counsel. \u201cYou can\u2019t use your official position to advance your business interests or create a personal gain.\u201dMr. Grayson accuses Democratic Party leaders of trying to undermine his campaign so the nomination will go to Representative Patrick Murphy, a Democrat who they say has a better shot at helping the party win a Senate seat that is being vacated by Marco Rubio, a Republican who is running for president.Mr. Murphy declined through a spokesman to comment.In the 2013 hedge fund marketing material, the Grayson Fund is described as an investment opportunity that will \u201ccapitalize on markets in turmoil due to economic, political or natural disasters.\u201d It says, \u201cAlan Grayson specializes in discovering outstanding companies that are undervalued due to forces beyond their control.\u201dAnother hedge fund marketing document cited a quotation attributed to an early member of the Rothschild banking family in advising that \u201cthe time to buy is when there\u2019s blood in the streets.\u201dMr. Grayson defended his approach. \u201cWhat creates the opportunity is when people overreact to something bad happening,\u201d he said.At least some of Mr. Grayson\u2019s global travel has been paid for by the United States government, congressional records show. Mr. Grayson has traveled in official congressional delegations to Finland, Iraq, Kuwait, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, according to a tally of those records by LegiStorm, a website that assembles data on Congress. He has also traveled to Israel on an official trip paid for by a private group, according to LegiStorm.But Mr. Grayson\u2019s spokesman said the congressman had not invested in any country that he had traveled to as part of an official delegation, or used any information gained in that travel to assist in his investment strategies.A document dated June 2013 details the capabilities that it says Representative Alan Grayson brings to the hedge fund he continued to run despite his return to Congress.Mr. Grayson said the marketing materials did not violate the rules in the House ethics manual that prohibit members of Congress from using their names for businesses that provide professional services because the manual says the ban applies only to companies that provide professional services \u201cinvolving a fiduciary responsibility.\u201d Mr. Grayson said he intentionally set up his hedge fund so he did not have such a responsibility to its investors, an arrangement that is allowed under the law in Delaware, where the fund is based.House ethics rules also require that lawmakers list the names of companies they invest in through any hedge fund in an annual financial disclosure report. Mr. Grayson\u2019s most recent report, covering 2014, is 36 pages long and written by hand and does not segregate transactions conducted on behalf of the hedge fund from other personal transactions.Documents obtained by The Times show that the hedge fund lost about 17 percent of its value in its first 18 months of operation. Even so, the fund rules called for investors to pay a 2 percent annual management fee.At least one of Mr. Grayson\u2019s former outside investors, Bob Poe, a prominent Florida businessman and campaign contributor to Mr. Grayson and other Democrats, said he reached out to the congressman in 2014 after he became concerned over the fund\u2019s losses.\u201cThis fund is taking a beating,\u201d Mr. Poe recalled telling Mr. Grayson. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t fit my investment temperament.\u201dMr. Poe, who is running for the House in a neighboring Florida district, said he was pleased when Mr. Grayson called him last year and notified him he would pay him back in full.\u201cI have never had anyone come back and do that,\u201d said Mr. Poe of a money-losing investment. \u201cIt was Alan\u2019s decision to do it.\u201dMr. Grayson said he thought paying Mr. Poe back in full was the right thing to do, given that he is running what he called a \u201cfriends and family\u201d hedge fund.\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s very frustrating to me,\u201d Mr. Grayson said. \u201cThis whole insinuation that I have done something improper.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Christie, a former chairman of the Republican Governors Association, has since reached out to other elected officials, and called his donor network, to seek more establishment support for Mr. Trump. \u201cChris Christie\u2019s endorsement of Donald Trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism,\u201d Ms. Whitman, who was a national finance co-chair of the Christie campaign, said in the statement.\u201cDonald Trump is unfit to be president,\u201d Ms. Whitman said. \u201cHe is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears. Trump would take America on a dangerous journey. Christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly. The governor is mistaken if he believes he can now count on my support, and I call on Christie\u2019s donors and supporters to reject the governor and Donald Trump outright. I believe they will. For some of us, principle and country still matter.\u201dMr. Christie, the governor of New Jersey, dropped out of the presidential race after finishing in an embarrassing sixth place in the New Hampshire primary.

{"Headline": "Chief of Pemex, Mexican Energy Giant, Steps Aside", "Date": "2016-02-08", "News": "Supported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The chief executive of Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company Pemex, Emilio Lozoya Austin, stepped down on Monday, a casualty of the energy giant\u2019s struggle with collapsing oil prices and declining production.In his place, Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, appointed Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya, a Harvard-educated economist with a long career in Mexico\u2019s finance ministry. Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya has spent the last three years as the head of Mexico\u2019s sprawling social security institute, the country\u2019s main public health system.Concern over Pemex\u2019s finances has risen over the past week. Last week, the president of the central bank, Agust\u00edn Carstens, issued a sharp warning that planned spending cuts at Pemex could not be postponed.Mr. Lozoya, who was appointed to lead Pemex at the start of President Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s term three years ago, was seen as a capable turnaround specialist from the private sector who could wring efficiencies from the company.His chief task was preparing Pemex for stiffer competition as the government began to open Mexico\u2019s closed oil sector to the private sector in an effort to reverse the decline in output. Pemex crude production has fallen by more than a million barrels a day since its peak in 2004.But special interests at the company, like its unions and its private contractors, hampered those efforts.\u201cI think nobody anticipated a crisis of this dimension at Pemex,\u201d said Luis Miguel Labardini, a partner at Marco y Asociados, an energy consultancy here. \u201cThere were so many changes that were needed, but one way another he was not able to do the job.\u201dMr. Gonz\u00e1lez Anaya is not new to the oil company. As a former finance under secretary, he served on the energy giant\u2019s board.The Mexican government taxes Pemex heavily to finance national spending, taking enough money that the company has long operated at a loss. That also means that Pemex was unable to invest in new oil fields when it had the benefit of high prices.Analysts say that Pemex\u2019s most profitable opportunities lie in the deep of the Gulf of Mexico, but finding and developing new deepwater fields is so expensive that oil companies usually establish joint ventures.Along with debt that, including pension liabilities, is close to $200 billion, Mr. Labardini said the company was so cash poor that it owes its contractors $10 billion.The company employs 150,000 workers, and although it said there would be job cuts last year, the layoffs affected only workers who were outsourced.Advertisement"}

Eliot said, meaning that the best poets seek to improve on lasting ideas. It would seem that the Democratic presidential primary\u2019s mature poet is Hillary Clinton, who has been adopting the progressive words, and style, of her rival Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator\u2019s longstanding call for revolution against a system rigged against the poor and middle class resonates with young Democrats who jam convention halls to hear his booming, Brooklyn-accented voice. Some Democrats say it\u2019s great that Mr. Sanders is nudging Mrs. Clinton to the left. Others say she\u2019s merely parroting the race\u2019s true progressive.Responding to Mr. Sanders\u2019s call for a $15 per hour minimum wage, Mrs. Clinton, who favors raising the federal minimum to $12, now says she supports state and local efforts for higher minimums. Her call for a \u201cfair share surcharge\u201d on people making more than $5 million a year is a response to Mr. Sanders\u2019s signature call for the rich to take on a greater role in caring for the poor. Both candidates now take their audiences on a Caribbean tour of overseas tax havens and pledge to close tax loopholes for wealthy individuals and corporations, a longtime stance of Mr. Sanders\u2019s.Mr. Sanders now promises to increase government funding to Planned Parenthood, an organization Mrs. Clinton has championed for years. He also puts equal pay for women front and center in his speeches, another issue Mrs. Clinton, endorsed by many women\u2019s groups, has owned in the past.The merging of the philosophies pursued by these two very different politicians is a fascinating twist in the race. After an entire political career as a voice in the wilderness, Mr. Sanders\u2019s lifelong message is resonating. The challenge for Mrs. Clinton is to listen and adapt to what these voters are demanding, not just to imitate what Mr. Sanders says.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghanistan\u2019s Crippled Power Grid Exposes Vulnerability of Besieged Capital", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 When saboteurs crippled the Afghan capital\u2019s power supply last month, the tailors in Najeebullah\u2019s clothing shop had to abandon their electric sewing machines for hand-cranked models. Their output fell by half.\u201cI\u2019ve lost nearly $215 since the power cuts,\u201d Mr. Najeebullah, a gentle-mannered man with a gray beard, said. \u201cI have four tailors to pay, whether they sew two outfits a day or four. And I have to pay my rent and feed my staff, whether I make money or not.\u201dMr. Najeebullah, who goes by only one name, said he eventually decided to buy a diesel generator, \u201cbut I have to pass the fuel costs on to my customers, and they can\u2019t afford it.\u201dThree decades of conflict have taught Afghans to be resilient and adaptable, but the latest hardships have further soured the mood in this city of five million people.Every day brings promises by the government that the lights will be on again soon, but the cables fell in areas contested or controlled by the Taliban, suggesting a lasting restoration will be possible only with the acquiescence of the insurgents.Many homes and most large businesses here already have backup generators. But the privations are another disappointment for a long-suffering people. The creation of a modern power grid, paid for by international donors, was one of Afghanistan\u2019s signature achievements after the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. Only 5 percent of Afghans had electricity then, compared with 40 percent today, according to Qudratullah Delawari, the chief executive of DABS, Afghanistan\u2019s national power company.So much of everyday commerce and modern social life, even in Kabul, is conducted online, and every temporary return of power creates a dash to surf the web and recharge electrical devices.Assadullah, who was wiping the dust from his Toyota Corolla outside a Soviet-era apartment block in the Macrorayan neighborhood where he lives with his family, said he had only two hours of electricity a day.\u201cIf there is no electricity, then there is no heat,\u201d he said, \u201cand we don\u2019t get running water, which means all the toilets and bathrooms are unusable.\u201d Every evening, the women and children stand in line to fill buckets with water from the downstairs tap, which they then lug up the stairs.\u201cHonestly, we don\u2019t have any expectations for this government; they can\u2019t help the people,\u201d Mr. Assadullah, who also goes by one name, said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening with the problem because there is no electricity to watch the news on TV.\u201dBeyond the inconvenience and the damage to the country\u2019s limping economy, the cuts to power have exposed the vulnerability of a city that already felt besieged. The Taliban have been gaining ground since the departure of most United States and other NATO combat soldiers at the end of 2014, staging daily attacks on police and army checkpoints in Kabul and the surrounding provinces.Traveling by road even a few dozen miles outside the city can be a dicey proposition because of insurgents and brigands.The government has blamed the Taliban for the power failures, though the insurgents, through a spokesman, denied responsibility. Conspiracy-minded Afghans suggest that the destruction of power lines was the work of gangs seeking to profit by selling generators and the diesel to run them. Regardless of who is responsible, the areas where the pylons fell are the scenes of major battles between the army and the Taliban, and repair work cannot begin until hostilities cease and mines are cleared in the area.At the best of times, DABS, the power company, is able to meet less than three-quarters of the capital\u2019s demand of 800 megawatts of electricity, Mr. Delawari, the chief executive, said. Emergency measures, including the use of an American-financed diesel-powered plant, have made up some of the deficit, he said, but the supply is still well short of normal.\u201cExpectations are that we can bring the lines up in days, as soon as the area is secured,\u201d Mr. Delawari said. Last year an avalanche in the Salang Pass, north of Kabul, knocked out three pylons, he noted, requiring 45 days to fix, but that was in far more challenging terrain. In Baghlan, he said, a temporary fix could be rigged quickly if the combatants would stand down.\u201cI\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll be able to restore the electricity supply within the next week,\u201d he said.On Tuesday, a police commander in Baghlan reported that the DABS crew was already reconnecting cables, but a DABS spokesman disagreed, saying that no work could be done until land mines were defused and the area was secured. For now, the power failures are affecting almost every aspect of life in Kabul, including religious observance.\u201cMost people like me used to pray at home,\u201d said Sadiqullah, who had just emerged from a mosque in the Karte Seh neighborhood of the capital. \u201cNow we go to the local mosque, not only to pray, but because we can use the generator there to recharge our cellphones. If you plug in your phone for the whole time you\u2019re praying, you get just enough of a charge for a couple of phone calls.\u201d\u201cThen we come back and charge up again at the next call for prayer,\u201d he said.Jawad Sukhanyar and Ahmad Shakib contributed reporting from Kabul, and Najim Rahim from Kunduz, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ponzi Scheme in China Gained Credibility From State Media", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byHONG KONG \u2014 At every turn in his improbably rapid rise, Ding Ning, 34, went to great efforts to convey the image of strong government backing for his Internet financing business.There was his company\u2019s lavish annual meeting and banquet last year in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People, where China\u2019s legislature meets and where top government leaders host official functions. Adding a splash of celebrity to the event were Zhou Tao, a nationally famous actress and host on the government\u2019s main television broadcaster, and several mid-ranking officials, bureaucrats and lawmakers.There were the positive profiles in state-controlled media, as well as the company\u2019s advertising on official TV. There was the section of his company\u2019s website devoted to building Communist Party spirit.The charges were conveyed by the same official outlets whose favor Mr. Ding once curried \u2014 CCTV, the official TV broadcaster, and Xinhua, the main government news agency. And for some investors and employees, that apparent reversal smacked of hypocrisy.\u201cOne day, you praise the company, another day, you criticize it. Exactly what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Yang Fan, 29, a Beijing resident who worked at Ezubao until December.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for it to be this big without government support,\u201d he said, adding that like many employees he is still owed money by the company. \u201cWe really want an answer. We all are victims.\u201dThe demise of Ezubao highlights a precarious challenge for the Chinese government. Beijing has actively promoted Internet finance as a way to make affordable credit available to more businesses and consumers, potentially helping to cushion the blow of the country\u2019s slowing economic growth. Investors have embraced the model with gusto, helping China surge past the United States last year to become the biggest global market for such lending, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley.But regulation of the sector has failed to keep pace with its explosive expansion, and that has left it ripe for abuse, putting ordinary investors at risk. The prospect of angry investors and former employees taking to the streets in protest is anathema to China\u2019s leadership, which may explain the prompt and high-profile action seen so far in the Ezubao case.Ezubao sold itself as a peer-to-peer lender, which matches investors with potential borrowers online. Ezubao also said it specialized in helping companies raise funds for equipment leasing.Set up by Mr. Ding\u2019s main holding company, Yucheng, in July 2014, Ezubao grew quickly. It drew in funds from nearly one million investors by promising annual returns as high as 15 percent, much higher than bank deposits or many other peer-to-peer lenders.But more than 95 percent of the investment products Ezubao marketed on its platform were fake, Xinhua said this week, citing local officials. Instead, investors\u2019 funds were used to enrich Mr. Ding, his family members and other top executives, including attractive women whom he put on payroll and lavished with expensive gifts, Xinhua said. Those included real estate, cars and luxury goods, like a villa in Singapore valued at 130 million renminbi, or $20 million, according to the Xinhua report and a confession made by Mr. Ding that was televised by CCTV this week.Executives went to great efforts to conceal their ruse, according to the Xinhua report. Those efforts included literally burying the evidence: Police in China\u2019s Anhui Province, where Ezubao is based, deployed two excavators that worked for 20 hours to dig up some 1,200 documents that were buried nearly 20 feet underground at a site on the outskirts of Hefei, the provincial capital.In interviews, former staff and investors described the signals of strong state support as one of the keys to Ezubao\u2019s rapid rise.\u201cMany people joined Ezubao because they saw the support from the government and from some government officials,\u201d said Feng Zhe, 36, a Beijing resident who worked as a salesman at the company from June of last year until December.Mr. Feng said a number of his friends and family members invested in Ezubao\u2019s products and suffered losses. \u201cMany people bought their products because the government has lent the company credibility,\u201d he added.Luo Kaichen, 30, said he decided last July to invest 1 million renminbi in Ezubao, at an interest rate of 14.6 percent.Mr. Luo, a former banker who now works at an e-commerce company in Beijing, said he had not previously invested in online financing products. But friends were recommending Ezubao, and after he did some research, he was impressed.Ezubao had received positive reviews and coverage in articles posted on a number of central government websites. \u201cNot every company will receive complimentary articles on government websites,\u201d he said.The company also placed advertisements on CCTV, the state broadcaster, which Mr. Luo took to mean it had passed some level of official scrutiny.\u201cThose advertisements usually would require strict vetting,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, CCTV is a media organization, but also part of the state.\u201dCCTV declined to comment. A person in the office of the station\u2019s chief editor who answered the phone on Friday said, \u201cWe have no knowledge of the situation.\u201dIn addition to Ms. Zhou, other luminaries who appeared in public on behalf of Ezubao included Guan Tong, another CCTV anchor. Neither could be reached Friday for comment. Officials from the National People\u2019s Congress; a research institute under the State Council, or China\u2019s cabinet; and even some of China\u2019s lesser-known political parties have also showed up at promotional events for Ezubao.While the investigation into Ezubao continues, the circumstances of the case have prompted calls for a thorough exploration of who was involved in carrying out the alleged fraud and whether corruption of government officials or regulators came into play.\u201cWe advise government to investigate this clearly to identify criminal intent and motive,\u201d the Beijing Lawyers Association said in a statement this week after being asked by the city\u2019s justice bureau to give advice on the case. \u201cAny corruption or crimes involving government and supervision departments should be punished,\u201d it added.But for investors who lost their funds, it remains to be seen whether there is any hope of getting their money back.Zhang Wenru, 24, works at a steel company in Baotou, a city in Inner Mongolia. He saw an ad for Ezubao in October on CCTV and decided to invest 20,000 renminbi, at an attractive interest rate of 14.6 percent annually.\u201cI thought to myself, now that it\u2019s on CCTV, there should be a lot of credibility,\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cSo I thought why not give it a try?\u201dOnce reports started surfacing in December that Ezubao was under investigation, Mr. Zhang became concerned. He attempted to withdraw his funds, but there was a problem with Ezubao\u2019s text-message authentication system.Angered, he decided to report the matter to the police.\u201cOf course I want my money back, but overall I am quite at ease with myself,\u201d he added of his current situation. \u201cIf I can get back the money, great. If not, let it be. It\u2019s just my salary for half a year.\u201dOwen Guo and Cao Li contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

But they found themselves locked out, just as tens of thousands of civilians fleeing the most intense bombing of the war are locked in.\u201cThe deals they make there are so isolated and detached from this reality here,\u201d said Faisal, 25, who gave only a first name to protect relatives still inside Syria.Mohammad Saeed, 27, pointed out that before Munich, there were three rounds of fruitless peace talks in Geneva, the last falling apart before it even began. \u201cGeneva 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\u201d he said, counting on his fingers. \u201cAnd there is nothing.\u201dThe men said the proposal would not stop the shooting, the scrambling from refuge to refuge, the fears of the Islamic State infiltrating rebel-held areas or the threat of government forces besieging more cities and towns. Least of all did they expect it to stop the Russian bombing campaign that has put so many civilians on the run in recent days.In Geneva, United Nations officials and diplomats were groping for details on Friday about the shape of a \u201chumanitarian task force\u201d the organization was charged with creating to immediately deliver aid inside Syria as part of the Munich agreement. As they discussed what the task force would do, the United Nations refugee agency reported that more than 80,000 migrants had arrived in Europe by boat over the last six weeks, more than half of them women and children.Agency officials said that some 2,000 people were still arriving daily in Greece, undeterred by the dangers of rough seas and winter weather that have resulted in more than 400 deaths. Nearly a quarter of the people who reached Greece in January were from Aleppo, the divided city that the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive seeks to bring completely under state control.In Aleppo, where roughly 400,000 people are still living in areas outside government control, international aid workers welcomed the news from Munich but also expressed deep skepticism about it. In a telephone news conference conducted by Save the Children, they also expressed concern that the one-week delay in the proposed cessation of hostilities would give all combatants more reason to escalate the fighting immediately.\u201cWhy wait a week?\u201d asked Dalia al-Awqati, director of North Syria programs for Mercy Corps., who participated in the news conference. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is shameful and morally unacceptable. It must end.\u201dHere on the Turkish-Syrian border, several spokesmen for the insurgent groups the United States deems moderate enough to support dismissed the cease-fire plan as na\u00efve and fanciful. They said it included a gigantic loophole \u2014 it allows airstrikes to continue against Islamic State and Nusra Front forces \u2014 that they expect Russia to exploit to continue pounding areas they control with scores, often hundreds, of airstrikes per day.Both Russia and the United States consider the Islamic State and the Nusra Front to be terrorists. But the insurgent leaders say that Russia has made clear since it began its bombing campaign last fall that, like the Syrian government, it applies the \u201cterrorist\u201d label to virtually all the opposition to President Assad.\u201cRussia will continue bombing Nusra and Daesh,\u201d said Yusef Farrouh, a fighter whose group receives ammunition and salaries from the United States and its allies, using the Arabic name for the Islamic State. \u201cAnd we know what Russia means by \u2018Nusra\u2019 and \u2018Daesh\u2019 \u2014 us.\u201cIf we thought Russia was bombing Nusra clearly and specifically,\u201d he added, chuckling and throwing up his hands, \u201cwe would have moved away from them.\u201dMr. Farrouh said that rebel groups had rejected the proposed deal at a meeting he attended earlier this week in Ankara, the Turkish capital. The rough outlines of the cease-fire, he said, were laid out by Riad Hijab, the former Syrian prime minister who heads the opposition\u2019s High Negotiations Committee. In attendance were representatives of rebel groups that receive support under a covert program run by the C.I.A., along with European and Arab allies.With the proviso that the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria, can still be bombed, Russia puts the United States in a difficult position; the insurgent groups it supports cooperate in some places with the well-armed, well-financed Nusra in what they say is a tactical alliance of necessity against government forces. So Russia can argue that many of them are, in effect, Nusra affiliates.But insurgents say Russia has been also bombing groups that are nowhere near Nusra, including some that are fighting to hold back assaults by the Islamic State. Two weeks ago, Mr. Farrouh said, Russia unleashed fierce firepower on his hometown, Marea, which is held by his group, Safwa al-Islamiyya, and other Western-backed insurgents.The town is surrounded on three sides by Islamic State fighters whose advances the rebels have repeatedly fought off, including an attack in which ISIS used mustard gas, wounding civilians. \u201cWhy are you bombing us?\u201d asked Mr. Farrouh, who sold curtains before the war. \u201cWhere should I go? Leave Syria, and leave all of Syria to Nusra to Russia can bomb them?\u201dAhmad Farrouh, a young antigovernment activist from Marea who fled the bombing and is now stuck on the Syrian side of the border, laughed at the announcement of the deal. \u201cRussia will never have a cease-fire,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially after the fall of our countryside \u2014 they will not stop.\u201dIt remained unclear whether the Syrian government itself would welcome a cease-fire. On Thursday, hours before the Munich agreement was announced, Mr. Assad told Agence France-Presse that his government planned to retake the entire country in a war that could take \u201ca long time.\u201dEarlier this week, an adviser to Mr. Assad, Bouthaina Shaaban, told Reuters that anyone backing a cease-fire wanted to \u201cshore up\u201d terrorist groups and \u201cavoid the main thing that must be done, which is fighting terrorism.\u201dSamer, a resident of Houla, in the countryside north of Homs, who spoke on the condition that his full name not be used, said that insurgent groups there wanted a cease-fire, if it is was a real one. \u201cThe problem is the implementation,\u201d he said.\u201cHalting the military operation is good for us, but we never trust the regime, which might take the chance and might move its troops into another area and escalate,\u201d Samer said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a cease-fire where the regime can move the battle into other areas. This is rejected.\u201dJames Sadri, a leader of the Syria Campaign, an advocacy group pushing for a no-fly zone, said that if the \u201cagreement means the end of sieges in Syria,it will be welcome.\u201d But, he said, \u201cexcluding Russian aerial attacks from a cease-fire is absurd.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t expect celebration on the ground, because the lives of too many Syrian civilians have been ignored and too many people have been starved to death,\u201d Mr. Sadri said in a statement. \u201cRussia has become the No. 1 killer of civilians in Syria, killing more than the Assad regime, Al Qaeda and ISIS combined. If this proposed cease-fire doesn\u2019t stop Russian warplanes from bombing hospitals and schools, then the U.S. and others shouldn\u2019t pretend it\u2019s a cease-fire.\u201dReporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad from Beirut, Nick Cumming-Bruce from Geneva, Karam Shoumali from Kilis and Rick Gladstone from New York.videoAdvertisement"}

The dodge has become bipartisan, with President Obama\u2019s re-election helped by the Democrats\u2019 Priorities USA Action operation as a \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code.When he first ran, Mr. Obama promised to fight for reform of big-money politics, but he failed to follow through. Similar vows are being heard from the candidates for the Democratic nomination this year. Senator Bernie Sanders so far has been riding a wave of small donations, while Hillary Clinton, aided by \u201csuper PACs\u201d and small donors, is promising to rein in the special-interest money driving the current campaign. Republican candidates would rather talk about walling off Mexico and ending Obamacare, even as they profit from operations like Mr. Rove\u2019s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Official Calls for Malaysian Prime Minister to Step Down", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byBANGKOK \u2014 A prominent member of the governing coalition in Malaysia who has been removed from a top party job lashed back on Saturday with a strongly worded Facebook post saying he had seen \u201cproof\u201d that Prime Minister Najib Razak committed a crime in his dealings with the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.Muhyiddin Yassin, who was ousted as deputy prime minister last year and suspended on Friday as deputy president of the ruling party, called on Mr. Najib to step down over the \u201cdark episode\u201d of his financial dealings involving the 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund, or 1MDB, whose advisory board is headed by the prime minister.Mr. Najib has been embroiled in a scandal after the revelation last year that nearly $700 million landed in his personal bank account. He has said that the money was a donation from Saudi royalty and that he returned $620 million. The Saudi government has contradicted that account. It is unclear what happened to the remainder of the money. Mr. Najib has said he did nothing wrong.There are also allegations that at least some of the money the prime minister received was diverted from the 1MDB fund through other companies. One alleged transfer was about $13 million through SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1MDB now owned by the Finance Ministry, which Mr. Najib controls. Mr. Najib has not commented on that transaction.Mr. Muhyiddin said in his statement that the former attorney general had shown him evidence of criminal conduct in the transfer of money from SRC International.\u201cThe scandal surrounding Najib has tarnished the image of the party as well as the government and embarrassed the people \u2014 particularly as I had been briefed on the issue of funds from SRC International by the former attorney general, who also provided proof that it was indeed a criminal act,\u201d he said.The former attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, could not be reached for comment. The decision by the governing party, the United Malays National Organization, or UMNO, to suspend Mr. Muhyiddin as deputy president of the party, leaves Mr. Najib fully in control of the party.Mr. Najib is the president of UMNO, which has long dominated Malaysian politics, and Mr. Muhyiddin\u2019s removal means he has no strong rival in a key party position. The party\u2019s Supreme Council decided on Friday to suspend Mr. Muhyiddin effective immediately on the grounds that he had not performed his duty to help Mr. Najib bolster the party. Last year, Mr. Najib ousted Mr. Muhyiddin as deputy prime minister for questioning the bank deposits. The prime minister also removed Mr. Abdul Gani before he could complete an investigation into the transactions.Mohamed Apandi Ali, who took over as attorney general, announced in January that he had found no evidence of a crime and closed the investigation.Mr. Muhyiddin noted that he was the one being punished even though it was Mr. Najib who received the vast sums of money and who was \u201cat risk of criminal prosecution.\u201dMr. Najib\u2019s office countered with a harsh statement accusing Mr. Muhyiddin and Mr. Abdul Gani of acting inappropriately in discussing the purported evidence.\u201cThis is an admission that there was a high-level conspiracy to topple the Prime Minister, in what would have been a coup against democratic process,\u201d said Azalina Othman Said, a minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Department.She said that the sharing of evidence was \u201cnot only unethical but also a breach of the Official Secrets Act.\u201dMr. Najib, in addition to removing officials who were critical of him, has sought to control the growing scandal by putting a lid on investigations into his actions and clamping down on media outlets that looked into the case.Last week, the government blocked the news website Malaysian Insider after it published a report saying there was sufficient evidence for the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission to bring charges against Mr. Najib. The report was based on the comments of an unnamed official and was denied by other government officials.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Deal Makers Have Disappointed", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byBreakingviewsThe ghosts of past failures haunt China\u2019s new mergers and acquisitions players.Most of the country\u2019s big overseas takeovers to date have fared poorly. Large bets on oil, mining and finance were victims of terrible timing. Though more recent deals like the China National Chemical Corporation\u2019s $44 billion takeover of Syngenta look less cyclical, real challenges remain.To date, 13 of the 20 biggest completed deals by Chinese buyers outside the People\u2019s Republic and Hong Kong have been in natural resources, Thomson Reuters data shows. Nine involved the state oil majors: Sinopec, the China National Offshore Oil Company and China National Petroleum. Another four were by state-backed specialists in metals, oil field services, chemicals and investment.Big mistake. Oil prices have more than halved since those deals were struck. And there were operational headaches, too. Cnooc\u2019s $18 billion purchase of Nexen left the Chinese group grappling with spills, fleeing civil war in Yemen and struggling to extract crude oil from Canada\u2019s tricky oil sands. Nomura analysts say Cnooc could soon have to take an impairment charge of more than $5 billion on Nexen.The record is not much better outside commodities. The $5.5 billion that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China invested in South Africa\u2019s Standard Bank has more than halved in dollar terms. The China Investment Corporation invested in Morgan Stanley and Blackstone before the depths of the financial crisis. Shares in Portugal\u2019s utility EDP are worth a fifth less than the price at which China Three Gorges invested $3.5 billion in it. The WH Group, which is listed in Hong Kong, is down roughly a third since floating in 2014, suggesting that investors have lost their appetite for its $7 billion push into American pork.The list of value-destroying deals is worrying, given the rush to seek outward mergers and acquisitions, which hit a record $113 billion in 2015. Of course, Chinese buyers may have learned some lessons. There\u2019s also a huge difference between chasing energy security and a seasoned deal maker like ChemChina\u2019s chairman, Ren Jianxin, adding world-beating foreign companies to his stable.Still, like other cross-border buyers, Chinese companies can struggle to run new overseas outposts effectively, while also keeping staff and governments onside. A poll by the consulting firm BCG found that Chinese acquirers thought just 32 percent of their foreign deals were \u201ctrouble-free.\u201d Towering piles of debt \u2013 a staggering $43 billion is being raised in Syngenta\u2019s case \u2013 raise the stakes further. The only consolation is that China\u2019s outbound M.&A. record cannot get much worse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Art and 3-D Magic in a German Subway", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byD\u00dcSSELDORF, Germany \u2014 An escalator descends into a dense soundscape of birdsongs. Windows appear to open onto outer space. An overhead LED screen converts human movements into colorful geometric animations.Yes, they are aesthetic experiences. But they are also part of Germany\u2019s newest subway line, an effort to transform commuter drudgery into art appreciation. The two-mile line, known as the Wehrhahn, is to open here on Saturday, the result of a 15-year, $950 million collaboration among artists, architects, civil engineers and the city government.\u201cNormally with public art, you have a wall with some kind of painting,\u201d said Ulla Lux of the D\u00fcsseldorf culture office. \u201cAnd we thought, no, it can\u2019t be that. We have to take the next step.\u201dThe line replaces several aboveground tram lines in the city\u2019s transit network and creates a transportation hub. As a bonus for passengers, the city stipulated that the new line would be free of advertising.The Wehrhahn is not the first to integrate art into a large-scale infrastructure project. Its most obvious (if unlikely) progenitor is the Moscow metro, which opened in 1935. Created under Stalin, its grand arched hallways, cinematic lighting and exquisite mosaics also amounted to an immersive art experience \u2014 albeit to more propagandistic ends. In 1950, Stockholm debuted its own art-filled metro system, often referred to as the \u201cworld\u2019s longest art gallery.\u201dThe Wehrhahn\u2019s digital and interactive elements are reminiscent of more recent public-art projects, like Rafael Lozano-Hemmer\u2019s 2005 work \u201cUnder Scan\u201d in Trafalgar Square in London, which used a system of surveillance and projection devices to transmit video images onto the shadows of pedestrians.Rather than conceiving the subway as a chain of individual stations, Ms. Klussmann and Netzwerkarchitekten designed a \u201csubterranean continuum.\u201d The station walls are a matrix of geometrically complex concrete components that appear to be an extension of the tunnel itself.The Wehrhahn\u2019s six stations were planned as \u201cincisions\u201d in the continuum, with each reflecting the vision of an artist. Five artists were selected to design the stations, with Ms. Klussmann designing the sixth.At Pempelforter Strasse, Ms. Klussmann\u2019s work features white bands threading geometrically across the walls, ceilings and floors.\u201cI wanted to open the space up visually,\u201d said Ms. Klussmann, a Berlin-based artist who also teaches at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. \u201cThe bands float into the station, defined by the geometry, and break at the corners like a billiard ball would break.\u201dThomas Stricker, a Swiss sculptor and electrician by training, designed the Benrather Strasse stop to have the feel of a space station. The steel-clad walls are interspersed with large panoramic \u201cwindows\u201d \u2014 multimedia screens that show slow-moving 3-D animations of outer space.\u201cMaybe you know this feeling when you\u2019re on a train, and you look out the window and think you are moving, but really it\u2019s the train next to you,\u201d said Mr. Stricker, who sought to create a similar sensation at Benrather Strasse.At the Heinrich-Heine-Allee stop, Ralf Br\u00f6g transformed the three entrances into audiovisual performance spaces that will host sound-based works. The station currently features a piece by the German theater director Kevin Rittberger, which fittingly evokes the myth of Orpheus, who descended to the underworld to rescue his captive wife, Eurydice, with divine music. At another entrance, recordings of birds are manipulated with software so the sounds seem to dip and swirl around passengers as they ride the escalators.\u201cWhat I quite liked is that the audience is in motion,\u201d Mr. Br\u00f6g said. \u201cAnd you have this given speed of the escalator, which can work as a metronome. So you know in theory how much time the ear will need to get from here to there.\u201dMovement was also integral to the design of the Schadowstrasse station, where the sculptor and cyber artist Ursula Damm installed an LED screen that depicts the comings and goings of pedestrians on the street above, using a differentiation filter to generate colorful geometric renderings that then recur in the blue glass of the station walls.\u201cIt stands for the people,\u201d said Ms. Damm, who has created similar interactive and generative artworks since the 1990s. \u201cYou can see how they are behaving in relation to the architecture, which spaces they prefer to inhabit. At the same time, they can see what the software is doing with their information. Nothing is hidden.\u201dAll the stations were designed to allow in as much natural light as possible. In most of them, the upper and lower levels are separated by cut glass panels, creating broad sightlines and a sense of spaciousness.The design incorporates systems like fire-resistant glass and barriers that deploy to protect passengers from smoke. Even the tunnel itself is illuminated so riders are never looking into darkness.\u201cWe wanted to design it so that there is good orientation and you feel secure,\u201d said Markus Schwieger of Netzwerkarchitekten. \u201cYou can see people coming in front of you very early.\u201dSuch a holistic approach required continuous coordination among the architects, artists, city planners and engineers, unusual in the realm of large public infrastructure projects.\u201cNormally the technicians first come in and produce the station, and then the artist is asked to do some work when the station is already done,\u201d Mr. Witan said. \u201cThe novelty of our system here is that we involved the artists from the very beginning.\u201dThe entire project cost 843.6 million euros, about $940 million, financed by the city of D\u00fcsseldorf, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the federal government.Hans-Georg Lohe, D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s head of cultural affairs, who was instrumental in pushing forward the project, said that a traditional metro line on a similar scale would have been only slightly cheaper.\u201cIt was about 3 million more euros on expenses for the art,\u201d Mr. Lohe said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a bit more money, but it has a completely different look and feel.\u201dMr. Lohe said the new line was about more than just convenience and improved mass transit. \u201cIt will be,\u201d he said, \u201ca living art experience for everyone who uses the metro.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Drawing Southeast Asia Closer With California Summit", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported bySince the Obama administration began its \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d in 2011, the United States has been in direct competition with China for economic power in Southeast Asia, and the political influence and security arrangements that frequently go with it.\u201cThere may be a better term for it than \u2018cold war,\u2019 but there\u2019s a lot of economic competition,\u201d said Stuart Dean, a retired executive with General Electric who spent 24 years working in Southeast Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s a commercial Olympics, as it were.\u201dGeographically astride the world\u2019s busiest and most strategic shipping lanes, the region is the fulcrum of the administration\u2019s rebalancing toward Asia.American officials briefing reporters in Washington on Wednesday did not get into specifics, saying the meeting would not be tightly scripted.\u201cIt is not a laboriously negotiated, strict, by-the-Roman-numerals agenda,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cIt is an open discussion among the leaders.\u201dWhile officials said the gathering was not an \u201canti-China\u201d meeting, Washington is clearly trying to exert its leadership in Southeast Asia through investment, analysts said.\u201cChina\u2019s actions in the South China Sea have undermined its narrative of a peaceful rising and fostered new suspicions about its economic and geopolitical intentions in the region,\u201d said Kevin G. Nealer, a China expert and a partner with the Scowcroft Group, based in Washington. \u201cAmerica\u2019s most difficult relationships in the region are healthier and more high-functioning than China\u2019s best relations, and the deep and consistent American investment there has created habits of cooperation and shared goals with Asean that trade alone doesn\u2019t yield.\u201dChina has been Asean\u2019s largest trading partner since 2009, with two-way trade surpassing $366 billion in 2014, according to Asean trade data. The United States was fourth last year behind the European Union and Japan. Southeast Asia was also America\u2019s fourth-largest export market that year.However, America\u2019s strategy has focused on direct investment, where it is far ahead of China. American companies poured $32.3 billion into Southeast Asia from 2012 to 2014, according to Asean data, compared with $21.3 billion from China.From 2000 to 2014, the United States invested $226 billion in Southeast Asia, according to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, more than American investment in China, Japan and India combined.The United States aims to maintain its dominance in investment while taking the lead in trade, according to analysts, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the chief weapon in that quest. Four of Asean\u2019s 10 member states have already joined the pact, while three others \u2014 Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand \u2014 have either declared their intention to join or said they were considering doing so.Alexander C. Feldman, president and chief executive officer of the U.S.-Asean Business Council, said the summit meeting was the culmination of American economic strategy in the region dating back to Mr. Obama\u2019s first weeks in office.\u201cI think the strategy by the Obama administration has been a long-term one which reflects a whole vision of Asia and realizes that Asean is a critical piece of the puzzle often not focused on by past administrations,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cSince Day 1 they have focused on this region and understood that it was really the battleground for the future of Asia.\u201dThe region\u2019s trade with China has been robust. Southeast Asia has been a huge source of raw materials and commodities to feed both China\u2019s economic engine and its growing consumer class, supplying products like minerals and palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia and electronics components from Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u201cChina is also a big aid donor, particularly for infrastructure projects, an area in which U.S. companies have had trouble competing because Southeast Asian governments produce so few bankable projects that U.S. banks are willing to finance,\u201d he said.The region\u2019s leading economies, including Indonesia, will feel the pain, according to economists. \u201cThe sensitivity of Indonesia to China\u2019s economy is very large, and that\u2019s also the case for Asean,\u201d said Destry Damayanti, an economist and commissioner at the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation who is based in Jakarta.It remains to be seen whether the United States can profit from China\u2019s downturn to increase its trade with the region.But the American edge in direct investment may be the greater long-term benefit, said Mr. Dean, the retired General Electric executive.\u201cOur business progress and biggest deals have been driven by investing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ensures a long-term presence, builds long-term relationships and makes us a local company in each country where we invest.\u201cTrading is short term and can go away faster than investment, and China will always have a competitive advantage due to its proximity.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Donald Trump, Crony Capitalist", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorFour years ago, in the first draft of my book \u201cA Capitalism for the People,\u201d I had a section dedicated to how worrisome a Donald J. Trump presidential bid would be for America. I was not prescient. It\u2019s just that having grown up in Italy, I knew how a real estate tycoon \u2014 in this case, Silvio Berlusconi \u2014 whose career exemplified crony capitalism could become the leader of supposed pro-market forces, and I knew what it meant for the country.I cut this section after being told that my point was irrelevant: In America, there was no chance that a character like Mr. Trump would ever be seriously considered as a candidate.Then 2016 happened: After sweeping wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina, Mr. Trump has shattered that notion. The Trump phenomenon caught everybody by surprise. Yet it is a manifestation of a fundamental contradiction long present in the Republican Party: Despite fierce anti-big-business sentiment among many Republican voters, no Republican candidate has emerged to champion them.This contradiction created the space for Mr. Trump. In spite of being every bit a part of that pro-business establishment, Mr. Trump can pretend to be anti-establishment by sometimes reviling big business, because he doesn\u2019t need its funding for his campaign.Among self-identified Republicans in a 2010 Booth-Kellogg survey, 43 percent agreed that \u201cbig business distorts the functioning of markets to its own advantage,\u201d and only 22 percent disagreed. But the Republican establishment has happily become big business\u2019s mouthpiece. This fracture became evident during the congressional debate on the Troubled Asset Relief Program: Many Republicans in the House voted against it, even though it came from George W. Bush, a Republican.Why have so few serious anti-establishment candidates emerged in the Republican presidential primaries? A grass-roots campaign for a House or Senate seat is within financial reach for some people, but not a presidential run. Without the support of big business, a Republican candidate would be unable to raise that kind of money.But Mr. Trump does not need rich donors. To his supporters, he appears to be a free-market evangelist. According to the latest Booth-Kellogg survey, 38 percent of American voters think that Mr. Trump has the most pro-market platform of any candidate (a lead of 13 points over the next candidate). If a cursory glance at his very vague platform \u2014 heavy import tax on China, a wall against immigration, etc. \u2014 is not sufficient to see how misplaced this trust is, look at Mr. Trump\u2019s career.As a businessman Mr. Trump has a longstanding habit of using his money and power aggressively to obtain special deals from the government. For example, his Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan was built with the benefit of a decades-long tax abatement obtained through government connections.In 1985, Mr. Trump circumvented New York State campaign-finance laws by making a $30,000 donation, through several Trump companies, to Andrew Stein, the Manhattan borough president who was running for president of the City Council. Mr. Stein was also a member of the New York City Board of Estimate, the body then responsible for land-use decisions in New York.Finally, Mr. Trump has a long history of promoting eminent-domain abuses to expropriate private land he wanted.He is, in short, the essence of that commingling of big business and government that goes under the name of crony capitalism.We cannot blame voters for being confused about pro-business versus pro-market politicians. The Republican establishment deserves most of the responsibility. Being pro-market means being in favor of competition and against excessive concentration, as Theodore Roosevelt was. Business executives are pro-market when they want to enter a new sector.But when they become established in a sector, they favor entry restrictions, excessive licensing, distortive regulation and corporate subsidies. Those policies are pro-business (in the sense that they favor existing businesses), but they are harmful and distort a competitive market economy.With the pretense of defending free markets, the Republican Party consistently supported big business. When did any Republican presidential candidate \u2014 other than Mr. Trump \u2014 speak in favor of some antitrust enforcement? When did he campaign for tougher enforcement against white-collar crime? When did anyone call for free trade in pharmaceuticals? Or for more competitive pricing of drugs bought by Medicare?The forced identification between the interest of markets and that of business practiced by the Republican establishment in the last 30 years made it easier for Republican voters to fall for Mr. Trump, a businessman who pretends to uphold free-market principles.It is an indication of a country\u2019s institutional corruption when inside a main party the only alternative to the prevailing crony capitalism is a tycoon with a long history of shady deals.Luigi Zingales is a professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Conservative Case for Campaign-Finance Reform", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorALL Americans should be alarmed about the effects of money in politics. But it is conservatives who should be leading the fight for campaign-finance reform. Unfortunately, none of the Republican candidates for president have taken on this issue.Why should conservative voters care? First, big money in politics encourages big government. Campaign contributions drive spending on earmarks and other wasteful programs \u2014 bridges to nowhere, contracts for equipment the military does not need, solar energy companies that go bankrupt on the government\u2019s dime and for-profit educational institutions that don\u2019t educate. When politicians are dependent on campaign money from contractors and lobbyists, they\u2019re incapable of holding spending programs to account.Campaign contributions also breed more regulation. Companies in heavily regulated industries such as banking, health care and energy are among the largest contributors. Such companies donate with the hope of winning narrowly tailored exceptions to regulations that help them and disadvantage their competitors. Politicians sometimes say they want to roll back regulations wholesale, but they rarely follow through because they know that less regulation will remove the incentive for future contributions. Some would call it extortion, but that is how the regulatory game is often played.Social conservatives and faith-based voters should care about big money in politics because it drowns out their voices on issues from abortion and euthanasia to gambling and pornography. Churches and other charitable groups are prohibited from contributing to campaigns or even endorsing candidates. Politicians pay them lip service, but their influence pales in comparison to large for-profit enterprises. Values don\u2019t pay for campaigns; health insurance companies, entertainment businesses, the gambling industry and its online counterparts do.It is, of course, illegal for foreigners and foreign companies to contribute to American political campaigns. Those restrictions, however, are as easy to evade as underage drinking laws on college campuses. There is a big money party going on in Washington and telling well-heeled foreigners that they can\u2019t attend simply won\u2019t work. They may act more discreetly than their American counterparts, but they will be there, and that so little of what goes on at the party is disclosed makes foreign participation that much easier.More important, the system is a betrayal of the vision of participatory democracy embraced by the founders of our country. They rebelled against oligarchy and corruption in England. They tossed the British tea into Boston Harbor in 1773 and demanded taxation only with representation. We should do the same.Taxation in the United States should be conditioned on every individual taxpayer\u2019s being allowed to designate the first $200 of his or her taxes to support a political candidate. Such a \u201ctax rebate for democracy\u201d would bring billions of small donations to political candidates, who would no longer depend on a tiny sliver of the population for the money they need to get elected. Government contractors and other beneficiaries of wasteful spending would have less influence, and ordinary voters would have a fighting chance to make sure the rest of their tax dollars were spent conservatively and responsibly.This and other reforms, including greater transparency about who is paying for election ads, and a less activist Supreme Court that would allow Congress and state legislatures to address campaign finance, would go a long way toward restoring the republican form of government that our founders embedded in the Constitution.Richard W. Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, is the author of \u201cTaxation Only With Representation: The Conservative Conscience and Campaign Finance Reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Ress said that the collapse in the price of oil had taken \u201ca huge amount of cash\u201d out of the art market.\u201cThere aren\u2019t so many Russians and Brazilians involved now, and the Chinese slowdown has had a knock-on effect on the raw materials and equity markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe potential buyers in the art world won\u2019t be feeling as rich as they did last year.\u201dChristie\u2019s results reveal key shifts in the market in 2015. Bolstered by huge prices in New York for trophy works by artists like Picasso and Modigliani, auction sales of Impressionist and modern art were up 57 percent from 2014 to \u00a31.3 billion (about $1.85 billion), while auction sales of postwar and contemporary art \u2014 the main driver of growth from 2009 to 2014 \u2014 were down 14 percent to \u00a31.5 billion ($2.1 billion). Year-over-year sales of old master paintings, 19th-century and Russian art shrank 37 percent to \u00a3154.9 million (roughly $220.6 million).Owners, wary of a downturn, have become more reluctant to sell high-value works. Sotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s February auctions in London of Impressionist and modern, as well as contemporary, art are smaller and carry lower estimates than their equivalent events last year.The evening\u2019s star lot is \u201cT\u00eate de Femme,\u201d a 1935 Picasso study of his lover and muse Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. It has a low estimate of \u00a316 million (about $22.8 million). Its current owner bought it at Sotheby\u2019s in New York in November 2013 for $39.9 million.On Feb. 11, at Christie\u2019s evening contemporary sale, the auction house and a third-party financier are banking that the market for the Scottish painter Peter Doig is bubble-proof. Mr. Doig\u2019s 1991 canvas \u201cThe Architect\u2019s Home in the Ravine\u201d is guaranteed to sell against a low estimate of \u00a310 million (about $14.2 million), \u00a32.3 million more than it brought at auction in London three years ago.Overall expectations have also contracted at Christie\u2019s. The 62 lots of its evening contemporary sale have a total minimum valuation of \u00a350.4 million ($71.7 million), almost half the low estimate the company placed on its equivalent 64-lot auction in 2015, which took in \u00a3117.1 million (about $166.7 million).With investment-conscious buyers nervous about spending significant sums on works by artists without established reputations, the new category of \u201c20th-century art,\u201d to which the Picasso and the Doig both belong, now dominates the market.Mr. Kr\u00e4ussl doesn\u2019t think so, at least at the very top of the market.\u201cArt is now a must-have for the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery collection has to have a Picasso, a Richter, a Warhol.\u201dBut he and many other people are less sure about the thousands of lesser-known artists.\u201cI think collectors will be focusing more financial attention on an older generation of artists rather than emerging contemporary,\u201d said Heather Flow, an art adviser in New York. \u201cI think most collectors, rightly so, have been confused about the price fluctuations of younger artists.\u201dBuyers will be hoping that Savelli will be this year\u2019s Paolo Scheggi, whose auction prices shot up from $353,617 in October 2013 to $1.8 million in May 2015. Savelli\u2019s current auction high is $91,764, set in 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Sends Sweeping Trade Enforcement Bill to Obama", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate gave overwhelming final approval Thursday to the most comprehensive overhaul of customs law in decades, giving presidents new tools to combat unfair trade, yet falling short of bipartisan demands for penalties against other nations that manipulate their currencies.Senators voted 75 to 20 for the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, a blend of bills the House and Senate passed separately nearly a year ago. The bipartisan compromise was reached by negotiators in December, with White House support, and was quickly approved by the House. Senate action stalled partly because of an unrelated dispute over taxing Internet sales.The White House, in a statement, hailed the bill\u2019s passage as \u201can important milestone in our overall trade agenda,\u201d and said President Obama would sign it into law \u201cto help strengthen enforcement of the rules and level the playing field for American workers and businesses.\u201dSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that is responsible for trade issues, called the package \u201ca major step forward in advancing a robust agenda for international trade that better reflects the realities of the 21st-century global economy.\u201dThe trade enforcement package took shape last year as a way to persuade trade skeptics in Congress to support a separate measure renewing presidents\u2019 bolstered authority to make trade deals. The idea was to assure legislators that the federal government would have enhanced powers to act against trade violations once Mr. Obama completed negotiations on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership accord.Congress did narrowly approve so-called trade-promotion authority for Mr. Obama and his successor, but the enforcement package is not expected to similarly improve Mr. Obama\u2019s low odds of winning congressional approval this year of the Pacific agreement, which was concluded in October.In the main, the trade measure defines a new process for the Customs and Border Protection service to act quickly against foreign businesses that evade anti-dumping laws and American duties on imports, or that traffic in counterfeit goods. It also addresses a loophole that allows some imports made with forced or child labor to get through customs, and includes new protections for businesses\u2019 intellectual property rights.Among the strongest supporters were the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation; both served notice to lawmakers that this would be among the \u201ckey votes\u201d when they assess whom to support at election time.But labor unions, led by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., were adamantly opposed. Labor had supported last year\u2019s Senate version of the trade bill, which mandated import duties against countries found to manipulate their currencies to make their exports cheaper to American consumers.That penalty was dropped, however, from the final bill, and House Republicans won other concessions that infuriated unions. The new language, proposed by Mr. Hatch and two Democrats \u2013 Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware \u2013 calls for the president to seek \u201cenhanced bilateral engagement\u201d with suspected manipulators, and to keep violators out of trade pacts with the United States.Critics dismissed the language as toothless. China and Japan are considered the worst offenders at manipulating currency.Most of the 20 senators who opposed the trade bill were Democrats, though more than half of Democrats \u2013 led by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee \u2013 strongly backed the final compromise.Unions, joined by senators from both parties, also objected to a provision unrelated to trade. It would prohibit state and local governments from taxing Internet access. That, the critics said, would close off a revenue source to those governments as they seek funds for public services.But Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and others got a promise from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to allow a vote this year on a bill allowing states to tax sales of retailers that sell only online. Supporters say online sellers have a competitive advantage over \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d stores that must collect sales taxes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chris Christie and Jeb Bush Team Up on a Mutual Target: Marco Rubio", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byMr. Christie, whose White House hopes hinge on a strong showing in New Hampshire, is unleashing the kind of cutting and personal attacks that brought him renown in New Jersey but that pose a far greater risk in a presidential campaign, where they can harm the assailant as much as the intended target.Over the past 48 hours, Mr. Christie has mocked Mr. Rubio as a cosseted \u201cboy in the bubble,\u201d derided him as \u201cconstantly scripted,\u201d likened him to \u201cthe king of England,\u201d and, perhaps most creatively, compared his Senate career to that of a helpless fourth grader who is told which chair to sit in at school.\u201cI can\u2019t find one,\u201d Mr. Christie added.Mr. Rubio\u2019s strong third-place performance in Iowa on Monday night, and his steady improvement in the polls days before the voting there, alarmed Mr. Christie and his mainstream Republican rivals, including Mr. Bush, who fear Mr. Rubio\u2019s emerging as a breakout figure in New Hampshire.The shared concern has even prompted the opening of a back channel: Members of the Bush and Christie campaigns have communicated about their mutual desire to halt Mr. Rubio\u2019s rise in the polls, according to Republican operatives familiar with the conversations.While emails, texts and phone calls between operatives in rival campaigns are not uncommon in the tight-knit world of political strategists, the contact among senior aides in the two campaigns has drifted toward musings about what can be done to stop or at least slow Mr. Rubio, the operatives said.In a sign of a budding alliance, the aides have, for example, exchanged news articles that raise potential areas of vulnerability for Mr. Rubio. There is no formal coordination, the operatives stressed, but rather a recognition of a shared agenda. \u201cWe do have similar goals,\u201d an adviser to Mr. Christie said.For their part, Mr. Christie and Mr. Bush are praising each other in public and cozying up to each other in private: Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Christie on Monday to wish him good luck in the caucuses. (Mr. Christie was not available, and the call went to voice mail.)During a CNN interview Wednesday, Mr. Bush put their bond on display for all to see. \u201cI love Chris Christie,\u201d said Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida. \u201cHe is a \u2014 he\u2019s a great campaigner, he\u2019s a good friend and he\u2019s been an effective governor.\u201d\u201cJeb can\u2019t do that sort of stuff,\u201d said an adviser to Mr. Christie, referring to the New Jersey governor\u2019s slashing \u201cboy in the bubble\u201d attack on Mr. Rubio and his comfort with political street fighting. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the weapon.\u201dAfter the Iowa caucuses, the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates.And it would make it harder for Mr. Bush and Mr. Christie to justify remaining in the race.As the primary nears, Mr. Christie is expressing disapproval for Mr. Rubio in increasingly elaborate and colorful ways.At Londonderry High School, he found a fourth grader named Matthew in the audience and posed a series of questions about his daily routine.Did he have a set time when he had to be at school? Yes, the boy said.An assigned desk to sit in? The boy nodded.A list of questions to answer each day \u2014 and a summer break? Matthew answered affirmatively.Mr. Christie pounced: \u201cThey do that in the United States Senate, too!\u201d The audience roared.The Senate, he said, was a foolhardy place from which to pick a president. \u201cWhat we are all wondering is: How does that train you to be president?\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s not the way the presidency works, and it is certainly not the way the governorship works.\u201dSpeaking to reporters in Manchester on Thursday, Mr. Rubio said that the joint attacks from his rivals were \u201csilly.\u201d\u201cLook, when people are having a tough time in a campaign, especially near the end, you see some desperation set in and so they\u2019ll start saying things. But I\u2019m not too worried about that.\u201dJoe Pounder, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, also dismissed the criticism, pointing to a record that he suggested was outside the Republican mainstream.\u201cNo amount of hot air or made-up facts can distract from Chris Christie\u2019s liberal record,\u201d he said.For Mr. Christie, there is a personal dimension to the onslaught against Mr. Rubio.Beyond that, Mr. Christie evidently feels a sense of betrayal over the inroads that Mr. Rubio has made with major Republican donors, particularly the New York-area financiers whom Mr. Christie spent years courting.\u201cSo he got a couple of donors,\u201d Mr. Christie sniffed, adding, \u201cGood for him.\u201dThomas Kaplan and Steve Eder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

To make his point, Mr. Sanders referred to the director Adam McKay\u2019s acceptance speech at the Academy Awards on Sunday after he won for the best adapted screenplay for \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d a movie about the failure of the banking industry.\u201cAs Adam McKay pointed out at the Oscars last night, if we want to have a government that is not controlled by billionaires, then we should not be voting for candidates who received substantial sums of money from the wealthy, from Wall Street, from the pharmaceutical industry and the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

He tried to get some attention to attract a candidate to actually run against the president when he was running for re-election,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told a gymnasium full of voters near the campus of a historically black college here.\u201cHe does not support the way I do building on the progress the president has made, and that includes building on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said of her opponent, receiving a loud ovation when she mentioned Mr. Obama\u2019s signature domestic accomplishment. It is African-Americans, she added to more applause, who \u201chave made the most advances and gains\u201d thanks to the health law.The electorate in the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27 is expected to be at least half black, a constituency that reveres Mr. Obama and was crucial in his defeat of Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 Democratic contest here. Mrs. Clinton still enjoys a substantial advantage over Mr. Sanders among African-Americans in polls, but her campaign is plainly concerned about his making inroads with such voters. Her campaign has conducted focus groups of African-American voters, an aide said, which revealed that many of them associate attacks on the health law as no different from attacks on Mr. Obama himself.Mr. Sanders voted for the legislation, but has called for going further and enacting universal, government-run health care for all Americans.\u201cClearly, after Iowa and New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign is getting very nervous and is becoming increasingly negative and desperate,\u201d said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders. \u201cThe simple truth is that there are very few in Congress who have a stronger civil rights record than Senator Sanders.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strategy appears to be to wage a multipronged set of attacks on Mr. Sanders as the battle moves to South Carolina and the rest of the South.Provoking old memories of politicians bearing false hope, she suggested that Mr. Sanders was setting voters up for a letdown with his ambitious proposals. \u201cI want you to understand: I will not promise you something that I cannot deliver,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not make promises I know I cannot keep. We don\u2019t need any more of that.\u201dA generation gap is emerging over the importance of electing a woman to the White House. We invite you to share your opinion. The Times may follow up with you.More broadly, Mrs. Clinton is effectively seeking to turn Mr. Sanders\u2019s grounding in class-based politics into a liability, suggesting that he is insufficiently focused on the immediate problems of black voters whose quality of life will not be lifted by curbing Wall Street excesses or reforming the campaign finance system.\u201cI\u2019m not a single-issue candidate, and this is not a single-issue country,\u201d she said to applause. \u201cIf we enacted our toughest plans to rein in Wall Street and shadow banking and all the other abuses we are concerned about, I\u2019d worry we\u2019d still have lead in the water in Flint and we\u2019d still have deteriorating schools here in South Carolina.\u201dMrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks came in a poor, rural region of South Carolina that drew national attention when a 2005 documentary called \u201cCorridor of Shame\u201d was filmed here about its dilapidated schools.Mrs. Clinton noted to the audience that she has a history here: She visited the county Denmark is in when she worked for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund in the early 1970s and came to the South to investigate the treatment of juvenile offenders who were imprisoned with adult criminals.Despite the fact that Mrs. Clinton has led in most South Carolina polls, Priorities USA is leaving nothing to chance there.

{"Headline": "Oscar\u2019s Heart May Be in Hollywood, but His Accent Is British", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byMr. Rand, a cultural observer for The New Yorker, had arrived just as 10 actors from Britain, including Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Peter O\u2019Toole, were poised to take half the Oscar acting nominations in 1965; and 10 Brits, including Laurence Olivier and Julie Christie, did the same in 1966.In terms of Academy Awards recognition, that actually marked something of a limit for foreign actors, who were soon bested by Americans like Jack Nicholson, Robert Redford and Al Pacino.But the pendulum has swung back, toward those swingin\u2019, cross-cultural \u201960s.In a little-noticed twist in this year\u2019s Oscar race, and allowing some wiggle room for Alicia Vikander, who is Swedish but lives in London, fully half of the acting nominees come from Commonwealth countries. It is only the second time in 50 years \u2014 the same happened in 2002, when Russell Crowe, Jim Broadbent and Nicole Kidman were in the lineup \u2014 that the Commonwealth contingent has been such a powerful awards force.Ms. Vikander and Eddie Redmayne, who last year was named an officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, are both nominated for their performances in \u201cThe Danish Girl.\u201d This year\u2019s acting field also includes Christian Bale (\u201cThe Big Short\u201d), Tom Hardy (\u201cThe Revenant\u201d), Mark Rylance (\u201cBridge of Spies\u201d), Charlotte Rampling (\u201c45 Years\u201d) and Kate Winslet (\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d), all of whom are British.Michael Fassbender, a best-actor nominee for \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d was born to parents from Germany and Northern Ireland, and lives in London. Cate Blanchett, nominated for \u201cCarol,\u201d is Australian. Rachel McAdams, nominated for \u201cSpotlight,\u201d is Canadian.If you consider every Oscar category, Britain has the most nominees of any country outside the United States \u2014 36 this year \u2014 say the organizers of a British celebration coming up later this month. Mr. Redmayne, the winner of the best-actor award last year for \u201cThe Theory of Everything,\u201d will be the cohost with Chris O\u2019Connor, Britain\u2019s consul general for Los Angeles. Mr. Redmayne said in a statement that the trove of honors \u201cdemonstrates the strength of the British creative industries.\u201dTo some extent, this new invasion by Brits and their allies has been a stealth affair, complicated by performances that tangle nationalities beyond easy recognition. Mr. Bale, Ms. Blanchett, Mr. Fassbender and Ms. McAdams play Americans. Ms. Vikander and Mr. Redmayne are supposed to be Danes. Mr. Rylance passes for a Soviet spy. Ms. Winslet plays Joanna Hoffman, who was born in the Soviet Union to a mother from Armenia and a father from Poland.Richard Hicks, the New York-based president of the Casting Society of America and a member of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, said \u201ca lot of actors from overseas are scoring in America\u201d because of training. The British, he said, tend to cut their teeth on the stage, which \u201cprovides tremendous technical skill.\u201d American actors often come up through vanilla television shows.\u201cHollywood is also focused on a world audience in a way that it wasn\u2019t just a few years ago,\u201d added Mr. Hicks, whose credits include \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d which received five Oscar nominations in 2013, winning one. \u201cI\u2019d also add technology as a reason. Casting people have been able to cast a much wider net, if you will, as video has advanced.\u201dActors from Commonwealth countries \u2014 most of which were part of the former British Empire \u2014 hit a modern Oscar low point in 1986, when not one figured among the nominees.That 1980s-era turn toward homegrown talent may have involved economics. When the home-video market started to boom in the United States, the easy money came from films that spoke to Americans. No surprise, then, that Michael Douglas, from New Jersey, was the best-actor winner for \u201cWall Street,\u201d in 1988, while Cher, a Southern Californian from the get-go, was best actress, for \u201cMoonstruck.\u201d (The years cited for films are those of the awards ceremonies, not the years when the films were released.)By the 1990s, however, the initial wave of domestic video growth was over, and Hollywood started looking more closely at foreign markets. Not by coincidence, Commonwealth actors again came into their own, as in 1994, when Emma Thompson, who is British, was nominated twice, for roles in \u201cRemains of the Day\u201d and \u201cIn the Name of the Father.\u201d Jeremy Irons (1991, \u201cReversal of Fortune\u2019\u2019) and Anthony Hopkins (1992, \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u2019\u2019) won back-to-back best-actor Oscars, which Mr. Hopkins followed with best-actor nominations in 1994 and 1996 and a supporting actor nod in 1998. Mr. Crowe, an Australian, snagged three straight best-actor nominations beginning in 2000, winning in 2001 for \u201cGladiator.\u2019\u2019In 2002, Oscar-nominated Britons populated films like \u201cSexy Beast,\u201d \u201cGosford Park\u201d and \u201cIris.\u201d The British boom had grown obvious by 2011, as Harvey Weinstein, whose company has shopped abroad for Oscar prospects and financing, turned \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d into a best-picture winner, and Colin Firth, as George VI, into the year\u2019s best actor.If the Commonwealth group is not yet large enough to dominate Oscar voting, its choices are almost certainly contributing to an alignment between the Oscars and the Bafta awards, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. This year, 15 of 20 Bafta acting nominations matched the Oscars. (Some exceptions: Among actresses, Maggie Smith was a Bafta nominee, for \u201cThe Lady in the Van,\u201d but she was bumped from the Oscars by Jennifer Lawrence, for \u201cJoy.\u201d Benicio Del Toro, with a British nomination for \u201cSicario,\u201d and Idris Elba, with another for \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d were edged from the Oscars by Mr. Hardy and Sylvester Stallone, singled out for his \u201cCreed\u201d performance.)If the Oscar-Commonwealth confluence continues to grow, the Academy Awards, as in the 1960s, may become a tougher climb for Americans, and, as an adjunct, for African-American-themed films like \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which was slighted on both sides of the Atlantic this year (except for an Oscar screenwriting nomination) .And the Oscars, as in Mr. Rand\u2019s day, will be as American as shepherd\u2019s pie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delivery Start-Ups Face Road Bumps in Quest to Capture Untapped Market", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byDoorDash, one of a multitude of start-ups with a mobile app that lets people order and get food sent to their doorsteps, relies on contract drivers like Brian Navarro to make the deliveries. The problem is that workers like Mr. Navarro don\u2019t always stick around.\u201cDrivers do jump around,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe general consensus is that drivers really only stick around for three to six months.\u201dThat churn has become expensive for DoorDash. A large number of drivers left the start-up less than a year after they joined, according to two people who have seen the company\u2019s driver data. DoorDash spends upward of $200 in recruitment and referral bonuses for some drivers, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Other delivery companies, like Postmates and Instacart, face similar retention challenges, these people said.The issue is just one headache now troubling delivery start-ups, which have been among the hottest sectors of start-up activity in recent years. Based on a belief that the companies would succeed once they grew to enormous scale, investors poured more than $730 million into delivery firms like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, up more than 1,100 percent from the same period a year and a half ago, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm.But entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to find that the economics of making a delivery service work are far from easy.The problems are rooted in the high operating costs of the start-ups, which typically act as middlemen between consumers and restaurants or grocery stores. The companies not only have to pay for large fleets of drivers, they also have big groups of employees who receive customer orders from the apps and who then manually make calls to the restaurants to order food. At the same time, to attract customers, many of the start-ups offer introductory prices and discounts, often making delivery free for first-time users.As DoorDash\u2019s experience with drivers shows, the start-ups\u2019 costs don\u2019t necessarily decline over time. For some drivers, who are paid a fee per delivery, it can be difficult to make enough deliveries in an hour to make it financially worthwhile for them. And when drivers move on, the companies must spend again to recruit replacements.\u201cEnsuring drivers have the best possible experience on the DoorDash platform is one of our top priorities,\u201d Eitan Bencuya, a DoorDash spokesman, said in a statement. He said the company has proprietary technology that helps drivers increase the amount of deliveries they can make in a single trip, increasing their commissions per hour.\u201cPrivate companies doing last-mile delivery rely on charging high consumer fees, which make the services untenably expensive for the average consumer,\u201d Dean Prissman, an Internet analyst for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note to clients in October.Some investors said the start-ups have the potential to capture a relatively untapped multibillion-dollar market, one that is also being eyed by tech behemoths like Google, Amazon and Uber. The companies see opportunity in bringing delivery to millions of retailers and restaurants that do not now offer it, all for a slice of the fees.Alfred Lin, a partner at the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in DoorDash and Instacart, said the start-ups are also amassing a very valuable asset: consumers\u2019 purchasing data. \u201cThe advent of the smartphone gives a company the ability to track all the information about your purchasing habits, and where you are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dramatic what a company can do to utilize that information.\u201dMr. Lin compared DoorDash\u2019s trajectory to those of Netflix, Amazon and Zappos, which all required huge early spending toward a bet on future growth. He added that DoorDash is seeing a lot of growth now.\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of a premium service,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike the early days of Uber, when they only had black cars.\u201dMr. Lehmann said he imagines a future in which Postmates cuts deals with 60 to 70 percent of the restaurants in its app. As Postmates grows more popular, drivers will be able to make more deliveries to more people in shorter amounts of time, eventually earning them \u2014 and the company \u2014 more money.\u201cWe can and will be profitable as a company in 2017,\u201d he said.Mr. Lehmann added that its drivers do jump to adjacent services from time to time but frequently return to working for Postmates.DoorDash is trying to keep a lid on costs another way: By paying its drivers less per delivery. According to an email from the company to drivers that was reviewed by The New York Times, DoorDash said that starting on Monday, it would change the pay per delivery in Los Angeles to $5, down from $6, excluding tips.\u201cWe know this is an important change, so we want to be transparent about why we are making this adjustment,\u201d DoorDash said in the email. The company said drivers would make up what they lose in fee cuts through an increased order volume.Mr. Navarro, the driver in Los Angeles, said he could make only about two deliveries an hour, though that has increased at peak mealtimes. While he is unhappy with the fee change, he said he plans to keep working for DoorDash and Postmates for now because it beats the alternative.\u201cI\u2019d rather do this than be driving for Lyft or Uber,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Mix of Russian Sports, Politics and Business, a Bobsled Leader in Exile", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 In December, Grigorii Bedzhamov, the president of Russia\u2019s national bobsled federation, disappeared. He stopped coming to work, stopped answering his cellphone, stopped answering his emails.A week into the silence, the Russian news media began to report that Mr. Bedzhamov had fled the country amid an emerging bank scandal. The Russian edition of Forbes magazine placed him in Monaco and reported that he was preparing to apply for political asylum in another European country. Soon after, the bobsled federation released a statement saying that Mr. Bedzhamov was on a \u201cplanned vacation.\u201dBut almost three months later, Mr. Bedzhamov is still on that vacation, and the federation, which is struggling to pay its bills and its coaches, says it has still not heard from him.\u201cNo idea,\u201d Kirill Serikov, the federation\u2019s acting director, said when asked about his colleague\u2019s whereabouts.Mr. Bedzhamov appears to be in Monaco. A waiter at a Monte Carlo wine bar, the Wine Palace, owned by Mr. Bedzhamov, said that Mr. Bedzhamov had visited the establishment this week. Efforts to reach him directly were unsuccessful.This peculiar state of affairs \u2014 which federation officials privately say means Mr. Bedzhamov is abdicating his post as president \u2014 is obviously a problem for Russian bobsledding. But the idea that Mr. Bedzhamov would be incommunicado in Monte Carlo \u2014 where he has a 217-foot yacht that is often moored in the city\u2019s harbor \u2014 is also indicative of broader issues concerning Russian sports.Widely credited with building Russia\u2019s bobsled program into an international contender after the team had been in decline for years, Mr. Bedzhamov is a prime example of how well-connected businessmen have been used to finance national teams under Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin. But Mr. Bedzhamov\u2019s disappearance shows the risks of this system, and it has refocused attention on the entanglement of sports with corruption and cronyism among Russia\u2019s elite.Auditors reviewing Vneshprombank\u2019s liquidity found a $2.4 billion hole in its finances, the largest ever uncovered for a Russian bank. Investigators have accused Ms. Markus and others connected to the bank of embezzling about $13 million from clients\u2019 accounts and investing some of that money abroad. She has denied the charges.Hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to those institutions, including \u2014 according to the business outlet RBK \u2014 a large part of Russia\u2019s training budget for this summer\u2019s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, could disappear with the bank.Mr. Bedzhamov owns between 1 percent and 3 percent of Vneshprombank. Although he has not been formally accused of wrongdoing, his colleagues at the federation assume his flight was prompted by fear that he might be implicated.All of this has complicated life for the bobsled federation, which has been prevented from paying its foreign trainers, including its Canadian chief coach, Pierre Lueders. The federation also had an account in Vneshprombank.Russia\u2019s bobsled team was already enduring a rough patch, struggling to regenerate after the retirement of most of the athletes who had helped it win two gold medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. At the world championships last weekend in Austria, the Russian team managed only a silver in the mixed team event. Mr. Bedzhamov\u2019s absence has put added pressure on the program, although federation officials emphasized that the team was still racing.\u201cOf course it has an effect,\u201d said Dmitrii Trunenkov, a member of the Russian crew that won a gold medal in the four-man event at the Sochi Games. \u201cHe\u2019s the president, after all.\u201dThe frequency of such scandals may be attributable to the peculiar closeness of sports to politics and business in Russia, where many federations are sponsored by large state companies and led by powerful businessmen.Mr. Bedzhamov was typical. He had interests in several companies, including one of Russia\u2019s largest shipping lines, and he and his sister shared a powerful connection in Nikolai Tokarev. Mr. Tokarev is a longtime friend of Mr. Putin, who served with him as a K.G.B. agent in the former East Germany. Transneft, the huge state oil firm led by Mr. Tokarev, was one of Vneshprombank\u2019s core clients and was also a sponsor of the bobsled federation.Such networks reflect how sports have become a patronage-infested domain in the Putin era, with major companies expected to support Russian teams, and businesses seeing sports as an arena in which they can earn official favor and build ties.Sports have become loaded with prestige as the Kremlin has come to identify them as ways to showcase Russian power. Vast sums have been directed to overhauling the country\u2019s sports infrastructure, and that movement has created lucrative opportunities for Mr. Putin\u2019s allies. Ahead of the Sochi Olympics, companies owned by friends of Mr. Putin\u2019s received huge construction contracts.At the same time, it is understood that supporting sports will attract favorable notice from the government.\u201cSport is just a means,\u201d said Leonid Martynyuk, an activist who investigated corruption related to the Sochi Games. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of getting access to the authorities\u2019 ear.\u201dThis system has lifted the fortunes of Russia\u2019s national teams, but it has sometimes backfired when darker sides of Russian business intrude, as in Mr. Bedzhamov\u2019s case.Natalya Gart, Mr. Bedzhamov\u2019s counterpart with Russia\u2019s luge federation, acknowledged that involvement in sports could grant access to powerful circles, but she said that it rarely brought financial returns. She complained that her company, GRM Group, which sponsors her federation and was hired to help build the Olympic bobsled track, did not have any state contracts.\u201cI\u2019m waiting probably for when the state will one day notice what GRM Group is doing for Russia and give us some project to build,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s a hint of some kind to the state.\u201dMs. Gart, who described Mr. Bedzhamov as a friend, said she felt that the authorities ought to take into account his contribution to rejuvenating Russian bobsledding.\u201cIt seems to me that our authorities even ought to somehow help him with this difficult situation,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this really frightens me. I help luge racing, and I try and try, and then later, suddenly \u2014 bang, something unpleasant happens to me. And what? I will have to leave the country, and nobody will help me? One good turn deserves another.\u201dShe added, \u201cYou have to help your own.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article carried an erroneous credit.

{"Headline": "Russia Sues Ukraine in London Court Over Unpaid Debt Claim", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia filed a lawsuit against Ukraine in the London High Court on Wednesday over $3 billion in unpaid loans, escalating a legal battle that is adding to the geopolitical tensions between the two countries.The dispute is the latest between Ukraine and Russia to spill off the battlefield and into European courts. While a shaky cease-fire has reduced violence in eastern Ukraine, a year-old peace accord still faces major obstacles.The new Ukrainian cabinet has insisted that Moscow agree to the same 20 percent write-down and delay in repayment that was accepted by commercial creditors in a restructuring deal last year. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has rejected the deal as unfair.Russia\u2019s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, told reporters in Moscow that his ministry had sued after \u201crepeated unsuccessful attempts to encourage Ukraine\u201d to settle in negotiations.Ukraine was not \u201cnegotiating in a spirit of good will,\u201d Mr. Siluanov said in announcing the lawsuit.Despite blaming the West for geopolitical woes, many Russian companies and even government ministries prefer to settle commercial disputes in European courts, which are perceived to be more evenhanded than those in former Soviet countries.The Russian energy giant Gazprom is seeking $29.2 billion from Ukraine in a Stockholm arbitration court for what it says are various breaches of the terms of a natural gas contract.Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, announced in Parliament on Tuesday that Kiev, in turn, was seeking $22.5 billion from Gazprom in countersuits. Neither side is likely to collect in full.The murky structuring of the loan is proving contentious in the latest run-in between Ukraine and Russia. Moscow provided the funds to Ukraine in December 2013 in an unsuccessful attempt to prop up the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted two months later. Russia had, for unclear reasons, structured the loan as a Eurobond, a financial instrument typically used in commercial transactions rather than in loans between two countries.The new Ukrainian government, deeply at odds with Russia, has insisted that the loan now be treated as a commercial transaction, making it subject to the restructuring deal.Russia argues that the bonds should not be subject to the terms of the commercial debt restructuring, a position backed by the International Monetary Fund.Advertisement"}

Mr. Sanders, addressing a stadium full of supporters after the meeting, said Flint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s water problem was just one of several examples of the country\u2019s dangerous, declining infrastructure.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just come from a meeting, which was one of the more difficult meetings that I have ever attended in a long political life where I have seen a lot and I have heard a lot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said to the crowd at the university. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just met with seven or eight residents of Flint, Mich.

{"Headline": "With Shares Plunging, Deutsche Bank Sets Out to Prove It Can Be Fixed", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byAfter John Cryan took the helm of Deutsche Bank in July, he set out to quickly clean up the mess left by his predecessors. The bank has taken earnings-crushing charges, slashed costs and pulled out of countries that it has been in for decades.Mr. Cryan, a cerebral British banker, is even getting down into the minutia. He is personally helping to decide which complex derivatives trades to close as he tries to free up scarce financial resources for better investments.But in recent weeks, the markets have wondered whether Deutsche waited too long to mend itself.Shares in the bank, Germany\u2019s largest, have plunged nearly 40 percent so far this year. The market now effectively values Deutsche at a third of its liquidation value, an astonishing discount that suggests investors do not believe that Mr. Cryan will be able to squeeze solid earnings out of the bank\u2019s businesses. Investors in credit markets have even begun to bet that some of Deutsche Bank\u2019s bonds will not be repaid in full.The disfavor in the markets may pass, especially if central banks around the world signal that they are willing to do more to support economic growth and the global financial system. Mr. Cryan and his new management team may also soon be able to show that they are making progress with their turnaround plan, perhaps by settling some of the many lawsuits that Deutsche Bank faces.Deutsche Bank is also not as fragile as the banks that crashed or required bailouts in 2008 \u2014 a message Mr. Cryan was eager to get out this week. \u201cClients may ask you about how the marketwide volatility is impacting Deutsche Bank,\u201d Mr. Cryan said on Tuesday in a memo to employees. \u201cYou can tell them that Deutsche Bank remains absolutely rock-solid, given our strong capital and risk position.\u201dStill, Deutsche Bank is trying to fix itself at what looks like an increasingly inauspicious time.Doubts are swirling over many of Europe\u2019s large banks, which took longer than their United States peers to bolster their balance sheets after the financial crisis. European banks with large trading operations, like Credit Suisse and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, have also come into investors\u2019 cross hairs this week. The sharp declines in the shares of European banks are an indication that the region is still grappling with the threat that large banks can pose to the wider economy when they run into trouble.Regarded in Germany as a national asset and a symbol of economic might, Deutsche Bank sits at the center of the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d debate. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, even spoke out in support of the bank, saying on Tuesday, \u201cNo, I have no concerns about Deutsche Bank.\u201dWhen he became co-chief executive, Mr. Cryan seemed well qualified for the tasks ahead. (Mr. Cryan will drop the \u201cco-\u201d from his title in May when the other co-chief, J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, is set to retire.) He had, after all, been involved in a far-reaching overhaul at UBS, a Swiss bank that got into deep trouble during the financial crisis. Mr. Cryan even seemed to relish the challenge.\u201cSometimes I go home in the evening and I say to my wife, \u2018I wish some people would actually think I had some talent for running a company and not just cleaning it up,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Cryan said, at a news conference in Frankfurt last month. \u201cIt should be fun running a company like this.\u201dBut Mr. Cryan finds himself battling on three fronts. The bank has to simultaneously shore up its balance sheet, produce dependable profits and satisfy the demands of frustrated regulators, particularly those in the United States.Deutsche Bank has less capital, the financial foundation of a bank, than many of its peers, which can mean investors view it more warily when markets tumble. Deutsche Bank\u2019s leverage ratio, a regulatory metric that measures capital as a percentage of assets, was 3.5 percent at the end of 2015, well below the 6.5 percent that JPMorgan Chase reports.Deutsche Bank can raise its capital levels by off-loading subpar loans and trades or selling new shares. But both remedies are hard to pull off when there is bone-shaking turbulence in global markets.\u201cDeutsche is fixable,\u201d said James Chappell, a senior financials analyst at Berenberg in London. \u201cConsidering the current state of credit markets, it\u2019s much harder to achieve \u2014 and that\u2019s the key question really.\u201dBut even with higher capital, Deutsche Bank has to show where its profits are going to come from in the future.Some of the European banks that have slashed the size of their trading operations have been able to fall back on other businesses that have performed relatively well. Credit Suisse and UBS, for instance, have large wealth management divisions that can produce stable profits. Analysts say that Deutsche Bank lacks a large alternative source of profit that could take up much of the slack if Mr. Cryan took an ax to the trading operations, which accounted for nearly a third of the bank\u2019s revenue last year.While Deutsche Bank has 1,800 branches in Germany, the retail network has never been very profitable and lost 675 million euros in the last quarter of 2015. In Germany, private banks have trouble competing profitably with savings banks, which are typically controlled by local governments content with meager earnings.Much of Deutsche Bank\u2019s fate depends on how it fares in the United States, where regulators have long been dissatisfied with the bank\u2019s operations.One United States Deutsche unit, a trust bank, last year failed a regulatory stress test carried out by the Federal Reserve. The failure was expected, and another overseas bank also fell short.An even bigger test looms. In 2018, all of Deutsche Bank\u2019s United States operations, including its big investment bank, are to start undergoing regular Fed stress tests.The bank is now preparing to put its American operations into one holding company that will be subjected to the test. Deutsche Bank has been hiring heavily to get ready for the stress tests, said Renee Calabro, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman.Then there are Deutsche Bank\u2019s legal costs, which have concerned investors for many months and have served to remind the public of the bank\u2019s missteps.In some litigation, Deutsche Bank is accused of acts that took place several years ago, including selling shoddy mortgages before the financial crisis. But other investigations are focused on more recent activities, including one that looks at stock trades that took place in Moscow and London.Deutsche Bank has settled a handful of lawsuits, like one in the United States last year that accused the bank of violating sanctions, and it has set aside over $6 billion for future legal payouts. In his memo on Tuesday, Mr. Cryan sought to underscore his role in clearing the litigation cloud hovering over Deutsche Bank.\u201cI am personally investing time to resolve successfully and speedily open regulatory and legal cases,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want to remove the uncertainty among staff and in the market that these cases cause. A small group of senior people, led by me, will focus on this.\u201dJack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nate Cohn and Justin Wolfers on Donald Trump\u2019s Chances", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byThe 2016 RaceJustin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economist, and The Upshot\u2019s Nate Cohn debated the likelihood that Donald Trump would become the Republican nominee. We thought you might enjoy the conversation.The point is, March 15 is only two weeks away, but there\u2019s a lot more news events in this two weeks than in the previous two months.That said, a Rubio comeback is about more than just moving polls. Rubio might need a two-way race to beat Trump, or a lot of resources for attack advertisements. By those measures, two weeks is a long time. It\u2019s hard to fund-raise during an intense stretch of campaigning, and it\u2019s not much time for Kasich or Cruz to decide to leave the race, either.The point is, this race is unlike any that we\u2019ve ever seen. And this brings with it greater uncertainty. When we don\u2019t have good historical precedent, then we should shade our intuitions toward admitting that anything could happen. Statisticians call this shrinkage. And so whatever you think will happen, you should shrink your estimate of the probability of Trump, Rubio, Cruz or Kasich winning toward an uninformed prior, and in this case, that would be that each has a one-in-four chance. (No one is so uninformed as to think Carson has a chance.)Another interesting question is whether there could still be a successful effort to deny him a majority of delegates, even if he swept the races on March 15. It\u2019s far too early to tell whether this could work, but it\u2019s at least imaginable.By the way, this is why I\u2019m not yet willing to completely count Mitt Romney out. Nate, is the idea of Romney somehow being drafted at the convention totally nuts?So, I agree that 81 percent for Trump is probably too high \u2014 although I wouldn\u2019t say someone was wrong if they decided to put the odds around there. What kind of odds would you give Trump at this point?I think people have been too quick to dismiss this possibility. After a long string of false predictions that some incident or another would doom Trump\u2019s campaign, my sense is that pundits have gotten gun-shy in suggesting that anything could hurt him. Perhaps they\u2019re right. But perhaps he\u2019s not really the Teflon man. And so there\u2019s still a chance he simply implodes under the weight of his own offensiveness.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Caution Rebuffed, Unicorns and Other Start-Ups Fixate on Rainbows", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byBut in Silicon Valley, ask any start-up entrepreneur about the shifting economic environment and the answer often goes like this:\u201cI haven\u2019t changed anything since this all started,\u201d said Manav Mital, the chief executive of Instart Logic, which speeds the delivery of computing services to customers.\u201cThe pullback hasn\u2019t affected our hiring plans at all,\u201d said David Vivero, the chief executive of Amino, a free service that matches patients with doctors for appointments. He added that he was looking to increase his work force by about a third.Nor has the downturn changed life at Gusto, a payroll management start-up. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the shift,\u201d said Joshua Reeves, a founder of the company. \u201cEven in downturns, some businesses succeed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always the other guy who will suffer,\u201d said Venky Ganesan, a managing director at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has invested in the ride-hailing company Uber and the food-delivery start-up Munchery. \u201cI\u2019m no psychologist, but all the people we\u2019ve backed have never been average. They never think the things that happen to average people will happen to them.\u201dEntrepreneurs\u2019 confidence levels remain buoyant even though investors are telling them that the change from go-go-go times to merely go-go will have consequences.The message from Rory O\u2019Driscoll, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, that entrepreneurs should be more careful is often ignored.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a company where the pullback in funding hasn\u2019t been discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a person has had a conversation about this 10 times and it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet\u2026 \u201dMr. O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s voice trailed off. \u201cI\u2019m tired and grumpy because I\u2019ve had three of these conversations today and in every one you have the same discussion,\u201d he said.For now, start-up entrepreneurs are operating much as they did during the recent boom times. Data from Jobvite, a recruiting service used by start-ups, show no drop in hiring activity or salaries in the San Francisco Bay Area. Well-appointed offices that look like photo shoots for Design Within Reach and perks like free Uber rides and in-house meals remain common at the companies.\u201cThe narrative of start-up comeuppance is in the air, but we haven\u2019t seen a statistically significant change in food budgets,\u201d said Arram Sabeti, the chief executive of ZeroCater, which serves meals to tech companies.In fact, the food from tech companies that goes uneaten is piling up. \u201cTwo years ago, we picked up 15 tons of food a week and now we\u2019re picking up 17 tons a week,\u201d said Mary Risley, whose group Food Runners in San Francisco distributes leftover office food to the city\u2019s homeless residents. She attributes the increase largely to start-ups.\u201cI\u2019ve been reading a lot about a slowdown and asking myself about what it means, but we just closed a substantial round of funding,\u201d said Mr. Mital, characterizing his recent financing as \u201cone of the easiest fund-raisings we\u2019ve had.\u201dThe air of detachment pervades the talk. Shan Sinha, the chief executive of the video conferencing start-up Highfive, said his customers were discussing ways to save money over the coming months. But he said he and his founder friends wonder \u201cwhether what\u2019s happening in the world will have an effect on us.\u201dOther entrepreneurs emphasize that any downturn will be good for them. Less venture capital money should lead to fewer competitors; a less crowded market may also make it easier to recruit talented people. Mr. Reeves, of Gusto, said that if his customers found themselves in financial straits, that would create another great selling point for his company, which can help businesses save money.\u201cIt\u2019s awesome to see this conversation come up,\u201d Mr. Reeves said. \u201cMost have only known the froth of the cycle. Now it\u2019s time to create companies to solve real problems.\u201d\u201cWhen I bring up issues that could impact the value of their stock, employees want to talk about them,\u201d said Mary Russell, a lawyer based in Palo Alto who counsels individuals about their equity compensation. \u201cLast year there was less concern.\u201dThe message of more caution is not lost on all start-ups. Some are cutting back on expenses, albeit just a little. Jeff Selzer, the manager of Palo Alto Bicycles, a specialty bike store, said he was seeing fewer start-ups build custom $10,000 bicycles as signing bonuses for new managers.Others are going further. Origami Logic, a marketing analytics start-up, held its annual off-site meeting for salespeople last month at a rustic coastal lodge near Santa Cruz, Calif. The company said that other start-ups typically hold such events at luxury hotels in San Francisco or Las Vegas, which can cost twice as much.And Ben Katz, the founder of the mobile banking app Card.com, said he had found ways to save more than 30 percent a month on his company\u2019s computing services bills by using less server space. He is looking to sublet a 100-square-foot space in his office to save $12,000 a year.\u201cIn the past, we wouldn\u2019t have justified taking the time to do little things like that, but now we take time to find ways to grow sustainably,\u201d he said.Still, confidence reigns.\u201cWe can make a compelling case that our software will help save money during a downturn,\u201d said Greg Waldorf, the chief executive of Invoice2go, a start-up based in Silicon Valley and Australia that makes an invoicing app. Another plus, he said, was that his own company did not burn through cash at a fast rate.\u201cFor us, it\u2019s business as usual thanks to how I\u2019ve been leading the company,\u201d Mr. Waldorf said.Advertisement"}

But what stands out is the Bush team\u2019s taste for the Vegas Strip, where aides and allies patronized the Bellagio, the Wynn and the Venetian, owned by Sheldon Adelson, the Republican megadonor.A well-funded candidate tends to attract hordes of consultants, and Mr. Bush had plenty.

{"Headline": "Consensus on Need to Revise Tax Code, but Partisan Split on Specifics", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by2016 TaxesWashington is gripped by partisan divisions, but there is overwhelming agreement on at least one important issue: The United States is long overdue for the sort of sweeping, once-in-a-generation tax overhaul that last occurred in 1986.There is also broad, bipartisan consensus that it\u2019s unlikely to happen in 2016 \u2014 largely because of the near paralysis in policy making that typically accompanies a presidential campaign season.But after the enactment in December of a big, complicated tax law that gave permanence to a litany of previously temporary tax breaks for individuals and businesses, many of the smaller, recurring disagreements that bedevil policy makers have been swept aside, and the stage seems set for a big overhaul, whenever the time is ripe.Much, of course, will hinge on the outcome of the presidential race, but even this year, some important policy changes may emerge, particularly in the area of international business taxes. There is rising consternation among Democrats and Republicans alike over corporate inversions, in which some major companies have managed to shift their tax headquarters outside the United States and reduce their tax liabilities. And there is also general agreement that the United States is losing the global competition to create a business-friendly tax environment.Another important factor pushing tax policy to the top of the agenda was the ascendance of Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, to speaker of the House in October. Before then, Mr. Ryan had been chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, which he had long called his dream job, and he has also been the author of his party\u2019s boldest tax overhaul proposals.Mr. Ryan has often said that individuals and corporations should pay no higher than 25 percent, compared with the current 39.6 percent top bracket for individuals and 35 percent top rate for corporations.With deductions, credits and loopholes, few corporations or sophisticated taxpayers actually pay that high a percentage, but all the major Republican presidential candidates share Mr. Ryan\u2019s view that taxes must be cut. Mr. Ryan\u2019s past budget proposals have called for eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest as well as eliminating the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.In general, Mr. Ryan has attacked the tax code as too complicated and he has called for ending or sharply reducing an array of popular tax breaks, like the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health plans, and the mortgage interest deduction. In their place, Mr. Ryan has called for across-the-board rate reductions, and potentially the imposition of a consumption tax.Many Democrats fiercely disagree with any plan that would reduce taxes for the wealthiest, but even Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in recent weeks has taken aim at the tax code as being unduly complex and filled with inefficient exceptions, exclusions and other loopholes.\u201cThere is no question, everyone recognizes this tax code has outlived its usefulness and now is a drag on our economy,\u201d said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, who took over as chairman of Ways and Means in November.President Obama has weighed in with his own jabs at the tax system, often denouncing the ability of wealthy individuals to pay less than most Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts,\u201d Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address.In a visit to Detroit last month, Mr. Obama also chided Republicans. \u201cThey\u2019ve somehow still convinced themselves that cutting taxes for folks at the very top is to help you succeed. I think there\u2019s a better plan.\u201d Despite the persistent disagreements and continuing vitriol, Democrats and Republicans found common ground in adopting December\u2019s big year-end tax law.That law gave greater certainty to breaks for businesses for research and development and for capital expenditures, deductions for individuals of state and local sales taxes, and a small but symbolic tax credit for teachers who spend their own money on supplies.The bill also made permanent (a status that, of course, could be changed by a future Congress) several provisions important to lower-income families: the earned-income tax credit; the child tax credit; and the American Opportunity tax credit, which provides up to $2,500 for higher-education expenses.Republicans and Democrats alike said the clarity afforded by the new legislation would help set the parameters of the sweeping changes that many expect will seek to \u201cbroaden the base and lower the rates\u201d: That is to say, it will end many tax exemptions and exclusions and use the increased revenue to lower what are known as marginal tax brackets. (Those define what you will pay for all net taxable income beyond certain thresholds.)In the process, policy makers hope to give the United States a cleaner, easier-to-understand tax code. Yet some of the current exemptions are hugely popular, like the deduction for home mortgage interest or for state and local taxes. Everyone wants a simple tax code, but few people want to eliminate provisions that benefit them. That helps explain why it is so difficult to make big changes.Mr. Ryan, in his first major policy speech after becoming speaker, talked about rewriting the tax code, which has been a personal passion throughout his years in office. \u201cYou know what the first item on that agenda is? It\u2019s creating jobs and raising wages,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in the speech at the Library of Congress in December. \u201cWe know what\u2019s standing in our way. Instead of a tax code that all of us can live by, we have a tax code that none of us can understand.\u201dAfter noting that Canada has lower business tax rates, Mr. Ryan continued: \u201cThe only way to fix our tax code is to simplify, simplify, simplify. Close all those loopholes and use that money to cut tax rates for everybody. Take the seven tax rates we have now and collapse them into two or three.\u201dThe speaker is not the only one railing against the tax code. Consider the man Mr. Ryan challenged on the ballot in 2012: Vice President Biden.\u201cGuys, when Reagan was president there was $600 billion in tax expenditures,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a speech last month to House Democrats, referring to the same provisions that Mr. Ryan called \u201cloopholes.\u201d Whatever you call them, many are hugely popular and various interest groups will invariably fight to preserve them. For that reason, big tax overhaul plans often call for a phase-in process so that any shift is not excessively abrupt.\u201cThere are now $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cFind me a responsible economist that can justify more than $500 billion to $600 billion of those tax expenditures having any socially redeeming value whatsoever.\u201dMr. Biden then decided to take aim at just one tax break, known as \u201cstepped-up basis,\u201d in which the capital gains liability is reduced on inherited assets. As Mr. Biden explained, stepped-up basis reduces capital gains taxes on inherited assets when they are sold. So if a stock was purchased at $10 a share, and later bequeathed at $50 a share, the $40 a share in gain is effectively tax-free. Capital gains tax would be due only on any amount greater than $50.Mr. Biden said stepped-up basis costs $14 billion a year \u201cto benefit two-tenths of 1 percent of the population that is already very wealthy, does not need it, does not indicate they will invest it in any way that will improve the economy differently.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd for that we can send every kid to community college for free and cut the deficit at the same time\u201d by an additional $8 billion.Despite some points of agreement, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Biden do not agree on the best ways to revise the tax code, and much will depend on who wins the presidency.The major Republican contenders also disagree on many of the ways they would change the code, with some favoring fewer brackets and lower rates, and others favoring the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax.Donald J. Trump\u2019s plan would reduce revenues by $9.5 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank, while Senator Ted Cruz of Texas would cut $8.6 trillion and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida would trim $6.8 trillion. In each case, the cuts would largely benefit the wealthy, and would sharply raise the deficit unless they spurred remarkable economic growth. Critics say the proposals are not realistic.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton has proposed a 4 percent surcharge on the wealthiest Americans, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has called for tax increases on virtually everyone, but particularly on the wealthiest.While the larger debate may have to wait until after the November election, many lawmakers see an urgent need to enact policies that will end new incentives for companies to relocate jobs or offices overseas, or even to reincorporate entirely through tax inversions in which an American company is acquired by a foreign company, and the headquarters is shifted to a lower-tax jurisdiction overseas.Many policy makers are also deeply concerned about the estimated $2 trillion in corporate earnings that American companies have stockpiled offshore and refuse to repatriate because they would then owe taxes on that money.There are acute worries on Capitol Hill and throughout Washington that American companies will end up paying far more taxes to foreign countries \u2014 especially in Europe \u2014 as a result of an effort by the world\u2019s major developed economies to streamline tax policies and prevent increasingly mobile companies from exploiting differences in the laws.In a report last year, a bipartisan working group of the Senate Finance Committee warned that inaction could be costly for the United States and for American companies.\u201cIf policy makers fail to implement new rules in a timely fashion to combat overseas action,\u201d the group wrote, \u201cunilateral actions around the globe will undoubtedly result in far more taxes paid into foreign coffers by U.S. multinational companies, with a corresponding revenue and job loss here in the United States.\u201dMr. Ryan and Mr. Brady are hoping to take action on that front this year. Still, it could be difficult to reach a consensus.\u201cEssentially people are using the need to do international tax as a reason not to act on inversions,\u201d Mr. Levin said in an interview. \u201cWe should put a stop to the takeovers.\u201dHe said he believed Republicans were more interested in allowing American companies to repatriate profits now held overseas by offering some sort of tax holiday.\u201cThey are talking about ways to repatriate,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cThere\u2019s serious disagreement under what circumstances and also what the rate would be. We went through it once before. It was a fiasco. They said the money would be used for job creation, and none of it was.\u201dIn short, something needs to be done. but there is no agreement on exactly what. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who spent a decade as the top Republican on the Finance Committee, put it this way: \u201cYou are not going to get Congress to move unless there is more of a consensus on it.\u201d A new president may have to lead the way, he said.Of course, Mr. Grassley said, there will always be opponents to reform. \u201cAccountants don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to become productive members of our society.\u201d In the meantime, there is plenty of work for accountants and lawyers.Welcome to tax season.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Talk Grows About Who Will Succeed Palestinians\u2019 Fading Mahmoud Abbas", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported byMr. Fayyad, who never joined Fatah, is also respected by Israel and by the West, but has been cast out by Mr. Abbas as a perceived threat to his rule. Names of other potential successors also circulate, including Jibril Rajoub, a former Palestinian security boss who is said to have support from Qatar, and in January called on Mr. Abbas to name a deputy.Mr. Dahlan\u2019s name always surfaces. Now in lavish exile in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Dahlan, 54, was expelled by Mr. Abbas from Fatah in 2011 after Mr. Dahlan accused him, bizarrely, of helping to murder Mr. Arafat. Mr. Dahlan has a reputation for corruption but is well funded, reportedly with backing from Egypt and the Emirates, speaks Hebrew and English, and is believed to pump money into Palestinian refugee camps and Fatah\u2019s militant wing, the Tanzim, which has sometimes clashed with the security forces.The other inescapable figure is Marwan Barghouti, 56, sometimes called the Palestinian Mandela for his long period in an Israeli prison and his efforts to bring Hamas and Fatah together. Mr. Barghouti is the only Fatah leader who outpolls the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniya, when Palestinians are surveyed about an Abbas successor.But Mr. Barghouti is serving five consecutive life terms for murder, so he may be less candidate than kingmaker, operating from behind bars through his influential wife, Fadwa, and a network of supporters.Mr. Abbas might go sooner rather than later, said a former Palestinian negotiator who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to be frank. Facing this new wave of violence, Mr. Abbas is typically paralyzed, said this former negotiator. \u201cHe can neither support it nor oppose it,\u201d he explained, \u201cso he shuts up and does nothing, which further enhances the perception that drives all this, that he and Fatah have produced nothing and will produce nothing, and that they are useless.\u201dRamiz Hassouna, 45, a Fatah supporter, said: \u201cNow Fatah has no strategy or plan for the Palestinian people, and Fatah members have lost their dedication to the land and to the Palestinian cause. They\u2019re more interested in their bank accounts \u2014 money for them, and for Abu Mazen and his family.\u201dWhile most believe Mr. Abbas intends to die in office, his isolation is increasing. \u201cAbu Mazen is like a tree in the wind, with leaves blowing off everywhere,\u201d said a former aide. \u201cHe thinks everyone is listening to him, but no one is listening anymore.\u201dPalestinian institutions and finances have deteriorated, with a 2015 budget deficit estimated around $700 million. Fatah and Hamas remain as divided as ever, with Fatah running the West Bank under an Israeli umbrella and Gaza securely in the hands of Hamas. Mr. Abbas and his allies have grown old in office without bringing in younger Palestinians.The political weakness of Mr. Abbas became painfully clear in September, when he called a meeting of the Palestinian National Council after removing another former ally and now critic, Yasser Abed Rabbo, whom he accused of conspiring with Mr. Dahlan and Mr. Fayyad.Mr. Abbas had called the session, the first since 1996, to \u201crealign\u201d the P.L.O.\u2019s Executive Committee and banish Mr. Abed Rabbo. But it never materialized. Mr. Abbas also said he would make an important declaration about Palestinian tactics and hinted he would dismantle the Palestinian Authority. But he did neither. At the time, Tawfiq Tirawi, a member of Fatah\u2019s Central Committee, said there was an internal struggle over nominations. But in another sign of the sensitivity about succession, Mr. Tirawi, along with other key Fatah members like Qadura Fares, refused interview requests.\u201cWe worry that the Palestinian Authority is getting weaker,\u201d said Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s minister of public security and strategic affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to decide who will be the leader because if you say who you prefer, you damage him in the eyes of those there.\u201dRami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He was 93.His death was confirmed by the office of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Ban later made a brief appearance before reporters at the United Nations, calling Mr. Boutros-Ghali \u201ca memorable leader who rendered invaluable services to world peace and international order.\u201dA generation before violent protests boiled over in Cairo in 2011, Mr. Boutros-Ghali was a keystone of Egypt\u2019s old-guard diplomacy, a senior minister to President Hosni Mubarak and to his slain predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat. He seemed to meet the tests of character and experience when, in 1992, he became the sixth secretary general of the United Nations, the first African and the first Arab to hold the post. The scion of a politically active Coptic Christian family, he accompanied Mr. Sadat on his historic olive-branch mission to Jerusalem in 1977, then played a pivotal role in the Camp David accords. He was at the White House when Mr. Sadat, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Jimmy Carter signed the 1979 treaty ending a 31-year state of war between Egypt and Israel, a breakthrough in the history of the Middle East conflict.There were doubts among diplomats about Mr. Boutros-Ghali. Was he, at 69, too old for a five-year term? Could an Egyptian Arab who had favored a Palestinian state be evenhanded in the Middle East? He went out of his way to reassure Israel, and Arab and African endorsements helped overcome the first President George Bush\u2019s misgivings.Strong-willed and independent, Mr. Boutros-Ghali took the helm determined to subdue aggression and pursue peace after the fall of Soviet Communism and a relaxation of East-West tensions that had long hamstrung the United Nations. He also resolved to attack the organization\u2019s bloated bureaucracy and chronic money problems.But he faced daunting tasks. Civil wars in Somalia and the secessionist states of Yugoslavia had already begun. Murderous conflicts between Hutus and Tutsis were hurtling toward genocide in Rwanda. And 60,000 United Nations peacekeepers were already thinly posted in a dozen trouble spots, including Cambodia, El Salvador, Angola and Mozambique.Mr. Boutros-Ghali\u2019s relations with the incoming Clinton administration were soured almost from the start in 1993 by foreign policy differences, political infighting and frictions between him and Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Madeleine K. Albright, who was Washington\u2019s representative at the United Nations before succeeding Mr. Christopher at the State Department.Even more than money, the United Nations needed American support for peacekeeping operations. But Mr. Boutros-Ghali said he had often been rebuffed when he tried to see the president and other officials to discuss what he called an \u201cutterly confused\u201d American foreign policy.Mr. Clinton had taken office trumpeting enthusiasm for multinational humanitarian and peacekeeping operations. But a disaster in Somalia shocked the administration into a policy reversal, and it shied away from future interventions, especially in Africa.American troops had entered Somalia in 1992 as part of a United Nations mission to feed starving victims of internal chaos. But when 18 Army Rangers were slain by warlord forces in 1993, and America saw searing images of a dead helicopter pilot dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, the United States withdrew its forces and retreated from risky United Nations missions, humanitarian or military.Thus America, like most other member states, tragically refrained from assisting a small, overwhelmed force of United Nations peacekeepers when Rwanda descended into genocidal slaughter and rape in 1994. Estimates varied widely, but the Rwandan government said 1.17 million people had been killed in 100 days. Mr. Clinton apologized years later for America\u2019s inaction.Mr. Boutros-Ghali\u2019s frustration over the Clinton administration\u2019s pattern of voting for tough Security Council resolutions, and then refusing to support the actions on the ground, had its paradigm in the civil war that raged from 1992 to 1995 in the former Yugoslavia, a conflict precipitated by the secession of Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia and fueled by a tinderbox of ethnic, religious and regional differences.Massacres, rapes, displacement of populations and other atrocities ensued, many in \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d campaigns against Muslims. The Security Council deplored the violence, but its peacekeepers in Bosnia \u2014 Mr. Boutros-Ghali wanted 35,000, but got 8,000 \u2014 were wholly inadequate to subdue the fighting.Aside from some airstrikes against Serbs, which the peacekeepers opposed even after Serb forces slaughtered unarmed Muslims at Srebrenica and other cities, the United States also did not substantively intervene militarily, although the Bosnian conflict was eventually mediated by the Clinton administration.While he had said early on that he would not seek a second term as secretary general, Mr. Boutros-Ghali ran again. Late in 1996, the Security Council voted overwhelmingly to give him another term. But Ms. Albright, in her last days as the American delegate, cast a decisive veto as one of the five permanent Council members. Mr. Boutros-Ghali thus became the only secretary general denied a second term.The Clinton administration insisted that its decision arose from policy differences with Mr. Boutros-Ghali, not personal animosity or politics. White House officials called him an ineffective reformer whose mere presence was impeding efforts to get Congress to pay America\u2019s debt to the United Nations.But Mr. Boutros-Ghali regarded the veto as an assault on his record and integrity. In \u201cUnvanquished,\u201d he portrayed himself as a dedicated civil servant hounded out of office by Mr. Clinton for election-year political gain.He said the president had done so to undermine an accusation by Senator Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee, that the administration had effectively put the United Nations in charge of the American military by giving the secretary general veto power over airstrikes against Serbs in Bosnia.The General Assembly gave the departing secretary general a standing ovation as it ushered in his successor, Kofi Annan of Ghana. But a frustrated Mr. Boutros-Ghali, in a farewell rebuke, chided member states for failing to deal with disasters in Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia.\u201cThe concept of peacekeeping was turned on its head,\u201d he said, \u201cand worsened by the serious gap between mandates and resources.\u201dBoutros Boutros-Ghali was born in Cairo on Nov. 14, 1922. His father had been finance minister, and his grandfather, a prime minister under the British, was assassinated in 1910.Like his family, he represented the cosmopolitan class in Egypt between the wars that was immortalized in Lawrence Durrell\u2019s \u201cAlexandria Quartet\u201d novels. Indeed, some said he was the model for Nessim Hosnani, the Coptic financier of that tale.He earned a law degree from Cairo University in 1946 and a doctorate in international law from the University of Paris in 1949. He was a Fulbright scholar at Columbia University in 1954-55. For many years he was a professor at Cairo University, led its political science department and lectured around the world in Arabic, French and English.In 1977, when Mr. Sadat decided to go to Jerusalem, his foreign minister, Ismail Fahmy, resigned in protest, as did another cabinet member, the minister of state for foreign affairs, Mohammed Riad, reflecting opposition to the overture in Egypt\u2019s dominant Muslim majority and in the Arab world. In Mr. Riad\u2019s place for the trip, Mr. Sadat named Mr. Boutros-Ghali. He had never held office but was known to support peaceful coexistence with Israel, and Mr. Sadat regarded his Coptic origins, reputation for fairness and marriage to an Alexandrian Jew, Leia Nadler, as potential assets in Jerusalem.The three-day visit went well for Mr. Sadat, but not for Mr. Boutros-Ghali. A lean, slightly built man with glasses and an intense expression, he often looked awkward and ill prepared in the glare of klieg lights, addressing world news media in the unfamiliar role of government spokesman \u2014 a remarkable flop for a confident, fastidiously groomed, well-organized scholar with cool manners and a self-effacing wit.But he was back to normal for the 1978 Camp David talks. While Mr. Sadat was the prime mover on the Egyptian side, observers said Mr. Boutros-Ghali argued cogently if unsuccessfully for a Palestinian state and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But the negotiations secured peace and Mr. Sadat\u2019s primary objective: the return of the Sinai Peninsula, seized by Israel in the 1967 war.In his memoir of the period, \u201cEgypt\u2019s Road to Jerusalem\u201d (1997), Mr. Boutros-Ghali said he had often been frustrated at being excluded from Mr. Sadat\u2019s inner circle and critical policy decisions and had disagreed with many of them. He said he had warned Mr. Sadat about Egypt\u2019s growing isolation in the third world over the rapprochement with Israel, but eventually became convinced that retrieving the Sinai was worth it.Mr. Boutros-Ghali joined the Mubarak government after Mr. Sadat\u2019s assassination in 1981, focusing on foreign affairs. Besides pressing Israel to withdraw from occupied territories, he helped settle political and ecological disputes in Africa and in 1990 helped negotiate the release of Nelson Mandela, South Africa\u2019s imprisoned black leader.When Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar of Peru decided to retire as secretary general in 1991, Mr. Boutros-Ghali broke tradition and campaigned for the job. Three Europeans, an Asian and a Latin American had held it, and it seemed Africa\u2019s turn. Secretaries general are invariably compromise candidates, all but unknown to the world until their elections, and African and Arab support proved critical for Mr. Boutros-Ghali.After his term, he was secretary general of La Francophonie, an organization of French-speaking countries, from 1997 to 2002. He then served three years as chairman of South Centre, which conducts research for developing nations.Somini Sengupta, Rick Gladstone and Nour Youssef contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Bank Profits May Be Endangered by Diesel Scandal", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byVolkswagen Financial Services, the company\u2019s in-house bank, has been an important element in Volkswagen\u2019s rise to become the No. 2 carmaker in the world after Toyota. The unit has helped speed Volkswagen\u2019s growth by lending money to buyers, financing leases and extending credit to dealers. It even offers checking accounts.Financial services are a major source of profit for Volkswagen. In the first nine months of 2015, banking activities generated operating profit of 1.6 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion. That compares with \u20ac2.2 billion that the company earned from Volkswagen brand passenger cars.But the finance unit\u2019s focus on a single asset \u2014 Volkswagen cars \u2014 could endanger those profits if the scandal continues to undercut new-car sales or undermine the value of used vehicles. A particular concern is leased vehicles. Typically, Volkswagen and its dealers are obligated to buy back leased cars when the leases \u2014 valued at about \u20ac20 billion \u2014 expire. If their value drops more than planned, Volkswagen must absorb the difference.The risks have drawn scrutiny from regulators and prompted all three major credit ratings firms to downgrade debt issued by Volkswagen, a company once considered so solid that even during the financial crisis its bonds found buyers. In December, for example, Standard & Poor\u2019s cut its ratings for Volkswagen Financial Services and the parent company by one notch to BBB+, S&P\u2019s fourth-highest grade. That is worse than Toyota, BMW and Daimler, but still better than United States competitors like Ford.Investors\u2019 view of Volkswagen as a creditor \u201chas deteriorated quite significantly,\u201d said Yasmina Serghini, a senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which downgraded the financial-services unit one notch to A1 from Aa3 in November. The risk increases, she said, the longer it takes Volkswagen to reach agreement with United States regulators on how to make its diesels compliant with air-quality rules.Volkswagen admitted in September that 11 million diesel vehicles, including almost 600,000 in the United States, were programmed to produce exemplary emissions readings when being tested, but to flout the rules at other times. \u201cThe emission crisis might cause lasting damage to VW\u2019s once-solid reputation with adverse effects on its future earnings and cash flows,\u201d Moody\u2019s warned in a report on Monday.All large automakers have divisions that provide financing to car buyers. But Volkswagen was particularly aggressive in the way that it used its finance arm to pursue its earlier ambition, since abandoned, of becoming the largest carmaker in the world.With \u20ac114 billion in loans and other assets, Volkswagen Financial Services is considered important enough to be overseen directly by the European Central Bank, rather than solely by local regulators. The only other car-company bank to earn that distinction is RCI Banque, Renault\u2019s finance unit. They are among 129 banks, out of about 5,500 in the eurozone, deemed worthy of special central-bank scrutiny because of the possibility they could damage the broader financial system if something went wrong.There are no signs that the problems of Volkswagen Financial Services represent a risk of instability in the eurozone financial system. Volkswagen is contractually obligated to support the unit and has enough cash to do so.The emissions scandal threatens Volkswagen\u2019s finance unit in several ways. One is that investors will demand higher interest rates on Volkswagen debt and raise the company\u2019s financing costs, adding to the already heavy financial impact from recalls, repairs, fines and lawsuits. Volkswagen would not be able to pass the higher rates on to buyers without hurting sales.The banking unit could also suffer losses on the \u20ac14 billion in credit it has extended to dealers. If sales slump, some dealers might not earn enough money to repay their loans. \u201cThe performance of the dealer loan book is to a large extent related to the well-being of the related car manufacturer and its brands,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a November report.Values of Volkswagens are already falling in the United States. Kelley Blue Book estimates that prices for used Volkswagens have declined 16 percent since the scandal became public in September.Some owners report steeper losses. Mark Winnett, a drug-development team leader for a pharmaceutical company, was forced to sell his 2014 Jetta in December when he moved from Phoenixville, Pa., to a posting in Shanghai.Mr. Winnett, 58, paid about $28,000 for the car in April 2014. A Volkswagen dealer bought the car in December 2015 for a little more than half that amount. Mr. Winnett also said the dealer acted as though he was doing him a favor.\u201cI felt betrayed,\u201d he said. Even before suffering the financial hit, Mr. Winnett said, he was angry at Volkswagen for marketing diesel as environmentally friendly. In fact, the cars emitted as much as 40 times the allowable amount of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to lung ailments, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201cWe bought the car because we thought we were doing a good thing,\u201d Mr. Winnett said.Frank Fiedler, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen Financial Services, said in a statement that \u201cno effect on the resale value of vehicles has been established so far in the majority of the markets.\u201d The unit has set aside enough money to cover any losses that might materialize, Mr. Fiedler said in a written response to questions.Volkswagen does not have any trouble raising money, he said, although he said that the company had sometimes had to pay higher interest rates.The financial services unit makes heavy use of asset-backed securities, bundles of loans sold to investors who are then entitled to proceeds from the payments. The transactions allow Volkswagen to raise money for new loans.Volkswagen Financial Services is also a full-service bank. Its Volkswagen Bank subsidiary has retail branches in Germany where customers can keep checking and savings accounts, in addition to applying for loans. Credit agencies consider the retail operations positive for the unit, because customer deposits provide a more stable source of funding than debt markets, which can be volatile.Volkswagen has a separate finance unit in the United States, VW Credit. It has a $28 billion loan portfolio, 90 percent of which consists of credit to buyers or for leased vehicles.In Europe, Volkswagen sales have not suffered as much as in the United States. That is good news for Volkswagen Financial Services, which does three-quarters of its lending in Europe. In December, sales including other Volkswagen brands, like SEAT and Skoda, rose 5 percent in the European Union to 246,278 vehicles.That was much slower than the overall market, which rose 17 percent. And Volkswagen\u2019s market share in the European Union slipped to 22 percent from 25 percent, though it was still double that of the nearest competitor, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn.Whatever happens, Volkswagen is likely to keep offering competitive lending rates to customers, although it might cost the company more to do so. Mr. Fiedler of Volkswagen Financial Services said that it was in the company\u2019s \u201cown interest that we always offer our customers attractive financing and leasing conditions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Old Hollywood Buildings Get Makeovers and Turn \u2018Creative\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetLOS ANGELES \u2014 The former prop house at 720 North Cahuenga Boulevard was once old Hollywood. Into the 1990s, it housed props from police shows like \u201cHill Street Blues.\u201dThe building\u2019s newly installed glass doors were recently opened to prospective tenants. Docler Media, based in Luxembourg, installed its technology and film production division in the 33,173-square-foot building, which has concrete floors and 30-foot bow-truss ceilings, subway tile showers, a kitchen that seems out of a Nancy Meyers movie, yoga studio and full bar.\u201cThat\u2019s still all very important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you can say there\u2019s on-site laundry, a cool kitchen area, there\u2019s a little dog park \u2014 that helps landlords land and attract more tenants, especially in the tech sector.\u201dIn Los Angeles, that kind of space has been specifically positioned for more creative firms, rather than those in fields like insurance, law and finance, according to John D. Zanetos, senior vice president for brokerage services at the commercial real estate services firm CBRE in Los Angeles. But that is changing.\u201cWhether you\u2019re an entertainment firm or a law firm, what we hear consistently is that companies are trying to enhance collaboration and deliver a workplace that will enhance that,\u201d Mr. Zanetos said.\u201cThe audience for this type of space isn\u2019t the normal cast of characters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s growing.\u201dPetra Durnin, CBRE\u2019s director of research and analysis for Southern California, estimated the Los Angeles County office space market at 200 million square feet. Technology and creative tenants lease 38 percent, roughly 76 million square feet, she said.\u201cGoing forward, another 30 million square feet of tenants will be expiring and then renewing,\u201d Ms. Durnin said, speaking of the next five years. \u201cFrom that pool we\u2019re looking at everybody turning to some kind of creative space. Eventually all office-using tenants will be in some sort of creative.\u201dThe city has a number of office buildings dating back to the early 1900s with the requisite exposed brick and wood-beamed ceilings. There is also a vast amount of industrial space built from the early 1900s to the 1980s, a vestige of a once-robust manufacturing economy.\u201cL.A. has this unique combination of historic office buildings and industrial product that\u2019s no longer useful in the way it was originally intended,\u201d Mr. Zanetos said.Cory Bird, a co-producer on the television shows \u201cBates Motel,\u201d \u201cThe Strain\u201d and \u201cColony\u201d at Carlton Cuse Productions, often searches for spaces like these. The company produces television shows with sometimes unpredictable schedules and changing needs. This means maintaining multiple offices.\u201cIn our \u2018Bates Motel\u2019 building, everyone\u2019s under one roof and there\u2019s a real community environment,\u201d Mr. Bird said.That building in Sherman Oaks comes closest to fulfilling the needs of a production: a suitable writers\u2019 room, space for casting and the capacity to handle the terabytes of digital information used in postproduction. Yet Mr. Bird still faces challenges.\u201cIf we come in with postproduction, a lot of times we\u2019ll have to overhaul the entire Internet setup,\u201d he said, speaking of not-quite-enough web power. He looks forward to an influx of available space tailored to what he will need.\u201cIf you asked us a year ago when we started Cross Campus, we would have said that\u2019s going to work for offices of up to about 10 people,\u201d Mr. Olshansky said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re starting to see is most of the demand coming from 20-, 40-person offices. That same value proposition still exists.\u201dHe added, \u201cTenants aren\u2019t just limited to creative companies. We\u2019ve got financial companies, law firms, branding, design, advertising. It\u2019s a really wide cross section.\u201dThe Masonic Temple\u2019s 37-foot ceilings, stadium staircase seating and 24-hour concierge illustrate the kind of adaptive reuse these spaces employ.CBRE\u2019s workplace division was a consultant on CBRE\u2019s downtown and Masonic Temple offices.\u201cThat group started off as 12 people; now there are over 50,\u201d said Lewis C. Horne, who heads the firm\u2019s Los Angeles/Orange County region. \u201cWe would not go to meet with a tenant without bringing our workplace strategy professionals.\u201d\u201cIt used to be a broker would go out and find space because it was in the right location,\u201d Mr. Horne said.\u201cPeople would move in, put perimeter offices around the edge of the space,\u201d he added. \u201cThe core would be support, and away you\u2019d go. That\u2019s just not what we\u2019re doing anymore. Now there\u2019s wellness components, this concierge idea, natural light. The line between your home and your office really blurs.\u201dLos Angeles comprises many smaller regions that Mr. Zanetos says have reached a \u201ccritical mass.\u201d On the west side, Playa Vista has attracted tech, entertainment and design companies. Burbank, to the north, is home to two major studios \u2014 Warner Bros. and Disney \u2014 and the companies that do business with them. Both areas have a high concentration of tenants desiring different spaces.\u201cThere\u2019s an effort to bring down real estate costs,\u201d said Eric Sussman, senior lecturer of accounting at the University of California, Los Angeles, Anderson School of Management.\u201cCosts of doing business here are quite high. This can reduce the amount of square footage per employee,\u201d he said.\u201cYou had this move to very traditional space in the \u201980s, \u201990s, 2000s,\u201d Mr. Sussman said. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re getting this other stream where everything\u2019s open and you\u2019re sitting in people\u2019s laps. The dogs are roaming the concrete floors.\u201dAnd tenants are willing to pay.When the developer Rising Realty acquired the PacMutual complex in 2012 for $60 million, rent went for $2 a square foot, according to CBRE. Rising transformed the traditional office space and then sold it to Callahan Capital Properties and Ivanhoe Cambridge.\u201cWhen a developer goes in and buys a historic office building, those buildings need love. They need money,\u201d said Mr. Zanetos of CBRE. \u201cElevators need to be modernized; HVAC and electrical need updates. Data is critical. Nobody can function without high-speed Internet.\u201dPacMutual just achieved rent of $4 a square foot.Similarly, in the Arts District, industrial rents go for 65 cents a square foot per month triple net, meaning the tenant is responsible for taxes, insurance and maintenance. A lease was just recorded in a converted 1920s industrial building at $3 a square foot triple net.\u201cIn L.A., these buildings that were once looked at as obsolete are now being rediscovered,\u201d Mr. Zanetos said.Mr. Kim of Miren observed, \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Field of Dreams\u2019 \u2014 if you build it they will come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

So far, her campaign has stepped lightly around the D.N.C. reversal, emphasizing instead her calls for wholesale campaign finance reform and her reliance on hundreds of thousands of low-dollar donors in addition to deep-pocketed contributors. But the Clinton campaign has not yet called for reinstating the ban on donations from lobbyists, the Washington insider corps paid to influence government policy in assorted ways, including \u00e2\u0080\u009cmoney bundling\u00e2\u0080\u009d for favored candidates.The D.N.C. rationalized its return to accepting lobbyists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 money as necessary for having \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe resources and infrastructure in place to best support whoever emerges as our eventual nominee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This echoes the position of Clinton supporters who say they must not \u00e2\u0080\u009cunilaterally disarm\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the approaching \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark money\u00e2\u0080\u009d war with the Republicans in the general election. In the meantime, of course, there is Mrs. Clinton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprisingly tight and increasingly costly primary skirmish with Senator Sanders, whose supporters complain the D.N.C. is deeply biased toward the Clinton campaign.Political watchdog groups have called for restoration of the Obama ban, warning that its absence will mean a flood of influence buying this year through six-figure checks from lobbyists, particularly via the candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 joint fundraising committees with the D.N.C. The joint Clinton committee raised $26.9 million last year to share with the party, while the Sanders joint committee reported only $1,000. Making a virtue of fat-cat penury, the Sanders campaign, which has sizable funding strength from small-dollar donors, has started a petition drive calling for the Obama ban to be restored for the sake of cleaner politics.After dramatically framing this issue eight years ago, President Obama will have no part of it this year. The White House said donor restrictions should be left to the current candidates to decide. As a candidate, Senator Obama was not so hesitant, telling a cheering Virginia crowd in June of 2008 that he would \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot take a dime\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Washington lobbyists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will not fund my party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thundered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will not run our White House.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Appointment Could Reshape American Life", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported by\u201cAt-risk precedents run from campaign finance to commerce, from race to religion, and they include some signature Scalia projects, such as the Second Amendment,\u201d said Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.\u201cSome would go quickly, like Citizens United, and some would go slower,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll go.\u201dEvery time the party in the White House changes, there is a potential impact on the court as the new president tries to mold it when openings develop. But Mr. Obama has a relatively rare opportunity to make a third appointment at a crucial moment. \u201cThe court is now divided on many issues,\u201d the president said on Tuesday. \u201cThis would be a deciding vote.\u201dThe last nomination with the ideological stakes so high was in 1991, when Thurgood Marshall retired, by some measures the most liberal justice in modern history. He was replaced by Justice Clarence Thomas, the most conservative by those same measures, after a brutal confirmation process.\u201cThe importance of the change in the court\u2019s jurisprudence that is directly attributable to the choice of Clarence Thomas to fill the vacancy created by Thurgood\u2019s retirement cannot be overstated,\u201d Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired in 2010, wrote in a 2011 memoir.Appointing a replacement for Justice Scalia could be just as consequential. Abortion rights would become more secure, and gun rights less so. Business interests would meet with less success, and consumers and workers with more. Judicial hostility to government programs aimed at helping disadvantaged minorities would wane. First Amendment arguments in cases on campaign finance, public unions and commercial speech would meet a more skeptical reception.Divisive Supreme Court decisions are more likely to be re-examined \u2014 and possibly overturned \u2014 when a court changes. In the Roberts Court, 85 cases split 5 to 4 or 5 to 3 with Justice Scalia in the conservative majority, many with similar judicial themes.A new Obama appointee would bolster the current court\u2019s four-member liberal bloc \u2014 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, who were appointed by President Bill Clinton, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, appointed by Mr. Obama.By political science measures, those four justices are ideologically very close. They often vote together in closely divided cases, and they have lately had some success in attracting a fifth vote for their positions, often from Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who would almost certainly lose his position at the court\u2019s ideological center should Mr. Obama succeed in appointing the next justice.Until Justice Scalia\u2019s death, the four Democratic appointees were outnumbered by five Republican appointees, all of them more conservative. A fifth liberal vote could be profoundly consequential, said Vikram Amar, the dean of the University of Illinois College of Law.\u201cAdding another justice who has instincts and outlooks similar to those of Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor could call into question a number of contentious 5 to 4 precedents,\u201d he said, ticking off the decisions that might be overruled.Indeed, Professor Amar said, \u201cthe judicial debate over the fundamental permissibility of Obamacare would likely draw to an end\u201d with the appointment of a fifth liberal.Professor Epstein identified 85 decisions in the Roberts court years in which Justice Scalia was part of a five-justice majority and Justices Ginsburg and Breyer (the two liberals who served throughout those years) were in dissent.The empty seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4.The list also included cases on abortion, school integration and government surveillance. And it featured at least five cases striking down campaign finance regulations.The Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, have pledged to work to overturn the Citizens United decision. But that may not be enough to produce a fundamental change, said Tom Ginsburg, a law professor at the University of Chicago.\u201cComprehensive reform may require more than just overturning a single case,\u201d Professor Ginsburg said.There are practical and prudential reasons a new liberal majority might not embark on such a broad project. Appropriate cases presenting the relevant issues must reach the court, for starters, which can sometimes be a matter of happenstance.Then there is the doctrine of stare decisis, which generally counsels against overruling settled law.At his confirmation hearings in 2005, Chief Justice Roberts explained that \u201cadherence to precedent promotes evenhandedness, promotes fairness, promotes stability and predictability.\u201dBut in Citizens United, he voted with the five-justice majority to overrule two important precedents. Stare decisis, he wrote in a concurrence, is not an \u201cinexorable command.\u201dSince 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.It can be a malleable concept, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joked last September. \u201cIt is a Latin phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means \u2018to leave things decided when it suits our purposes.\u2019 \u201dHe added, apparently more seriously, that it is \u201cnot difficult for a judge to make the stare decisis inquiry come out however the judge wants it to come out.\u201dEric J.

Look for enhanced registration requirements as the first step.\u201dJustice Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Heller, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as lower courts\u2019 lawless refusal to follow it by sustaining all manner of gun control laws.A new Obama appointee would make successful Second Amendment challenges to gun control laws even less likely, a point Senator Ted Cruz has been making on the campaign trail.\u201cWe are one justice away,\u201d Mr. Cruz said at a recent Republican presidential debate, \u201cfrom a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia\u2019s seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Head Toward Super Tuesday With G.O.P.\u2019s Deepest Pockets", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byMr. Cruz is the best financed candidate in the Republican race, beginning February with $13.6 million in cash on hand. Mr. Trump, a billionaire, has raised millions of dollars from small donors and lent himself millions more, including nearly $5 million in January. He paid out more than $11.5 million that month, the most sustained spending of his presidential bid so far.Much of the donor class\u2019s money was spent on a shootout among its favored candidates. Groups backing Mr. Bush, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Kasich and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey devoted almost three-quarters of the money they spent on negative advertising to attacking those other candidates rather than Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz, according to the commission\u2019s data. The outside group aligned with Mr. Bush, Right to Rise, spent an astonishing $34 million in January alone, with little impact on Mr. Bush\u2019s own fortunes.That proposition will be tested in the coming weeks, as Republican donors begin to organize more strategically against Mr. Trump. Our Principles PAC, a group devoted to highlighting his past support for Democratic positions like universal health care, higher taxes and abortion rights, is now spending significantly to persuade Republicans that Mr. Trump is not a reliable conservative.On Saturday, filings revealed that Marlene Ricketts, a prominent Republican donor who previously supported the campaign of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, provided the group with $3 million in January. Richard Uihlein, a wealthy Chicago-area businessman and conservative patron, also contributed to the group.See how the latest fund-raising numbers from the campaigns and outside groups stack up.The disparity between traditional and insurgent candidates was echoed to some extent on the Democratic side, where Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised almost $6.5 million more than Hillary Clinton in January \u2014 the first reporting period in which his campaign has taken in more money. Virtually all of that money came from donors giving small checks.But Mr. Sanders also spent heavily to win in New Hampshire and fight Mrs. Clinton to a virtual tie in Iowa, dropping $35 million in January, reports filed late on Saturday showed. He ended the month with less than half as much cash on hand as Mrs. Clinton.A super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, also continues to stockpile cash, reporting $45 million in cash on hand at the end of last month. The group took in almost $10 million in January, including $3.5 million from James H. Simons, a retired hedge fund founder from New York.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio are now hoping to take advantage of Mr. Bush\u2019s decision to quit the race, leaving them to divvy up his remaining large donors. Both have been heavily dependent on donors making large contributions: Mr. Kasich raised just 17 percent of his contributions from donors giving $200 or less in January, and Mr. Rubio 19 percent.\u201cSouth Carolina is the political equivalent of the parting of the Red Sea,\u201d said Theresa Kostrzewa, a Bush fund-raiser in North Carolina, who predicted most of Mr. Bush\u2019s supporters would flow to Mr. Rubio. \u201cRepublicans: This is your sign from God.\u201dJeff Sadowsky, a spokesman for the pro-Rubio group, Conservative Solutions PAC, said on Saturday that he expected the race to \u201cgo on for quite some time.\u201d The group is planning to begin what Mr. Sadowsky described as a \u201cmultistate, multimillion-dollar advertising effort\u201d on Tuesday.Mr. Kasich\u2019s chief strategist, John Weaver, told reporters on Saturday that Mr. Kasich\u2019s fund-raising had increased \u201cdramatically\u201d since his second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, but did not specify by how much. And Mr. Kasich faces perhaps the biggest challenge. He is bypassing this week\u2019s Republican caucuses in Nevada, and he is counting on strong performances in Michigan, whose primary is March 8, and his home state of Ohio, which votes on March 15. He is not likely to have another attention-grabbing finish before those contests.\u201cWe\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to get enough to run the kind of campaign we need,\u201d Mr. Weaver said after results came in on Saturday. \u201cThe days of us being outspent 10 to 1 are over because of what happened tonight.\u201dMaggie Haberman, Rachel Shorey and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Court Dismisses Criminal Case Against Rick Perry", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byTony Buzbee, a Houston lawyer who was representing Mr. Perry, called the ruling on Wednesday by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals \u201ca long time coming\u201d \u2014 one year and six months after his indictment in August 2014. The court ordered the indictment dismissed.In Austin, Mr. Perry told reporters that the court\u2019s ruling proved the indictment was \u201cnothing less than a baseless political attack\u201d as he struck a businesslike demeanor at a news conference. Mr. Perry, who withdrew from the presidential race in September as his campaign effectively ran out of money, said the shadow of criminal charges undercut his bid. \u201cObviously this indictment, as it would anybody, had a negative effect on our candidacy,\u201d Mr. Perry said.Mr. Perry and his lawyers had long denied any wrongdoing, saying that the threat to cut off state financing and his eventual veto of the money were lawful. Yet as the case dragged on after Mr. Perry left office in January 2015, it appeared to sour his efforts to attract donors and break into the top tier of candidates in the crowded Republican race for president.The case against Mr. Perry began when a nonprofit government watchdog group, Texans for Public Justice, filed a complaint accusing the governor of misdemeanor and felony offenses over his veto threat. A Republican judge appointed a special prosecutor \u2014 Michael McCrum, a San Antonio lawyer and former federal prosecutor \u2014 and a grand jury began hearing the case. Mr. Perry\u2019s critics said they saw a different form of politics at play in the dismissal of the case. There are nine judges, all but one Republicans, on the Court of Criminal Appeals. One recused himself from the case. The ruling was 6 to 2, with only Republicans among the majority. Only one of those who ruled for Mr. Perry was appointed by him, Judge Elsa Alcala. \u201cA highly partisan court has handed Rick Perry a gift,\u201d said Craig McDonald, the director and founder of Texans for Public Justice.Mr. Perry approached the case with a swagger, turning his booking session in Austin into a pep rally. Afterward, he went out for frozen custard with his legal team, and over the coming months enjoyed the support of Republican leaders and a bipartisan group of lawyers who filed an amicus brief. Those lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, called the charges unconstitutional.\u201cThere is no doubt that these sham legal proceedings cast a shadow over his recent political campaign, especially among some potential finance supporters,\u201d said Deirdre Delisi, a former chief of staff to Mr. Perry. \u201cGovernor Perry is ready to put this mockery behind him, and his conservative legacy of an effective, conservative governor won\u2019t be the least bit tainted by an overzealous prosecutor who couldn\u2019t grasp the basics of how the veto process actually works.\u201dMr. Perry appeared to take a swipe at both Texans for Public Justice and the special prosecutor, telling reporters that those who pursued the charges should be held accountable, although he did not mention anyone by name.\u201cThe people of this state do not want rogue prosecutors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want rogue organizations that use the political process, use the court system, to get done what they can\u2019t get done at the ballot box.\u201dMr. McCrum said he did not have any immediate plans to appeal the ruling. He said that the six judges gave Mr. Perry special consideration and based their decision on what he described as assumptions instead of facts. \u201cSix members on this court did back flips and created new hoops to jump through, and did everything possible, to give Rick Perry an out on this whole situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d Mr. McCrum said of his political affiliation. \u201cI\u2019ve done the job that I came to do.\u201dThe case centered on Mr. Perry\u2019s veto power as governor and his political maneuvering after the drunken-driving arrest of Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney. After her arrest, Mr. Perry and his aides threatened to veto $7.5 million in state funds for the public-corruption unit in her office unless she resigned. Mr. Perry followed through on his threat. Mr. Perry\u2019s critics accused him of using Ms. Lehmberg\u2019s arrest to dismantle a public-corruption squad that was unpopular with the state\u2019s Republican leadership and to try to go after Ms. Lehmberg, a powerful Democrat in Austin. Mr. McCrum argued that Mr. Perry\u2019s actions crossed the line from mere politics to the criminal act of threatening an elected official. Mr. Perry\u2019s supporters said the charges by a grand jury in liberal Travis County were a political witch hunt.Ms. Lehmberg never resigned and remains in office. A spokesman for Ms. Lehmberg declined to comment on the decision.The grand jury had charged Mr. Perry with coercing a public servant and abusing his official capacity, both felonies. In July, a state appeals court dismissed the coercion charge, ruling that the law upon which it was based violated Mr. Perry\u2019s First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The criminal appellate court upheld that ruling Wednesday. The judges found that \u201cpublic servants have a First Amendment right to engage in expression, even threats, regarding their official duties.\u201dOn the abuse-of-power charge, Mr. Perry\u2019s legal team had argued that the law underlying the allegation infringed on his veto rights as governor and violated the Texas Constitution\u2019s separation of powers clause, which divides the government into the legislative, executive and judicial branches. The court agreed.David Montgomery contributed reporting from Austin, Tex.Advertisement"}

The photo is not a punch in the face.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Richardson, 47, covered the migrant crisis last year for several months without any paid assignments. He worked on a shoestring, living with the migrants and at times going without meals.The winning image has not been published before, Mr. Richardson said, although he had sent it, along with others from the European migrant crisis, to two photo agencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a tough industry to be in, tough financially and on your personal life,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Richardson has worked internationally on substantive issues for more than 20 years but said he has had to, at times, turn to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccelebrity-based\u00e2\u0080\u009d photography to finance more serious stories.But the paparazzi stakeouts eventually became too discordant with his other work and he had to stop, he said.Other 2016 winners included several photographers working for The New York Times.

Tara Todras-Whitehall was awarded third place for Sport stories for her photos of a soccer club of ebola survivors.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese awards demonstrate the serious commitment to quality photojournalism and telling difficult stories while working in hard situations of Sergey, Daniel, Mauricio, and Tara,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michele McNally, the Times\u00e2\u0080\u0099 director of photography.

Nancy Borowick took second place for her intimate photo essay of her parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 love as they both succumbed to cancer. David Guttenfelder came in third in the category for his photographs of North Korea.  No winners were announced in the group long-term projects category.After last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controversies, the World Press consulted with photographers, editors and publishers in 15 countries to produce new rules. The changes included a code of ethics for entrants and provided detailed guidelines regarding digital manipulation of images.The Amsterdam-based organization also added an independent fact-checking process for captions and a 36-hour period for entrants whose images may have been unduly altered to explain their process.Lars Boering, the managing director of World Press Photo, said in an interview that the new rules were successfully instituted.The process \u00e2\u0080\u009cran smoothly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that the judging process was not much different from in previous years.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe winning image is in line with the changes of World Press photos over the last few years to being more interpretive and poetic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that he was speaking just for himself.All of the winning photos were checked for caption accuracy and postprocessing violations, he said. Information on any disqualifications of images that were considered as finalists will not be released until a technical report on the contest is issued on Feb. 29. But Mr. Boering said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe checked more photos than last year and found less, and that\u2019s clearly a good sign.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlong with Mr. Boering, David Campbell spent much of the last year shepherding the re-examination of the contest.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe process clarified the purpose of the contest as one based on journalistic ethics where the pictures have to be accurate and fair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe renewed focus for the contest and the verification processes worked, and the outcome was very satisfying from the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe jury is independent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.UpdateTwo Syrian freelance photographers working with Agence France-Presse covering their country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conflict won awards in the World Press Photo contest. A photographer working under the name Sameer al-Douma received first place in the spot news stories category. The name Abd Doumany appeared with an entry that took second place for general news stories. Both name are pseudonyms.When asked about the use of the names last week, Francis Kohn, AFP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s photo director, confirmed that both names were pseudonyms. He said local Syrian photographers and their families might be in danger if their actual names were published.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe thought it was fine for these guys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey chose their own names. And we agreed to that. We have a policy that we use real names, but in some really extraordinary circumstances we agree to use other names. The alternative would be to just use \u00e2\u0080\u0098stringer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which we do sometimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lars Boering, the executive director of World Press Photo, said that Mr. Kohn, who was jury chairman for the contest, told him of the pseudonyms after the judging but before the results were announced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u2019re very happy that guys like that get awards working in areas like Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe also realize how dangerous it is to be exposed and this is why we awarded them under their working names.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The New York Times does not use pseudonyms in credits to avoid the risk of misleading readers, but will omit photographers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real name if they might be in danger.

{"Headline": "Closely Watched Fight Over California Teacher Tenure Moves to Appeals Court", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 A fierce battle over the future of teacher tenure in California moved to an appeals court here on Thursday. Lawyers for student plaintiffs argued that the state\u2019s ironclad job protections for teachers deprived students of a quality education, while teachers unions and the state said the system helped recruit and retain teachers.Judge Treu said the evidence presented by the plaintiffs in the 2014 case, Vergara v. California, \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d because poor and minority students were disproportionately affected by the state laws and the placement of ineffective teachers. The nine plaintiffs, then in high school, are backed by Students Matter, a group financed by a Silicon Valley business magnate, David Welch.With states around the country overhauling tenure laws, the Vergara case has been closely watched by teachers unions and education advocates. A New York-based group, Partnership for Education Justice, has brought a similar case in New York and is working with plaintiffs in other states to mount parallel cases challenging tenure protections for teachers. The partnership is backed by the foundations of the Los Angeles billionaire Eli Broad and the Walton family, founders of Walmart \u2014 philanthropists deeply involved in the overhauling of America\u2019s public schools.The former high school students in the case in California, where teachers can be granted tenure after just two years in the classroom and where procedures to dismiss ineffective teachers can cost school districts hundreds of thousands of dollars, argue that too often, incompetent teachers end up in classrooms with disadvantaged children, and that the laws make it all but impossible to remove the teachers.In Thursday\u2019s hearing before a three-judge panel, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., the lawyer for Students Matter, described what experts called \u201cthe dance of the lemons,\u201d in which underperforming teachers were shuffled around from school to school, ultimately ending up in communities with a high concentration of poor and minority students, where there were the most openings for teaching jobs.At one point during the hearing, when lawyers focused largely on case-law precedent rather than the emotional testimony of teachers and students that characterized the initial trial, Associate Justice Brian M. Hoffstadt said the plaintiffs\u2019 logic seemed circular. In response to arguments by the state that the contested laws did not lead to underperforming teachers, presiding Justice Roger W. Boren said, \u201cThere\u2019s probably nobody in this room who didn\u2019t have a bad teacher at some point.\u201dLawyers for the state and teachers unions said it was not the laws that led to ineffective teachers\u2019 staying in classrooms, but school district administrators\u2019 inappropriately granting tenure or not following procedures to remove them. \u201cThe statutes don\u2019t cause underperformers to be in the classroom or to remain in the classroom,\u201d Michael Rubin, a lawyer representing the California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a function of district decisions.\u201dDuring the hearing, Mr. Rubin repeatedly held up the example of Long Beach, where he said 95 percent of the teachers the district tries to fire are forced out \u2014 usually because they choose to resign voluntarily, rather than risk a dismissal, which remains on their record. \u201cWhen we talk about tenure issues or start talking about poor-performing teachers, I think that this may have the unintended consequence of causing people to not want to stay in the profession,\u201d said Preston Green, a professor of educational leadership and law at the University of Connecticut, who signed on to support the teachers union brief.The lawyers for both sides staged dueling news conferences outside the courthouse, each group insisting the arguments had gone their way.Brandon DeBose, a plaintiff who has since graduated from high school, was also at the news conference. He said he had endured \u201cteachers who wore us down and told us we wouldn\u2019t amount to anything, teachers who moved us back instead of forward.\u201d\u201cThe Vergara case is no longer about me or changing my future,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing the future generations of California students coming up in the public school system behind me.\u201dA decision is expected within 90 days. The case could be appealed to the State Supreme Court.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is Mitch McConnell Picking This Fight?", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byNews AnalysisIN early 2009, as Barack Obama was about to take office, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, assembled his caucus at a retreat in West Virginia. There, he laid out his strategy for taking on the new president, who was sweeping into office on a tide of popularity, historical resonance and great expectations barely diminished by the economic free fall then underway.The key, Mr. McConnell told his fellow Republicans, was to stymie and undermine Mr. Obama, but to do so in subtle ways. As one of the senators present, Robert F. Bennett of Utah, later recalled to me: \u201cMitch said, \u2018We have a new president with an approval rating in the 70 percent area. We do not take him on frontally. We find issues where we can win, and we begin to take him down, one issue at a time. We create an inventory of losses, so it\u2019s Obama lost on this, Obama lost on that. And we wait for the time where the image has been damaged to the point where we can take him on.\u2019 \u201dSeven years later, with the Republicans now in the Senate majority, the opposition led by Mr. McConnell is as frontal as can be. After word of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death emerged last weekend, it took the majority leader less than an hour to announce that the Senate would not entertain a replacement before November. \u201cThis vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\u201d he said.Mr. McConnell\u2019s blunt declaration was taken as the starkest exhibition yet of the obstructionism that has characterized the Kentucky senator\u2019s stance toward President Obama and congressional Democrats. The resistance from Mr. McConnell has had an enormous influence on the shape of Obama\u2019s presidency. It has limited the president\u2019s accomplishments and denied him the mantle of the postpartisan unifier he sought back in 2008. But it has also brought the Senate, the institution to which Mr. McConnell has devoted his life, close to rupture.His declaration on the Supreme Court also represents a striking shift for the veteran politician. In throwing down the gauntlet so emphatically, and potentially riling up a Democratic electorate, Mr. McConnell was doing something deeply out of character: putting at risk his and his party\u2019s prospects in the coming election.The best way to understand Addison Mitchell McConnell Jr. has been to recognize that he is not a conservative ideologue, but rather the epitome of the permanent campaign of Washington: What matters most isn\u2019t so much what you do in office, but if you can win again.From that point on, the priority was winning every six years and, once he\u2019d made his way up the ranks of leadership, holding a Republican majority. In 1996, that meant voting for a minimum-wage increase to defuse a potential Democratic talking point in his re-election campaign. In 2006, as George W. Bush wrote in his memoir, it meant asking the president if he could start withdrawing troops from Iraq to improve the Republicans\u2019 chance of keeping the Senate that fall, when Mr. McConnell was set to become its leader.More often, though, these self-described revolutionaries confounded him, which led to explosions of frustration like the one that a longtime associate witnessed in 2011: \u201cHe said, \u2018Those idiots, those people come up here and have never been in office and know nothing about being in office.\u2019 \u201dSuch outbursts were kept under wraps, of course. Mr. McConnell needed to appease enough of the chaos makers in order to stay atop the Republican caucus, and to overcome a Tea Party Republican challenger leading up to his 2014 re-election.Justice Scalia\u2019s death has greatly complicated Mr. McConnell\u2019s election-year plans. Remarkably, he has, for once, chosen a path that would seem to reduce his party\u2019s odds in November.Unlike 2009 and 2010, when his opposition took the form of procedural delays, Mr. McConnell is taking a high-profile stand. Had he instead allowed the nomination process to proceed and bog down in more gridlock, the outrage quotient among Democrats would have remained lower and his prospects for retaining the majority higher.The likeliest explanation is that the insurgency that Mr. McConnell helped engender has gotten so strong, embodied in the rise of Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz, that it has caused him to lose his bearings. He felt compelled to get out in front of the base\u2019s ire over the Scalia replacement to avoid a later challenge to his leadership perch.It is also possible, though, that in the Supreme Court\u2019s balance, in particular in relation to campaign finance law, Mr. McConnell has at long last discovered one matter that is so consequential that it is worth risking an election over.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of the Democratic Presidential Debate", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byFollowing is a transcript of the Democratic debate, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.TODD: Good evening, and welcome to the MSNBC Democratic candidates debate.MADDOW: We are super excited to be here at the University of New Hampshire. Tonight, this is the first time that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have squared off exactly like this. Face-to-face, just one-on-one, just the two of them.TODD: And neither party has seen this yet. These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president. Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.MADDOW: And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions \u2014 show us the differences between them. That\u2019s the whole reason that we\u2019re here tonight.We\u2019re not here for talking points. We\u2019re to learn about the difference between the candidates. And with that, let\u2019s get going. Please join us in welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: First, I want to say a special thanks to the New Hampshire union leader for helping make this debate possible, and the readers, who helped provide some of the questions and topics that we\u2019ll be addressing tonight.The rules tonight, by the way, are simple: 90 seconds for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.MADDOW: And with that, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re going to begin with 60- second opening statements from each of the candidates. And as agreed to in advance by the two campaigns, we\u2019re going to begin tonight with Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Rachel, thank you very much.Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process. And they\u2019re giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.They are working longer hours for low wages. They\u2019re worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent. Not what America is supposed to be about. Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about. And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United. One person, one vote. That\u2019s what American democracy is about.TODD: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed. And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind. CLINTON: Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans. Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.But there\u2019s also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.I believe that we can get back on the right track. I want to imagine a country where people\u2019s wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.I\u2019m fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I\u2019m not making promises that I cannot keep.TODD: All right.Let\u2019s get started.Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.\u201d So please tell us why you think if he\u2019s elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.CLINTON: Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals. I\u2019ve been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we\u2019re now on the path to achieving it. I don\u2019t want us to start over again. I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.I want to build on the progress we\u2019ve made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage. And I don\u2019t want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar. So we have a difference.I also believe in affordable college, but I don\u2019t believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs. What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump\u2019s kids, get to be able to afford college. I want to get the economy going again. It\u2019s not just enough about what we\u2019re against, as important as that is. I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power. I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work. But the numbers just don\u2019t add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing. That\u2019s why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.Let\u2019s go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do. A progressive is someone who makes progress. That\u2019s what I intend to do.TODD: Thank you, Secretary.Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven\u2019t gotten any of these things passed. Why do you think as president you\u2019ll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?SANDERS: Well, I haven\u2019t quite run for president before.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)Let\u2019s deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made. And by the way, you know, sometimes there\u2019s a lot of drama here. I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.Here is the issue. Every major country on earth, whether it\u2019s the U.K., whether it\u2019s France, whether it\u2019s Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are. So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can\u2019t do that.I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can\u2019t stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce. This is 2016. When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade. I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free. Well, how do we pay for that? It\u2019s an expensive proposition.I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people. We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation. The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need. Now, it is Wall Street\u2019s time to help the middle class.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: If I could just follow up on that.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it. I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down. Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again. This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country. It is helping people right now.I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding. Let\u2019s make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Let me...TODD: Go.SANDERS: ... this is a good discussion here.TODD: Yes, go ahead.SANDERS: And let me just say this. As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee. That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act. The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we\u2019re waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate. The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here \u2014 I helped write that bill \u2014 but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, thank you both. Rachel. MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee. He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you\u2019re too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party\u2019s standard bearer.Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?CLINTON: Well because I am a progressive who gets things done. And the root of that word, progressive, is progress. But I\u2019ve heard Senator Sanders comments, and it\u2019s really caused me to wonder who\u2019s left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact. Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country. But if we\u2019re going to get into labels, I don\u2019t think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.(APPLAUSE)I don\u2019t think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity. I don\u2019t think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy\u2019s immigration reform. So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we\u2019ve done and what we will do. That\u2019s why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress. That\u2019s what I\u2019m offering and that\u2019s what I will do as president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?SANDERS: No, not at all. Here\u2019s the reality of American economic life today. The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process. The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people\u2019s needs and desires from what Congress is doing. So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution \u2014 contributors. SANDERS: Now all of the ideas that I\u2019m talking about, they are not radical ideas. Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States. Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens. That is not a radical idea.What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors. When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.MADDOW: Thank you Senator.(APPLAUSE)TODD: I\u2019d like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator. President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty. President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can\u2019t be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can\u2019t be both. Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?SANDERS: Let me just pick up on this point. This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary. She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I\u2019m a moderate. Well, I am a moderate.That\u2019s where this came from. It wasn\u2019t me paraphrasing her. It is what she said, and all that I said was there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a moderate. But, you can\u2019t be a moderate, you can\u2019t a progressive.In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit. The world\u2019s financial system on the verge of collapse. I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job. We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago. That\u2019s the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.Do I think President Obama is a progressive? Yes, I do. I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement. But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.CLINTON: Well, Chuck...TODD: ... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...CLINTON: ... If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I\u2019m a progressive who likes to get things done. Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn\u2019t change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children\u2019s Defense Fund.It certainly didn\u2019t stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies. Before it was called Hillarycare \u2014 I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren\u2019t successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children\u2019s health insurance program. Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.So, again...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... I think it\u2019s important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself. I understand that, that\u2019s what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let\u2019s not be \u2014 in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I\u2019ve always stood.It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don\u2019t know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.And, that\u2019s what we ought to be celebrating. Let\u2019s talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: (inaudible) 30 seconds, and then we\u2019ll move.SANDERS: That\u2019s right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let\u2019s talk about...CLINTON: ... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...SANDERS: ... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk. I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who\u2019s not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... And special interests. I am enormously proud. Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece. That is what the political revolution means.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire. But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?SANDERS: Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn\u2019t accurate. In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points. I came in second. It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat. In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me. And it is true...(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: It is true, it\u2019s not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress. People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent. That is true.But on the other hand, I have \u2014 when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats. In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course. And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I\u2019m very proud of. And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.I am running for president as a Democrat. And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn\u2019t exist now. And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I\u2019m very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials. Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator. I really appreciate that.And I think it\u2019s because they\u2019ve worked with me, they\u2019ve seen what I do. They know what kind of a colleague I am. They want me as their partner in the White House. And that\u2019s exactly what I will do.We\u2019ll get things done together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, we\u2019re going to make progress together when I\u2019m president.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats. She\u2019s implying that that says something about the people who know you best.SANDERS: Well, I don\u2019t see it quite like that.MADDOW: How do you see it?SANDERS: I am \u2014 will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House. She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her. That\u2019s a fact. I don\u2019t deny it.But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece. That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out. That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment. I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.MADDOW: Secretary.CLINTON: Well, look, I\u2019ve got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment. And I\u2019ve got to tell you that it is... (APPLAUSE)CLINTON: It is really quite amusing to me.People support me because they know me. They know my life\u2019s work. They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders. And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: I am not going to make promises I can\u2019t keep. I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.CLINTON: A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.I\u2019m not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don\u2019t want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead. That is not my agenda.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you\u2019ll have 30 seconds to respond to that.SANDERS: What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one\u2019s life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.CLINTON: Yeah, but I \u2014 I think it\u2019s fair to really ask what\u2019s behind that comment. You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign. I\u2019ve tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to \u2014 you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.And I just absolutely reject that, Senator. And I really don\u2019t think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you. And enough is enough. If you\u2019ve got something to say, say it directly.But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.SANDERS: What...(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I\u2019m very proud of that.SANDERS: ... you know...CLINTON: So I think it\u2019s time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...SANDERS: (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: ... in recent weeks, and let\u2019s talk...(BOOING)... let\u2019s talk about about the issues. Let\u2019s talk about the issues that divide us.SANDERS: Let\u2019s talk about \u2014 OK, let\u2019s talk...CLINTON: And let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s...SANDERS: ... let us talk about issues.CLINTON: ... we both agree with campaign finance reform.SANDERS: Let\u2019s talk about issues.CLINTON: I \u2014 I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.SANDERS: Let\u2019s...CLINTON: I want to reverse Citizens United.SANDERS: ... let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s talk about issues.CLINTON: And so \u2014 let\u2019s talk about issues.SANDERS: Let\u2019s talk \u2014 let\u2019s talk about issues, all right? Let\u2019s talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated. Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided \u2014 spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.(LAUGHTER)Let\u2019s ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there\u2019s nothing that the government can do to stop it.You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry? Let\u2019s talk about climate change.Do you think there\u2019s a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?That is what goes on in America. I am not \u2014 I like...(APPLAUSE)... there is a reason. You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system. And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.CLINTON: Well, you know, Senator, I don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t...(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: ... Secretary, we\u2019re gonna...CLINTON: ... I don\u2019t think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.And I\u2019m proud of that. You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance. CLINTON: Today, you\u2019ve got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you. I know this game. I\u2019m going to stop this game.But while we\u2019re talking about votes, you\u2019re the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.So I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives. People make mistakes and I\u2019m certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage. What we\u2019ve got to do as Democrats \u2014 what we\u2019ve got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems. And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.That\u2019s what this election should be about.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thirty seconds.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder. I was on the House Financial Committee at that time. I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans \u2014 Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan \u2014 about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.Go to YouTube today. Look up Greenspan-Sanders. Listen to what I told them then. I helped lead the effort against deregulation. Unfortunately, we lost that. The result is \u2014 was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.TODD: Thank you both.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we\u2019ve touched a nerve. We\u2019re going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this. Stay with us.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, welcome back. Let\u2019s get right to it.Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform. You rail against big money in politics. But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is \u2014 it is in place to run for president. Why aren\u2019t you walking the walk on that?Why aren\u2019t you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?SANDERS: Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster. The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well. But in terms of the early states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t work.Your point is well taken. I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely. But this system is \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the secretary would agree \u2014 is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.TODD: Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got \u2014 and all this when it is \u2014 you know, that\u2019s the system? I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing \u2014 public financing system...SANDERS: But if the...TODD: ... and being able to set \u2014 being able to set an example.SANDERS: \u2014 but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated. It no longer works. Nobody can become president based on that system. So what\u2019s the alternative? There are two alternatives. And, you know, we looked at it. Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don\u2019t represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn\u2019t want it.So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign. And you know what? We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece. I think that\u2019s pretty good.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...CLINTON: On the issue of Wall Street.MADDOW: ... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that\u2019s what they offered.Have you been too dismissive of voters\u2019 concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?CLINTON: Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record. You know, I did \u2014 when I left the secretary of State\u2019s office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit. I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street. They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash. I was the one saying you\u2019re going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages. I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy. I proposed changes in CEO compensation.I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created. And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary. They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads. Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.And why are they doing that? These are guys who try to make smart investments. They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it. And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.So I do want people to know that, and I think it\u2019s important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street. What about her defense of her record? SANDERS: Let me just say this. Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country. You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans. But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about. These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record. A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record. That is what power is about. That is what corruption is about. And that is what has to change in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change. It has to change. And that\u2019s why I have put forward a plan to do just that. And it\u2019s been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.I have great respect for Senator Sanders\u2019s commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall. But I do not believe that that is enough. And in fact, I don\u2019t believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks. And I\u2019ve said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk. But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.So let\u2019s not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem. We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed. My plan takes us further and it would do the job.(CROSSTALK)(APPLAUSE) SANDERS: I would say that \u2014 that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it\u2019s Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation. And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were \u2014 significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.And that is what I believe and many economists believe. Time to break them up.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Look we have a law \u2014 look, you know, I \u2014 I appreciate the senator\u2019s advocacy. We have a law. It was passed. It was signed by President Obama. It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he\u2019s a responsible president. So we have a law in place. If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it. And from what you say, I know you will as well.But that is not enough. And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me \u2014 the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys \u2014 is because I\u2019ve got their number on all of that. And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.You know, we can\u2019t just fight the last war. We\u2019ve got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans. And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: ... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.SANDERS: Well, we\u2019ve had a number of economists supporting our legislation. And here\u2019s where we are. The American people can judge. Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.SANDERS: That is a lot of money. They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they\u2019re ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.That is a lot of power for six financial institutions. That\u2019s it. I think it is too much power. Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.TODD: Thank you both. Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.Secretary Clinton, it\u2019s addressed to you, and it\u2019s about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs. This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.\u201cI am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money,\u201d and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, \u201cDon\u2019t you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?\u201dBut, let\u2019s make that bigger. Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches? We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches. In full disclosure, would you release all of them?CLINTON: I will look into it. I don\u2019t know the status, but I will certainly look into it. But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs. I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.My view on this is look at my record. Look at what I am proposing, and \u2014 we have a vigorous agreement here. We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street. I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people\u2019s health. Now, if all we\u2019re going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we\u2019re missing the big oil companies. We\u2019re missing other big energy companies. We\u2019re missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.TODD: Senator, you sound like you want to respond. Go ahead.SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak. Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power. That\u2019s a fact.And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people. In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud. It\u2019s fraud. I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don\u2019t start breaking them up, we\u2019re going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...CLINTON: ... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen. I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again. We have no disagreement about this. But, I think it\u2019s a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people. And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they\u2019ve beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I\u2019ve been in the arena with them time and time again.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system. You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart. But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans. That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business. The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you\u2019ve approached them in this campaign?SANDERS: Of course I can work with them, but let\u2019s be clear. When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage. I suspect the secretary agrees request me.Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they\u2019re paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year? Zero. Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we\u2019re going to do? We\u2019re going to end that loophole. They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.We\u2019re going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.Can I work with corporations? Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development? Absolutely they are. And we should be proud of them.But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that\u2019s what I will do.I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you.And with that, we\u2019re going to take a break.TODD: We\u2019ll be right back. And we\u2019re going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back \u2014 welcome back to the Democratic candidates\u2019 debate. We\u2019re going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.And Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re going to start with you. There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS. It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America\u2019s military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that\u2019s fighting ISIS right now?CLINTON: Well, I think what the president understands, and what he\u2019s trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.I agree with the president. I\u2019ve said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq \u2014 that is off the table.But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they\u2019re doing the fighting. We\u2019re doing the support and enabling.And I also think we\u2019ve got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.So as I look at what the president it doing, it adds up to me. We just have to keep \u2014 try to get more support for those people on the ground in Syria and Iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back. MADDOW: To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you\u2019re describing requires considerably more of Americans \u2014 an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?CLINTON: No. I mean, of course that\u2019s a theoretical question, and we don\u2019t know what it would be for, and we don\u2019t know how many numbers there are. I am against American combat troops being in Syria and Iraq.I support special forces. I support trainers. I support the air campaign. And I think we\u2019re making some progress. I want to continue to intensify that, and that\u2019s exactly what the president is doing.MADDOW: Thank you, Madam Secretary.TODD: Go ahead, Senator Sanders \u2014 30 seconds, your response.SANDERS: OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.TODD: All right. Senator, I want to stay, though...CLINTON: If I could \u2014 if I could...TODD: Go ahead. 30 seconds.CLINTON: ... respectfully add \u2014 look, we did differ. A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS. We have to look at the threats that we face right now...(APPLAUSE)... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.TODD: Let me \u2014 let \u2014 we\u2019re gonna \u2014 we\u2019re staying \u2014 we\u2019re staying basically on this topic. Obviously you\u2019ve been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan. How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?SANDERS: Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq. And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn\u2019t happen.I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen \u2014 and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said. I think he hit the nail on the head. SANDERS: And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam. And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers \u2014 U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate. But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, \u201cLook, we\u2019re taking on those terrible Americans.\u201dThe combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support. We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.TODD: Can you address a question on Afghanistan?(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: How long are these troops going to be there? If President Obama leaves you 10,000 troops, how long do you think they\u2019re going to be there?SANDERS: Well, you can\u2019t simply withdraw tomorrow. Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country. But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi. ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.Hopefully, and you know, one can\u2019t predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.TODD: Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan? We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.CLINTON: Oh, absolutely. The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan. We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top \u2014 his top partner, Abdullah. And they are doing their very best. And the Afghan army is actually fighting. The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need. Because it\u2019s not just the Taliban. We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.So, we\u2019ve got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it. And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.TODD: You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are. You haven\u2019t given a major foreign policy speech. And it doesn\u2019t sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you\u2019re asked about it, and you say you\u2019re going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet. Why?SANDERS: Well, that\u2019s not quite accurate. I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn\u2019t get much attention. So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq. And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone. We cannot be the policeman of the world. We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense. We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders\u2019s views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel. Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can\u2019t stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.CLINTON: So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief. And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.TODD: All right, Senator, 30 seconds.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience \u2014 hat is not arguable \u2014 in foreign affairs. But experience is not the only point, judgment is. And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn\u2019t.In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other. That\u2019s no great secret. But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.CLINTON: Well, let me just add that, you know, I\u2019ve said this before and I\u2019m very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State. And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.Because I know from my own experience that you\u2019ve got to be ready on day one. There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I\u2019ll get to that when I can. That is just not an acceptable approach.SANDERS: Well...MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, at the \u2014 at the last Democratic debate in Charleston \u2014 I want to get specific here \u2014 Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran. Your campaign has criticized him for saying that. Now that he\u2019s standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn\u2019t try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?CLINTON: Absolutely. You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions. I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.I\u2019m very pleased we got that nuclear agreement. It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program. We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it. But that is not our only problem with Iran. We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.They are destabilizing governments in the region. They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel. A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard. I\u2019m prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior. The president doesn\u2019t think we should. I certainly don\u2019t think we should. I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.SANDERS: Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow? I never said that. I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.And you\u2019re right. They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that. But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea. They\u2019re Communists, they are our enemy. Well guess what? Change has come.So please don\u2019t suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow. We don\u2019t. But I would like to see us move forward, and hopefully some day that will happen. And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary \u2014 and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong. When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies. I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: Well Senator, let me just correct the record if I can. You know \u2014 let me correct the record.(CROSSTALK)TODD: 30 seconds, madam secretary.CLINTON: As I \u2014 as I certainly recall, the question was to meet with without conditions. And you\u2019re right, I was against that. I was against it then I would be against it now.SANDERS: OK.CLINTON: Part of diplomacy, the hard work of diplomacy is trying to extract whatever concessions you can get, and giving something the other side wants. Of course you\u2019ve got to try to make peace with, and work with those who are your adversaries, but you don\u2019t just rush in, open the door, and say, \u201cHere I am. Let\u2019s talk and make a deal.\u201dThat\u2019s not the way it works.SANDERS: I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions. But, of course it doesn\u2019t do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...CLINTON: ... Well, we set conditions on Iran. We worked hard to get them established, and to be enforced, and then we talked. That\u2019s exactly the right...(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: ... And, that\u2019s what I did with the President, so he and I are on the very same page.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Just to set the record straight, I very strongly supported the agreement which makes certain that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.TODD: Alright, as Commander in Chief, Senator Sanders, you\u2019ve got to prioritize potential threats to the United States. Three countries, North Korea, Iran, Russia. How would you rank them in order of their threat to America\u2019s security right now...SANDERS: ... ISIS...TODD: ... Starting with the biggest threat.SANDERS: ISIS, you forgot one...TODD: ... I didn\u2019t say that...SANDERS: ... No, no...TODD: ... No...SANDERS: ... ISIS would be ...TODD: ... We already had that. I\u2019m talking about these three countries. How would you orient our national security, our national defense posture.SANDERS: Clearly North Korea is a very strange situation because it is such an isolated country run by a handful of dictators, or maybe just one, who seems to be somewhat paranoid. And, who had nuclear weapons.And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure. China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China. I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.I think, clearly, we got to work closely with China to resolve the serious problems we have, and I worry about Putin and his military adventurism in the Crimea and the Ukraine.TODD: Secretary of Defense Ash Carter this week picked one of those three, and he has said Russia is, basically, the most important national security threat. Sort of reorienting the defense and the challenges to that. Do you agree with his decisions...The New York Times will be checking assertions made throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.SANDERS: ... No, I don\u2019t. I worry very, very much about an isolated country. That\u2019s what makes me nervous. Russia lives in the world. China lives in the world. North Korea is a very, very strange country because it is so isolated, and I do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons, they have got to be dealt with. Dealt with effectively.TODD: Secretary Clinton, what do you think of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. He\u2019s basically putting Russia above Iran, above North Korea, as sort of the chief national security challenge right now.CLINTON: I haven\u2019t talked to Secretary Carter, but here\u2019s what I would think he\u2019s planning. We do have the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, that\u2019s an enforcement consequence, action for action, follow on. We have a plan, we will watch them, we will be vigilant.We do have to worry about North Korea. They continue to develop their nuclear weapons capability, and they\u2019re working very hard on their ballistic missile capability.And, I know that some of those plans could very well lead to a missile that might reach Hawaii, if not the West Coast. We do have to try to get the countries in the region to work with us to do everything we can to confine, and constrain them.But, what Secretary Carter is looking at is the constant pressure that Russia\u2019s putting on our European allies. The way that Russia is trying to move the boundaries of the post-World War II Europe. The way that he is trying to set European countries against one another, seizing territory, holding it in Crimea. Beginning to explore whether they could make some inroads in the Baltics.We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East. They have a naval base, they have an air base in Syria. They want to hang on to that. I think what Secretary Carter is seeing, and I\u2019m glad he is, is that we got to get NATO back working for the common defense. We\u2019ve got to do more to support our partners in NATO, and we have to send a very clear message to Putin that this kind of belligerence, that this kind of testing of boundaries will have to be responded to. The best way to do that is to put more armor in, put more money from the Europeans in so they\u2019re actually contributing more to their own defense.TODD: Thank you both, Rachel?MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, I want to ask you about a national security issue that is closer to home. There are thousands of veterans, over 100,000 veterans living in the state of New Hampshire.If either one of you is nominated as the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, you will likely face a Republican opponent in the general election who wants to privatize or even abolish big parts of the V.A. It\u2019s a newly popular idea in conservative politics.How will you win the argument on that issue given the problems that have been exposed at the V.A. in the last few years? What\u2019s your argument that the V.A. should still exist and should not be privatized?CLINTON: Well, first of all, I\u2019m absolutely against privatizing the V.A. And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what\u2019s wrong with the V.A.There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.But you\u2019re absolutely right, you know, Rachel, this is another part of the Koch brothers agenda. They\u2019ve actually formed an organization to try to begin to convince Americans we should no longer have guaranteed health care, specialized care for our veterans.I will fight that as hard as I can. I think there\u2019s where we can enlist the veterans service organizations, the veterans of America, because, yes, let\u2019s fix the V.A., but we will never let it be privatized, and that is a promise.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you, as a congressional leader on veterans issues and the Veterans Committee, you\u2019ve worked in a very bipartisan way with Senator John McCain and others on veterans issues. Is the right contour of the fight, the way she\u2019s talking about this issue?SANDERS: Let me agree. You know, as the secretary knows, I chaired \u2014 I had the privilege and the honor of chairing the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs. And it is interesting to me, you know, Republicans give a lot of speeches about how much they love veterans. I work with the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the Vietnam Vets, and virtually every veterans organization to put together the most comprehensive piece of the veterans legislation in the modern history of America. That\u2019s what I did.And I brought it to the floor of the Senate. Every Democrat voted for it, I got two Republicans. We ended up with 56 votes and I couldn\u2019t get the 60 votes that I needed. That is pathetic.This was legislation supported by all of the veterans organizations, addressing many of the serious problems that veterans face in health care and in how we deliver benefits to them.So Republicans talk a good game about veterans, but when it came to put money on the line to protect our veterans, frankly, they were not there.What I did next, Rachel, is I had to retreat a little bit, I had to compromise. I did work with John McCain. I did work with Jeff Miller over in the House. And we put together not the bill that I wanted, but probably the most comprehensive V.A. health care bill in the modern history of this country.Secretary Clinton is absolutely right, there are people, Koch brothers among others, who have a group called Concerned Veterans of America, funded by the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers, by the way, want to destroy Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, every governmental program passed since the 1930s. Yes, there are people out there who want to privatize it.The last point that I\u2019d make. I had a hearing. I had all of the veterans groups in front of me. And I said to them, tell me when a veteran gets in to the V.A., understanding there are waiting lines and real problems, when a veteran gets into the system, is the quality of care good?Without exception, what they said, good, excellent, very good. We\u2019ve got to strengthen the V.A. We do not privatize the V.A.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, we\u2019re going to take another break. We\u2019ll be talking about Social Security and some of those other issues when we come back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: And we are back. We\u2019re gonna get into a little bit of election politics, electability, in a little bit.Senator Sanders, The Iowa Democratic Party has declared Hillary Clinton the winner of Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses \u2014 narrowest of margins. Today, the Des Moines Register has an editorial that calls for the audit of the results, saying, quote, \u201cwhat happened Monday night at the Democratic caucuses was a debacle, period. The results were too close not to do a complete audit.\u201dSenator Sanders, do you accept the idea that Hillary Clinton won Iowa? And do you \u2014 or do you believe the caucuses are still an open question?SANDERS: Well, I agree with the Des Moines Register, but let\u2019s not blow this out of proportion. This is not a \u2014 this is not, like, a winner-take-all thing.I think where we now stand \u2014 correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 you have 22 delegates, I have 20 delegates. We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.(LAUGHTER)You know, so this is not \u2014 this is not the biggest deal in the world. We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.What the Des Moines Register said \u2014 you know, there were coin \u2014 I think there were half a dozen coin flips \u2014 a fairly chaotic type situation. At the end of the day, no matter how it\u2019s recounted, it will break roughly even.And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa. See, and I don\u2019t have to say it, because they voted already.(LAUGHTER)And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven\u2019t voted, but...(APPLAUSE)... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion. But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.TODD: Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if that\u2019s what the party wants to do? You good with that?CLINTON: Whatever they decide to do, that\u2019s fine.TODD: That\u2019s fair enough. OK.CLINTON: All right.TODD: Good, we move on. We\u2019re happy with that. We have more questions.MADDOW: Senator \u2014 Senator Sanders, in 1964...SANDERS: Oh (inaudible).(LAUGHTER)See, when you are old, then they go back all these years. All right. What have you got?MADDOW: In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement. He was, however, far to the right of most of that party. In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party\u2019s mainstream.Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election. Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election. And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now. We know that. But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you\u2019re running right now to try to get the nomination?SANDERS: Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process. But let me just say this. In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire. For example, the last poll I saw \u2014 there may have been a new one \u2014 last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one. There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.These are polls. Polls go up. Polls go down. But here\u2019s why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate. Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression. I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate. We win governors\u2019 chairs up and down the line. So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House. With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?CLINTON: I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.(APPLAUSE)And I say that with great \u2014 with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running. I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign. I hope that I will be able to earn their support. They may not support me now, but I support them and we\u2019ll work together.But what I\u2019m concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election. And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight. I\u2019ve been vetted. There\u2019s hardly anything you don\u2019t know about me. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job. I think I\u2019m the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans. And I think that at the end of the day, it\u2019s not so much electability. It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m prepared to...(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)TODD: We\u2019ll stay on this issue. We\u2019ll stay on this topic.TODD: Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders\u2019 ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they\u2019re worried about the emails issue, not because they don\u2019t believe your explanation, but because it\u2019s a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.They see your numbers right now and they think it\u2019s the email issue as to why you\u2019re not polling very well. So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn\u2019t going to blow up your candidacy if you\u2019re the nominee?CLINTON: Absolutely I can. You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that. And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions. They basically said yeah, didn\u2019t get her. We tried. That was all a political ploy.Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts. and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice\u2019s aide they\u2019ve been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material. They are retroactively classifying it.I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity. And so I think the American people will know it\u2019s an absurdity. I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open \u2014 there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material. Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?CLINTON: I am 100 percent confident. This is a security review that was requested. It is being carried out. It will be resolved. But I have to add if there\u2019s going to be a security review about me, there\u2019s going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we\u2019ve got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.Honest to goodness, this is \u2014 this just beggars the imagination. So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of what\u2019s really going on here, and I hope that will happen.TODD: Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn\u2019t give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible).SANDERS: (OFF-MIKE)TODD: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m trying to \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a family hour still right now. After 11:00, I\u2019ll say it the other way. And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she\u2019s getting slapped with the email controversy.Are you \u2014 how are you feeling about these darn emails now?SANDERS: I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate. There\u2019s a process under way. I will not politicize it.TODD: OK. Senator Sanders, thank you.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: And by the way \u2014 and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn\u2019t know that there\u2019s not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign. You apologized for that when the incident was made public.Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece. Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?SANDERS: Not losing control of our campaign. You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper. Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did. So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not. What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.MADDOW: Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.SANDERS: But that was only for \u2014 that was not to be on television. That\u2019s an important point. That was just something \u2014 as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue? CLINTON: No.MADDOW: And with that, we will (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MADDOW: Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates\u2019 debate.Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer. It\u2019s a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide. Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?CLINTON: Yes, I do. And \u2014 you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism. I have strong feelings about that. I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it. If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.MADDOW: Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton\u2019s support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...SANDERS: ... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are \u2014 all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes. It\u2019s hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty. That\u2019s number one. We have to be very careful about making sure about that.But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there. But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don\u2019t believe that government itself should be part of the killing. So, when somebody commits...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key. They\u2019re never going to get out. But, I just don\u2019t\u2019 want to see government be part of killing. That\u2019s all. (APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states. I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan. On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it. You have both been outspoken on that.The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it. There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today. Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today. If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?CLINTON: Absolutely. Absolutely. You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before. I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall. I will be in Flint at the Mayor\u2019s invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.This is an emergency. Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child\u2019s life. I know from the work that I\u2019ve done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient. We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring. That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan. If Michigan won\u2019t do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.(APPLAUSE)MADDOW: Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing? President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?SANDERS: Absolutely. I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.SANDERS: You know, I don\u2019t go around asking for governor\u2019s resignations every day. In fact, I think I never have in my life. But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: ... was so outrageous.What we are talking about are children being poisoned. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. We don\u2019t know, no one knows for sure because they haven\u2019t done the appropriate studies, but there\u2019s no question that kids\u2019 intellectual development may have been impacted. We don\u2019t know how many thousands.The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension. And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.And of course the federal government says, you\u2019re not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.Last point on this. And I suspect the secretary agrees. One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.(APPLAUSE)SANDERS: Flint, Michigan, is a poor community. It is disproportionately African-American and minority. And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.MADDOW: Senator, thank you.TODD: Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade. In the \u201990s you supported NAFTA. But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008. As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then \u2014 which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.If elected, should Democrats expect that once you\u2019re in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?CLINTON: You know, Chuck, I\u2019ve only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator. And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements. And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration. Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.Now I have a very clear view about this. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. That\u2019s the way the global economy works.But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy. So it\u2019s not just what\u2019s in the trade agreement that I\u2019m interested in.I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea. We go the UAW on board because of changes we made. So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.TODD: Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you\u2019ve been in Congress.SANDERS: Absolutely right.TODD: But if you do that as president...(APPLAUSE)TODD: If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?SANDERS: Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.I was not only in opposition to NAFTA \u2014 and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements. I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood \u2014 I don\u2019t think this is really rocket science.We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created. I didn\u2019t believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it\u2019s to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.I don\u2019t want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour. I don\u2019t want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.SANDERS: So, do I believe in trade? Of course, I believe in trade. But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, \u201cHey, you don\u2019t want to take a cut in pay? We\u2019re going to China.\u201dWorkers today are working longer hours for lower wages. Trade is one of the reasons for that.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Thank you both.We\u2019re going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we\u2019ll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing. We\u2019ll be right back.(APPLAUSE)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right. Welcome back here in the final minutes.MADDOW: The home stretch.TODD: The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question. Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half. You\u2019re going to have to make choices. And there\u2019s a lot of heavy lifts. And he made choices. He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform. Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn\u2019t.TODD: So there are three big lifts that you\u2019ve talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change. What do you do first? Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.CLINTON: Well, I \u2014 I don\u2019t accept that premise, Chuck. I think that we\u2019ve got so much business we have to do. We\u2019ve talked a lot tonight about what we\u2019re against \u2014 we\u2019re against income inequality. We\u2019re against the abuses of powerful interests. We\u2019re against a lot of things.I\u2019m for a lot of things. I don\u2019t want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening. And I believe, if I\u2019m so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.(APPLAUSE)I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years. I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.(APPLAUSE)Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we\u2019re not creating and growing small businesses. I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces \u2014 because that\u2019s the way Congress is set up. You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure \u2014 we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.TODD: All right, but Senator Sanders...(APPLAUSE)... you\u2019ve still got to do something first. As you know, history said \u2014 shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.SANDERS: No, let...TODD: Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.SANDERS: ... I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows. All right? We got to do that.(APPLAUSE)But you miss \u2014 when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important. And that is you\u2019re not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.(APPLAUSE)So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families. So let me be very clear. No nominee of mine, if I\u2019m elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.(APPLAUSE)Second point \u2014 second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country \u2014 largely African-American and Latino \u2014 the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.No, you just can\u2019t negotiate with Mitch McConnell. Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, \u201cMitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.\u201dAnd as president, that\u2019s what I will work hard on.(APPLAUSE)TODD: OK. Thank you.MADDOW: Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government \u2014 which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president. The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops \u2014 is \u2014 is there a department of government that you would get rid of? Or is there a whole new one that you would create?CLINTON: The answer to both of those is no. I\u2019m interested in making what we have work better. I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant. I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn\u2019t work, and be absolutely clear we\u2019re getting rid of what doesn\u2019t work.I have had the opportunity to run a big agency. I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better \u2014 better than anybody had run it in a long time. So I have an idea of what it\u2019s going to take to make our government work more efficiently.And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it\u2019s not appropriate to say \u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of this, get rid of that\u201d until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do. CLINTON: But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it\u2019s the greatest work that Americans will be called to do. And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it. We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry. So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get done, here\u2019s why I need your help, here\u2019s why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn\u2019t something you care about, but I\u2019m telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows \u2014MADDOW: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.CLINTON: \u2014 it will actually raise wages. You have to make all those connections so that you\u2019ve got people with you every step of the way. That\u2019s what I want to do.MADDOW: Thank you very much. Thank you.(APPLAUSE)TODD: All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these. Secretary Clinton, you\u2019ve made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see \u2014CLINTON: I never said that.TODD: But do you see \u2014 do you see a vice president?(LAUGHTER)CLINTON: Look \u2014TODD: Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?CLINTON: Well, I\u2019m certainly going to unite the party, but I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not getting ahead of myself. I think that would be a little bit presumptuous. If I\u2019m so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Senator, would you consider the secretary?SANDERS: I agree with what the secretary said. We shouldn\u2019t be getting ahead of ourselves. And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand. I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it\u2019s mutual. And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.(APPLAUSE)CLINTON: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.(CROSSTALK)TODD: Secretary Clinton, closing statements. You are first.CLINTON: Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary. I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I\u2019m asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.You know, we didn\u2019t get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities. Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders\u2019 supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we\u2019ve got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Senator Sanders.SANDERS: I \u2014 my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. Didn\u2019t have any money, couldn\u2019t speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money. But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee health care to all people, that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid family and medical leave. We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth. We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.I\u2019m running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics. I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.Thank you all.(APPLAUSE)TODD: Well, there you have it. I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just don\u2019t have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I don\u2019t think so.Our debate coverage \u2014 (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.MADDOW: We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire. You guys get to vote in just five days. I can\u2019t wait to see how it turns out. Don\u2019t screw up.TODD: We\u2019ll see you in a few minutes. Thank you.MADDOW: Thank you.(APPLAUSE)ENDAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Plans Visit to Cuba, as Talks on Expanding Trade Begin", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will travel to Cuba within weeks, a senior administration official said on Wednesday, making a historic visit as part of an effort to end more than a half-century of estrangement and forge normalized relations with a Cold War adversary.The administration will announce the trip \u2014 the first by a sitting president in 88 years, when Calvin Coolidge visited \u2014 on Thursday as top Commerce, Treasury and State Department officials are meeting privately with their Cuban counterparts in Washington for talks aimed at expanding business ties between the two nations.Opening the discussions on Wednesday, Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary, called on the government of Cuba to open its economy to American business and investment, saying the Cubans must do more to help facilitate commerce after the thaw between the two nations.Ms. Pritzker said her department had acted aggressively since Mr. Obama\u2019s December 2014 announcement to pave the way for American companies to do business in Cuba, granting 490 authorizations amounting to $4.3 billion last year alone \u2014 a roughly 30 percent increase over the previous year.\u201cBut we need help from the Cuban side,\u201d Ms. Pritzker said. \u201cThe U.S. companies that are attempting to do business in your country continue to face challenges.\u201dShe added: \u201cWithout specific changes on your side that allow the private sector to engage, our changes will not unlock the opportunities for the Cuban people that both of us want to see.\u201dTha talks, which began in a wood-paneled library at the Commerce Department within view of the White House, represent the latest effort by the Obama administration to push forward with the policy shift the president set in motion just over a year ago. But the process is vastly complicated by the American statutory trade and commercial embargo that has been in place for decades and that only Congress can lift.While the Commerce and Treasury Departments have moved several times to loosen restrictions on travel and trade, Rodrigo Malmierca, the foreign trade and investment minister of Cuba, said the onus was on the United States to remove the embargo, and on Mr. Obama to essentially defang the laws that compose it in the meantime.\u201cThese measures have been positive and are in the right direction, but still they are not sufficient in terms of the lifting of the main obstacle that we still confront that is the blockade,\u201d Mr. Malmierca, who was seated opposite Ms. Pritzker as the talks began, said in Spanish through a translator. \u201cWe are aware of the fact that the blockade can only be fully lifted with the actions in Congress,\u201d he added, but, \u201cwe know that the executive has prerogatives which can be used in terms of the dismantling, trying to void the blockade.\u201dAmerican carriers can begin applying to the Department of Transportation to offer the service \u2014 up to 20 scheduled flights a day to Havana and 10 to each of nine other international airports in Cuba. The pact aims to substantially increase travel between the two countries, which are currently served by only about a dozen charter flights a day.But even as Mr. Obama makes progress in his drive to forge closer commercial ties with Cuba, the process is hamstrung by sanctions that have left American businesses wondering what they are permitted to do. Mr. Malmierca said on Tuesday that he had heard from many American companies that want to establish businesses in Cuba but are ensnared in regulatory limbo, awaiting special licenses from the United States government.\u201cThe problem that we face today is that many companies want to do business, but we need to create the conditions for them to access the Cuban market,\u201d Mr. Malmierca said at an event hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.He repeatedly said that Cuba welcomed American investment and would not \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against United States companies. \u201cLifting the blockade is essential to advancing this,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, Mr. Malmierca called on Mr. Obama to do more unilaterally, including allowing the dollar to be used in transactions with Cuba. On Tuesday, he said the president should lift the ban against imports of top Cuban products like rum and cigars and end the prohibition against direct investment in Cuba.Critics argue that with each move to foster better relations and American investment, the president is rewarding a dictatorial government that infringes on human rights and squelches democratic discourse.Advertisement"}

He stressed that he did not have a \u201csuper PAC\u201d as she does and that Mrs. Clinton supported several trade policies that he believes led to millions of people losing their jobs. He also chastised her admiration for Mr. Kissinger.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe looked to Henry Kissinger as one of her mentors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said, as the crowd booed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not look to Henry Kissinger for guidance. In fact, Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Sanders, delivering a stump speech for about 40 minutes, also said that if elected he would change campaign finance laws, devote resources to fighting climate change and work on combating institutional racism. He added that he would push back against laws that in his view suppress voter rights. And he pledged to increase wages and give people access to tuition-free public colleges and universities.The senator also talked about providing more resources to American Indians. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe owe Native Americans so, so much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Sanders said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot continue current policies which are so devastating to the Native-American community.

{"Headline": "Ted Cruz, a Public Firebrand on Social Issues, Is Cooler When Wooing Donors", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byBut seven months later, when Mr. Cruz visited the Midtown Manhattan office of a major Republican supporter of same-sex marriage, he sounded almost indifferent: If New York politicians wanted to legalize it, that was their business, he told Paul Singer, the billionaire investor who had bankrolled efforts to strike down laws forbidding same-sex marriage across the country. There was no reason the issue had to drive a wedge between the two men, the Texas senator said, according to a person briefed on the meeting who supports one of Mr. Cruz\u2019s opponents. (Mr. Singer went on to endorse Senator Marco Rubio of Florida a year later.)Mr. Cruz would hardly be the only person to modulate his most provocative language when speaking to people whose support he is courting. But Mr. Cruz, the winner of the Iowa caucuses, has worked harder than any Republican running for president to portray himself as the true and pure conservative and to impugn his rivals as not faithful enough in their conservatism.Now, as he finds himself locked in an intense struggle for the support of the party\u2019s top donors, instances in which he curried favor, or merely associated, with people who do not share his views on some contentious issues are being dredged up and shared by people who believe that Mr. Cruz has been disingenuous, especially in his solicitation of money from people he has coolly dismissed as having \u201cNew York values.\u201dIn interviews, donors and activists do not suggest that Mr. Cruz has contradicted himself. But they say that, in contrast to his aggressive public persona, he places a distinctly softer emphasis on some of his most stridently conservative views when privately addressing people who might find them offensive.On immigration, for example, Mr. Cruz has come under fire for reversing himself on expanding the H1B visa pool for highly skilled workers, a program viewed skeptically by conservatives. He now opposes it, citing abuses of the program. But in advocating for the program in 2013, he sought support not just from policy experts but from donors with an interest in the subject.After the Iowa caucuses, the paths to the nomination diverge for the three leading candidates.That June, Mr. Cruz\u2019s spokesman, Sean Rushton, wrote to an aide to Joe Lonsdale, a venture investor, attaching a draft op-ed by Mr. Cruz explaining his support for an increase in the visas, which was favored by many in the tech industry, including Mr. Lonsdale. The email invited Mr. Lonsdale to propose edits to the article if he saw fit. (The op-ed does not appear to have run.)Mr. Cruz\u2019s spokesman, Rick Tyler, said his positions were consistent, adding, \u201cWe give donors an opportunity to sign on with Cruz, not the other way around.\u201dIn interviews, people who have seen Mr. Cruz speak privately said he was able to switch back and forth with ease between his crusading public persona and a softer and less confrontational tone.Mr. Perkins, the evangelical leader, who endorsed Mr. Cruz this week, said that there was nothing unusual about this. \u201cYou find a point of commonality,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not for the other issues.\u201d Mr. Cruz, he added, was sincere in his beliefs. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him speak out of both sides of his mouth.\u201dRobert O\u2019Brien, a Los Angeles lawyer who supported Mitt Romney in 2012 and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin before he dropped out, gathered more than a dozen former Romney supporters to meet Mr. Cruz in December 2014. \u201cI found his positions to be solid conservative Ronald Reagan-type positions,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Brien, saying Mr. Cruz, whom he found charming, focused primarily on national security. \u201cI didn\u2019t find them to be kind of the caricature that came out of him in the Senate,\u201d he said. But he said he did not hear any contradictions with Mr. Cruz\u2019s public pronouncements.Despite his public denunciations of political opponents and firebrand views on social issues, Mr. Cruz has a long history with some of the party\u2019s prominent donors who hold more liberal views on social issues.In his 30s, when he was a lawyer mulling his next move, Mr. Cruz sought out wealthy financiers who were major benefactors to gay-rights causes. His campaign for Texas attorney general in 2009 was aided with $250,000 from Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, and he persuaded Mr. Singer to donate $25,000. (Mr. Cruz withdrew when his boss at the time, Attorney General Greg Abbott, sought re-election.)Mr. Cruz continues to rely on Mr. Thiel\u2019s generosity and describes the venture capitalist, who is gay, as a close friend. He has been a guest at two lavish conferences Mr. Thiel hosts for up-and-coming conservative leaders, one in Miami Beach at the Setai, where rooms top $1,000 per night, in 2008, and another at the Reynolds Plantation in Georgia in 2009.A person who attended the Miami Beach gathering described the retreats as brainstorming sessions on the future of the American right involving people who were more centrist-minded than fire-breathing conservatives. Attendees included young Republicans who were considered rising stars at the time, including Eric Cantor, who would become House majority leader, and Aaron Schock, the former Illinois congressman who would later resign amid revelations of campaign finance impropriety.Mr. Thiel was also a major supporter of Mr. Cruz\u2019s 2012 Senate campaign, giving $2 million to the Club for Growth, which in turn spent heavily on Mr. Cruz\u2019s behalf. And Mr. Cruz invoked their friendship at a fund-raiser last April at the home of two hoteliers whose properties cater to a gay clientele.Mr. Thiel and Mr. Singer have both supported efforts to legalize same-sex marriage for the better part of the last decade.Mr. Cruz first wooed Mr. Singer in March 2009, according to a person who reviewed Mr. Singer\u2019s calendar but insisted on anonymity to disclose details from it. Over the next five years, Mr. Cruz requested at least eight more meetings with Mr. Singer in his Manhattan office, and got four.In 2012, Mr. Singer donated $100,000 to a group that helped elect Mr. Cruz to the Senate. But he was turned off by what he thought was Mr. Cruz\u2019s futile and harmful efforts that shut down the government in 2013 in protest of the Affordable Care Act.They differed most noticeably, however, on gay rights. Mr. Singer has often urged Republicans to adopt a more inclusive tone. But shortly after the Supreme Court ruling last summer that legalized same-sex marriage, Mr. Cruz told an audience of conservatives the decision was \u201cone of the greatest threats to our democracy we have seen in modern times.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nigeria\u2019s Booming Film Industry Redefines African Life", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byThis was the seventh \u2014 and last \u2014 day of shooting in a village near here for \u201cBeyond the Dance,\u201d Mr. Ugezu\u2019s story of an African prince\u2019s choice of a bride, and the production had been conducted at a breakneck pace.\u201cIn Nollywood, you don\u2019t waste time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the technical depth that has made our films so popular. It\u2019s because of the story. We tell African stories.\u201d\u201cThe Nigerian movies are very, very popular in Tanzania, and, culturally, they\u2019ve affected a lot of people,\u201d said Songa wa Songa, a Tanzanian journalist. \u201cA lot of people now speak with a Nigerian accent here very well thanks to Nollywood. Nigerians have succeeded through Nollywood to export who they are, their culture, their lifestyle, everything.\u201dNollywood generates about 2,500 movies a year, making it the second-biggest producer after Bollywood in India, and its films have displaced American, Indian and Chinese ones on the televisions that are ubiquitous in bars, hair salons, airport lounges and homes across Africa.The industry employs a million people \u2014 second only to farming \u2014 in Nigeria, pumping $600 million annually into the national economy, according to a 2014 report by the United States International Trade Commission. In 2002, it made 400 movies and $45 million.Nollywood resonates across Africa with its stories of a precolonial past and of a present caught between village life and urban modernity. The movies explore the tensions between the individual and extended families, between the draw of urban life and the pull of the village, between Christianity and traditional beliefs. For countless people, in a place long shaped by outsiders, Nollywood is redefining the African experience.\u201cI doubt that a white person, a European or American, can appreciate Nollywood movies the way an African can,\u201d said Katsuva Ngoloma, a linguist at the University of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo who has written about Nollywood\u2019s significance. \u201cBut Africans \u2014 the rich, the poor, everyone \u2014 will see themselves in those movies in one way or another.\u201dIn Yeoville, a neighborhood in Johannesburg that is a melting pot for migrants, a seamstress from Ghana took orders one recent morning for the latest fashions seen in Nollywood movies. Hairstylists from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, working in salons or on the street, offered hair weaves following the styles favored by Nollywood actresses.\u201cNigerian movies express how we live as Africans, what we experience in our everyday lives, things like witchcraft, things like fighting between mother-in-laws and daughter-in-laws,\u201d said Patience Moyo, 34, a Zimbabwean hair-braider. \u201cWhen you watch the movies, you feel it is really happening. One way or another, it will touch your life somewhere.\u201dThe name stuck \u2014 and spread. But success hasn\u2019t robbed Nollywood of its freewheeling ways: During my recent visit to a Nigerian village where a half-dozen movies were being shot, a producer came over and, on the spot, offered me the role of an evil white man who brings a vampire to Nigeria.Back in 2002, the movies were simply known as Nigeria\u2019s home videos. They were popularized at first through video cassettes traded across Africa, but now Nollywood is available on satellite and cable television channels, as well as on streaming services like iRokoTV. In 2012, in response to swelling popularity in Francophone Africa, a satellite channel called Nollywood TV began offering round-the-clock movies dubbed into French. Most Nollywood movies are in English, though some are in one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic languages.Until Nollywood\u2019s ascendance, movies made in Francophone Africa \u2014 with grants from the French government \u2014 dominated filmmaking on the continent. But these movies catered to the sensibilities of Western critics and viewers, and won few fans in Africa, leaving no cultural footprint.In Nollywood, though, movies are still financed by private investors expecting a profit.\u201cYou want to do a movie? You have the script? You look immediately for the money and you shoot,\u201d said Mahmood Ali-Balogun, a leading Nigerian filmmaker. \u201cWhen you get a grant from France or the E.U., they can dictate to you where to put your camera, the fine-tuning of your script. It\u2019s not a good model for us in Africa.\u201dMr. Ali-Balogun was speaking from his office in Surulere, Lagos, the birthplace of Nollywood. Film production has since moved to other cities, especially Asaba, an otherwise sleepy state capital in southeastern Nigeria. On any given day, a dozen crews can be found here \u2014 \u201cepic\u201d films with ancient story lines like \u201cBeyond the Dance\u201d are in the works in nearby villages, while \u201cglamour\u201d movies about modern life make the city itself their sets.Most films have budgets of about $25,000 and are shot in a week.Once completed in Asaba, the movies find their way to every corner of Africa, released in the original English, dubbed into French or African languages, and sometimes readapted, repackaged and often pirated for local audiences. Many movies are also propelled by a symbiotic relationship with Nigeria\u2019s Pentecostal Christianity, which pastors have exported throughout Africa.In the Democratic Republic of Congo, pastors who visited Nigeria years ago returned with videocassettes and showed the films in church to teach Christian lessons and attract new members, said Katrien Pype, a Belgian anthropologist at the University of Leuven who has written about the phenomenon.Today in Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, Nollywood permeates mainstream culture. Local women copy the fashion, makeup and hairstyles of the actresses; local musicians grumble at the popularity of Nigerian imports, like Don Jazzy and the P-Square twins.Nollywood has also created a model for movie production in other African nations, said Matthias Krings, a German expert on African popular culture at Johannes Gutenberg University.In Kitwe, Zambia, local filmmakers were recently making their latest movie in true Nollywood style: a family melodrama shot over 10 days, in a private home, on a $7,000 budget. Burned onto DVD, the movie will be sold in Zambia and neighboring countries.Acknowledging the influence of Nigerian cinema, the movie\u2019s producer, Morgan Mbulo, 36, said, \u201cWe can tell our own stories now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Costly Debt, Home Is Where the Deduction Is", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by2016 TaxesYou cannot turn the clock back to make yourself younger. But you may be able to turn it back to a time when it was easier to obtain certain income tax deductions.Deducting the interest on auto loans and credit card debts is no longer permitted. Yet for people who qualify, there is a way around this problem.To manage this perfectly legal trick, you need to own a house, a condominium or a co-op, and have equity in it, as well as a decent credit rating. Then you can borrow against your home and use the proceeds to pay off your other, nondeductible debt.What makes this maneuver possible is the fact that interest on home mortgages is still deductible, though only $100,000 of a mortgage or home equity loan may be deducted if it is used to pay down other debt.That $100,000 limit is embedded in tax law. The interest on a far greater amount can be deducted if the loan is used to buy, build or improve a residence. But the law lets taxpayers deduct interest on up to $100,000 in debt, secured by a mortgage, that is used for any purpose at all, according to Avery E. Neumark, a lawyer and accountant at the New York accounting firm Marks Paneth.Mr. Neumark says this strategy makes sense for many people. \u201cIf you\u2019re saddled with an 18 or 21 or 24 percent credit card and you have $30,000 or $40,000 on it, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d he said. But he cautioned that people who have amassed that much consumer debt should use a low-interest deductible loan to \u201cpay it off and then rip up the credit cards,\u201d he said.The approach will not work for some taxpayers, though. Interest on mortgage debt that is not used to finance a residence cannot be deducted by a taxpayer who is subject to the alternative minimum tax, according to Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y. (If you are subject to that tax, you can stop reading here.)The details on deductibility can be found in Internal Revenue Service Publication 936: \u201cHome Mortgage Interest Deduction.\u201dAmong those for whom the alternative minimum tax is not a barrier, people who own their homes outright could take out a mortgage for this plan. And those with significantly more equity than the balance of the current mortgage could refinance the mortgage.But even if you qualify, this tactic may not be right for you. Both a first mortgage and a refinancing carry high closing costs that may exceed the savings from the interest deduction.In that situation, a home-equity loan or line of credit probably makes more sense than refinancing, because the closing costs are much lower and may even be paid by the lender.There are two kinds of these loans, Mr. McBride explained. In a straight home equity loan, the borrower takes a fixed sum, and pays it back in equal installments, usually over 10 or 15 years.A home equity line of credit, he said, is somewhat like revolving credit, because the borrower can take some of the maximum loan allowed now, and more later. In addition, there is \u201ca lot of flexibility on repaying,\u201d he said. On some loans, the borrower pays only interest during the first 10 years, called the draw period. \u201cThen the loan converts to an installment loan amortized over 10 or 15 more years,\u201d he said, adding that some lenders require a minimum draw when the loan is taken out.That means that the payback period may be much longer than that of a car loan or credit card debt.As of Thursday, according to Mr. McBride, the average rate for a home equity line of credit was about 4.7 percent, and for a fixed-term home equity loan about 5 percent.Another possible disadvantage of a home-equity loan is the temptation to keep borrowing.One of a financial planner\u2019s worst nightmares is the person who borrows against the value of a home to pay for a vacation to Las Vegas or Bora Bora. Equity loans may be better for reducing the bite of excess borrowing in the past than for financing yet more debt.\u201cDebt, in and of itself, is not bad,\u201d said Marc J. Minker, an accountant and financial planner who is a tax partner at the accounting and business-consulting firm CBIZ MHM in New York. \u201cPrudent debt, in my view, is one of the best and most effective ways to manage personal finances.\u201dBut, he said, such debt is effective only \u201cif the people who are driving those decisions understand the consequences.\u201d\u201cPrudent\u201d means that \u201cyou try to educate everybody,\u201d he said, \u201cso that they are not piling on more and more debt and creating a terrible financial situation.\u201dLenders want to see good credit, a fair amount of equity and the income to pay off the new loan. Many home equity lenders will make loans only if the original mortgage combined with the new loan does not exceed 80 percent of the home\u2019s current value, Mr. McBride said \u2014 although, he added, \u201cin some instances lenders will go higher.\u201dWhatever is borrowed should be used to pay off existing high-rate debt, not to create new debt, Mr. Minker emphasized. He likens prudent borrowing to staying on a diet.\u201cDon\u2019t binge,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Have Deal With Second Dewey & LeBoeuf Figure", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byThe criminal case arising from the collapse of the once-prominent law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf has been cut in half, with Manhattan prosecutors agreeing to a deferred prosecution agreement with another of the four original defendants.Prosecutors announced the agreement with Zachary Warren, a 31-year-old lawyer, during a court hearing on Tuesday afternoon that came just weeks before he was to go on trial in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.Mr. Warren will be required to perform 350 hours of community service as part of the one-year agreement.The hung jury in their trial was a blow to Mr. Vance and his prosecutorial team, which had said the three men were the architects of a huge accounting fraud that enabled Dewey to defraud its lenders and creditors during much of the financial crisis.The state judge overseeing the Dewey criminal proceedings, Justice Robert M. Stolz, has indicated he may rule next week on motions by lawyers for Mr. DiCarmine, the firm\u2019s former executive director, and Mr. Sanders, its former chief financial officer, to dismiss some of the grand larceny charges still pending against them.A deferred prosecution agreement typically calls for the charges against someone to be dismissed after a period of time if that person does not violate the deal or commit other crimes.The deal with Mr. Davis was much tougher. That agreement runs for five years and Mr. Davis is not permitted to practice law in New York during that time.The agreement with Mr. Warren, who is currently working for a small law firm in Pittsburgh, does not come as a complete surprise after the hung jury and the deferred prosecution given to Mr. Davis. The decision by prosecutors to indict Mr. Warren, who was a client relations manager at the 1,300-lawyer firm, was criticized by some in the New York legal community as a heavy-handed move by Mr. Vance\u2019s office.After leaving Dewey, Mr. Warren went on to graduate from the law school of Georgetown University and clerk for a federal judge. He is to begin working as a lawyer with Williams & Connolly, a large Washington-based law firm, in the fall.\u201cWe are deeply pleased that the district attorney\u2019s office has decided to dismiss the charges,\u201d said Paul Shechtman and William Murphy, the lawyers representing Mr. Warren, in a statement.Prosecutors have said that Mr. Warren played a pivotal role in the Dewey accounting scandal because he attended a steak dinner at Del Frisco\u2019s in Midtown Manhattan in December 2008, when Mr. Sanders and Frank Canellas, the firm\u2019s former finance director, discussed ways to overcome a shortfall of more than $50 million in the firm\u2019s net income.Mr. Vance\u2019s prosecutorial team has said that at that dinner, a multiyear scheme began to make Dewey look more profitable than it was to bank lenders and insurance companies that invested in debt offerings by the law firm.Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vance, said in a statement, \u201cThe deferred prosecution agreement is unrelated to the strength of the case.\u201d She added that prosecutors \u201care confident that, had this case proceeded to trial, we would have met our burden of proof.\u201dNeither Mr. Davis nor Mr. Warren is expected to testify at the coming trial of Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders.Both Mr. DiCarmine and Mr. Sanders rejected plea deals that would have required them to plead guilty to at least one felony charge. Mr. Sanders also would have had to serve a prison term as part of his plea deal, with Mr. DiCarmine being sentenced to community service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Let Ohio Vote First", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byWe, as voters and election-obsessed bystanders, made it past the first two contests in this eons-long presidential primary, but seven candidates weren\u2019t so lucky.The winnowed-down field has now moved on to the warmer vote-seeking climes of Nevada and South Carolina. Before moving on too, I\u2019d like to consider what this election has now proven: Iowa and New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation status is not only obsolete, it\u2019s bad for our democratic process.That\u2019s why, to help save our democracy, I would like to autocratically declare Ohio as the new first-in-the-nation primary state starting in 2020. It might not be a perfect idea, but it would be a lot better than our system now.Unlike Iowa and New Hampshire, Ohio has a racial and cultural makeup that more closely mirrors the United States as a whole. Ohio\u2019s primary process is also generally less restrictive than caucusing, as the state allows absentee and early voting.Let\u2019s preemptively address defenders of our current system. It\u2019s true that television and radio ads in a state like Iowa are significantly cheaper than, say, New York or California. But with the advent of cable TV, online news and social media, the primary is national from Day 1.There\u2019s just one problem with Ohio becoming the new Iowa: Ohio doesn\u2019t want to be first in the nation. Jon Husted, Ohio\u2019s secretary of state, said that as swing-state voters Ohioans get enough attention from presidential candidates as it is. Putting even more focus on the state would make it more expensive for candidates at the state level to buy local advertising.\u201cI think we probably have enough impact on who becomes president already. I think that\u2019s what some people would say,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel neglected, let\u2019s put it that way. We get plenty of attention.\u201dBut the idea of holding one national primary is difficult, as it could even the playing field in some ways, while still disproportionately benefiting candidates who can campaign across 50 states without their money running out \u2014 or who are skilled enough media personalities that they don\u2019t need to rely on showing up in person. It would also mean there is no gradual winnowing of the field, which is arguably the best purpose the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries serve.A staggered primary system, by contrast, helps candidates build that all-important yet intangible \u201cmomentum,\u201d giving donors and voters more time to assess which candidate best fits their values.Another asset of the staggered primary system is it gives us a chance to see how candidates interact with real live voters on the campaign trail before we cast our votes. John C. Fortier, the director of the Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Democracy Project, says that while our current system may not be ideal, Iowa and New Hampshire do serve the political process by requiring candidates to meet with voters one-on-one and address their concerns.\u201cIt allows you to see the candidates in a light that you don\u2019t get to for the rest of the campaign, where it\u2019s much more of a managed process,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other part of the presidential process where they have to do that.\u201dThe influence of Iowa is arguably a bigger problem for the Republican Party than for Democrats. It means that a largely white, Christian conservative cohort has more sway over the nomination than any other group within the party.Changing the system \u2014 to Ohio or anywhere else \u2014 does seem unlikely, however. Iowa\u2019s state party activists have pretty much threatened to leapfrog any other state that dares to schedule its primary earlier than the caucuses. And Bill Gardner, New Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state, has steadfastly guarded his state\u2019s early calendar spot for many years.Among secretaries of state, who schedule state elections, Mr. Gardner is a legend.\u201cI think the law in New Hampshire is, the election is whenever Bill Gardner says the election is,\u201d Mr. Husted, of Ohio, said. \u201cI\u2019m exaggerating, but not by very much.\u201dIf you really care about making the campaign process cheaper, demand that we push back the primary calendar. If you really care about increasing turnout, ensure that the early voting process that gets the most attention isn\u2019t an hourslong affair that prohibits large swathes of people from participating. If you really care about the presidential campaign being inclusive, pay attention to states that represent Americans\u2019 diverse interests.But if you only really care about a narrow definition of \u201ctradition,\u201d well, you may have a promising career in Iowa or New Hampshire state politics.An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Michael McDonald as an assistant professor at the University of Florida.

{"Headline": "Negative 0.5% Interest Rate: Why People Are Paying to Save", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byBelow ZeroWhen you lend somebody money, they usually have to pay you for the privilege.That has been a bedrock assumption across centuries of financial history. But it is an assumption that is increasingly being tossed aside by some of the world\u2019s central banks and bond markets.A decade ago, negative interest rates were a theoretical curiosity that economists would discuss almost as a parlor game. Two years ago, it began showing up as an unconventional step that a few small countries considered. Now, it is the stated policy of some of the most powerful global central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.On Thursday, Sweden\u2019s central bank lowered its bank lending rate to a negative 0.5 percent from a negative 0.35 percent, and said it could cut further still; European bank stocks were hammered partly because investors feared what negative rates could do to bank profits. The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, acknowledged in congressional testimony Wednesday and Thursday that the American central bank was taking a look at the strategy, though she emphasized no such move was envisioned.But as negative rates \u2014 in which depositors pay to hold money in bank accounts \u2014 become a more common fixture, there are many unknowns about what these policies mean for finance, for the economy and even for the definition of money.These are some of the key questions, and, where we have them, the answers.So how do negative interest rates work?It depends. In the cases of interest rate targets set by central banks like the E.C.B. and Swedish Riksbank, they set a negative target rate for banks, and banks in turn pass it along to their customers. The E.C.B., for example, currently has a negative 0.3 percent rate, meaning that when banks deposit money at the central bank overnight, they pay for the privilege.Banks have different ways of passing the negative rates on to depositors, often framed as fees for keeping money in an account, which is basically negative interest rates by another name.Bond markets reflect these negative rates, too, including for longer-term government debt. For example, if you bought a two-year Swiss government bond on Thursday, you would have needed to pay a price that resulted in a yield of negative 1.12 percent. Even 10-year Swiss bonds have a negative rate, a sign markets expect below-zero rates to persist in Switzerland for many years to come.But don\u2019t people just withdraw cash rather than pay to deposit it at their bank or buy a government bond that will give them back less than they paid?You\u2019d think, right? This was exactly why economists had long thought that negative interest rates were impossible. It helps explain why central banks first turned to other tools, including quantitative easing, when they saw a need to ease monetary policy despite interest rates that were already near zero.But it looks as if the convenience of keeping money in a bank account is worth a small negative interest rate or fees for most consumers and businesses, at least at the only slightly negative rates currently in place. Storing and providing security for cash may be more expensive than a small bank charge.When initial experiments in Switzerland and Sweden didn\u2019t result in mass withdrawals from the banking system, larger central banks in need of easier money moved gingerly in the same direction. They\u2019ll stop when either their economies start to grow or they see more concrete evidence that negative rates are doing more harm than good.How is this supposed to help the economy?Pretty much the same way it always is supposed to help the economy when a central bank cuts rates. Lower rates encourage business investment and consumer spending; increase the value of the stock market and other risky assets; lower the value of a country\u2019s currency, making exporters more competitive; and create expectations of higher future inflation, which can induce people to spend now.We have decades of experience with central banks trying to manage the economy by, for example, cutting bank rates to 2 percent from 3 percent when there is an economic downturn. The shift to negative rate policies is, hypothetically at least, the same, but with a starting point of rates already around zero.So does it work?It\u2019s hard to say with any certainty yet. At a minimum, it seems to have an effect of lowering the value of a currency, which makes export industries very happy. It\u2019s less clear whether it can help create sustained economic growth, particularly when the hard-to-calculate downsides are factored in.What are those downsides?The global financial system is built on an assumption of above-zero interest rates. Going below zero could cause damage to the very architecture by which money and credit zoom through the economy, and in turn inhibit growth.Banks could cease to be viable businesses, eliminating a key way that money is channeled from savers to productive investments. Money market mutual funds, widely used in the United States, could well cease to exist. Insurance companies and pension funds could face their own major strains.Is the Federal Reserve going to do this in the United States?Janet Yellen doesn\u2019t think so. But in two days of congressional testimony this week, she also didn\u2019t rule it out.For one thing, the United States economy, and particularly its labor market, looks to be in stronger shape than that of many others around the world. So the Fed expects to be in interest-rate raising mode this year (though exactly how fast is very much in question). But even if the economy does take a turn for the worse, there\u2019s no certainty that negative rates are the path the Fed would take.She also said that \u201cit isn\u2019t just a question of legal authority.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also a question of could the plumbing of the payment system in the United States handle it?\u201d she said. \u201cIs our institutional structure of our money markets compatible with it? We\u2019ve not determined that.\u201dMs. Yellen noted that the rates on Treasury bills could go negative even in the absence of a policy shift by the Fed, as has happened a few times in the past.So what are some of the weird things that could happen in a world in which negative rates become routine?The policies in Europe and Japan are still relatively new and involve rates only slightly below zero. But if the policies become long-lasting, or negative rates go much lower, there are a lot of mind-bending ways it could affect routine transactions.For example, would people start prepaying years\u2019 worth of cable bills to avoid having money tied up in a money-losing bank account? How about property taxes? Would companies and governments put in place new policies prohibiting people from paying their bills too early?Or consider this: Many commercial transactions now take place with some short-term credit attached \u2014 for example, a company that gets a 60-day grace period to pay bills from its suppliers. Would that flip, and suddenly suppliers would prohibit upfront payment and insist that their customers wait 60 days to pay?Might new businesses sprout up that allow people to securely store thousands of dollars in bundles of $100 bills, or could people buy physical objects as stores of value that the banks can\u2019t charge a negative interest rate on?videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bahamas Mega-Resort Stands Empty, Casualty of Dispute With Chinese Partners", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported bySquare FeetNASSAU, the Bahamas \u2014 Trei Bethel had been looking for work in the Bahamas for about a year when he finally got a break: a coveted spot in a program that trained young Bahamians to work at Baha Mar, a $3.5 billion mega-resort nearing completion on Nassau\u2019s white-sand Cable Beach.There, he said, he learned about fine wine and the choreography of five-star service. He saw the resort as a place of opportunity and stability in a difficult economy.\u201cThey really put so much effort into the growth and development of us as young people,\u201d said Mr. Bethel, now 20, who became a concierge at one of the resort\u2019s four hotels.But in October, Mr. Bethel lost his job along with 2,000 others, the casualties of a dispute between the resort\u2019s developer and his Chinese partners that led to bankruptcy court. The falling-out has left Baha Mar at a standstill, fenced off at the end of a road that bears its name, more than a year after its original opening date.Baha Mar\u2019s uncertain future points to the challenges China faces as it finances and builds large-scale construction projects overseas amid language and cultural barriers, lack of regulation and allegations of graft.\u201cThe more problems there are and, in a way, the more media attention these problems attract, they erode positive attitudes towards Chinese presence in the region,\u201d said Ariel C. Armony, director of the University Center for International Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, who has researched the perception of Chinese investment in the Americas.After losing its American backer during the financial crisis, Baha Mar was revived in 2009 by China Construction America, a Jersey City-based subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned construction company, the China State Construction Engineering Corporation. The company facilitated a $2.5 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, a state-owned lender with which it has close ties, and invested $150 million for its own equity stake. In exchange, China Construction America would serve as the resort\u2019s contractor, using Chinese workers.The rest of the financing came from Sarkis Izmirlian, the Swiss-born developer who conceived Baha Mar and invested $850 million.Since his project filed for bankruptcy last summer, there has been finger-pointing from all sides. But there is broad agreement on two points: Baha Mar is spectacular, and there is plenty of blame to go around for its failure to open.Critics say the resort was overly ambitious from the start and should have been built in phases. It combines four luxury hotels, the largest casino in the Caribbean region, a championship golf course, a 200,000-square-foot convention center and what is billed as the world\u2019s largest collection of Bahamian art. The hotel chains Hyatt, Rosewood and SLS had signed on as partners.The Bahamas welcomed the investment, even moving the prime minister\u2019s residence to provide a prime location for the resort.But Baha Mar executives say that problems became evident when China Construction America, or C.C.A., missed several construction deadlines, including a second attempted opening in March for which the hotels had already started taking reservations. The company then walked away from the job, officials say, leaving the resort staffed to run hotels that weren\u2019t finished.In a statement in July, it called the developer\u2019s accusations \u201cmisleading and dishonest,\u201d saying Baha Mar\u2019s \u201cfailure to secure adequate financing and its mismanagement\u201d led to construction delays. The company did not respond to requests for further comment.The Export-Import Bank of China did not respond to a list of faxed questions.Unable to maintain the upkeep of a dormant mega-resort, Mr. Izmirlian filed bankruptcy paperwork for the project in Delaware in June. He declined to be interviewed for this article.The United States case was dismissed in September because the Bahamian government refused to recognize it. The top court in the Bahamas, which has no bankruptcy law of its own, appointed provisional liquidators. After months of fruitless negotiations, the Export-Import Bank of China put the resort into receivership in November.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Since then the resort has received a $50 million loan from another Chinese state-owned company, the China Harbor Engineering Company, to help maintain the resort. Prime Minister Perry Christie of the Bahamas has said there are several potential buyers from China.For C.C.A., which celebrated its 30th anniversary last fall, Baha Mar was an opportunity to show what it could do as it tries to expand into Latin America and the Caribbean.In court filings, Baha Mar officials say C.C.A. failed to maintain adequate staffing, provide proper schedules or follow through on a promise to bring in partners with the experience needed to build such a complex project.\u201cChina State Construction never allocated the resources that were necessary to meet the deadlines of this project,\u201d Stephen Wrinkle, former president of the Bahamian Contractors\u2019 Association, said in a phone interview, using the name of C.C.A.\u2019s parent company. \u201cFrom Day 1 they never put the manpower, they never put the management, they never put the materials on site to finish on time.\u201dIn court filings, C.C.A. countered that the developer had mismanaged the project, requesting multiple design changes that created cost overruns.As evidence of poor construction quality, Baha Mar officials have cited an email from a Chinese subcontractor that appeared to have been accidentally shared with them. In it, he admonished two of his staff for using cheap material.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you two! You can\u2019t fake things in such an obvious way!\u201d he wrote in Chinese, according to court records. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourselves in trouble! If you want to do this, you must be careful!\u201dIn an affidavit, the subcontractor said that the English translation of his email did not convey his intent and that \u201cthere is a conflict between American and Chinese culture and expressions.\u201dChina\u2019s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.As the project went on, more subcontractors from the Bahamas, the United States and elsewhere were brought in to speed the process, said Dionisio D\u2019Aguilar, who was a director at Baha Mar until the entire board resigned in November, including Mr. Izmirlian. The bankruptcy plan Baha Mar submitted called for C.C.A. to be removed from the project entirely.\u201cI have to believe that in the end the goings-on at Baha Mar have embarrassed them,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Aguilar said of C.C.A.The delays are an economic blow to the Bahamas, which expected the resort to generate a payroll equivalent to 12 percent of its gross domestic product. Bahamians who had returned home to join Baha Mar after working or studying overseas are now leaving again.Locals had started or expanded small businesses in anticipation of the resort\u2019s opening, \u201cand those people are also left hung out to dry,\u201d Mr. Wrinkle said. Bahamian contractors are owed an estimated $74 million by the resort.Standard & Poor\u2019s cited the Baha Mar impasse in its August decision to lower the Bahamas\u2019 credit rating to one level above junk status, warning that further downgrades were possible depending on \u201cthe handling of the Baha Mar project.\u201d And in December, the International Monetary Fund lowered the country\u2019s growth forecast for 2016.Even if work at Baha Mar resumes, it could be another year or more before it opens. Rosewood has moved to terminate its license agreement with Baha Mar; SLS did not respond to requests for comment.

{"Headline": "As Demographics in Cambodia Shift, Youth Seek Political Change", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byMs. Thy Sovantha put out a call on YouTube and rallied hundreds of her supporters to meet him at the airport.But at the last minute, he canceled his flight and fled to France.\u201cI was very angry,\u201d Ms. Thy Sovantha said. \u201cThe reason we supported him is that we want change. If he does not come back like this, we think, how can we change the leader? How can we win?\u201dThe question is a riddle in Cambodia, which has been stuck in roughly the same political cycle for decades.Mr. Sam Rainsy is now as well known for fleeing the country in the face of legal threats as he is for his reform-minded agenda. His retreat to France was his third in a decade.For many Cambodians, the 2013 election was the biggest opportunity yet to break out of that rut. Youth like Ms. Thy Sovantha were a central part of that hope, as a demographic shift gave them a larger say than ever before.Politically, they are restless, having outgrown the authoritarian style and patronage system of Mr. Hun Sen.But having come so close to ousting him and failed, many are disillusioned. And now some are starting to give up on Mr. Sam Rainsy as well.\u201cI feel disappointed and hopeless,\u201d said Ms. Thy Sovantha, now 20.His decision not to return to Cambodia, analysts say, was a lost opportunity, if not a surprise.But even his supporters were disappointed.Ou Ritthy, 28, the founder of a youth political discussion group, said he and his peers were exasperated with the cat-and-mouse game of Cambodian politics.\u201cHun Sen, many things he has been doing are for power, for party interests, and Sam Rainsy also does the same,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s old-style politics in a new society.\u201dMr. Ou Ritthy credits the sharp rise in Internet penetration and smartphone use for changing the dynamic here.\u201cYouth have two things,\u201d he said. \u201cInformation \u2014 they got informed from social media \u2014 and smartphones. They are more independent in terms of information. They are not told what to do by their parents like in the past.\u201dAfter two opposition lawmakers were dragged from their cars and severely beaten in October, Facebook sleuths managed to identify several attackers as members of government security forces.Both parties are keenly aware of the demographic shift and are trying to chase the changing electorate.According to a study by the public relations firm Burson-Marsteller, he already ranks second among world leaders for engagement with Facebook followers.He is increasingly conducting government business on Facebook. He has made several policy changes based on complaints posted to his personal page, and last week, he announced the creation of dozens of \u201cFacebook working groups\u201d to gather information about citizens\u2019 concerns.Sun Heng, a 22-year-old university student, said he and most of his friends followed both leaders on Facebook but were still skeptical about the sexagenarians\u2019 embrace of social media.\u201cFor me, I find it very pretentious: Sometimes it is so obvious that they are acting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it can also be a good sign, showing that they care what people think now.\u201d\u201cThis is for me the fourth time that I am forced into exile,\u201d he said by Skype from his home in Paris. \u201cBut eventually, each time, the situation changes, and I always manage to be back in time.\u201dThe question for Cambodia is whether his followers will still be waiting. Ms. Thy Sovantha seems to have moved on.She has told her followers, who now number 1.2 million, of her disillusionment with Mr. Sam Rainsy. Her Facebook posts focus increasingly on education and environmental issues rather than party politics, and she is channeling her energy into starting a center for homeless youth.But she may not have entirely given up on the system. On her Facebook profile, she describes herself as \u201cpolitician.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article referred incorrectly to the building shown in Phnom Penh. It is the Cambodian People\u2019s Party headquarters, not the Senate.Neou Vannarin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mylan also fended off its own unsolicited approach by Teva last year.Among the motivations for the deal was Mylan\u2019s desire to provide greater exposure to over-the-counter products, which represent 40 percent of Meda\u2019s product sales, and entry into emerging markets. Meda focuses largely on respiratory, dermatology and pain products. By acquiring Meda, Mylan is bringing together more than 2,000 products, including consolidating the EpiPen Auto-Injector for allergic reactions in Europe.Mylan said the acquisition was immediately accretive to its earnings, increasing to 35 cents to 40 cents a share in 2017. The transaction also could create about $350 million in annual pretax synergies by the fourth year after the deal, the companies said.As part of integrating the two companies, Mylan and Meda said there would most likely be some \u201cchanges to the organization, operations and employees of the combined group,\u201d adding that no decisions had been made to this effect. Meda has about 4,500 employees, while Mylan has 35,000.Meda\u2019s two largest shareholders, Stena and Fidim, representing 30 percent of the company\u2019s shares outstanding, have already accepted the offer.The economy, rampant consolidation among drug makers,and the need to compete in the health care sector led those investors to believe that Meda would be better off combining with another company than existing on a standalone basis, Ms. Bresch of Mylan said in a phone interview Wednesday.Conditioned on approval by regulators, the companies expect to close the deal by the third quarter of 2016.Centerview Partners provided financial advice to Mylan for the transaction, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore served as legal adviser. Vinge provided legal advice in Sweden and NautaDutilh was the legal adviser in the Netherlands.

{"Headline": "Medicines to Keep Addiction Away", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Second of two articlesThis week, another idea whose time has come: trying to kick opioid addiction without medicines is as smart as relying on willpower to overcome diabetes or asthma. Medicines greatly increase the chance of success and reduce the risk of death.Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out there now.Methadone, a liquid opioid that patients must drink every day under supervision at a methadone clinic, has been in use since the Vietnam War; it was approved to help the many soldiers coming back with heroin addiction. Before that, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctreatment\u00e2\u0080\u009d usually consisted of a) jail and b) nothing else.Suboxone, approved to treat addiction in 2002, is a pill (in generic form) or film that dissolves under the tongue, and is prescribed by a doctor for home use. It combines two drugs, the opioid buprenorphine and naloxone, an opioid antagonist that makes buprenorphine less prone to abuse. If the pill or film is crushed and snorted or injected, the naloxone blocks the high.That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important beginning. But laws blocking access need changing as well. For example, doctors must be trained and certified by the federal government to prescribe Suboxone, and may treat only 100 patients at a time.In part, these laws are designed to guard against illegal resale of the drug.But the laws also reflect many Americans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unease with opioid maintenance therapy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is still some level of pervasive stigma against medication,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in an interview last week. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people still think there is some hierarchy of who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more in recovery \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people who are not on this versus people who are. It can be a real barrier for some people for whom these medications are totally appropriate.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAt Gosnold on Cape Cod, an addiction treatment organization, a majority of patients use Vivitrol after they leave residential treatment, said Kristoph Pydynkowski, a recovery manager. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt really helps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how many people said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was out there at a using spot, driving down the street, and then I turned around: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on Vivitrol. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not doing that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn 2012, Sheriff James M. Cummings of Barnstable County, Mass., began offering it to inmates in the Barnstable County House of Corrections. Vivitrol is part of a larger program to help keep inmates from coming back, which includes job counseling and connections to social services. Inmates get the injection right before they leave prison (Alkermes, the drug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maker, donates it to the jail) and set up plans for counseling and continuing Vivitrol shots once they leave.About 200 inmates have received Vivitrol so far. Cummings said that 50 percent remain sober, and only 12 percent have ended up back behind bars.\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with the worst of the worst \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people whose addiction is so bad they ended up committing crimes and going to jail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. On the other hand, the inmates who volunteer to get Vivitrol are likely a more motivated group than those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.Barnstable was one of the first jails in the country to use Vivitrol. Many corrections officials from elsewhere have visited the program, and some have started their own. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I like is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a narcotic, has no street value, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something going to be diverted,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cummings said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a little frustrated that it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been taken on by more correctional facilities.\u00e2\u0080\u009dStill, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crucial to have some options in a field with very few, especially when many people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want Suboxone. There are 16,000 Americans on Vivitrol, said Richard Pops, chief executive of Alkermes, and 1 million on methadone and Suboxone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the correct ratio is, but 100 to 1 it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Richard Rosenthal, a co-principal investigator on the latest study who is medical director of addiction psychiatry at Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System in New York, said that Probuphine was designed to solve three problems with Suboxone. One was the chance of resale or accidental exposure to the pills. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlso, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the opportunity for non-adherence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 people forget, or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take their dose, which leaves them vulnerable again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. The other issue is that medicines have peaks and troughs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople on various medications may have increased cravings during those troughs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Read previous contributions to this series.I spoke with a man named David, a firefighter in a Boston suburb who wanted to be identified only by his first name. After doing well on Suboxone, he participated in the latest trial of Probuphine. When he was taking the pill, he said, he could feel it kick in every morning, \u00e2\u0080\u009clike drinking a good cup of coffee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the implant there was a much more consistent feeling of normalcy. I just felt perfectly normal all the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd some medicines have what A.A. lacks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 scientific evidence of success.There is evidence, though, for medication.Only 1 percent of people treated for alcohol problems in the United States are prescribed medications. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to understand that while 12-step programs may be very helpful for many people, there are many people who suffer from these disorders who need more than that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bradley Stein, a psychiatrist who is senior natural scientist at the RAND Corporation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same way other chronic diseases don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a single intervention, we need other tools in our toolbox. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore From Fixes \u00bbMore From Private Lives \u00bbMore From Couch \u00bbMore From The Stone \u00bbMore From Moviegoers \u00bbMore From The End \u00bbMore From Draft \u00bbMore From Anxiety \u00bbMore From Menagerie \u00bbMore From Disunion \u00bbMore From Bedside \u00bbMore From The Conversation \u00bbMore From The Great Divide \u00bbMore From Errol Morris \u00bbFollowAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "G-20, Rejecting Major Policy Shifts, Plays Up Basic Strengths", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Through the winter, world financial markets have tumbled and churned with a succession of worries. The Chinese economy seemed to be faltering. Commodity exporters like Russia and Brazil suffered sharp slowdowns. And with oil prices falling, banks that have lent heavily to energy companies could be hurt.On Saturday evening, finance ministers from 20 of the world\u2019s largest economies wrapped up a day and a half of meetings with a rough consensus: The markets worry too much.The ministers turned aside suggestions that they embark on any radical changes in policy, like realigning the exchange rates of major currencies. They endorsed instead a stepped-up combination of monetary policies, government spending and structural changes, altering the wording of Saturday night\u2019s communiqu\u00e9 from communiqu\u00e9s last year to put somewhat greater emphasis on these policies.The ministers tried hard to persuade investors around the world that they were missing basic strengths in the global economy.\u201cThe magnitude of the recent market volatility has not reflected the underlying fundamentals of the global economy,\u201d said Lou Jiwei, the finance minister of China, the country that holds the group\u2019s presidency this year.The agreement to share information came in addition to renewing a previous commitment by large economies not to devalue their currencies to obtain a competitive advantage for their exporters. Devaluations make exporters\u2019 goods less expensive in foreign markets.The information sharing agreement was prompted by actions in recent months by China and Japan. China unexpectedly made small devaluations in its currency in early August and in late December, both times leading to drops in world stock markets. Japan has embraced negative interest rates and pushed hard to expand its money supply, moves that have made it less attractive to hold yen.Masatsugu Asakawa, Japan\u2019s vice minister of finance for international affairs, said there had been strong agreement that countries should not devalue currencies to help the competitiveness of their exports. While expansionary monetary policies like Japan\u2019s may have spillover effects on currencies, they are not problematic as long as the policies are aimed mainly at supporting the domestic economy, not currency depreciation, he said.Many of the worries this winter have involved whether economic growth in China may be slowing more than official statistics indicate. Giving a possible glimpse into the Chinese government\u2019s priorities in the budget to be released next Saturday, Mr. Lou said China would pursue a long list of policies aimed at helping various sectors of the Chinese economy become more efficient.One policy already carried out, he said, had shortened the lengthy process for obtaining some kinds of government approvals for businesses to a few days. \u201cThrough deregulation, we can invigorate entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d he said.\u201cSome market participants wanted a big plan to boost the economy,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who is also the chairman of the European Union\u2019s council of 28 finance ministers. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel there is a need for a big plan. We\u2019re not in a crisis mode.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Father, a Son, a Disease, and a Camera", "Date": "2018-01-18", "News": "Yet right around now, Mr. Astrada should be in Myanmar, about eight months since he left his home base in Barcelona, Spain, on Athena, his Royal Enfield motorcycle laden with clothes, supplies and camera gear. He has gone over the Pyrenees, into Turkey, up to Vladivostok, Russia, over to South Korea (by ferry) and, most recently, India (by plane).There have been mechanical failures, unexpected delays and bureaucratic nightmares, not to mention the Korean hotel vending machine he thought sold soda, but actually dispensed sex toys. Yet, during a phone interview last week, Mr. Astrada sounded upbeat about how his impulsive decision one day while covering Haiti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cholera outbreak in 2010 has gotten him halfway around the world, where he goes out taking pictures for himself, not some assignment editor.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you have to think a lot about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said by phone from a small town in India near the Myanmar border. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think too much, in the end you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never do it. I wanted to go around the world, and I thought I could do it by motorcycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009dTo hear him tell it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with enough feeling to make deskbound editors long to toss off the shackles of meetings and budgets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 his journey wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about taking time to think, but making time to experience. With almost 20 years as a photojournalist, Mr. Astrada has covered everything from Haiti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earthquake or conflict in Africa, to longer projects on violence against women or people living with multiple sclerosis. As a news photographer, he was used to rituals of blowing into town, covering the breaking story and leaving. While that may be good for news, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the kind of grind that hardly leaves little time to get to know a place. This time, he wanted the freedom to explore and do street photography.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had lost sight of what I had before, to go out with my camera and make pictures of whatever caught my attention, without thinking of any specific reportage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking with news agencies, especially once the news is over, many times we forget there is daily life that continues in these places. In some ways this idea was to complete the other part of what you never get to cover when you do news.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFiguring out that he wanted to travel light and be as self-sufficient as possible, he settled on going by motorcycle, a Royal Enfield built in India, first learning how to ride one at a driving school in Spain. In keeping with his theme of self-sufficiency, he enrolled in a motorcycle repair class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he used to be an airplane mechanic, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s handy with tools and motors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 because he figured he might be in some remote places. That proved the case when a spring broke while he was on a deserted road to Uzbekistan.One truth at the root of The Journey is something essential: the lure of the road, the ability to stop and go as one pleases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of course, making accommodations for bureaucrats, the police and border crossings. Some places he wanted to see \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like Florence, for Michelangelo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s masterpieces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 while others would have to wait; his Iranian visa came through too late, since he had to get to Vladivostok by October. If he found a place was to his liking, he might stay longer than planned, which is what happened in Tbilisi, Georgia.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plan is there is no plan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI adapted as I went along. That is the beauty of going by motorcycle.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBut another important aspect of his trek speaks to the universality of the human experience, for better or worse. Cellphones turn up in the unlikeliest places, he noted, as did traffic that could rival New York\u2019s.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I got to Ulan Bator, it was like being on Fifth Avenue in a traffic jam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said of the Mongolian capital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have this idea in our heads \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the tourist idea \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that people continue to live as they did in a previous era, when in reality the world has evolved. The idea of this trip is to see how similar we are, as well as how we have differences. In truth, television and movies have influenced so much. In the end, all the globalization of technology and the economy means a lot of things are similar.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFor now, Mr. Astrada is going to base himself in Southeast Asia for about a year, giving workshops and being able to take on assignments. After that, his plan is to go to North America and, he hopes, Latin America. And for all his traveling, he has come up with one project he feels he must do: a deep look at Argentina, the homeland in which he has not lived for some 19 years.But those plans can wait.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis trip has made me enjoy taking pictures more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like the excitement of being somewhere without the pressure to make pictures and being able to share life in a different way, to see what people do every day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}
{"Headline": "China Gives Glimpse of Its Solutions to Economic Problems", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported bySHANGHAI \u2014 Chinese economic policy makers tugged back the curtain a bit on Thursday on their plans to stabilize the country\u2019s economy and financial markets, even as shares plunged more than 6 percent late in the day.Speaking to leaders of the world\u2019s biggest banks and institutional investors at a financial conference here, officials described how they would use government deficit spending to spur growth. A senior Chinese central banker also pledged to preserve the value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, by firmly tying its value to a range of other currencies.Timothy Adams, the chief executive and president of the Institute of International Finance, said Chinese policy makers realized they had made a serious mistake by staying silent as slowing growth, stumbles in the stock market and a fluctuating currency undermined the world\u2019s perception of China\u2019s economic stability. Their silence has been widely construed as either a reluctance to acknowledge difficulties or a lack of solutions.\u201cEither they communicate with the markets in a timely and intelligent fashion, or the markets are going to write their own story line,\u201d said Mr. Adams, a former senior United States Treasury official.Finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world are flying into Shanghai for meetings this weekend. Global banking leaders are already here for the annual conference of the Institute of International Finance. So a large contingent of Chinese officials has come from Beijing to meet with them and discuss their policies.So far, the Chinese officials have acknowledged the challenges they face, but they contend that the world has overlooked the many policy options they can use to respond.The officials outlined how they hoped to shift the economy from its emphasis on manufacturing, exports and a sometimes manic pace of construction, toward services and consumer spending. And they described how they hoped to manage that transition without tripping up economic growth along the way.Zhu Guangyao, a vice minister of finance, said Thursday morning that Prime Minister Li Keqiang would unveil a government budget early next month that would include economic stimulus through an increase in deficit spending, which was only 2.3 percent of economic output last year. \u201cIn 2016, certainly we will have to increase that ratio,\u201d he said.Although China\u2019s corporations are heavily indebted, the Chinese central government is not.In a subsequent speech to international bank leaders, Yi Gang, the first deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, provided the strongest commitment to date not to devalue the renminbi. He described a complex strategy based on anchoring the value of the renminbi to three baskets of currencies. The baskets are essentially weighted averages of how much the renminbi is worth in terms of dollars, euros, yen and other currencies.Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, is scheduled to speak Friday morning and then hold a rare news conference immediately afterward.He will have much to discuss: Money has been sluicing out of China this winter, as companies and individuals use their renminbi to buy dollars, fearing that the renminbi may decline further against the dollar. As officials spoke on Thursday, the Shanghai stock exchange on the other side of town was sliding steeply, ending with a loss of 6.4 percent \u2014 a particularly precipitous decline given that the market halts trading in any listing once it has fallen 10 percent.Share prices slid on Thursday, not in response to the reassurances of Chinese officials but rather to a spike in short-term interest rates in Chinese money markets.China\u2019s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.Despite huge outflows in recent months, it was not immediately clear that trying to slow them was the sole cause of the rise in interest rates. The Chinese central bank injects huge sums of cash into the economy in late January and early February each year in anticipation of heavy consumer spending during Chinese New Year, then tries to drain some of that extra money in late February. It is a tricky task every year, and especially when financial confidence is weak.Even if Chinese officials do start unveiling further policy responses to economic weakness, it is unclear whether overseas investors will believe them. China has repeatedly promised measures to limit the rapid growth of corporate debt and to overhaul state-owned enterprises, notably at the Third Plenum, a policy-setting gathering in the autumn of 2013. But putting changes in effect has proved slow and difficult, as many could involve layoffs in single-company towns with few alternative employers, and could threaten the livelihoods of politically connected executives at troubled state-owned enterprises.The Chinese central bank has been trying to inject additional cash into the economy to offset outflows and prevent interest rates from rising. Qu Hongbin, the chief economist for greater China at HSBC, said that not all of the money leaving China was harmful, however. He estimated that three-fifths of it consisted of Chinese companies paying overseas debts, which would become more expensive in renminbi terms if the currency weakens further.Mr. Yi, the deputy governor, sought to reassure bankers that China\u2019s central bank would not tolerate another broad decline in the value of the renminbi. The bank devalued the renminbi 4 percent compared with the dollar last August, then pushed it down nearly 3 percent in late December and early January.Mr. Yi said that China is anchoring its currency to three weighted averages of currencies: one that it calculates itself, one from the Bank of International Settlements and one from the International Monetary Fund. Paul Gruenwald, a former I.M.F. official who is now the Singapore-based Asia economist for Standard & Poor\u2019s, said that because the dollar typically makes up a third of each of these baskets, the shift meant that the renminbi could conceivably vary three times as widely against the dollar.The renminbi gained against the broader baskets through much of last year, even as it weakened against the dollar. But this winter, the currency has also weakened against the averages, as it has followed the dollar down against the euro.By not specifying which of the baskets is most important, the People\u2019s Bank of China keeps greater flexibility, although at the cost of also allowing greater uncertainty in financial markets. China\u2019s own basket includes currencies that are somewhat important for its trade, like the Russian ruble and Malaysian ringgit. The I.M.F.\u2019s special drawing rights, another basket cited by Mr. Yi, only has the dollar, euro, yen, British pound and the renminbi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fining Bankers, Not Shareholders, for Banks\u2019 Misconduct", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byFair GameHo-hum, another week, another multimillion-dollar settlement between regulators and a behemoth bank acting badly.As has become all too common in these cases, not one individual was identified as being responsible for the activities. Once again, shareholders are shouldering the costs of unethical behavior they had nothing to do with.It could not be clearer: Years of tighter rules from legislators and bank regulators have done nothing to fix the toxic, me-first cultures that afflict big financial firms.\u201cNearly a decade after the financial crisis, some firms continue to experience systemic breakdowns manifested through significant violations due to poor cultures of compliance,\u201d said Richard Ketchum, Finra\u2019s chairman. \u201cFirms with a strong ethical culture and senior leaders who set the right tone, lead by example and impose consequences on anyone who violates the firm\u2019s cultural norms are essential to restoring investor confidence and trust in the securities industry.\u201dBut changing behavior \u2014 as opposed, say, to imposing higher capital requirements \u2014 is a complex task. And regulators must do more than talk about what banks have to do to address their deficiencies.\u201cIf behavior doesn\u2019t change, banks will not be trusted and they won\u2019t be efficient in their financing of the real economy,\u201d he said. \u201cA functioning banking system must be based on trust.\u201dMr. Dombret is a regulator who knows banking from the inside, having held executive positions at J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.Most companies have codes of ethics, Mr. Dombret said, but they often exist only on paper.Regulators could help encourage a more ethical approach by routinely monitoring how a bank cooperates with its overseers, Mr. Dombret said.\u201cHow often is the bank the whistle-blower?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot only to get a lesser penalty but also to show that it won\u2019t accept that kind of behavior. We are seeing more of that.\u201dRegulators may have other tools to curb dubious activities, he said. One idea is to increase the capital requirements of banks that are found to have violated rules and laws repeatedly. That not only enhances the safety of its operations but also imposes a real cost on future profits.\u201cIf there was a series of misconduct, would that require increasing capital or asking for more equity?\u201d Mr. Dombret asked. \u201cWe have to think through how you would penalize misconduct.\u201dThe professors call this covenant banking. And it looks a lot like the kind of personal liability that was a fact of life among the top Wall Street firms when they were private partnerships.With their own money at risk, partners of Salomon Brothers, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs were much more careful about their business dealings. When these firms became public companies funded more by outsiders\u2019 money, that self-discipline diminished.Their plan contains a crucial element, requiring the best-paid bankers in the company to be liable for a fine whether or not they were directly involved in the activities that generated it. Such a no-fault program, the professors argued, would motivate bankers not only to curb their own problematic tendencies but to be on the alert for colleagues\u2019 misbehavior as well.This would help instill a culture, the law professors wrote, \u201cthat discourages bad behavior and its underlying ethos, the competitive pursuit of narrow material gain.\u201dPutting such a covenant in place would also help eliminate the problem of banking regulators who become captured by the institutions they are supposed to police. \u201cThose in the best position to choose conduct that is appropriate may not be regulators but, rather, bankers with a stake in the bank,\u201d the professors wrote.A regulator could give a company the choice of a far lower fine if it were to be paid by managers, not shareholders. A company choosing to pay the higher fine and billing it to the shareholders would have some explaining to do, Mr. Painter said.While the idea of a covenant is centered on banking, it could easily expand to other businesses. But the focus on finance is justified, Ms. Hill said.\u201cWe don\u2019t take the position that this should only be about banks,\u201d she said. \u201cBut banks can do huge damage, and we have seen this ethos in the industry that cries out for responsibility.\u201dTighter regulations and billions in fines levied on financial firms have had little impact on banking culture, as the Barclays and Credit Suisse cases make clear. It\u2019s high time to up the ante.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Daytona, a Track That Opened in 1959, No Longer Feels Like an Antique", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Jeff Gordon had no frame of reference. As he stood along one of the concourses at the lavishly renovated Daytona International Speedway, he chuckled at the realization that \u201cin my 23 years of coming here, this is the first time I\u2019ve actually seen this speedway from this side of the fence.\u201dHe was referring to the fans\u2019 side of the racetrack, which opened in 1959 and, in recent years, had gone from quaint to antiquated to archaic. It is no secret that while fan interest in many sports remains healthy, falling attendance at stadiums and arenas is a growing concern. There is the cost and the hassle of getting there and, not to be minimized, the appeal of a plush lounge chair in front of a flat-screen television that can be paused for bathroom breaks.Nascar\u2019s answer was a $400 million renovation of Daytona just in time for Speedweeks and Sunday\u2019s 58th running of the Daytona 500.\u201cI\u2019m blown away by it,\u201d said Gordon, 44, a four-time series champion who has retired to the broadcasting booth. \u201cOur fans are in for a great experience. I may not have seen the way this place was before, but I\u2019ve been to Super Bowls and a lot of different events, and I can tell you this place has elevated itself to be as good or better than any other major sports venue I\u2019ve been to.\u201dKnown as Daytona Rising, the renovation was two and a half years in the making, all while the site continued to host events. \u201cIt was backbreaking,\u201d said Joie Chitwood III, the racetrack\u2019s president. \u201cWe didn\u2019t postpone a single event. If anyone ever asks you to operate a venue while undergoing a construction project, politely decline. It was incredibly hard. But in the end, it was all worth it.\u201dFans apparently feel the same way.What officials are calling a stadium now has 40 escalators, compared with none previously. There are now 17 elevators, 11 more than before. In addition, there are spacious concourses that allow clear sightlines to the racetrack, 1,400 television screens, 60 luxury suites, lounge areas, interactive displays and grandstand chairs to sit in, rather than metal bleachers.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely great,\u201d said Mike Roselli, 36, a Nascar fan from Brodheadsville, Pa. \u201cIt reminds me of the new Yankee Stadium. It\u2019s almost as if they went there first before building this. They did an awesome job, and you can tell that they really took the fans\u2019 aspect of it seriously.\u201dThe fans\u2019 aspect was, in fact, a continuing initiative.Part of the concept is not only to get fans to come to the venue but also to interact with them, engage them and, of course, market and sell to them. The Wi-Fi signal is strong and free \u2014 well, sort of. To receive it, fans must register through their email and sign off on fine print that allows Nascar and its corporate sponsors to gather information on them, and even to keep track of them as they meander through the stadium. The purpose is to see what captures their attention, and for how long \u2014 and, perhaps just as important, what does not interest them.Chitwood noted that one of the project\u2019s biggest challenges in the renovation was how best to facilitate the flow of fans.Roselli, who estimates that he has been to 13 Daytona 500 races, said: \u201cYou always had to wait in line before. I don\u2019t see that happening now. Not only do they have more entrance points, they scan your ticket when you come in and if you go out, so that you can come back in again.\u201dThe old speedway had fans entering at ground level and then primarily climbing stairs. Its six elevators were all-purpose. \u201cYou\u2019d have situations where fans, workers and maybe a food cart were all crammed into the same elevator,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cWe\u2019ve eliminated that.\u201dWhat was not eliminated was one of the speedway\u2019s time-honored perks: fans bringing coolers. Chitwood insisted that even the notion of separating fans from their coolers was never considered.\u201cWe had a focus group once,\u201d Chitwood said, \u201cand an older gentleman, who was kind of cantankerous with us, finally said: \u2018I know what you\u2019re trying to do. You\u2019re trying to take my cooler away from me.\u2019 We assured him we weren\u2019t. And we haven\u2019t.\u201dWhat the new speedway does not have are the 46,000 seats that were on the backstretch. Like many new stadiums and arenas, Daytona is buying into the notion that less is more, with several other racetracks having already downsized. The new speedway will accommodate what it did when it opened 57 years ago: 101,500 fans.Chitwood believes that there will not be a revenue dip and that the financial difference will be offset by increased and upgraded concessions and food offerings, more and markedly better luxury suites, and, of course, finding creative ways to bring in more corporate sponsorship money.Toward that end, Nascar sold what it calls four injectors \u2014 entrance points and interactive areas for fans \u2014 to Sunoco, Florida Hospital, Toyota and Chevrolet. Highly interactive, the areas are emblazoned inside and out with corporate logos and other marketing mechanisms. For instance, you can buy a Chevrolet at a local dealership and, for an additional cost, pick it up inside the speedway.Jeff Chew, Chevy Racing\u2019s manager for strategic planning and operations, said his company\u2019s injector area would feature 23 Chevrolets spread over 20,000 square feet of space spanning three concourse levels. \u201cThis was important to us, as we feel that we\u2019re part of the very fabric of Nascar,\u201d Chew said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more championship drivers than any other manufacturer.\u201d Neither he nor Nascar\u2019s chief executive, Brian France, would divulge the cost of such prime real estate at the sport\u2019s premier venue.\u201cIt\u2019s tricky because we don\u2019t enjoy the public-private partnerships like other leagues do with public financing of stadiums and arenas,\u201d France said. \u201cThat\u2019s a challenge. What they\u2019ve done on the public enterprise model is build something that works for us, works for our fans, and we could actually pay for.\u201dAlthough other leagues need a new location when they build a new venue, even if it is just across the street, that was not the case at Daytona, Chitwood noted. \u201cWhile everything else has changed,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat hasn\u2019t changed is that when you look at that start-finish line, you know that it\u2019s the same one that Lee Petty crossed when he won the first Daytona 500.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Court Fight Won\u2019t Die, No Matter How Hard Republicans Try", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans, facing fierce criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, insisted Thursday that they would face no political retribution from their decision to shun any Supreme Court nomination made by President Obama, expressing confidence that they would not be hurt at the polls in November.\u201cThe American people are pretty much split on it,\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, citing polls that showed the country divided on whether the Senate should act on a nomination. \u201cFor that reason, I don\u2019t think it will be a major factor.\u201dBut Democrats said the issue would be valuable in motivating turnout and helping them close the gap with conservative Republican voters energized by Donald J. Trump. They said they were excited about polls showing independent voters siding with Democrats because independents could be in a position to decide not only the presidential election, but also Senate elections in swing states.\u201cTo be honest, this is why people hate the Senate,\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an interview. \u201cElections are about accountability. We have a job to do and we need to do our job. People are going to ask the same question: \u2018Why aren\u2019t you doing your job?\u2019\u00a0\u201dPolls from past presidential elections offer some guidance on voter behavior. However, both parties agreed this year\u2019s election might be unique.In 2008, the last time a new president was being elected, exit polls showed that only 7 percent of those voting considered future appointments to the court to be the most important factor in their choice, although 47 percent rated it as one of several important factors. More than 40 percent said it was a minor factor or none at all.In 2016 races, Rob Jesmer, a Republican consultant and former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said: \u201cIt is not going to change voting behavior. People who feel strongly about this have already made up their minds.Since 1900, the Senate has voted on eight Supreme Court nominees during an election year. Six were confirmed.\u201cThe idea that out of all the issues facing the country \u2014 whether it is ISIS, the economy or immigration \u2014 that this is going to trump those issues, I find to be kind of laughable,\u201d Mr. Jesmer added.Democrats insisted they could use the court fight to spur voters on the individual priorities that resonate with them, citing the stakes for climate change, campaign finance changes, abortion rights, immigration \u2014 mobilizing them on a topic that goes beyond the court but is tied to who chooses the new justice.Whoever turns out to be right, both sides hardened their positions on Thursday as one potential nominee, Brian E. Sandoval, Nevada\u2019s Republican governor, sent out a statement that he did not wish to be considered for the job.Democrats opened their assault when more than two dozen senators stood in a brisk wind in front of the Supreme Court and criticized Republicans for what they said was outrageous intransigence in refusing to consider any nominee to fill the spot left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.But while the tableau of United States senators standing before the court\u2019s iconic marble pillars underscored the Democrats\u2019 determination to raise public pressure on Republicans, it also accentuated their powerlessness, in terms of legislative procedure, to force action on a nominee.Republicans adopted a strategy of trying to deflect attention from the court fight and move on to other business in the Senate.\u201cI think our friends across the aisle would agree that there is a lot of important work that we can, and should, do together,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said in a floor speech urging everyone to get back to work. \u201cI would ask our friends across the aisle, while they come out on the floor or give news conferences and express mock horror, to tone down the rhetoric and avoid the hypocrisy that seems so apparent when they argue for different standards today than they advocated in the past.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, cast the presidential election as a referendum on the court.Divisive Supreme Court decisions are more likely to be re-examined \u2014 and possibly overturned \u2014 when a court changes. In the Roberts Court, 85 cases split 5 to 4 or 5 to 3 with Justice Scalia in the conservative majority, many with similar judicial themes.\u201cDo the American people want to elect a president who will nominate a justice in the mold of Scalia to replace him?\u201d Mr. Grassley asked. \u201cOr do they want to elect President Clinton or Sanders, who will nominate a justice who will move the court in a drastically more liberal direction?\u201dMr. Reid replied by speaking about the court vacancy and quoted Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\u201cI will never agree to retreat from our responsibility to confirm qualified judicial nominees,\u201d Mr. Reid said, quoting a 2007 floor speech by Mr. McConnell.The Republicans reiterated that it would not matter who Mr. Obama put forward, Republican or Democrat, no matter how accomplished a jurist \u2014 the nomination would be dead on arrival.The White House on Thursday said that Mr. McConnell and Mr. Grassley had agreed to meet with Mr. Obama to discuss the vacancy on Tuesday. But the Republicans said they would use the session merely to restate their position. Even as Republicans expressed confidence that there would be little political fallout in November, Democratic challengers across the country began chiding Republican incumbents for refusing to consider a nominee, with particular emphasis on swing states like New Hampshire and Ohio. Some Republicans said privately that if there was a fight worth losing their Senate majority over, protecting the balance of the Supreme Court was it.Standing outside the Supreme Court, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the judiciary committee, accused Republicans of shirking their constitutional responsibility. \u201cI have served in the Senate longer than anybody who is here,\u201d said Mr. Leahy, first elected in 1974. \u201cI have never once, never once, whether the Democrats have been in control or the Republicans, whether there is a Democratic president or a Republican president, seen this total abrogation of their duties.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They included a swimming pool, a visitor center, a helipad, a cattle enclosure, an amphitheater, three houses for Mr. Zuma\u2019s personal employees and even a chicken coop. (The government tried to justify the swimming pool by characterizing it as potential firefighting equipment.)Mr. Zuma did not specify how much he would repay.The government at first insisted that the home upgrades were security enhancements, and at one point, Mr. Zuma told Parliament that he had paid for the improvements himself. But late in 2012, critics filed complaints with the office of the public protector, whose job is to investigate allegations of official misconduct, and demanded an investigation.The court is scheduled to hear the case on Feb. 9, two days before Mr. Zuma delivers his annual State of the Nation address to Parliament. At last year\u2019s address, a brawl broke out between security forces and opposition politicians who chanted, \u201cPay back the money.\u201dOn Wednesday, the two opposition parties said they were proceeding with their case, despite Mr. Zuma\u2019s announcement.\u201cHow those irregularities happened continues to be investigated in separate inquiries relating to officials and professional consultants on the project,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe report specifically found no wrongdoing of any kind by the president. It also found no benefit for which the president could to any degree be required to compensate the state in relation to nearly all aspects of the project.\u201dThe statement said Mr. Zuma had intended \u201cto achieve an end to the drawn-out dispute,\u201d but did not specify how much money he would repay. Instead, he suggested that the amount \u201cshould be independently and impartially determined\u201d by the country\u2019s auditor general and finance minister.

{"Headline": "5G Is a New Frontier for Mobile Carriers and Tech Companies", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byGUILDFORD, England \u2014 On the outskirts of this sleepy commuter town just south of London, plans are underway to build the fastest cellphone network in the world.The work is being done at the University of Surrey, where a leafy campus is dotted with rundown Brutalist-style buildings. Here, researchers and some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies, including Samsung and Fujitsu, are collaborating to offer mobile Internet speeds more than 100 times faster than anything now available.\u201cEveryone is rushing to demonstrate they are a leading player for 5G,\u201d said Bengt Nordstrom, co-founder of Northstream, a telecom consulting firm, in Stockholm.\u201cIf we miss the chance to make our networks relevant, it will be a disaster,\u201d said Ulf Ewaldsson, Ericsson\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThe billion-dollar question is what will a 5G network look like?\u201dDespite companies\u2019 efforts to outspend each other, that question remains unanswered.A global standard for 5G wireless technology will not be finished before 2019, at the earliest. Companies worldwide must agree on how their networks talk to each other, so users\u2019 mobile connections do not become patchy when traveling overseas. That involves lengthy negotiations over what type of radio waves the new technology should use, among other complicated global agreements, which can take years.As a result, carriers, telecom equipment makers and tech companies are lobbying global-standard bodies and national lawmakers to promote their own technologies over rivals\u2019, according to industry executives and telecom analysts. Because of this jockeying, a widespread rollout of 5G networks is not expected until well into the next decade.\u201cA lot of this is about carriers and equipment makers looking for new ways to make money,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research in Paris. \u201cConsumers shouldn\u2019t expect great things until after 2020.\u201dThese challenges have not stopped companies from staking a claim in hopes of being at the forefront of 5G.That is particularly true ahead of major global sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup, at which carriers and national governments want to promote their technological know-how. At the 2018 World Cup, which will be held in Russia, for instance, the local operators MegaFon and MTS are expected to test 5G-style services, including ultrafast mobile Internet, even without global standards in place.The Korean mobile operator KT also plans to offer its own version of 5G technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and NTT DoCoMo has said it will have similar trials ready for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.United States carriers have also jumped on the 5G bandwagon, partly to offer people new services as current mobile speeds have become relatively interchangeable between major operators nationwide.For Dr. Tafazolli, of the University of Surrey, whose team started working on 5G in late 2011, these battles have led to an increasing number of companies offering support \u2014 including the use of high-speed computer servers, costly radio antennas and millions of dollars of financing to research and build the next-generation wireless network on his college campus, he said. Their primary goal: to test their latest technology in a real-world setting.\u201cIn the race to 5G, everyone wants to be first,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Vegetarian,\u2019 a Surreal South Korean Novel", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byThe mesmerizing mix of sex and violence was not what fans and reviewers expected from Ms. Han, a celebrated and award-winning poet and novelist.\u201cIt was received as very extreme and bizarre,\u201d Ms. Han said in English during a recent telephone interview from her home in Seoul. \u201cDefinitely, readers were surprised.\u201dEven more surprising was the rapturous reception that followed. \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d became a cult international best seller. Publication rights have sold in nearly 20 countries. It was adapted into a Korean film that played at Sundance in 2010.Still, Ms. Han, who has been publishing fiction and poetry for more than two decades, remained almost entirely unknown to English-speakers.That is starting to change, thanks largely to Deborah Smith, a 28-year-old British translator who read a Korean edition of \u201cThe Vegetarian\u201d four years ago, when she was studying for her Ph.D. at the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies. She was transfixed by the unusual story and vivid, chiseled prose, and attempted to translate it herself, but wasn\u2019t fluent enough yet to capture Ms. Han\u2019s style. A year later, she tried again, and sent a short sample translation to a British publisher, who decided to publish the novel based on the first 10 pages.\u201cIt was very visual and painterly,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThe reason that I wanted to translate her in the first place is that I think she is the best writer they have.\u201dIt remains to be seen whether \u201cThe Vegetarian,\u201d which is being released in the United States this week by Hogarth, will resonate with American readers. But it is causing a stir in literary circles. The book has drawn a string of ecstatic early reviews, including those in Publishers Weekly, Booklist and Kirkus, which called it \u201cgracefully written and deeply disturbing.\u201d Independent booksellers are rallying around it. Literary novelists like Lauren Groff, Helen Oyeyemi and Eimear McBride have heaped praise on Ms. Han\u2019s hypnotic prose.\u201cEnthusiasm spread like a virus in the way that you always hope will happen,\u201d Molly Stern, the publisher of Hogarth, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that virus spreads into the reading public.\u201dThe story centers on Yeong-hye, a melancholy housewife who is haunted by violent dreams that drive her to stop eating meat. Her abusive husband views her vegetarianism as an act of rebellion, while her brother-in-law becomes obsessed with her increasingly emaciated figure and her bluish birthmark, and lures her into performing in his sexually explicit video art. Like a cursed madwoman in classical myth, Yeong-hye seems both eerily prophetic and increasingly unhinged when she begins starving herself, hoping to transform into a tree.Ms. McBride, the author of \u201cA Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing,\u201d said she was struck by \u201cthe alignment of extraordinarily lyrical prose with incredibly brutal content.\u201d\u201cThe tension between the two creates a very singular effect within the reader; a sense of complete immersion and utter disorientation all at once,\u201d Ms. McBride wrote in an email. \u201cThe technical achievement is astonishing and all the more so because she never allows you even a glimpse at the seams.\u201dIf Ms. Han gains a broad American readership, she will be one of the first South Korean authors to do so. While American publishers have become more willing to take risks on works in translation, particularly since the commercial success of international authors like Elena Ferrante, Karl Ove Knausgaard and Haruki Murakami, literary imports from South Korea remain scarce. Just a few prominent contemporary South Korean novelists have been published in the United States, including Young-ha Kim and Kyung-sook Shin.Some scholars, editors and translators say it is a shame that South Korea\u2019s vibrant and diverse literary culture has been largely overlooked by Western publishers, even as other Korean cultural exports like K-pop have spread across the globe. \u201cThere are so few works of Korean literature in translation, especially contemporary stuff,\u201d said Ed Park, a Korean-American novelist and executive editor at Penguin Press.More books are starting to trickle in. Three years ago, the independent publisher Dalkey Archive Press started its \u201cLibrary of Korean Literature\u201d series, a translation program financed in part by the Literature Translation Institute of Korea. Dalkey has published 19 translations so far, including contemporary novels and 20th-century classics, and will release six works of Korean fiction this year.Last year, AmazonCrossing published the Korean author Bae Suah\u2019s acclaimed novella \u201cNowhere to Be Found.\u201d Hogarth has acquired a second novel from Ms. Han, \u201cHuman Acts,\u201d which takes place in 1980 in Gwangju, South Korea, where a boy searches for his friend\u2019s body after a violently suppressed student uprising. The novel won Korea\u2019s Manhae Literary Prize last year, and Ms. Smith\u2019s English translation came out last month in Britain, where it was well received.Ms. Han was born in 1970 in Gwangju. Her father, Han Seung-won, a novelist, struggled to make a living from his writing, and her family moved frequently when she was young. \u201cIt was too much for a little child, but I was all right because I was surrounded by books,\u201d she said.\u201cI was thinking about the spectrum of human behavior, from sublimity to horror, and wondered, is it really possible for humans to live a perfectly innocent life in this violent world, and what would happen if someone tried to achieve that?\u201d she said.She always intended to return to the plant woman, but wrote two other novels before returning to that theme around 2004.Ms. Han spent three years working on \u201cThe Vegetarian,\u201d which she wrote as three separate novellas. She has published three other novels since, but said she is still attached to her heroine and the story, which ends on an ambiguous note.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to describe Yeong-hye\u2019s death,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cI wanted to keep her alive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "TodayTix Makes Inroads Into Broadway\u2019s Ticketing Business", "Date": "2016-02-23", "News": "Supported byA theater industry start-up that is trying to corner a share of the byzantine Broadway ticketing business has raised nearly $16 million in venture capital and has expanded beyond New York to four other American cities and to London.TodayTix, which 26 months ago introduced a mobile app for selling discounted and full-price last-minute tickets, has already become a visible presence on Broadway, thanks to its red-jacketed agents (they wear red shirts in warmer weather) who deliver tickets outside theater doors. The company has made inroads into a ticketing world largely controlled by the theater owners themselves \u2014 TodayTix says it is currently selling 4 percent of all tickets to Broadway shows\u2014 and the company\u2019s executives believe that their emphasis on mobile technology and clarity in pricing will lure younger consumers.\u201cWe are focused on attracting a millennial audience that might find theater inaccessible,\u201d said Brian M. Fenty, one of the company\u2019s founders. \u201cPeople think the theater industry is very small and cottage, but it\u2019s a large business that we thought was ripe for innovation.\u201dTodayTix faces a variety of competitors as it continues to expand to other cities. And its innovations can be mimicked \u2014 it was the first company to offer a mobile lottery for deeply discounted last-minute tickets, but now such lotteries are widespread on Broadway.The tight-knit world of Broadway theater owners has not welcomed TodayTix. The company has been unable to negotiate agreements to electronically access inventory at Broadway theaters, so users of the TodayTix app choose theater sections and ticket prices, but not specific seats; TodayTix then sends couriers to the theater box offices to buy the tickets in person.In New York, the biggest players are the theater owners themselves: the Shubert Organization owns Telecharge and the Nederlander Organization has a long-term agreement with Ticketmaster. Asked about TodayTix, a spokesman for the Shubert Organization, which is the largest owner of Broadway theaters, declined to comment.Broadway has been booming in recent years \u2014 the last season, which ended in May, saw a record audience of 13 million people, and the 40 Broadway theaters grossed $1.365 billion. But to consumers, buying theater tickets can seem complex, with a dizzying array of websites offering discounts to many shows, and heavily marked-up tickets for sold-out hits being resold on the secondary market.Broadway has lagged behind other parts of the entertainment business in its embrace of technology such as mobile ticketing, but practices have been gradually changing. About half of all Broadway tickets are now purchased over the Internet, according to a new study of audience demographics by the Broadway League, and about 37 percent of Broadway tickets are purchased less than a week in advance. About 11 percent of Broadway tickets are sold at the TKTS booths.Beyond Broadway, TodayTix has had more success within the industry. The company said it has agreements with most of the major New York nonprofit theaters, including the Public Theater, as well as other performing arts institutions, including the Metropolitan Opera and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Outside New York, the company has partnerships with 157 theaters, so at many of those theaters TodayTix users can choose specific seats.TodayTix sells tickets only within a week of a performance date. It charges a $5 fee per ticket on those purchased in the United States, and another $5 per ticket if they are hand delivered to customers at the theater; for tickets purchased at theaters that partner with TodayTix, the company charges the theaters a commission of 5 percent plus credit card fees, and the tickets can be picked up at will-call.\u201cThey\u2019ve been able to do something mobile, and to sell at discount,\u201d Mr. Davenport said. \u201cIt was very successful for \u2018Spring\u2019 and for other shows I\u2019ve done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Warning on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Limits", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byLetter From AmericaInside the hurricane-force partisanship swirling around the capital, Washington has retained a singular bulwark for mainstream consensus: Federal Reserve stewardship of economic policy.Now, the bad news: The Fed may have reached the end of its ability to steer the economy, and it requires help from the White House and Congress.Yet growth remains modest. Income inequality remains stark. In recent weeks, volatility in the stock market and boisterous populism on the 2016 campaign trail have amplified fears about the economy\u2019s ability to raise living standards for most Americans.Mr. El-Erian, former chief executive of the bond-trading giant Pimco, considers those fears well founded. Not long ago, he observed in an interview, some analysts envisioned high finance as a new engine of United States growth in a globalized economy, a step up \u201cthe value-added chain,\u201d like earlier moves from agriculture to manufacturing to high technology.Recent economic history, however, has highlighted the limitations of reliance on the financial industry. It places an increasing proportion of income in the hands of wealthy Americans, who spend a smaller percentage of their income than the less affluent, suppressing demand. It fuels bubbles in the value of financial assets that destabilize markets when they burst. The Fed\u2019s stimulative tools operate through Wall Street, exacerbating those problems.What\u2019s vital now, Mr. El-Erian argues, are large-scale investments in the \u201creal economy\u201d with greater potential to create stable, widely distributed growth. They are measures only a president and Congress can take: improved public infrastructure, enhanced education and job training, an overhaul for a convoluted tax system rife with perverse incentives.That\u2019s enough to depress anyone watching Washington in recent years. Politicians have acknowledged the need to take such steps but have consistently proved unable to bridge partisan differences and take them.Results in the early stages of the 2016 campaign have increased pressure for Congress to act by highlighting the breadth of economic discontent among voters. But the divergent nature of the solutions proposed by both parties \u2014 tax cuts versus tax increases, smaller government versus ramped-up spending \u2014 point toward continued gridlock.A small glint of encouragement lies in Mr. El-Erian\u2019s assessment that even small steps from government can produce a virtuous cycle of productive investment by businesses awash in cash.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually take a Big Bang,\u201d Mr. El-Erian said. \u201cWashington just needs to deliver a small bang.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Libya, With \u2018Very Little Time Left\u2019", "Date": "2016-02-27", "News": "The Libya GambleThe fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi seemed to vindicate Hillary Clinton. Then militias refused to disarm, neighbors fanned a civil war, and the Islamic State found refuge.Supported by\u201cWe came, we saw, he died!\u201d she exclaimed.It was a brag sheet for a cabinet member eyeing a presidential race, and the Clinton team\u2019s eagerness to claim credit for her prompted eye-rolling at the White House and the Pentagon. Some joked that to hear her aides tell it, she had practically called in the airstrikes herself.But there were plenty of signs that the triumph would be short-lived, that the vacuum left by Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s death invited violence and division.The country\u2019s interim leaders seemed shockingly disengaged, he wrote. Mahmoud Jibril, the acting prime minister, who had helped persuade Mrs. Clinton to back the opposition, was commuting from Qatar, making only \u201ccameo\u201d appearances. A leading rebel general had been assassinated, underscoring the hazard of \u201crevenge killings.\u201d Islamists were moving aggressively to seize power, and members of the anti-Qaddafi coalition, notably Qatar, were financing them.On a task of the utmost urgency, disarming the militia fighters who had dethroned the dictator but now threatened the nation\u2019s unity, Mr. Feltman reported an alarming lassitude. Mr. Jibril and his associates, he wrote, \u201ctried to avert their eyes\u201d from the problem that militias could pose on \u201cthe Day After.\u201dIn short, the well-intentioned men who now nominally ran Libya were relying on \u201cluck, tribal discipline and the \u2018gentle character\u2019 of the Libyan people\u201d for a peaceful future. \u201cWe will continue to push on this,\u201d he wrote.In the ensuing months, Mr. Feltman\u2019s memo would prove hauntingly prescient. But Libya\u2019s Western allies, preoccupied by domestic politics and the crisis in Syria, would soon relegate the country to the back burner.And Mrs. Clinton would be mostly a bystander as the country dissolved into chaos, leading to a civil war that would destabilize the region, fueling the refugee crisis in Europe and allowing the Islamic State to establish a Libyan haven that the United States is now desperately trying to contain.\u201cNobody will say it\u2019s too late. No one wants to say it,\u201d said Mahmud Shammam, who served as chief spokesman for the interim government. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid there is very little time left for Libya.\u201dMedia reports referred to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s one brief visit to Libya in October 2011 as a \u201cvictory lap,\u201d but the declaration was decidedly premature. Security precautions were extraordinary, with ships positioned off the coast in case an emergency evacuation was needed. As it turned out, there was no violence. But the wild celebratory scenes in the Libyan capital that day actually highlighted the divisions in the new order.At a hospital, a university and government offices, Mrs. Clinton posed for photos with the Western-educated interim leaders and hailed the promise of democracy.\u201cI am proud to stand here on the soil of a free Libya,\u201d she declared, standing alongside a beaming Mr. Jibril. \u201cIt is a great privilege to see a new future for Libya being born. And indeed, the work ahead is quite challenging, but the Libyan people have demonstrated the resolve and resilience necessary to achieve their goals.\u201dBut everywhere Mrs. Clinton went, there was the other face of the rebellion. Crowds of Kalashnikov-toting fighters \u2014 the thuwar, or revolutionaries, as they called themselves \u2014 mobbed her motorcade and pushed to glimpse the American celebrity. Mostly they cheered, and Mrs. Clinton remained poised and unrattled, but her security detail watched the pandemonium with white-knuckled concern.At the University of Tripoli, students were trampling wall hangings of Colonel Qaddafi that had been pulled to the ground, recalled Harold Koh, the State Department\u2019s top lawyer, who had flown in with Mrs. Clinton on an American military aircraft. One grateful student pointed out the gallows where anti-Qaddafi protesters had been hanged, while others wondered what the United States might do to help win the peace.\u201cWe know what the U.S. can do with bombs,\u201d one student told Mr. Koh. \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201dWhen Mrs. Clinton\u2019s entourage finally departed, Gene A. Cretz, the American ambassador, wrote a relieved email to Cheryl Mills, the secretary of state\u2019s chief of staff. The visit, he wrote, had been \u201cpicture perfect given the chaos we labor under in Libya.\u201dMrs. Clinton certainly understood how hard the transition to a post-Qaddafi Libya would be. In February, before the allied bombing began, she noted that political change in Egypt had proved tumultuous despite strong institutions.\"So imagine how difficult it will be in a country like Libya,\u201d she had said. \u201cQaddafi ruled for 42 years by basically destroying all institutions and never even creating an army, so that it could not be used against him.\u201dEarly on, the president\u2019s national security adviser, Tom Donilon, had created a planning group called \u201cPost-Q.\u201d Mrs. Clinton helped organize the Libya Contact Group, a powerhouse collection of countries that had pledged to work for a stable and prosperous future. By early 2012, she had flown to a dozen international meetings on Libya, part of a grueling schedule of official travel in which she kept competitive track of miles traveled and countries visited.Dennis B. Ross, a veteran Middle East expert at the National Security Council, had argued unsuccessfully for an outside peacekeeping force. But with oil beginning to flow again from Libyan wells, he was pleasantly surprised by how things seemed to be going.\u201cI had unease that there wasn\u2019t more being done more quickly to create cohesive security forces,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cBut the last six months of 2011, there was a fair amount of optimism.\u201dEven so, the gulf separating the suave English speakers of the interim government from the thuwar was becoming more and more pronounced.After decades in exile, some leaders were more familiar with American and European universities than with Libyan tribes and the militias that had sprung from them. Others, like Mr. Jibril, were suspect in some quarters because of previous roles in the Qaddafi regime. It was increasingly evident that the ragtag populist army that had actually done the fighting against Colonel Qaddafi was not taking orders from the men in suits who believed they were Libya\u2019s new leaders.\u201cIt should have been clear to anyone,\u201d said Mohammed Ali Abdallah, an opposition member who now heads a leading political party, \u201cthat there were clear contradictions in the makeup of the opposition and that unity could not last.\u201dJeremy Shapiro, who handled Libya on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy staff, said the administration was looking for \u201cthe unifier \u2014 the Nelson Mandela.\u201d He added: \u201cThat was why Jibril was so attractive. We were always saying, \u2018This is the guy who can appeal to all the factions.\u2019 What we should have been looking for \u2014 but we were never good at playing that game \u2014 is a power balance.\u201dUnder the circumstances, Libya\u2019s push for elections by July 2012, nine months after Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s death, appeared to some to be premature. But the schedule fulfilled the opposition\u2019s promises to the West and had the backing of competing factions.\u201cSuddenly you had people who belonged to political parties,\u201d said Abdurrazag Mukhtar, a member of the interim government who lived in California for many years and is now Libya\u2019s ambassador to Turkey. \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood. Jibril. All these guys thinking, \u2018Time for an election.\u2019\u201d\u201cBut we were not ready,\u201d he said. \u201cYou needed a road map for security first.\u201dBy January 2012, there was an unmistakable drumbeat of trouble.His popularity sagging, Mr. Jibril had stepped down as transitional prime minister. A prominent Muslim scholar had accused him of guiding the nation toward a \u201cnew era of tyranny and dictatorship.\u201d In a deal struck between two powerful militias, he was replaced by Abdurrahim el-Keib, an engineering professor who had taught for years at the University of Alabama.The memo detailed the roiling tensions between Islamists and secularists over the role of Islamic law, fighting between rival militias associated with two different towns and four visits to Mr. Keib\u2019s office by \u201cangry militiamen\u201d demanding concessions.Such alarming reports might have been expected to spur action in Washington. They did not.Libya, Mr. Ross said, \u201cwas farmed out to the working level.\u201dThe inattention was not just neglect. It was policy.\u201cThe president was like, \u2018We are not looking to do another Iraq,\u2019\u201d said Derek Chollet, then handling Libya for the National Security Council. \u201cAnd by the way, the Europeans were all along saying: \u2018No, no, no, we\u2019re doing this. We got it. We believe in Libya. This is in our neighborhood.\u2019\u201dArchitects of the Libyan intervention lament its aftermath.So the president and the National Security Council set what one official called \u201cfierce limits\u201d on the American role: The United States would provide help only when it could offer a unique capability, only when Libya explicitly requested the services and only when Libya paid for them with its oil revenue. In practice, those conditions meant the United States would do very little.The neglect was made easier by the Libyans themselves. Displaying both na\u00efvet\u00e9 and nationalism, the interim leaders insisted, at least in public, that they wanted no outside interference. They were so wary of foreign troops that they refused to let the United Nations maintain a basic security force to protect its compound.\u201cThey were very keen to take responsibility for their country,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cAnd we were very keen to let them, for our own reasons. So there was a sort of conspiracy there.\u201dAs the months passed and the factional fighting grew worse, Mrs. Clinton pressed for the administration to do more, asking the Pentagon, for example, to help train security forces. But she was boxed in by the president\u2019s strictures and the Libyans\u2019 resistance.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re twisting yourself into a pretzel to try to say, \u2018O.K., we won\u2019t have boots on the ground, but we know we got to do something,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ross said.Even modest proposals foundered. When Mrs. Clinton proposed sending a hospital ship to treat wounded Libyan fighters, the National Security Council rejected the idea, aides said.But whatever her misgivings, Mrs. Clinton prized her relationship with the president and respected his authority to set policy. So she went along, as disciplined as ever.Andrew Shapiro was trying to make the best of a bad situation. He had to explain what the United States was doing to secure the vast military arsenal that Colonel Qaddafi had left behind \u2014 a notable exception to the hands-off policy.Speaking in Washington in February 2012, Mr. Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, described efforts to \u201cgalvanize an international response\u201d to find and destroy arms caches. But he acknowledged that the $40 million program Mrs. Clinton had announced was not going as well as hoped, even when it came to the most worrisome weapons, the Manpads, shoulder-fired missiles capable of shooting down an airliner.\u201cHow many are still missing? The frank answer is we don\u2019t know and probably never will,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cWe cannot rule out that some weapons may have leaked out of Libya.\u201dThe covert coals-to-Newcastle effort to arm the rebels during the revolution was the least of it. The dictator had stashed an astonishing quantity of weapons in the desert.\u201cWe knew he had a lot, but he had 10 times that,\u201d said Jean-David Levitte, then a top aide to Mr. Sarkozy.While the C.I.A. moved quickly to secure Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s chemical weapons, other efforts fell short. \u201cThere was one arsenal that we thought had 20,000 shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missiles, SA-7s, that basically just disappeared into the maw of the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d recalled Robert M. Gates, the American defense secretary at the time.A major stumbling block was that the Obama administration was negotiating with interim Libyan ministers as if they represented a unified government. In fact, they were often rivals, jockeying for power in advance of the elections.\u201cI know this sounds incredible, but for months and months and months on end we could not get anyone in authority in the government to just sign an agreement on anything, including our detailed offers of security assistance,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, then the top security aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cThere was total paralysis.\u201dWhen it came to securing weapons, the Americans\u2019 initial idea \u2014 to give the interim government assistance to buy them back itself \u2014 foundered when the Libyan ministers failed to carry out the program, several Libyan officials said.So the State Department, working with the C.I.A., was left to try to strike its own deals with the militias. But there was little incentive to sell. As Mr. Shammam, the former spokesman for the interim government, put it: \u201cHow are you going to buy a Kalashnikov for $1,000? With a Kalashnikov, someone can make $1,000 a day kidnapping people.\u201d\u201cIf you want to buy weapons, you have to control the border,\u201d Mr. Zeidan said, adding that the failure to do that led fighters to \u201csell them, get more and sell them again.\u201dAsked by a reporter that spring why it was so difficult for the United States to \u201cget it right\u201d when it intervened in the Middle East, Mrs. Clinton was still holding up Libya as a model of success. \u201cI would take issue with the premise of that question,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, who declined to be interviewed for these articles.But she was well aware of the deteriorating security situation.\u201cContinuing rivalries among the militias remain dangerous from the perspective of the havoc they can wreak with their firepower,\u201d he wrote to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy adviser, Mr. Sullivan, who sent it on to her.In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s inner circle, the boasting about her achievements in Libya had given way to a \u201cnagging worry that it would go south,\u201d one senior aide said. The aide recalled being instructed jokingly by Mr. Sullivan \u201cto make sure that didn\u2019t happen\u201d before the American presidential election in November.The next month, with crowds in Tripoli chanting that the \u201cblood of the martyrs will not be wasted,\u201d power was handed over to the newly elected General National Congress, the first peaceful transition in Libya\u2019s history.Mrs. Clinton, who one aide said privately shared the worry that the country was not ready for elections, nevertheless congratulated the Libyans on \u201cthis historic milestone.\u201d\u201cNow the hard work really begins to build an effective, transparent government that unifies the country,\u201d she said.But unity was already impossible.\u201cIn a sense it was lost from the beginning,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Araud, France\u2019s ambassador to the United States and an early advocate of the intervention. \u201cIt was the same mistake you made in Iraq. You organize elections in a country with no experience of compromise or political parties. So you have an election, and you think that everything is solved. But eventually tribal realities come back to haunt the country.\u201dWhile the Americans struggled against weapons proliferation and hoped for the best, a former rebel officer took on the problem at the core of Libya\u2019s predicament: disbanding the volatile forces that had ousted Colonel Qaddafi and helping the fighters find a place in a peaceful new Libya. The officer, M. Mustafa El Sagezli, would never meet Mrs. Clinton. But the outcome of his lonely campaign would decide to a considerable degree Libya's place in her record as secretary of state.As deputy commander of the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, one of the largest and most capable rebel militias, Mr. Sagezli had tried his best to look after his recruits. It was, he felt, an obligation that did not end with the revolution.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked the fighters. \u201cWhat are your dreams?\u201dTheir modest answers surprised and encouraged him.\u201cSome were very simple dreams,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Help us get married.\u2019 Some wanted a scholarship.\u201dThe transitional government soon set up a Warriors Affairs Commission, headed by Mr. Sagezli. Many of the 162,000 former fighters it registered were illiterate and needed education. Some wanted to join a police force or a new army, but nearly half hoped to start small businesses.Mr. Sagezli said he had taken a proposal to the transitional government: The Labor Ministry could help would-be businessmen, the Interior Ministry could train customs and police officers, the Defense Ministry would absorb others into a national army, and so on.It was ambitious, but the government had plenty of money; Mrs. Clinton had worked hard to free up billions of dollars in Libyan assets that had been frozen by anti-Qaddafi sanctions. Her view, said one top aide, was that if the interim government \u201ccouldn\u2019t rule by force, let them rule by finance.\u201dBut instead of giving priority to demobilizing the militias, as an aide said Mrs. Clinton had hoped, the transitional regime simply began paying fighters salaries that many viewed as protection money. In one illustrative incident in May 2012, Kikla militiamen stormed the office of Mr. Keib, the interim prime minister, demanding back pay as gunfire filled the air.\u201cDon\u2019t give them salaries for nothing,\u201d Mr. Sagezli recalls begging. \u201cGiving a commander money means giving strength to the militias, more loyalty for the commander, more armaments and more corruption. They never listened.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cthe politicians started bribing them to buy loyalty.\u201dWith the July elections, precedent became political imperative.In the run-up to the vote, a powerful militia shut down roads to press its demand that its eastern Libyan region have a greater say when the incoming Parliament drafted a constitution. The authorities capitulated, leaving the writing of the constitution for a second assembly to be elected later, with more seats from the east.That, in turn, made it harder to disarm the militias, since each faction and town knew its weapons might be needed to protect its interests in the constitutional process. That was how the game would be played.Mr. Zeidan, who became prime minister in November 2012, financed a few of Mr. Sagezli\u2019s programs. But he continued to pay off militia leaders. Political parties aligned themselves with various commanders, and with no army or police force to carry out their will, the elected officials became increasingly dependent on the fighters extorting them.Haig Melkessetian, a former American intelligence operative whose company provided security for European embassies in Libya, described militia rule as \u201canarchy \u2014 there\u2019s just no other word for it.\u201d\u201cWe had to have five or six IDs to be able to pass, depending on the street,\u201d he said.But if there was any pressure from American or European officials to stop the government payoffs, he said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t loud enough.\u201dThe American ambassador was hearing it from both sides.Officials from Libya\u2019s moderate governing coalition were demanding that the United States stop the wealthy nation of Qatar from sending money and arms to militias aligned with Libya\u2019s Islamist political bloc. The Islamists, in turn, were accusing a rival gulf power, the United Arab Emirates, of providing similar patronage to fighters aligned with their political enemies.The shipments violated a United Nations arms embargo. But Mr. Stevens told Mr. Abdallah, the Libyan party chief, that when he raised the issue with his Qatari and Emirati counterparts, he was met either with outright denials or with protestations that the shipments had gone through blessed official channels, namely government ministers aligned with various factions.\u201cWhen I go to the U.A.E., they say, \u2018I\u2019m dealing with the minister of defense \u2014 how much more official can I get?\u2019\u201d Mr. Abdallah recalled the ambassador saying.It was bad enough that Libya\u2019s elected officials lacked the will to force militias to lay down the arms they already possessed. Now, with Libya veering toward civil war, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 waging a broader war for influence throughout the region \u2014 were providing opposing militia commanders with back-channel resupply routes.In Washington, though, it was the Islamists\u2019 patrons, the Qataris, who were of paramount concern.During the 2011 Libyan revolution, Mrs. Clinton had successfully pushed the administration to take a direct role in arming opposition groups, hoping that would persuade the Qataris to stop sending weapons to extremist rebel factions. Though that clearly had not worked, she explored a similar play as she wrangled with what to do about \u201cthe Qatar problem\u201d in 2012, aides said.Mrs. Clinton was already pushing for an aggressive American program to arm and train Syrian rebels trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad. What if she could secure what one top aide called a \u201cbank shot\u201d deal in which the United States would provide assistance to certain of Qatar\u2019s allies in Syria in return for Qatar\u2019s dropping its support for Islamist militias in Libya?But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s activist streak ran up against President Obama\u2019s deep wariness of further entanglement in the Middle East, and she lost the debate on arming the Syrian opposition. With no carrot to offer the Qataris, she asked aides to prepare a memo on how the United States might wield a stick.Mrs. Clinton typically relied heavily on a tiny circle of close advisers. But facing a thorny problem, she sometimes convened a larger group, 15 or more aides, in her outer office, where her long sofa sat beneath a window with a view of the Lincoln Memorial.\u201cShe really liked to get people to think through the what-if pieces \u2014 what if we do this, what are the consequences of doing that, and exploring alternatives,\u201d said James B. Steinberg, her deputy secretary of state.Some advisers suggested trimming military aid to Qatar or threatening to move American military assets elsewhere in the region. But Middle East hands at the State Department pushed back, saying that pressuring the gulf monarchy would only backfire. And the Defense Department strongly objected: It had a 20-year history of close cooperation with Qatar, which hosted critical American military bases.In the end, there was no appetite for anything beyond quiet diplomacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do nearly enough,\u201d said Mr. Ross, who also explored ways to \u201craise the price\u201d on Qatar, to no avail.Only last year did President Obama rebuke the nations meddling in Libya, and by then it was too late.\u201cThey created the monsters we are dealing with today,\u201d Mr. Abdallah said, \u201cwhich is these militias that are so empowered they will never subordinate themselves to any government.\u201dOn Aug. 8, 2012, a month after the elections, Mr. Stevens, the American ambassador, signed off on a cable sent to Washington titled \"The Guns of August,\u201d playing on the title of a classic history of the first days of World War I. It described Benghazi as moving \u201cfrom trepidation to euphoria and back as a series of violent incidents has dominated the political landscape\u201d and warned of \u201ca security vacuum.\u201dIn the assaults on the diplomatic compound and nearby C.I.A. annex, the most worrisome trends in the country came together: the feeble central government, the breakdown of law and order, the rise of militants and the months of minimal attention from Washington. Republicans quickly seized on the episode for what would become years of inquiries, hearings and fund-raising focused on Mrs. Clinton.If the attempt to pin blame for the Benghazi attack on Mrs. Clinton would largely fail, the notion that the Libyan intervention was among her successes had become steadily more threadbare. Libya would not conform, either as cudgel or brag, to the needs of American politics.For 733 migrants crammed aboard two tiny boats somewhere between Libya and Italy, a leaky hull was neither the beginning nor the end of their troubles.The weapons that had made it so hard to stabilize Libya were turning up in Syria, Tunisia, Algeria, Mali, Niger, Chad, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Egypt and Gaza, often in the hands of terrorists, insurgents or criminals.In the fall of 2012, American intelligence agencies produced a classified assessment of the proliferation of arms from Libya. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u201d said Michael T. Flynn, then head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had that kind of proliferation of weapons since really the end of the Vietnam War.\u201dA cynical line would begin to circulate in Washington: In Iraq, the United States had intervened and occupied \u2014 and things had gone to hell. In Libya, the United States had intervened but not occupied \u2014 and things had gone to hell. And in Syria, the United States had neither intervened nor occupied \u2014 and things had still gone to hell.It was a dark jest designed to shift blame from baffled American policy makers to a troubled region. But it raised a serious question about Libya: If overthrowing a hated dictator in a small and relatively rich country produced such epic troubles, was American intervention ever justified?\u201cIt\u2019s true that things went wrong,\u201d said Mr. Sagezli, of the warriors commission. \u201cBut from a Libyan point of view, things could not go right. We had 42 years of Qaddafi\u2019s rule, no infrastructure, a terrible education system, thousands of political prisoners, divisions among tribes, destruction of the army. When you have such a state, when you take out the dictator, it\u2019s like taking the cover off the pot.\u201dGiven that background, Ms. Whitson, who monitored Libya for Human Rights Watch, thought the United States\u2019 failure to follow up was unforgivable.\u201cIf you are going to carry out a military intervention to decapitate the government, you are making a commitment to the stability of that country over the long haul,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing nothing, as we did here? A bunch of eighth graders can agree that is not an approach that is going to work.\u201dThe history that Mrs. Clinton often cited should have been instructive, Ms. Whitson said. \u201cIn Bosnia, yes, we intervened. But there\u2019s been peacekeeping troops there for 20 years,\u201d she said.Strikingly, President Obama said in 2014 that such criticism was just, and that Libya had provided his biggest lesson in foreign policy.But Mr. Obama said the United States and its allies \u201cunderestimated the need to come in full force\u201d after the dictator\u2019s fall. The Libyan experience, he said, is \u201ca lesson that I now apply every time I ask the question: Should we intervene militarily? Do we have an answer for the day after?\u201dLibya, aides say, has strongly reinforced the president\u2019s reluctance to move more decisively in Syria. \u201cLiterally, this has given him pause about what would be required if you eliminated the Syrian state,\u201d a top adviser said.She has said the military alliance that overthrew Colonel Qaddafi represented \u201csmart power at its best,\u201d but called Libya \u201ca classic case of a hard choice.\u201d Mostly, she has insisted that history\u2019s judgment on the intervention, and her role in it, are not yet final.\u201cI think it sometimes shows American impatience,\u201d she said in 2014, \u201cthat, \u2018O.K., you got rid of this dictator who destroyed institutions. Why aren\u2019t you behaving like a mature democracy?\u2019 That doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201dYet if, for Mr. Obama, the Libyan experience has underscored doubts about the United States\u2019 power to shape outcomes in other countries, it has demonstrated for Mrs. Clinton just how crucial an American presence can be.\u201cWe have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences,\u201d she said at a House hearing on Benghazi in October, articulating what sounded like a guiding principle. \u201cExtremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.\u201dScott Shane reported from New York and Washington, and Jo Becker from Cairo; Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey; Tunis; Paris; New York; and Washington.

About 25 percent of all Berkeley undergraduates this year are from other states and countries, up from 16 percent in 2011-12, the university said.But Ms. Napolitano said at the time that the system needed more money, whether through state aid or tuition increases. Out-of-state and international students pay higher rates than California residents.In a budget deal in May, Mr. Brown agreed to provide millions of dollars more to the university system, in exchange for a tuition freeze for in-state students until 2017-18. Out-of-state tuition was allowed to increase.Ms. Napolitano said in a statement on Wednesday that she supported the plan, while Mr. Brown declined to comment on it.A spokesman for the state\u2019s Department of Finance said the governor had committed to nearly $3.4 billion in additional funding for the entire university system over five years.Mr. Dirks said the fundamental math was still bad. Even with the increases across the state, the greatly reduced level of state support for Berkeley \u201cis here to stay,\u201d he said in a telephone press conference. \u201cThere might be a little movement up, a little movement down. It\u2019s not as volatile as the stock market.\u201dHe said Berkeley had become increasingly dependent on tuition and fees, now accounting for nearly 30 percent of total campus revenues, while state funding had dropped to about 13 percent of the budget. It was roughly half in the 1980s, Berkeley officials said.The chancellor compared Berkeley\u2019s problems to those faced by many public universities that had lost state funding since the 2008 recession, though Berkeley\u2019s position appears to be more secure than those of some other flagship state universities.\u201cWhat we are engaged in here is a fundamental defense of the concept of the public university, a concept that we must reinvent in order to preserve,\u201d Mr. Dirks said.But there is a sharp debate over whether the system\u2019s elite campuses, Berkeley and U.C.L.A., are taking too many high-paying out-of-state and international students at the expense of a growing population of lower-paying California residents who want to go to state universities.Of the 10 University of California campuses, Berkeley and U.C.L.A. are the most in demand among out-of-state and foreign students.Out-of-state undergraduate students pay $38,140 in tuition and fees a year, roughly triple the amount paid by residents, $13,432, the university said.The chancellor said that some academic departments could be restructured or combined \u2014 a move that would probably face resistance from faculty members \u2014 and that the committee would seek ways to address a spending gap in intercollegiate athletics. He also said the university would work to increase alumni donations. The changes will be phased in beginning in July, Mr. Dirks said.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Left-Leaning Economists Question Cost of Bernie Sanders\u2019s Plans", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byHis campaign strongly contests both critiques, defending its numbers and attacking prominent critics as Clinton sympathizers and industry consultants.Mr. Sanders on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d defended his comment in a debate Thursday that critics have assailed: \u201cA family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 more in taxes and get a reduction in their health costs of $5,000.\u201dBy the reckoning of the left-of-center economists, none of whom are working for Mrs. Clinton, the proposals would add $2 trillion to $3 trillion a year on average to federal spending; by comparison, total federal spending is projected to be above $4 trillion in the next president\u2019s first year. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t remotely add up,\u201d said Austan Goolsbee, formerly chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, now at the University of Chicago.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.Mrs. Clinton has also proposed tax increases on the rich and corporations to pay for her agenda, which she estimates would cost an additional $100 billion a year, or $1.2 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan includes a new, across-the-board 2.2 percent income tax to help pay for his single-payer, government-run health plan for all. But progressive economists and business groups say middle-class taxpayers would pay more for the European-style social welfare state that Mr. Sanders envisions.It is not just Mr. Sanders\u2019s assumptions for health savings that critics contest. Jared Bernstein, the former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, examined a paper by the economist advising Mr. Sanders, Gerald Friedman of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, that is circulating on the left.While calling Mr. Friedman\u2019s work a good effort, Mr. Bernstein cited several assumptions as \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d Among them were minimal health-cost inflation, economic growth reaching 5.3 percent and, in that heated-up economy, no action from the Federal Reserve to apply brakes.\u201cWe need a deep investment in infrastructure, more efficient health care and less student debt,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cBut when you put it all together, government\u2019s role in the economy goes well beyond anything we\u2019ve ever considered.\u201d He said protecting the Affordable Care Act against Republican opposition should be a higher priority \u2014 a critique echoed by Mrs. Clinton.But he called it a \u201cfairy tale\u201d in this political climate. Along with other economists in a \u201clefty chat group\u201d he joins online, Mr. Aaron said, he believes that if Mr. Sanders were elected and fought for a single-payer plan, it \u201cwould rapidly destroy his administration by using up every ounce of political capital he\u2019s got.\u201dOn his campaign website, Mr. Sanders proposes more than $18 trillion in new spending over 10 years; he does not account for some ideas he favors, like universal prekindergarten and child care, that could put the total above $20 trillion. About $14 trillion of the total is for health care; the rest is chiefly for infrastructure, free college, Social Security, paid family leave and clean-energy initiatives.Adding $20 trillion to projected federal spending would mean about a 37 percent increase in spending through the 2026 fiscal year \u2014 close to the 40 percent that Mrs. Clinton suggested. But Kenneth E. Thorpe, a prominent health policy economist at Emory University who advised the Clintons in the 1990s, recently concluded that Mr. Sanders\u2019s health plan would cost $27 trillion, not $14 trillion, which would put total spending for all of his initiatives above $30 trillion through 2026.Mr. Thorpe in recent years helped Gov. Peter Shumlin in Mr. Sanders\u2019s home state of Vermont design a single-payer plan there. It was unsuccessful.\u201cThe problem was that the price tag and the amount of disruption and redistribution was just so enormous,\u201d Mr. Thorpe said of Mr. Shumlin\u2019s efforts, \u201cthat he just had to drop it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Massacre, San Bernardino Police Stare Down Crippling Cuts", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported bySAN BERNARDINO, Calif. \u2014 Detective Ryan Wicks trained the headlights of his Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor on a young man spotted fleeing local gang members and climbed out of his car, a battered black-and-white cruiser of mid-2000s vintage. The odometer stood north of 95,000 miles. A rear fender was scarred by the belt buckles of hundreds of suspects who had been spread-eagled against it.Having uncovered a butcher knife and delivered a warning, Detective Wicks settled back into the driver\u2019s seat and felt something blocking a foot. He looked down.\u201cMy speaker\u2019s on the floor,\u201d he said.Since the city went bankrupt in 2012, its tax base swept away by the Great Recession, officers have retired or moved to other departments in droves. \u201cWe had an exodus, everyone jumping ship,\u201d Detective Wicks said.Jarrod Burguan, the department\u2019s chief and a 24-year veteran of the force, said the slide had been tough. \u201cWe\u2019d never been an agency before that people left for other departments \u2014 the type of place where people said, \u2018I don\u2019t like working here,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we attracted guys because it was a place where it\u2019s fun being a cop.\u201dThere are signs, however, of an inflection point for the struggling force. In November, Chief Burguan proposed a five-year, $50.6 million rebuilding plan, adding officers \u2014 and, yes, new cruisers \u2014 to combat what F.B.I. data say is one of California\u2019s highest crime rates.San Bernardino has long been a cop\u2019s kind of town, where drugs, gang wars and the manifold problems of a large lower-income population gave rookies more action \u2014 and valuable experience \u2014 than a cushy suburban assignment would ever offer. A city of about 215,000 people, half Hispanic, San Bernardino suffered in past decades as its biggest employers \u2014 an Air Force base, a nearby steel mill \u2014 were shuttered. At the same time, criminal gangs began moving in, forced from Los Angeles by a police crackdown and gentrifying slums.Today, about 30 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Hispanic, black and white nationalist gangs claim portions of poorer northern and western neighborhoods and account for about nine in 10 homicides, said Lt. Richard Lawhead, the department\u2019s spokesman.Hispanic gangs controlled by a prison gang, the Mexican Mafia, ship and sell heroin, methamphetamine and other drugs smuggled from Mexico about 100 miles south.San Bernardino once deployed a much larger force against that threat. But that created a huge obligation to the state-run pension system to finance an unusually generous retirement package. Officers can retire at 50 and collect 3 percent of their highest salary for every year of service. Many stay longer, further raising pension obligations. In 2000, the city contribution to the state pension fund equaled 14 percent of police officers\u2019 and firefighters\u2019 pay. By 2012, it was 39 percent.The Great Recession saddled San Bernardino with one of the nation\u2019s highest home-foreclosure rates and gutted its property tax revenues. By the time officials declared bankruptcy in August 2012, police officers had agreed to shoulder more of their pension costs, reducing their take-home pay by nearly 15 percent. Amid talk that the county sheriff\u2019s department might take over policing, San Bernardino officers fled to more secure jobs.At its peak in 2008, the department employed 346 sworn officers. Today, there are about 220 \u2014 a 36 percent reduction.The effect of those cuts has been palpable. The narcotics and vice division lost half of its 16 narcotics officers; the team that policed street sales was disbanded. Four community-policing offices, each with four officers, have shrunk to one four-person team covering the entire city.The traffic division, reduced by more than half, no longer polices streets at night. Officers no longer respond to noninjury auto accidents. City traffic deaths hit a record high in 2015.Fewer crimes are being solved as well. Officers cleared 14.6 percent of robberies last year, compared with 22 percent in 2012, and 20 percent of aggravated assaults, compared with more than 51 percent in 2012. Cleared vehicle thefts dropped 40 percent.The average time to respond to a call for help has risen drastically since 2010, by 75 percent for the most serious emergencies and 190 percent over all. \u201cWe had a guy who came in here with a bag, loaded it with what he wanted and walked out the back door,\u201d said Linda Sutherland, who owns the downtown Fun Corner costume shop with her husband, Steve. \u201cWe called the police, and they said: \u2018We can\u2019t arrest him. We don\u2019t have the resources.\u2019\u00a0\u201dNick Gonzalez, who heads the Arrowhead Neighborhood Association in northern San Bernardino, said officers were hardly to blame. \u201cYou have the bad guys moving in and the cops trying to keep them in line, but it\u2019s an impossible task,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t compete.\u201dDetective Wicks, at 39 a 12-year veteran, called such judgments too harsh, but he said the sheer volume of calls forced officers to focus on serious crimes at the expense of petty ones.On summer nights, he said, his onboard computer screen may list 50 and even 75 calls awaiting response by the 30 or so officers on patrol. Although a recent evening patrol was unusually slow, he was working an extra three and a half hours to fill a gap in coverage.Yet an upswing may be at hand. Chief Burguan, who was promoted in 2013, said he hoped a restructuring would place more officers on the street and improve coordination among divisions. The police officers\u2019 union, which might have been expected to oppose parts of the proposal, instead has embraced it.Already, the chief has hired civilians at lower cost to replace sworn officers who held desk jobs. His plan envisions rebuilding the force to 320 officers and upgrading ancient office and cruiser computers and the cruiser fleet, half of which is more than 10 years old.The plan awaits a bankruptcy judge\u2019s approval. A major creditor has suggested it might oppose the plan. But hints of a revival are already appearing. The turnover of police officers, which peaked in 2014, dropped more than a third last year. A recent job fair drew a throng of potential applicants. And the department\u2019s performance during the attack in December has lifted morale and, officials hope, its reputation.\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of stabilized,\u201d said Eric McBride, the deputy chief. \u201cWe were thrust into the limelight a bit, and people said: \u2018Hey, those San Bernardino guys were kicked around. But they performed.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Streetcar Service Proposed by Mayor de Blasio May Require 2 New Bridges", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported byThe Brooklyn-Queens streetcar proposed by Mayor Bill de Blasio could require the construction of two new bridges, one over Newtown Creek and a second over the Gowanus Canal, a top administration official said on Friday.At a briefing for reporters, the official, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen, and other administration leaders made public new details about the streetcar proposal, with the potential need for the two bridges among the most notable and expensive elements of the planned system, which would run between Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and Astoria, Queens.While the exact route has not been finalized, Ms. Glen said, planners have determined that the Pulaski Bridge, between Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and Long Island City, Queens, and the bridge that traverses the Gowanus Canal at Hamilton Avenue near Red Hook, Brooklyn, may not be able to accommodate streetcars.The new bridges, which would be covered under the project\u2019s estimated $2.5 billion cost, could also include paths for bicyclists and pedestrians, Ms. Glen said.In the two weeks since Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, announced the proposal, some experts have raised concerns about problems with streetcars in other cities and have questioned whether other parts of New York City have more pressing transit needs.Mr. de Blasio, at a news conference on Tuesday during which he championed the proposal, said the streetcar would connect a string of booming neighborhoods where rising real estate tax revenue would provide a compelling opportunity to finance the system.Ms. Glen said that in a so-called fatal-flaw analysis, city officials had found that there would be major challenges to building the system but that it was feasible.The city will start meeting with local residents in the affected neighborhoods soon to get feedback on the route, officials said. One major challenge will be deciding how much underground infrastructure, like utilities and sewer lines, must be moved.Polly Trottenberg, the city\u2019s transportation commissioner, said at the briefing that the project would most likely require the removal of hundreds of street parking spaces \u2014 an idea that could face resistance from residents. Earlier in the week, Mr. de Blasio said that some parking would be lost but that officials would seek to minimize the impact.\u201cI think given the many, many benefits of the project, it will more than be appropriate in terms of any trade-off with parking,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.Building two new bridges would make the city\u2019s timeline for completing the project \u2014 officials have pushed for a 2024 opening \u2014 even more difficult to achieve, said Jon Orcutt, a critic of the plan and a spokesman for TransitCenter, a transportation nonprofit.\u201cThe biggest concern is these kinds of transit projects haven\u2019t performed well and have been difficult to implement,\u201d Mr. Orcutt said of streetcar plans across the country. \u201cThis one is much bigger than what we\u2019ve seen elsewhere.\u201dThe New York proposal would dwarf other recent streetcar systems in the United States. The city envisions 30 stops over a 16-mile route and 60 streetcar vehicles. A new streetcar in Washington, which is scheduled to open next weekend after years of delays, is a 2.4-mile route with five vehicles, though the city wants to expand.Another issue in New York is whether riders would be able to use MetroCards on the streetcar and transfer to buses or subways for free. The city said it would work with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state-controlled agency that runs subway and bus lines, to reach an agreement to allow for transfers.A spokesman for the authority, Adam Lisberg, said in a statement that the agency was looking forward to learning more about the city\u2019s proposal.In many ways, the city\u2019s plan parallels a study commissioned by a nonprofit called Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector that examines how a waterfront streetcar could work and the effect it might have on the local economy. The 184-page study provides a detailed look at the possible costs attached to such a system, including $427 million for utility relocation and $260 million for 52 streetcar vehicles.The study recommends two facilities for maintenance and storage, at a cost of $100 million. The system would need at least 140 employees to operate the streetcars and a host of other workers, including traffic enforcement agents, according to the study.Among the local leaders involved with the nonprofit are Helena Durst, of the Durst Organization, and Jed Walentas, of Two Trees Management, along with others from business and transportation groups, including Transportation Alternatives and the Regional Plan Association.Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who worked on the study, said that he expected more criticism of the proposal and that he was prepared to win over New Yorkers.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a great project built that doesn\u2019t have people complaining,\u201d he said, \u201cand when it comes to a parking spot, a lot of people believe that was guaranteed in the Constitution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Do you want to know why?\u201dThen she muddled through an explanation of exchange rates and cheaper exports, only to trail off with an admission that she was still confused. But in the end, Ms. Legaretta and Mr. Araiza agreed, Mexicans should not worry about the tumbling peso unless they hanker for expensive imports.But her breathless introduction to economics did nothing to soothe Mexican consumers\u2019 worries: The peso has fallen more than 30 percent against the dollar over the past year, with an especially sharp drop this week.In Mexico, where currency collapses have led to triple-digit inflation and deep recessions, the peso\u2019s tumble creates rising anxiety.\u201cFor many generations in Mexico, a weaker peso has generally been associated with a crisis,\u201d said Alonso Cervera, the managing director for Latin America economics at Credit Suisse. \u201cNot everyone understands that the causes are external.\u201dOne of those causes is the fall in oil prices, which saps market confidence in oil exporters like Mexico. The government here relies on oil revenues to finance part of the budget, and the price drop has already forced budget cuts. Last week the president of the central bank, Agust\u00edn Carstens, insisted that more cutbacks were needed to avoid \u201ca much longer and more painful adjustment process.\u201dStill, analysts say the economy is better protected than in the past. Public debt is manageable and the central bank sits on healthy foreign reserves. Unlike many of the emerging market economies that have also watched their currencies struggle against the dollar, Mexico\u2019s economy grew a modest 2.5 percent last year, and is expected to grow again this year.\u201cThere are many forces at play and it is very difficult to disentangle them,\u201d said Gabriel Lozano, the chief Mexico economist for J.P. Morgan, who argues that the Mexican economy shows many signs of strength. \u201cYou have a lot of buffers.\u201dBut public jitters can cause consumers to delay purchases and investments, putting brakes on the economy. To stave that off, officials have struggled to find the right language to project calm.\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that we\u2019re experiencing a moment of great uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets,\u201d Mexico\u2019s finance secretary, Luis Videgaray, said in a recent radio interview. \u201cIn the face of that, governments have to act like the Mexican government has been doing, with full responsibility, with early measures to protect economic stability and that way protect the most important thing \u2014 which is to protect the economy of Mexican families.\u201dThe greatest worry is that a weaker peso will generate inflation as higher import prices are passed on to consumers. That means wherever one looks here, the effect of higher-priced American products is creeping in.\u201cThe price of apples went up from one day to the next,\u201d said Moi Gregorio, 33, the manager of a juice stand in Mexico City who blends apples from Washington State with other fruits grown in Mexico into his fresh juices. \u201cIf the price of the dollar stays like this, I won\u2019t have any choice but to raise the price.\u201dFor now, merchants are swallowing the cost increases. \u201cThe price of chicken has been going up every day since September,\u201d said Edgar Hern\u00e1ndez, 35, manager at a market counter that sells fresh poultry.Perhaps the Mexican-raised chickens eat imported animal feed, he speculated. Whatever the reason, \u201cI can\u2019t raise my price to the customer.\u201dThe price of cotton imported from the United States is a problem for LeRoy Laboratories, a national company that makes bandages and other medical supplies, said Armando Lezama Laguerenne, 48, who works in sales and training for the company.Rather than pass on the full price increase to consumers, the company is trying to reduce costs and raise productivity, even if that means cutting some jobs, he said.For now, Mexico\u2019s inflation rate is stable, well below the central bank\u2019s 3 percent target.And a cheaper currency is a blessing to some parts of the economy, like tourism. Other services are prospering, too.\u201cI have been drawing up budgets for foreigners nonstop\u201d since the fall, said Carlos Llergo, a producer for Arre Lul\u00fa, which provides production services for companies that shoot advertisements in Mexico.\u201cEven when the peso wasn\u2019t so cheap, they came for the locations or the well-qualified technicians,\u201d Mr. Llergo said. \u201cNow that it\u2019s cheaper and they make more money, they are in heaven.\u201dAvelino Rodr\u00edguez, managing partner for The Lift, another production services company, said that the cost of shooting a Corona beer ad recently was 10 percent under budget because of the peso\u2019s fall.But a cheap peso on its own is not enough to assure business, he said. Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil are all competitors \u2014 and their currencies have fallen, too.One of Mexico\u2019s most successful industries faces a similar challenge.\u201cYes, we are more competitive, but so are all the emerging markets that make auto parts,\u201d said Oscar Albin, the executive president of the National Autoparts Industry.Mexican factories sold some $85 billion in parts last year. \u201cIf we all have the same advantage, then it stops being an advantage,\u201d he said.On top of that, many components, like steel, plastic and fabric for seats, are priced in dollars.It is not just pricing that has given Mexico an edge, Mr. Albin said, \u201cIt\u2019s the productivity that makes us competitive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Plan to Flood-Proof Hoboken Runs Into a Wall", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byHOBOKEN, N.J. \u2014 Every time a powerful nor\u2019easter or tropical storm threatens New York, residents of this small city on the New Jersey bank of the Hudson River start having flashbacks to the devastating inundation they endured when Hurricane Sandy hit in 2012.Hundreds of millions of gallons of water poured in from the river and left most of Hoboken underwater and many of its residents without power for a week. Almost immediately, city leaders decided that Hoboken had to be fortified against future floods.But more than three years after the hurricane, Hoboken is just as vulnerable to a deluge and the plan to defend it is mired in controversy. Furious residents have sounded off to city and state officials, opposing any remedy that might diminish the city\u2019s character or its biggest selling point: the dazzling views of Manhattan.The backlash could cost the city the money Washington has offered. Some residents have even endorsed that outcome.Staunch opposition has emerged in Hoboken to a $230-million plan to prevent flooding. A model of flows from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 by the Stevens Institute of Technology shows how strategically placed sea walls might work.\u201cPlease do not destroy the one valuable asset this city has, which is its view and the charm of tree-lined streets,\u201d one resident, Suzanne Collins, wrote to state officials, saying Hoboken should \u201creject these funds.\u201dThe plan would inevitably involve erecting sea walls between the river and the low-lying parts of the city, possibly over 12 feet high in places. And, as Dawn Zimmer, the mayor of Hoboken, has learned, \u201cwall\u201d is a fighting word.\u201cThis is a historic opportunity for our city, an opportunity that no other city in the country has,\u201d Ms. Zimmer, a Democrat, said in an interview in her City Hall office, a few blocks from where the surging river rushed in.But irate residents, including Natalie Morales, a news anchor on the NBC \u201cToday\u201d show, have confronted Ms. Zimmer with their objections and directed their outrage to state officials. The mayor said she feared the public discord would cause Hoboken to lose out on its best chance to get help from the state and federal governments.Wedged into the coastline between the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, Hoboken is one of the country\u2019s most densely populated places, with more than 50,000 people living in slightly more than a square mile. Some of the land closest to the river is elevated, but most of the city lies low and is notoriously susceptible to flooding even after just a heavy downpour.City officials have tried to ease the flooding problem with pumps and cisterns, but stopping the river would require walls, Ms. Zimmer said. Not that she would call them that.Instead, she is careful to use less provocative terms, such as a \u201cflood-protection measure,\u201d and emphasizes that a wall could double as an \u201camenity,\u201d such as a bench or planter, that would fit into the urban landscape. But a wall by any other name has stirred indignation among prospective neighbors, who have vented in public comments sent to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, which is responsible for devising a plan that will meet the federal requirements.\u201cNo to the wall,\u201d Stacy Wallace-Albert wrote in all capital letters, succinctly summarizing the opinion of many neighbors.That plan, called \u201cResist, Delay, Store, Discharge,\u201d involved strategies for holding rain and floodwater and slowing its release into the city\u2019s sewer system. But its fundamental purpose was to prevent a repeat of what happened in Hoboken during Hurricane Sandy.State engineers have drawn up five configurations, including some that would place a wall on the waterfront and one that would have it wind along city streets and end on a block lined with brownstones. They are scheduled to whittle those alternatives down to three within several weeks, but the uproar from residents may have set back that schedule.Resentment started bubbling up late last year at additional public meetings requested by Ms. Zimmer to elicit the opinions of a cross section of her constituents. She got an earful.Some residents said that the waterfront and the front-row view of Manhattan were Hoboken\u2019s most attractive features, and that to obscure the panorama would be foolish.But the loudest opposition came from residents along Garden Street, which runs south several blocks from the river. Once they understood that one concept involved a wall four feet high or taller dividing their narrow street, they rebelled.\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin the character of the neighborhood,\u201d one woman said. One of her neighbors added: \u201cI got denied a zoning thing I wanted to do in my home, but you\u2019re going to put a four-foot wall in front of my house. No good.\u201dAmong the over 700 people who have supported the petition was Ms. Morales, who lives on one of the blocks that would be affected. The newscaster took a shot at Ms. Zimmer on the petition site, writing, \u201cThis is corruption at its finest!\u201d and alleging a \u201ckickback scheme at the highest level.\u201dMs. Morales did not respond to several requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the \u201cToday\u201d show, Megan Kopf, declined to comment about Ms. Morales\u2019s postings or whether NBC News had policies covering the involvement of its journalists in local politics.The mayor shrugged off the personal attacks, but she and other residents said they were troubled by the idea that Hoboken should pass up the $230 million.Sitting in his home-furnishings store that was flooded by Hurricane Sandy, Brian Battaglia shook his head at the thought. \u201cTo walk away from doing anything in Hoboken that stops the water from coming in seems unbelievable,\u201d he said, recalling how the rising water burst through the back door and shoved everything to the front wall.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t drive down the back side of town and see people\u2019s lives thrown out in the street, you might feel that way,\u201d Mr. Battaglia said.LaTrenda Ross, a 27-year resident of public housing in Hoboken, said she had not forgotten what Hurricane Sandy wrought. \u201cTo go through that for two weeks with no heat, no lights, no nothing, no food, it was a disaster,\u201d she said.Ms. Zimmer said she would be happy if a way could be found to resist a rising Hudson without limiting access to the waterfront or disrupting residential blocks. The Department of Environmental Protection said it would consider altering the proposed configurations to placate residents.In the meantime, Ms. Zimmer has met with small groups of residents to try to assuage their fears. She said a friend recounted how her young daughter came home and explained that \u201cthey\u2019re going to build a wall 12 feet high\u201d that would block a schoolmate\u2019s bedroom window.Ms. Zimmer told her friend, \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banks Are Warned Against Hindering Customers Seeking Accounts", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byYour Money AdviserBANKS must do more to make sure they are not unnecessarily thwarting customers who want to open mainstream bank accounts, a federal watchdog agency warned this week.The agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told the nation\u2019s retail banks and credit unions that they must act to provide accurate information to specialized screening companies, which track a consumer\u2019s record of overdrawn and closed checking accounts.Such companies collect information from banks on accounts that are overdrawn or involuntarily closed, perhaps because the holder overspent the balance and did not repay the money. When the customer applies for a new bank account, the companies provide a report, which may lead a bank to reject the application. So it is important that the report details are correct.The bureau said some banks offered such \u201cno overdraft\u201d accounts, but they tended not to promote them widely to customers \u2014 or they may offer the accounts only after a customer has been rejected for a traditional checking account. In its letter, the bureau pressed banks to make these accounts broadly available and to feature them online and in branches.\u201cBy simply offering consumers a bit more choice, banks and credit unions could help more people enjoy the many benefits of a banking relationship,\u201d the bureau\u2019s director, Richard Cordray, said in remarks prepared for a public hearing this week in Louisville, Ky., on checking account access.While almost 90 percent of American households have at least one checking account, about 10 million households have no checking or savings account, Mr. Cordray said.In a prepared statement, Virginia O\u2019Neill, senior vice president of the American Bankers Association\u2019s center for regulatory compliance, said that banks \u201cremain dedicated to featuring a full range of product choices that can accommodate a number of diverse consumer preferences.\u201dConsumer advocates cited Chase\u2019s Liquid prepaid debit card, and Bank of America\u2019s Safe Balance account, as examples of \u201ccheckless\u201d accounts that help customers avoid exceeding their balances and incurring fees as a result. The accounts simply decline spending if the account balance will not cover it and do not charge a fee. They do charge monthly service fees, however, which may be burdensome to lower-income users.Having a checking account closed for repeated overdrafts can have a lasting effect, said Susan Weinstock, director of the consumer banking initiative at the Pew Charitable Trusts, because the information remains on file for up to seven years. That means consumers are effectively \u201cblacklisted\u201d and cannot open another checking account, leaving them out of the financial mainstream.What is really needed, she said, is an update of bank overdraft rules, which the consumer agency is planning.Excessive overdraft fees have been a concern for years, particularly because some banks had been found to reorder transactions to maximize the fees they charged account holders. A Pew report in 2014 found that some big banks had stopped such reordering practices, but many others had not.Current regulations require banks to obtain customers\u2019 permission before allowing them to overspend their accounts using their debit cards in exchange for a fee, typically $35. If customers choose not to accept this \u201coverdraft protection,\u201d purchases or withdrawals that exceed the account balance are declined, usually without a fee.(Those rules, however, apply to overspending via debit card. Even if customers decline overdraft protection, they may still incur fees for bounced checks and overspending because of recurring electronic payments.)Consumers consistently say they find the overdraft option confusing, Ms. Weinstock said. \u201cWe know the system right now with \u2018opt in\u2019 isn\u2019t working,\u201d she said. Pew\u2019s research has found that more than half of people who have been charged a penalty fee do not recall opting in to overdraft coverage.Here are some questions and answers about checking accounts:If a bank turns you down for a checking account because of a negative report, the bank must give you a notice with the name of the screening company that provided the information. You may request a copy of your report to check it for accuracy.If you do not want to worry about overdraft fees, decline the bank\u2019s offer of overdraft protection. (If you overspend, however, the transaction will be rejected.) Alternatively, you may link your checking account to another source of money, like a savings account, and have money transferred automatically to cover any shortfalls. You will still be charged a transfer fee, but it is usually much less than an overdraft fee.Email: yourmoneyadviser@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hillary Clinton Beats Bernie Sanders in Nevada Caucuses", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byMrs. Clinton\u2019s team breathed a sigh of relief as the results of the often-unpredictable campaign made clear that she had rebounded after her crushing defeat in the New Hampshire primary. At a caucus at the famed Caesars Palace, blackjack dealers, pit bosses, cooks and housekeepers excitedly declared their support for the former secretary of state.Voters in many predominantly Hispanic and black neighborhoods backed Mrs. Clinton after she worked hard to connect with them, most notably when she comforted a tearful young Latina who feared her parents would be deported. That moment was turned into a powerful ad here for Mrs. Clinton, whose message of solidarity with minority voters stood in contrast to Mr. Sanders\u2019s more esoteric attacks on Wall Street and the campaign finance system.With votes from 92 percent of caucus precincts counted, Mrs. Clinton had won 52.6 percent, while Mr. Sanders had drawn 47.3 percent in relatively modest turnout. Mrs. Clinton had been far ahead in the polls until recently, when Mr. Sanders became better known here and struck fear into the Clinton campaign that he might prevail in Nevada and deal her a serious setback.In her victory speech Saturday afternoon, in a ballroom at Caesars Palace, Mrs. Clinton devoted her campaign to \u201chotel and casino workers who never wavered\u201d and \u201cthe thousands of men and women with kids to raise, bills to pay and dreams that won\u2019t die.\u201d She used plural pronouns like \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d more than usual, as opposed to leaning on \u201cI,\u201d a clear attempt to make her campaign about voters as Mr. Sanders has done powerfully.\u201cWe look at our country and see so much that isn\u2019t working the way it should,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cAmericans are right to be angry, but we\u2019re also hungry for real solutions,\u201d she added, a line that seemed aimed at aggrieved voters who like the urgency of Mr. Sanders but may doubt he can enact his ambitious agenda.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory was a serious setback for Mr. Sanders, who campaigned hard in Nevada in hopes that a surge of Latino and black voters would heed his call for a political revolution.Mr. Sanders delivered a bullish concession speech on Saturday, saying that his message had inspired historic numbers of young and working people to vote and that it would lead to victories in the Super Tuesday primaries on March 1 and ultimately the Democratic nomination.\u201cWe have come a very long way in nine months,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThe wind is at our backs. We have the momentum. And I believe that when Democrats assemble in Philadelphia in July at that convention, we are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.\u201dYet in the view of several political analysts, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory in Nevada and proven popularity with minority voters increases the likelihood of her winning the South Carolina primary on Saturday and many of the Super Tuesday contests, which would put her on even more certain path to the party\u2019s nomination.Robert Shrum, a longtime strategist for presidential campaigns, said that with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Nevada win, \u201cmost Democrats will conclude \u2014 again \u2014 that she will be the nominee.\u201dMrs. Clinton had for months considered Nevada a haven that would provide a welcome shift from the mostly white electorates of New Hampshire and Iowa. But in recent weeks, Mr. Sanders\u2019s populist message began to take hold and polls tightened. Her campaign, bracing for another loss, seemed to look beyond Nevada to the contest next weekend in South Carolina.Still, early organizing in the state and a last-minute on-the-ground push by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and its supporters paid off. And Mrs. Clinton, who is typically a reserved presence on the trail, seemed to embrace the quirkiness of campaigning in Las Vegas, posing for photographs with Britney Spears, who was in town for her show at Planet Hollywood, and even receiving the endorsement of 500 sex workers, mostly from Carson City brothels, who formed the \u201cHookers 4 Hillary\u201d group.9 PhotosLess than an hour before the caucuses began, Mrs. Clinton was shaking hands in the employee cafeteria at Harrah\u2019s casino. \u201cI need your help this morning, in the showroom at 11 a.m.,\u201d she told the predominantly Spanish-speaking workers.Several Hispanic voters cheered Mrs. Clinton with enthusiasm. \u201cShe\u2019ll change immigration. She\u2019ll change the economy. She\u2019ll change todo!\u201d said Dora Gonzalez, 54, a casino porter at the Bellagio, using the Spanish word for everything.\u201cAnd she\u2019s a mujer!\u201d added her friend Elba Pinera, 51, originally from Honduras, using the Spanish word for woman.Mr. Sanders, who performed well in the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire, is now under pressure to show that he can attract the broad cross-section of Democrats necessary to remain competitive with Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders did appeal to a good number of Hispanic voters: According to entrance polls by Edison Research, he was ahead of Mrs. Clinton among Hispanics. These numbers may not reflect the final vote tally, however, because Mrs. Clinton was performing strongly in heavily Hispanic neighborhoods around Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas. Mrs. Clinton won 60 percent of the delegates in the 22 Latino-majority precincts that had reported results on Saturday night, according to her campaign aides.Mr. Sanders fared poorly among African-American voters, earning support from only 22 percent of them, according to the entrance polls.Sanders advisers acknowledged on Saturday that his weak performance with African-Americans meant he could face significant difficulties in the South Carolina primary and the Super Tuesday states, many of which have large African-American populations. Mr. Sanders has been reluctant to reshape his political message to appeal more sharply or dramatically to black voters \u2014 which he did not do in his concession speech here \u2014 and political analysts said that time was running out to show he could expand his base of support.\u201cWhen will Sanders prove that he can win a state with a big minority population? That has to be his top goal right now, and he\u2019s far from it,\u201d said Brent F. Nelsen, a political scientist at Furman University in South Carolina. \u201cA lot of Sanders loyalists here are confused why African-Americans aren\u2019t supporting Bernie, since he\u2019s speaking their economic language. But a lot of blacks here and elsewhere also care about personal loyalty and relationships, and Clinton has a strong edge there.\u201dMr. Sanders\u2019s earlier surges in Iowa, where he nearly tied Mrs. Clinton, and in New Hampshire came at a high price, according to campaign finance data released on Saturday. He spent $35 million in January, an enormous amount, and ended the month with half as much cash on hand as Mrs. Clinton, after out-raising her by several million dollars.In Nevada, Mrs. Clinton benefited from deep connections to the state. Robby Mook, her campaign manager, had served as her Nevada director when she narrowly defeated Mr. Obama here in 2008. Her current state director, Emmy Ruiz, delivered a victory in Nevada to Mr. Obama in his 2012 re-election campaign.Her support among labor also ran deep, even though the Culinary Workers Union, which represents 57,000 members, many of whom are Latino, declined to endorse a candidate. But on Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who also remained neutral, said in an interview he had spoken to D. Taylor, the head of the union\u2019s parent group, to make sure its members could have paid time off to participate in the caucuses, a move that operatives in the state believed helped tip the race in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s favor.She overwhelmingly defeated Mr. Sanders in the caucuses that were held at six major Las Vegas casinos, including Harrah\u2019s, the Wynn and New York-New York, which heavily drew working-class minority voters.Before the 2008 election, Mr. Reid lobbied for Nevada to be among the early-voting states, arguing that its mix of urban and rural areas, and a population that is nearly half minority, could indicate how candidates would fare among a more diverse electorate. \u201cIf you\u2019re my color and you start school, you\u2019ll be in a minority in Clark County,\u201d Mr. Reid said Thursday in an interview, referring to the state\u2019s most populous county.The state has just six electoral votes in the general election, but its population reflects the composition of other potential Western battlegrounds like Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.The Nevada results were personally important for Mrs. Clinton, who struggled in 2008 to win caucus states, though she prevailed here against Barack Obama. In this campaign, she has won the two caucuses so far, here and in Iowa. Immediately following her speech, Mrs. Clinton flew to Houston for a rally. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to Texas. Bill is on his way to Colorado. The fight goes on!\u201d she said.Amy Chozick reported from Las Vegas, and Patrick Healy from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Jamaica", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byInternational Real Estate23 PhotosA CARPENTER GOTHIC HOUSE WITH A MINERAL SPRING IN JAMAICA$2.54 MILLION (1,753,675 BRITISH POUNDS)This three-bedroom three-bath house, built in 2014 on Jamaica\u2019s west coast, has the fairy-tale charm of the Carpenter Gothic style. Constructed of wood and local stone with cedar shingles and embellished with gingerbread trim and hand-carved fretwork, the roughly 1,600-square-foot, two-story house sits on the banks of the Blue Hole, a mineral spring near the Roaring River.The property, about 11 acres, is landscaped with rock walls and bridges, creating bathing areas in the Blue Hole and the river, and includes a large gazebo, a caretaker\u2019s cottage, a storage cottage, three pumphouses, a tropical greenhouse and an outdoor bathroom in the garden.\u201cThe house is so convincingly antique that many people believe it\u2019s from the 19th century,\u201d said Walter Zephirin, a managing director of Seventh Heaven Properties, a real estate agency based in London specializing in the Caribbean, which has the listing.The house, which is built into a small incline, has a main entrance on the second floor that opens to a living area, with an open kitchen on the left. The floors are tropical cherry wood, and all doors are cedar. The Gothic-style windows are topped by wooden fretwork carved by Jamaican artisans, backed with mosquito mesh to allow ventilation.Virtually all the wooden furniture, which is included in the asking price, was handmade in Jamaica. The kitchen has painted pine cabinets, butcher block countertops and high-end appliances. A wall of cupboards stores hurricane shutters, and the home\u2019s structure and roof are fortified for hurricanes, Mr. Zephirin said.Beyond the living area is the master bedroom suite, which opens to a second-floor veranda and has a canopy bed and a large bathroom with an adjoining outdoor shower. Next to the master bedroom is another bedroom with a canopy bed and sea views. It has an en-suite bathroom with a cast-iron clawfoot bathtub and a bidet.The home has no internal staircase; the first floor has an entrance off a lower veranda. It opens to a bedroom suite with a four-poster bed and a large bathroom with an adjoining outdoor shower. The home\u2019s verandas are often used as dining areas, while a nearby gazebo serves as an outdoor living room.The property has a vegetable garden and an ornamental garden and is landscaped with orange, lime, mango, star apple and papaya trees, among many others. The home is built just above the Blue Hole and the Roaring River, both natural water features springing from a network of subterranean caves. The Blue Hole, full of mullet and freshwater crabs, Mr. Zephirin said, is roughly 80 feet across and about 25 feet deep in the rainy season. During the two-month dry season, its water level falls, but it doesn\u2019t dry up, Mr. Zephirin said.The closest town, Petersfield, with about 2,250 residents, is a five-minute drive and has basic necessities, while Savanna-La-Mar, the capital of Westmoreland Parish, is about 20 minutes away and has large supermarkets. The closest beach at Bluefields is roughly a half-hour drive, as is Sandals Whitehouse European Village and Spa, which has many restaurants and amenities. The international airport at Montego Bay is about an hour away, Mr. Zephirin said.MARKET OVERVIEWThe financial crisis of 2008 took a serious toll on the housing market in Jamaica, particularly the higher end, though as economic conditions have improved in Britain and the United States, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen renewed interest from clients in second homes on the island,\u201d Mr. Zephirin said.Though Jamaica continues to be a buyer\u2019s market, tourism hit record levels last year, and almost 3,000 hotel rooms are under construction, which should eventually benefit the housing market, said Rory Marsh, the owner and chief executive of Meldam Realty, based in Ocho Rios.Foreigners seeking vacation homes tend to focus on the Montego Bay area, Negril and Ocho Rios, while Port Antonio has also become popular after the expansion of its airport, said Nicola Delapenha, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Jamaica, based in Montego Bay. While there is an oversupply of homes in some areas, \u201cif a home is properly priced, and it\u2019s on the water \u2014 because, contrary to popular belief, we do not have a whole lot of inventory on the water \u2014 those properties go fairly quickly,\u201d she said.Vacation homes typically range from about $800,000 to as high as $10 million, Mr. Zephirin said. But two-bedroom condominiums start at around $350,000 on the oceanfront, and as little as $200,000 to $250,000 off the beach, Mr. Marsh said.WHO BUYS IN JAMAICAForeign home buyers in Jamaica tend to be from the United States, Canada and Britain, with smaller numbers of German and Russian buyers, agents said. Jamaicans living abroad and buying retirement or vacation homes have helped keep home prices in the midrange fairly stable since the global real estate crisis, Mr. Marsh said.BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign home buyers in Jamaica.

{"Headline": "Why Angela Merkel Could Lead the U.N.", "Date": "2016-02-16", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorLONDON \u2014 Filed away at the back of an office at United Nations headquarters in Turtle Bay, in New York, is a small collection of yellowing letters, containing appeals from the organization\u2019s first secretary general, a former Norwegian minister named Trygve Lie, to be allowed to relinquish his post. To this day, his motive is unclear: Was he desperate to escape the burdens of high office? Or did he believe in his own indispensability and wish to evoke pleas from member states for him to remain?Those pushing for a more transparent selection process are hoping that the Security Council might offer more than one candidate for the General Assembly to choose from \u2014 although the General Assembly has never had the chutzpah to turn down a candidate whom the council has presented it with. The former Irish president Mary Robinson is one of the Elders, the group of global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela that is advocating reform.The United Nations is often blamed for this failure; in fact, responsibility lies with the five permanent members of the Security Council and the transgressors in the region. The five have an opportunity to help choose a leader who just might be able to change these dynamics and restore the United Nations\u2019 relevance.Who, then, could be a front-runner?Yet some United Nations insiders speak of a woman far more established on the world stage: Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. There was speculation in the German media last year about her possible candidacy, though it subsided and since then she has had her work cut out as Germany welcomed a huge influx of refugees.Germany\u2019s remarkable response under her leadership to Europe\u2019s refugee crisis has also underlined Mrs. Merkel\u2019s humanitarian credentials. At the height of last year\u2019s wave of migration, the contrast between Mrs. Merkel\u2019s willingness to accept desperate asylum seekers in their hundreds of thousands contrasted with the parsimonious response of Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, as well as with a growing xenophobia among some Eastern European leaders.The task facing Mr. Ban\u2019s successor is daunting. Despite the reforms he championed, the United Nations remains browbeaten, anxious about change and suspicious of outsiders. This new, multipolar world where conflict transcends national boundaries is a hugely difficult one to navigate, but if anyone can meet this challenge, it could be Germany\u2019s chancellor.Mark Seddon was a communications aide to the United Nations secretary general from 2014 to 2016.Advertisement"}

The victim died. Farruquito, after first saying his younger brother had been at the wheel, confessed and was convicted of manslaughter. He was sentenced to a 16-month prison term, but because he had no prior convictions, he did not go to jail. The prosecution appealed, and in 2006, Farruquito was sentenced to three years in prison \u2014 three years he had to serve.\u201cIt\u2019s flamenco the way it\u2019s always been done,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept that no one is doing it that way anymore, it seems.\u201d This was a nod to the spectacles, ensemble choreography, narrative programs and fusion experiments popular in recent decades. Admitting that he has participated in some of those trends, Farruquito stressed that \u201cby returning to improvising, I pay tribute to the history of flamenco and to my family, who did it that way.\u201dFarruquito first came to New York in 1986 with the Broadway show \u201cFlamenco Puro.\u201d He was not officially in the production, but much of his family was: his dancing mother and aunt; his singing father; and his maternal grandfather, the illustrious dancer known as El Farruco. Farruquito was 5, and every night he watched from the wings, sometimes joining the finale onstage.About the hit-and-run and his prison term, which he calls \u201cthe worst time of my life,\u201d he speaks with difficulty, offering penitent-sounding assurances that he has reformed. \u201cI can say that anything that makes you change as a person, if you are flamenco, you will show it in your dance,\u201d he noted. Flamenco, he insisted, is a way of life, one best understood through the biography of his grandfather.At 7, El Farruco watched his father die in his mother\u2019s arms, shot at the door of his home during the Spanish Civil War. The boy left home at 8, got married at 12, became a father at 13 and a widower at 14. \u201cThat\u2019s when he started taking dancing seriously,\u201d Farruquito said in 2014, \u201cto give his daughter the best.\u201d\u201cNo one ever taught him a single step,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe learned to dance from nature: birds, horses, rivers, wind. He created his own style to stand out. His style comes from what he lived.\u201dFarruquito teaches his own students with patience and humor. During a workshop he gave in New York a few years ago, after a heavyset dancer lamented that her weight was an impediment, Farruquito showed how his ample aunt conveyed the illusion of jumping without leaving the ground. \u201cLearn from everyone,\u201d he counseled, \u201cbut copy no one.\u201dOne person who will not accept Farruquito\u2019s instruction is his young son, Juan. \u201cI sometimes try to teach him,\u201d Farruquito said in 2014 when the boy was nearly 2, \u201cbut he says he knows how to dance.\u201d And that is how Juan looked on a video on Farruquito\u2019s phone, spinning and stamping : like someone who knows. \u201cI like that he\u2019s like that \u2014 that\u2019s how I was,\u201d Farruquito said.\u201cNow it\u2019s worse,\u201d Farruquito said a few weeks ago. \u201cHe watches videos of me and tells me how I should dance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 76.His wife, Earline, said that he died suddenly at their home and that the cause was not immediately known.Richardson came from a powerful football family in Mississippi. He was one of six brothers to play for the historically black Jackson State College (now Jackson State University), and one of four to go on to the professional ranks. At Jackson State he was a small-college all-American receiver. The College Football Hall of Fame inducted him in 2003.The Jets chose him in the third round of the American Football League draft in 1963, and the Colts selected him in the seventh round of the N.F.L. draft. He signed with the Colts, and played for them in eight of his nine pro seasons.Richardson\u2019s best season was 1967, when he set career highs with 63 catches for 860 yards and eight touchdown receptions; he was selected for the N.F.L.\u2019s first-team All-Pro squad and a spot in the Pro Bowl. He caught eight touchdown passes again in 1968, helping to propel the Colts to the Super Bowl, and was again chosen for the Pro Bowl.The Jets and their star quarterback, Joe Namath, gave the upstart A.F.L.\u2019s reputation a huge boost, stunning the Colts, 16-7, in Super Bowl III in Miami in January 1969. But Richardson caught six passes for 58 yards in the game, while receiver Jimmy Orr and tight end John Mackey had only three receptions apiece, along with modest reception yardage.Earl Morrall, starting at quarterback in place of Johnny Unitas, who missed most of the 1968 season with an elbow injury, nearly connected with Richardson for a touchdown in the second quarter, with the Colts trailing, 7-0. But Jets defensive back Johnny Sample, a former Colt, intercepted the pass, giving the Jets the ball at their 2-yard line. Unitas entered the game later, but the Colts\u2019 only touchdown came on the ground.Willie Louis Richardson Jr., the son of a Baptist preacher, was born on Nov. 17, 1939, in Clarksdale, Miss. His father and his mother, Alice, moved the family to Greenville, Miss., soon afterward, and Willie Jr. became a star high school receiver there.He played for the Colts from 1963 to 1969, spent one season with the Miami Dolphins, then concluded his career with the Colts in 1971. He had 195 career receptions for 2,950 yards and 25 touchdowns.After retiring from football, he was an administrator in the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration and an analyst for Jackson State football broadcasts.In addition to his wife, Richardson is survived by their son, Willie L. Richardson III; their daughters, Sonji Boyce and Shawn Terry; his brothers Gloster, Charles and Allen; a sister, Mary Alice Hutchins; and six grandchildren.Gloster Richardson played for the Kansas City Chiefs, including their Super Bowl IV championship team, and for the Dallas Cowboys and the Cleveland Browns. The other two brothers who played pro ball were Tom Richardson, for the Boston Patriots (now the New England Patriots), and Ernie Richardson, for the Browns. Both are deceased.When Willie Richardson joined the Colts, he faced stiff competition to make the team, and he learned quickly what was expected of him.\u201cAs a rookie, I saw that Raymond Berry and Jimmy Orr never dropped balls in practice, much less in games,\u201d he told The Baltimore Sun in 2012. \u201cMiss one pass and you felt like you didn\u2019t belong.

{"Headline": "Alfred E. Mann, Pioneer in Medical Devices, Dies at 90", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byAlfred E. Mann, who started medical device companies that pioneered in the development of pacemakers for erratic hearts, insulin pumps for diabetics, cochlear implants for the deaf and retinal implants for the blind, died on Thursday in Las Vegas. He was 90.Mr. Mann, who spent most of his career in the Los Angeles area, became a billionaire from his entrepreneurial activities. His biggest success was MiniMed, which became the leader in insulin pumps, wearable devices that deliver insulin throughout the day, allowing people with diabetes to more precisely control their blood sugar levels.Mr. Mann, who was chief executive of MiniMed for many years, sold the company to Medtronic for more than $3 billion in 2001.\u201cAl was a true pioneer and strong patient advocate,\u201d said David Kliff, publisher of Diabetic Investor, which follows companies that make products for that disease. \u201cAl touched the lives of millions of patients, mentored several notable executives and most of all never stopped trying to make life better for patients with diabetes.\u201dIn all, Mr. Mann started and largely financed 14 companies, nine of which were acquired for a total of almost $8 billion, according to MannKind.Alfred Mann was born in Portland, Ore., on Nov 6, 1925. His father, Charles, an immigrant from England, was a grocer. His mother, Anna, who was from Poland, was a singer and pianist, and musical talent ran in the family. Mr. Mann\u2019s brother, Robert, a violinist, was a founder of the Juilliard String Quartet. His sister, Rosalind Koff, was a concert pianist.Mr. Mann, however, turned to science. He received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in physics from the University of California, Los Angeles. He started two aerospace companies, Spectrolab and Heliotek, to fill contracts for the military.Some of that work was to provide solar cells to power satellites. Because of that, he was asked in 1969 by researchers at Johns Hopkins University to work on longer-lasting batteries for pacemakers. Mr. Mann founded Pacesetter Systems, which introduced pacemakers with rechargeable batteries. It was acquired by Siemens in 1985 for $150 million.In 1979, while running Pacesetter, Mr. Mann was visiting a cardiac ward and was challenged by a doctor there to work on diabetes, which caused many of the heart problems in patients. That led to the creation of MiniMed and later to MannKind, which developed a form of insulin that is inhaled instead of injected.MannKind, Mr. Mann\u2019s last big venture, may also have been his Waterloo, eating up much of his fortune.The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer suffered a costly marketing flop with an inhaled form of insulin in 2007. After that, other big insulin manufacturers dropped their own plans for similar products.But Mr. Mann, who was chief executive of MannKind for many years, would not give up. He insisted MannKind\u2019s inhaler was better than Pfizer\u2019s and that its insulin had desirable medical characteristics beyond being inhalable. He put about $1 billion of his own money into the company he had named for himself, keeping it afloat through years of setbacks.The inhaled insulin, called Afrezza, was finally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014, but sales have been dismal. In January, Sanofi, the big French drug company, pulled out of an agreement to market the product. MannKind is now in danger of going out of business, though it is vowing to survive.\u201cOur resolve is now stronger than ever to continue Al\u2019s legacy of medical innovation, as a tribute to this remarkable man, who did so much to help mankind,\u201d Matthew Pfeffer, chief executive of MannKind, said in a statement Friday.Mr. Mann, who worked seven days a week even when he was in his 80s, was divorced three times.He is survived by his fourth wife, Claude; seven children, Howard, Brian, Rick, Carla Woods, Kevin, Al Jr. and Cassandra; his brother and sister, and 10 grandchildren.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finding Common Political Ground on Poverty", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byEconomic SceneIf you have been paying any attention to America\u2019s paralyzed politics, you are not going to believe this.Even as substantive legislation in Washington remained largely bogged down by bitter partisan mistrust, some of the leading thinkers on opposite sides of the ideological divide \u2014 experts on the right who have advised Republican policy makers alongside left-leaning scholars who have Democrats\u2019 ear \u2014 came together to champion an increase in the minimum wage.They called for increasing the earned-income tax credit for adults without children. They also proposed more federal investment in early childhood education and community colleges. They defended a common core in education.These folks do not often agree. The group included Robert Doar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Lawrence Mead of New York University, who believe that welfare should come with stiff work requirements to discourage dependency. They sat across from Sheldon Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation and Jane Waldfogel of Columbia University, who believe in a cash safety net of last resort, at least for families with children.\u201cEverybody had to swallow very hard to put their name on that,\u201d acknowledged Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute, who was part of the 15-member group.It is easy to dismiss the exercise as a futile effort to find a minimum common denominator between disparate opposites. The report is not likely to make its way into legislation any time soon. But, the experts hope, the next administration might turn its attention to poverty and find a set of viable ideas on the shelf.The collection of proposals \u2014 from promoting strong and stable families to improving the quantity and quality of work \u2014 actually adds up to a coherent approach to improving an anti-poverty strategy that has fallen far short of its goals.\u201cThe report took us longer than we thought,\u201d Mr. Danziger told me. \u201cBut everybody agreed that even though there were things in it we didn\u2019t like, the package together would be better than the status quo.\u201dConsider the call to increase the minimum wage. The scholars made note of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s recent assessment that the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 and index it to inflation would provide higher pay to 16 million to 24 million workers and lift a million people out of poverty \u2014 at a cost of 500,000 jobs over three years and a slight uptick in consumer prices.Conservatives still found the costs too high and the benefits insufficiently compelling. Most of the income gains would benefit the nonpoor, they argued. And what if the budget office underestimated job losses? What if fixing the minimum wage to inflation brought other costs?This debate was a \u201cclear example of how values can influence the reading of research evidence,\u201d the report admitted candidly.Nonetheless, in the service of a deal, those on the right and the left held their noses and agreed to \u201crecommend an increase below what the administration has proposed, but still large enough to substantially improve the rewards associated with work among the less-skilled.\u201dThe two sides will never entirely agree, of course, partly because they view the causes of poverty from such different angles.To the left, deprivation is caused mostly by factors beyond the control of the poor. These include globalization that undercut good jobs previously within the reach of the less educated, an educational system segregated by race and class, lack of parental resources, discrimination, excessive use of prison.Experts on the right, by contrast, put a lot of the weight on personal responsibility, often faulting the bad choices of the poor. And government support, by providing the poor with an income with few strings attached, has made their choices worse.Yet common ground does exist. Understanding the causes of poverty has improved over the last few decades, helping push solutions through the ideological fog.Many liberals are still skeptical that encouraging marriage will do much to help the poor, but most have come to accept that the children of intact families have a better shot in life. Some conservatives have come to acknowledge that though the push to tie work requirements to public assistance may have made sense in the booming 1990s, the approach might require adjustments to fit the present, less dynamic economy.This opens up opportunities for deals. Conservatives want those on government aid to get a job? Liberals will agree, provided there is a guarantee that jobs are available and that there is a safety net for those at the very bottom who simply cannot work.\u201cIf we require more work as a condition of receiving public benefits, we should support policies expanding work availability to those who need it,\u201d the report states.Progressives, Mr. Danziger told me, placed more weight on the part of the report that calls for \u201censuring jobs are available.\u201d Conservatives, by contrast, preferred the bit that mentioned \u201craising work levels among the hard-to-employ.\u201dThere is another hurdle that may be even harder to overcome: money. The report\u2019s \u201cclose tax expenditures\u201d approach to financing useful proposals has become the standard Hail Mary pass. But given all the interests with a stake in the present tax system, it never seems to muster much support.As Mr. Strain put it, \u201cit\u2019s impossible to deny that conservatives want to spend less money than liberals.\u201d Indeed, when House Speaker Paul D. Ryan proposed expanding the earned-income tax credit, he favored paying for it by cutting funds for other anti-poverty efforts.Still, it is worth seeking a deal. If the Democrats retain the White House while the Republicans maintain their grip on Congress, neither party will be able to dominate Washington policy making. For the poor, a compromise along these lines would be a lot better than doing nothing.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated when the photograph was taken.

A Newsletter Aims for Your Inbox", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported byThere is perhaps no creature more vulnerable to scrutiny \u2014 or capable of fiercely scrutinizing others \u2014 than the teenage girl.Both women have digital publishing chops: Ms. Lewis left her job at Teen Vogue in December, and Ms. Darwin is a former editor at the culture and fashion magazine Nylon. The speed of the Internet took its toll, as both said in an interview that they had grown tired of writing so-called clickbait headlines that promoted superficial stories about starlets like Kylie Jenner and Miley Cyrus to a young audience. They decided to create a quieter environment for teenage girls.\u201cThe actual meaningful stuff gets kind of lost,\u201d Ms. Lewis said, \u201cand teenagers are the ones who need that info the most.\u201dTaking advantage of a boomlet in e-newsletters for women seemed like an obvious choice. But what to call it? The two said they wanted a name that did not sound twee or overly cute, opting instead for one that symbolized good luck. And Clover was born.Will they take Clover\u2019s (non-click)bait?Ms. Lewis believes they will, if they\u2019re provided a bit of direction. She said the young girls they interviewed before Clover\u2019s debut said they felt bombarded with information.\u201cFrom every angle, they\u2019re just getting hit with notifications and headlines and attention-grabbing exclamations,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cThey want to be informed, but they don\u2019t know where to look.\u201dResearch backs that up, and also suggests that millennial women use email as a tool more than their male counterparts, MaryLeigh Bliss, chief content officer of the millennial research firm YPulse, said in an email. YPulse conducts quarterly surveys of 1,000 teenagers, and Ms. Bliss said that 45 percent of women ages 13 to 33 report getting daily or weekly newsletters by email.The research suggests that younger women, ages 13 to 17, don\u2019t check their email as frequently but begin to develop it as a habit as they grow up, Ms. Bliss said.Another obstacle for Clover and other publishers: Teenagers might be overwhelmed by the noise, but they also know how to ignore the overload.\u201cThey have always looked for filters to give them a shortcut to what they need to know,\u201d Ms. Bliss said.Newsletter creators know what traditional media has been slow to realize, Ms. Bliss said: Millennial women are an attractive audience because they\u2019re a reliably influential group online.\u201cThey are a generation of women,\u201d Ms. Bliss said, \u201cmore educated than their male counterparts, beginning to even out the wage gap and bringing a different set of expectations to the brands they buy and the media they consume.\u201dBut teenagers, often referred to as young millennials or members of Generation Z, are a harder group to reach than older millennials, Ms. Bliss said. Newsletters geared toward teenagers are rare because teenagers check their email less often. They also are less likely to want to hear from brands through email.\u201cTeens would also rather watch a video than read an article,\u201d she added, \u201cso text-heavy content might not be as appealing.\u201dFor now, Ms. Lewis and Ms. Darwin appear to be mixing the tactics of theSkimm with the creativity of Lenny Letter. Their email issues will provide a rundown of the day\u2019s news as curated by editors, but they will end with a daily list of teenagers to follow on Instagram \u2014 models, actresses, artists, feminists. Homework, then dessert. (One of Clover\u2019s growth tactics will be to ask its recipients to share the email with a friend to earn a spot on the Instagram list.)Recent issues have included a selection of young adult fiction, news about Planned Parenthood financing and an essay about why it\u2019s O.K. to quit your dream job (written by Ms. Darwin, who now works with Ms. Lewis out of a cafe in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn).For now, Clover has no advertising and is not making money, the women said. Ms. Lewis said that several brands had approached Clover since it began, but she is wary of presenting teenagers with an experience that feels branded. The strategy is to grow slowly, said Ms. Lewis and Ms. Darwin, who are financing the project with their own money.\u201cTeens can smell\u201d insincerity, Ms. Lewis said. \u201cThey will know. We really are going to be smart about who we partner with.\u201dMore than 1,600 people have signed up for Clover since its debut on Monday, though the metrics used by Ms. Lewis and Ms. Darwin don\u2019t tell them whether the sign-ups are from teenage girls.Still, they see their engagements with influential readers on Instagram and their email exchanges with readers as proof that their efforts are paying off. Ms. Lewis said that they had received hundreds of emails from teenagers interested in writing essays or sharing more about their goals and ambitions in Clover.\u201cThe whole idea that millennials are ruining the world \u2014 what we\u2019ve found has been absolutely the opposite,\u201d Ms. Darwin said.The women say that, for now, they plan to expand the newsletter without outside help \u2014 except from their mothers, back home in Missouri and Tennessee. The millennial daughters are leaning on them to copy-edit each issue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Richard Anderson, Delta Chief Who Led Airline\u2019s Rebound, Will Retire", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byMr. Anderson, 60, who will become Delta\u2019s executive chairman, will be replaced as chief executive by Ed Bastian, the airline\u2019s president.One of the longest-serving airline executives in recent times, Mr. Anderson took the top job at Delta in 2007 shortly after the airline had emerged from bankruptcy. He orchestrated a merger with Northwest Airlines the following year, a move that helped push the rest of the industry toward greater consolidation and set the template for successful airline combinations.Born in Galveston, Tex., and trained as a lawyer, Mr. Anderson has been a vocal champion of his airline and is known for his blunt views of the industry.While Delta\u2019s succession plan was well established, the timing of the announcement took some aviation experts by surprise.\u201cHe wrote the book on successful airline merger planning and execution, and on employee engagement, and Delta\u2019s results show it,\u201d said Robert W. Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst.Delta\u2019s performance in 2015, for instance, is testimony to how Mr. Anderson built the airline into a global powerhouse. Delta had $4.5 billion in net income last year, aided by falling oil prices, and it gave $1.5 billion to employees under its profit-sharing plan.Mr. Anderson also helped cement successful joint-venture agreements with foreign airlines, including a North Atlantic partnership with Air France KLM that shares flights, revenues and costs on certain routes between the airlines.The early completion of the merger with Northwest, ahead of United\u2019s complicated merger with Continental and the more recent merger between American and US Airways, also allowed Delta to improve operations before its main rivals.As a result, Delta today is an industry leader in on-time performance. In January, for instance, when much of the East Coast was buried by an enormous snowstorm, Delta\u2019s percentage of flights not canceled, a measure known as mainline completion factor, was an industry-leading 98.7 percent. More than 85 percent of its flights also landed on time.The company was valued at $34 billion on Wednesday after the close of markets.But Mr. Anderson\u2019s legacy is also marked by more controversial positions. He has opposed the extension of financing by the Export-Import Bank, arguing it created unfair competition, and has pressed other airline executives to block the expansion of the Persian Gulf-based carriers in the United States.Delta has opposed a move to privatize part of the nation\u2019s air-traffic control system, saying the move carried serious risks and offered \u201cspeculative benefits.\u201d Disagreements over this issue was a reason behind Delta\u2019s decision last year to leave the industry\u2019s trade group, Airlines for America.Mr. Anderson\u2019s planned departure is the third high-profile move recently at the top of a United States airline, after the resignation last year of Jeffery A. Smisek at United and the departure of Ben Baldanza at Spirit Airlines at the beginning of the year.Mr. Anderson began his aviation career at Continental Airlines in 1987, and was at Northwest Airlines between 1990 and 2004, where he served as chief executive for three years before becoming chief of the UnitedHealth Group.Mr. Anderson will step down on May 2, his birthday.\u201cThis succession plan has been several years in the making and will keep Delta on top of the global industry,\u201d said Daniel A. Carp, Delta\u2019s chairman of the board.Among other moves at Delta, the airline said Glen Hauenstein, the company\u2019s executive vice president, would become president.\u201cRichard has also done a lot to help improve the airline\u2019s employee culture, which has helped keep Delta relatively union-free,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and the founder of Atmosphere Research Group. An article on Thursday about Richard Anderson\u2019s pending retirement in May as chief executive of Delta Air Lines misstated his employment circumstances in some copies. He is currently employed as chief executive without a contract; therefore, there is no contract \u201cexpiring soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oculus, Centerpiece of Transit Hub and Selfie Magnet, Is Set to Open", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byBuilding BlocksAfter a 12-year gestation, Santiago Calatrava\u2019s phoenix at the World Trade Center is ready to soar.Or, at least, to hatch.Those impulses help explain how a straightforward need \u2014 to rebuild the PATH commuter railroad terminal under the trade center \u2014 turned into a $4 billion shopping mall, transit center and pedestrian network, crowned at street level by a fantastic, zoomorphic, dazzling white structure with stout ribs and outspread wings.Say this about the Oculus: It is breathtaking from the inside \u2014 luminous, intricate, uplifting and tranquil. Photos of it resemble idealized architectural renderings.Elsewhere at the trade center, a family of four (two parents with a 10- and a 6-year-old) can expect to spend $179 just to get into the National September 11 Memorial Museum and the One World Observatory.The Oculus, however, will be free. It will be free because it is a public space.It is bound to be one of the most popular destinations in Lower Manhattan. Its balconies, cantilevered like diving boards at either end of the elliptical hall, will become Selfie Central. A comparison with the balconies at Grand Central Terminal is almost inevitable. Not surprisingly, Mr. Calatrava cites the terminal as inspiration.Then again, Mr. Cuomo does not have the federal transportation financing that the hub enjoyed.\u201cThis is a legacy project,\u201d said Steven Plate, chief of major capital projects at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is building the hub and redeveloping the overall trade center site. \u201cWe had a moral obligation to do this right.\u201dBarely two years after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, New York seemed to need a regenerative public work at the trade center site, almost as a counterpoint to what was sure to be a solemn memorial and a cluster of insular, private office towers.Port Authority officials chose an architectural and engineering joint venture with Mr. Calatrava in the lead. He promised a monument commensurate with their lofty aspirations.The gesture reflected more than Mr. Calatrava\u2019s penchant for structural drama.He says it also ensures the comfort and security of visitors; comfort, because the column-free expanse makes the hub easier to navigate; security, because it eliminates the threat of satchel bombs being placed at the base of relatively slender columns and will also make it easier for crowds to evacuate the spaces in case of emergency.The subway posed another big challenge. The hub had to be built around No. 1 trains operating around the clock, because the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would not consider suspending service to South Ferry. The mezzanine level of the hub was constructed from the roof downward, defying standard engineering practice, because its roof doubles as part of the memorial plaza, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg decreed must be open by Sept. 11, 2011, the 10th anniversary of the attack.In 2012, hundreds of millions of dollars in damage was caused by Hurricane Sandy. The authority will not put an exact figure on the amount because it is negotiating with its insurers. If the recovery from the storm were factored in as a construction cost, it would push the authority\u2019s official $3.7 billion budget figure past the $4 billion mark.The curvature of the storefronts in the Oculus and the radiating concourses will help give retailers visibility, Mr. Calatrava said. \u201cBut they have to be behind the glass,\u201d he added. \u201cOur idea is to create a concerto, and create harmony among the shops.\u201dRestraint is not a defining characteristic of 21st-century retailing. But Patrick J. Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority, believes there is a fine precedent.\u201cA balance is struck at Grand Central Terminal, and it will be here,\u201d he said.Shops, after all, are not new on the site. A half-century ago, a vibrant district of small electronics dealers was swept aside by the Port Authority to make room for the twin towers. By fall, there will be an Apple store in the Oculus, selling a new kind of electronics, not far from old Radio Row.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Argentina has agreed to pay $1.35 billion to individual Italian bondholders who were holdouts. And Argentina has also settled with two hedge funds, Montreux Partners and Dart Management, and offered $6.5 billion to settle the whole affair.The other hedge funds never enforced their debt, instead suing on the pari passu issue \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a clause in bond contracts that says all bondholders should be treated alike \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and collecting interest on the face value of the bonds, which they claim exceeded 100 percent a year. The second set of bonds is now worth much more because of the accrued interest.Argentina responded by offering one set of hedge funds, who did not sue on the pari passu clause, 150 percent of their judgement. Another set, that did not sue to collect on their bonds, but to enforce the pari passu clause, have been offered up to 72.5 percent of their claims. The holdout hedge funds don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the offer that Argentina has made because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compensate them for the higher rate of interest they feel they are entitled to. The hedge funds who sued on the pari passu clause, but not to enforce their debt are getting more but not enough, merely because of the choice of legal strategy. But this deal comes with safeguards. Apollo and its co-investors will provide $4.5 billion toward the transaction, nearly half the purchase price including debt. This will help keep ADT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt comfortably below guideline multiples. It might be a tall order to cover the 56 percent premium that Apollo is paying ADT shareholders, but it appears to have built in enough extra security both to complete the deal and to lock up a decent return.

{"Headline": "U.S. Soccer Keeping Silent on FIFA Presidential Vote, for Now", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byNine months ago, just before the last election for FIFA president, the United States Soccer Federation publicly endorsed Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan in his race against Sepp Blatter, the longtime and much-maligned incumbent who went on to win re-election easily. At the time, U.S. Soccer\u2019s endorsement was seen as a bold show of protest against the status quo within the scandal-plagued governing body.This week, with Mr. Blatter suspended and five candidates, including Prince Ali, vying to replace him, U.S. Soccer is planning to avoid a public endorsement. Barring a late change in that strategy, when the delegate from U.S. Soccer enters the voting booth on Friday morning in Zurich \u2014 the federation\u2019s representative will be Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer \u2014 his choice will most likely be known to only a handful of U.S. Soccer officials.All of the candidates have lobbied the federation for its backing. But while the last election was a clear-cut choice \u2014 U.S. Soccer was very much aligned with those who wanted a complete overhaul of FIFA \u2014 Friday\u2019s vote, with five candidates running on platforms of reform, makes the dynamics of public support trickier.To win, a candidate needs to receive two-thirds of the votes from the 207 eligible nations in the first round of balloting. It is expected that no candidate will reach that number, and on subsequent ballots only a simple majority is required. Some federations do not discuss how they reach a decision on which candidate to support \u2014 in many cases, the federation\u2019s president simply decides unilaterally \u2014 but in a recent interview, Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer and a member of FIFA\u2019s governing executive committee, described the process in his federation.Campaign materials from all five candidates have been shared with the 17 members of U.S. Soccer\u2019s board of directors. Brief discussions about the situation have been held during recent meetings, and Mr. Gulati also solicited opinions from the board via email at the beginning of this month. Several members had questions or thoughts, Mr. Gulati said.Mr. Gulati told the board that a final decision would be made this week in Zurich, where U.S. Soccer will have five board members in town for the FIFA congress. With almost one-third of the members present, Mr. Gulati, who does not vote himself because of his role on the executive committee, said that the board was satisfied that a substantive dialogue would take place.In addition to Mr. Gulati and Mr. Garber, the other board members present will be Carlos Cordeiro, the treasurer for U.S. Soccer and a top adviser on international issues; John Collins, a former general counsel for the federation; and Arthur Mattson, who represents the adult amateur players group within the federation.It is expected that Mr. Infantino will receive significant support among the countries that make up Concacaf, the confederation that covers North and Central America and the Caribbean. The politics of the race, however, and the likelihood of multiple ballots make deciphering allegiances tricky. U.S. Soccer, for example, could support Prince Ali on the first ballot but, if he finishes in third place, then switch to Mr. Infantino on the second ballot, where a winner would most likely be determined.Mr. Gulati declined to indicate which candidate he expected the federation to support, but he said the board of directors had several concerns it considered paramount. While many of the smaller federations are concerned almost exclusively with how much financing they might receive from FIFA under a particular president, Mr. Gulati said U.S. Soccer was focused on a broader view.U.S. Soccer lost a controversial (and tainted) FIFA vote to host the 2022 World Cup, and in the past year, the United States Department of Justice has taken an active role in attempting to identify corrupt individuals in the global soccer landscape. Given those realities, it is not surprising that revamping the structure of FIFA is one of the key points for U.S. Soccer.\u201cI think proper governance is critical for us,\u201d Mr. Gulati said. \u201cWe want to see changes in that on every level, and are making changes within our own organization, too.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe other issue that is of utmost importance to our board is gender equity. We want to continue to push that issue, and expect to do that regardless of who is going to win this election.\u201dAdvertisement"}

James and Sally were half-siblings to Jefferson\u2019s wife, Martha.Hemings trained under chefs at the famed Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly, the \u201cfive-star\u201d kitchen of 18th-century France whose culinary creations outshined those served the royal family at Versailles. Technically free in France, Hemings was paid a wage to helm the kitchen at Jefferson\u2019s residence in Paris. There he supervised a large French-speaking staff for Jefferson\u2019s extravagant dinners for royalty and the most discerning palates in Paris.Hemings returned to slavery in America, bringing with him revolutionary changes to traditional colonial hearth cooking. Meringues, cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, French-style cr\u00e8me Chantilly (whipped cream) and continental European-style macaroni and cheese can all be traced back to his training in Paris.He was in the kitchen for the most historic dinner in early American history. On June 20, 1790, the meal \u2014 a delicious balm in his signature half-Virginian-half-French style \u2014 helped reconcile the bitter enemies Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. Over lavish courses that included capon stuffed with Virginia ham, chestnut pur\u00e9e, artichoke bottoms and truffles, served with a Calvados sauce, and boeuf \u00e0 la mode made with French-style boeuf bouillon instead of gravy, they forged an agreement to settle the young republic\u2019s biggest problem: how to finance the Revolutionary War debt. They also decided that the national capital would be situated along the Potomac.The roots of iconic American foods can be linked to James Hemings and his Virginia kitchen with a French accent. Black cooks, including the celebrated Edna Lewis, have always kept, even if they didn\u2019t know its origins, some element of that tradition of fusion cooking.James Hemings has been a ghost in America\u2019s kitchen, overshadowed and still enslaved to the narrative that gives Thomas Jefferson credit for introducing gourmet cuisine to the nation. I dream of a day when Hemings is no longer left out of media stories on the origins of fine food in America.ASHBELL McELVEENPhiladelphiaThe writer is a chef and the founder of the James Hemings Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans See How Long They Can Hold Their Breath", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byMaybe we\u2019d better refrain from having any new opinions until after the election.Follow the leader. Mitch McConnell says the Senate shouldn\u2019t do anything about the Supreme Court\u2019s vacancy as long as Barack Obama is president. Not even go through the motions of pretending to think about it. We\u2019ve hit a whole new level in the politics of obstruction.Why stop there? For the next 11 months it\u2019s probably better if we let everything go except for the purchase of food staples.Don\u2019t even bother to fake it. Virtually every Republican with a job more elevated than zoning commissioner thinks the best thing to do with any Supreme Court nomination is to act as if it isn\u2019t there, like a wad of gum on the sidewalk.\u201cDelay, delay, delay!\u201d cried Donald Trump at the last debate. Some listeners might have presumed he was calling for the return of the former House majority leader who resigned during a campaign finance scandal and later rehabilitated himself by doing the cha-cha on \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201d Exactly the kind of guy Donald Trump would like. But in this case he was talking about stonewalling any Supreme Court nomination.\u201cIf I were president \u2026 I guess I\u2019d put in a name,\u201d Trump admitted in a phone call to Stephen Colbert. This is extremely mild language for the leading Republican presidential candidate. Normally you\u2019d expect Trump to say something like: \u201cIf I were president I\u2019d nominate somebody who would scare the hell out of them. Putin! I\u2019d nominate Putin. And then they\u2019d be so nervous that they\u2019d let me have anybody I wanted, which of course would be Sarah Palin.\u201dPeople, do you remember what Mitch McConnell used to say when he was the powerless Senate minority leader? Of course you don\u2019t. There\u2019s just so much stuff that fits into a human brain and no reason whatsoever that McConnell should be taking up space.He used to say that when Republicans got control, democracy and venerable tradition would rule. No more of those sneaky tricks that his predecessor Harry Reid used to keep the other side\u2019s ideas from coming up for a vote: \u201cThe answer is to let folks debate, to let the Senate work its will.\u201d He had a vision of a deliberative body that argued so long and hard that eventually all the Democrats would collapse from exhaustion and he, Majority Leader Mitch, would walk over their prostrate bodies to principled victory.That was the good old days. We remember them with nostalgia, like the golden era when members of both parties drank in the same bars. Now apparently the Senate can\u2019t even be trusted to hold a committee hearing.\u201cWe\u2019re not moving forward on it, period,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio. He used to be regarded as the most rational person in the Republican presidential field. That was just because we hadn\u2019t had time to get acquainted yet.If you want to understand why the Republicans are broadcasting their commitment to obstructionism, it\u2019s useful to take a look at Rubio\u2019s campaign. Given the tenor of our times, it\u2019s natural that all the candidates would depict Barack Obama as the worst thing that\u2019s happened to America since \u2026 oh, I don\u2019t know. Pearl Harbor? The Panic of 1837? But Rubio also insists that the president has been ruining the country on purpose: \u201cAll this damage that he\u2019s done to America is deliberate.\u201dThis is a theory, much loved on talk radio, that involves an insidious presidential plot to make America just a run-of-the-mill country \u2014 smaller and weaker and burdened with universal health care. When things go wrong it isn\u2019t because of ineptitude. It\u2019s a careful Obama scenario aimed at bringing the country down. A man that sinister can\u2019t be allowed to even put a nomination into play. God knows what would happen. Close your eyes and pretend he isn\u2019t there.Ben Carson made the same point in his traditional way \u2014 that is, in language that made no sense whatsoever: \u201cIt is imperative that the Senate not allow President Obama to diminish his legacy by trying to nominate an individual who would carry on his wishes to subvert the will of the people.\u201dAnd Jeb Bush \u2026 O.K., we don\u2019t need to talk about Jeb Bush. This is the man who recently tweeted a picture of a handgun with his name engraved on it, over the title \u201cAmerica.\u201d The only good thing you can say for his campaign is that he did not send out a video called \u201cIt\u2019s Morning Again in America\u201d that opens with footage of Vancouver.

{"Headline": "From a \u2018Dating Fast\u2019 to a Quick Proposal", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byVows10 PhotosSerena Powery did not know that Joseph Tillman was fasting when they met as youth ministry volunteers on a church retreat in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York in August 2014.\u201cWe talked for hours that first day, and though I had been dating someone else at the time, I was immediately attracted to him,\u201d said Ms. Powery, a 24-year-old social worker in the Bronx.\u201cI\u2019m really good at being able to tell if someone likes me, but I never got that vibe from Joseph,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was never an underlying tone of flirtation, and he made it clear from the start that we were never going to be anything more than just friends.\u201dMr. Tillman, a 31-year-old associate at a Manhattan law firm, clearly liked what he saw in Ms. Powery. \u201cShe had a great sense of humor and was wise beyond her years,\u201d he said. But having had some bad luck on the dating scene, including a tumultuous breakup earlier that year, he refused to view her, or any other woman, through romantic eyes.\u201cI had been dating a person I thought I knew very well, but after two months, the whole thing just crashed and burned,\u201d he said. \u201cI was completely thrown for a loop, and I kept asking myself, \u2018Why do certain relationships fail?\u2019 I needed to take some time to reassess things.\u201dMr. Tillman consulted with his pastor at the Brooklyn Tabernacle Church.Pastor Craig Holliday had suggested a fast, though not from food but rather from romance. It is advice he has given others in the church.\u201cIt all depends on the individual situation and what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mr. Holliday said. \u201cWhen it came to Joseph, there were a number of things that had gone on in his social life that he and I had discussed. I recommended the dating fast as a way to clear his head. I said, \u2018Don\u2019t date anyone for the rest of the year and let\u2019s talk around the beginning of the New Year.\u2019\u201dMr. Tillman took the recommendation to heart.\u201cIt was a time in my life when I had asked God to give me some clarity in terms of what I was looking for in a woman,\u201d he said.But it was clear that Ms. Powery was everything he was looking for in a friend.\u201cShe was so much fun to be around,\u201d he said, \u201cand we had so much in common.\u201dThey grew up in California, she in San Jose and he in Perris, and each stayed in-state to receive a bachelor of arts degree, she in psychology at U.S.C., and he in finance at California State University San Bernardino.Mr. Tillman moved to New York in 2009 to study for a law degree at N.Y.U. In 2012, he became a volunteer member of the young adult ministry of the Brooklyn Tabernacle Church. Ms. Powery, who arrived in New York in 2013 to study for a master\u2019s degree in social work from Columbia, joined the church a year later and volunteered in the same ministry.They made the California connection at the church retreat, after a quick introduction on a soccer field.After an evening sermon that night, Mr. Tillman was walking back to his cabin when he spotted Ms. Powery sitting alone on a bench around midnight, gazing at the stars. They began a conversation that lasted until 5 a.m., wandering around their campsite and engaging in what Ms. Powery described as \u201ca very deep, transparent conversation that set the tone for our friendship.\u201d\u201cWe talked openly about everything, including ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends, I mean everything,\u201d said Ms. Powery, who sings with a smaller segment of the renowned Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir during Friday night church services. \u201cWe learned a lot about each other on that trip.\u201dThose free-spirited discussions, Mr. Tillman said, were the byproduct of the fasting advice.\u201cSince I wasn\u2019t interested in dating Serena, I allowed myself to be more vulnerable in conversation than if I had approached her in a romantic way,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we were able to be completely honest and nonjudgmental, and we just clicked and talked for hours and hours.\u201dThey talked about continuing their education, and their lives, in New York. Ms. Powery was still studying for her master\u2019s (which she earned in May 2015), while Mr. Tillman, who had already earned his law degree, was specializing in private equity fund formation at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, overseeing general fund structure and United States regulatory matters.\u201cThe fact that Serena and Joseph were both from California was a definite factor in the two of them hitting it off,\u201d said Juliana O\u2019Brien, a lifelong friend of Ms. Powery from San Jose. \u201cWe\u2019re a different breed out in California, much more relaxed and much warmer, and they found those qualities in each other.\u201dThree months into her friendship with Mr. Tillman, Ms. Powery broke up with her boyfriend. Her friendship with Mr. Tillman remained strong as they continued worshiping together and often going for long walks and talks around Manhattan, where Mr. Tillman lived.But the dating fast continued. There were no romantic overtures.\u201cJust hanging out and telling jokes,\u201d she said. \u201cNot taking life too seriously.\u201dIn January 2015, Ms. Powery was aware that Mr. Tillman had begun dating again. Three months later, Ms. Powery told him that she had been accepted to the Peace Corps, in rural El Salvador.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it as if to say, \u2018Well, if we\u2019re not going to be together, I\u2019m going to run off and join the Peace Corps,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was already resigned to the fact that Joseph was just going to be a good friend, but I was also of the mind-set that I was young and single, and I thought that if this is where God wants me to be, then why not pick up and leave?\u201dMr. Tillman was shaken by her decision. \u201cMy head started spinning,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like: \u2018Whoa, wait a minute. I need more details.\u2019\u201dThey discussed it the next day over lunch, during which Mr. Tillman made a confession.\u201cI told her that since she was leaving anyway, it couldn\u2019t hurt to tell her that I remembered thinking after our first conversation that we had a great connection, but since I wasn\u2019t dating anyone at that time, I just sort of ignored it. I told her that I did think something was there, and though I didn\u2019t know if it was friendly or romantic, it was something I didn\u2019t want to let go of.\u201dIn recalling the moment, Ms. Powery offered a confession of her own.\u201cI\u2019m sitting there pretending to be all cool,\u201d she said. \u201cDeep inside I\u2019m shouting: Yes! Praise the Lord! We\u2019re finally on the same page.\u201dIn June 2015, Mr. Tillman officially began dating Ms. Powery, who was then living in Harlem and working in Brooklyn as a social worker at New York Therapeutic Communities.In October 2015, she began working in the Bronx as a youth justice social worker for the Center for Court Innovation, seeking alternatives to prison for 16- and 17-year-olds who commit misdemeanor crimes.Earlier that month, Mr. Tillman had gone back to the West Coast to cheer for Ms. Powery, who was participating in the Arthritis Foundation California Coast Classic Bike Tour, an eight-day 525-mile bike ride that began in San Francisco and ended in Los Angeles. Also riding were Ms. Powery\u2019s parents, Maria Powery and Dwight Powery, and her sister, Evelyn Powery.\u201cWe do it every year in memory of my younger sister who died from a more complicated disease, but she also had arthritis,\u201d Ms. Powery said.Soon after she rode across the finish line, Mr. Tillman, who had been waiting there, proposed.\u201cSerena knew all along that Joseph was the one,\u201d said Maria Powery. \u201cEverything has worked out perfectly for them.\u201dIncluding Ms. Powery\u2019s commitment to the Peace Corps, which was scheduled to begin in March. Though she had intended to forgo her service, she received an email two months ago from the Peace Corps, and learned that the cohort that she was to be a part of had been canceled. \u201cIt was further confirmation that Joseph and I were meant to be together,\u201d she said.They were married Jan. 31 by their pastor, Mr. Holliday, at the Kirkpatrick Chapel on the campus of Rutgers in New Brunswick, N.J.The groom waited and watched with 160 guests as the chapel\u2019s center doors opened wide. There stood Mr. Tillman\u2019s best friend, clutching a bouquet of white roses in her hands.\u201cIn every home, there is a thermostat and a thermometer,\u201d Mr. Holliday told them. \u201cJoseph, you are the thermostat. You will regulate the spiritual temperature in your new home, and based on your actions, Serena, who is your thermometer, will let you know what the temperature is.\u201dGail Tillman, the groom\u2019s mother, with tears in her eyes, watched her son and his wife enjoy their first dance togetherto \u201cAt Last,\u201d by Etta James. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect soul mates,\u201d she said at the reception, held at The Palace at Somerset Park in Somerset, N.J.Mr. Tillman had, at last, found in Ms. Powery the answer to a question he need no longer ask.\u201cThe moment I slipped that ring on her finger, I knew why so many relationships fail,\u201d he said. \u201cA true relationship can only last if it begins with an honest, solid friendship, like the one Serena and I have had from Day 1.\u201dMr. Tillman was inspired to go on his \u201cdating fast\u201d by Pastor Craig Holliday, a minister of the Brooklyn Tabernacle Church in Brooklyn, where the groom is a congregant. Pastor Holliday discussed what inspires him to sometimes advise men and women in his church to take a break from romance.Q: Have you given this advice to anyone else in the church?A: Yes, on occasion. It\u2019s important because unless you begin to identify the areas in your own life that you need help in, by God\u2019s grace, then all you will do is jump from one bad relationship to the next because you have brought these problems with you. And that is what I didn\u2019t want Joseph to do. He had been going through some bad relationships over a two- to three-year period, so finally I just said, \u201cStop, it\u2019s time to look at your own life and ask yourself \u2018What is it about me that needs to change?\u2019\u201d Because ultimately, the common denominator of every relationship he got himself into was himself. So now you have to step back and say, \u201cThese things aren\u2019t working out.\u201d You need to take the time to ask yourself, \u201cWhat am I bringing to the table?\u201dQ: Do you recommend a dating fast to women as well as men?A: I have advised both men and women, who have sought my counsel, to go on dating fasts. I currently have a couple of young ladies within the church who are in that kind of holding pattern when it comes to dating.Q: What kind of feedback do you receive from people who have taken your advice?A: I\u2019ve never had anyone come back to me and say \u201cI don\u2019t think it was such a good thing.\u201d I would say that every single person has come back to me and thanked me for encouraging them to do it, and all of them have said that it was a good way to help keep themselves accountable in relationships.Q: Is there a timetable for these dating fasts?A: It all depends on the individual and his or her situation. The shortest dating fast I ever recommended has been six months. You first have to get to a place of acknowledgment and then start working through certain issues, and I don\u2019t think anyone can do that in 30 days. I currently have another young man on a dating fast for the past year, and though he has really grown during that time, he has told me that he will continue to fast because he still needs a lot of work.A Matchmaker Finds a Love of Her OwnAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Bring the Supreme Court Back Down to Earth", "Date": "2016-02-15", "News": "Supported byNotebookAnd so, here\u2019s a question for President Obama, as he and his advisers are making their short list and checking it twice: Should the next justice bring a diversity of professional experience not currently on the court? Would a nominee who comes from outside the bench excite the country?The politician who left the greatest mark on the court is probably Earl Warren, a former governor of California. President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated him as a reward for his help securing the 1952 Republican presidential nomination. Chief Justice Warren\u2019s selection \u201cmight be regarded as a scandalous act of using a Supreme Court seat as simple political barter,\u201d Garrow points out. Instead, he is generally regarded as one of the nation\u2019s most successful chief justices, because the country reaped the benefit of his leadership experience. He led the court to its unanimous and historic 1954 ruling against school segregation, in Brown v. Board of Education, and to an ensuing series of decisions protecting civil rights and expanding due process in criminal cases. His closest partner on the court, Justice William J. Brennan Jr., came from the New Jersey Supreme Court, rather than the federal bench.There may be a pragmatic rationale for Obama to stick with the Sotomayor-Kagan strategy this time around. Before the president said a word about who his nominee would be, Senate Republicans, including the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, demanded that Scalia\u2019s seat be left open until the next president is chosen in November. One plausible riposte would be to nominate an apparent moderate with a traditional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 who was recently confirmed by the Senate to an appeals court, with plenty of Republican support or even unanimously. (Three examples: Judge Srikanth Srinivasan of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; confirmed 97 to 0. Judge Jane L. Kelly of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit; confirmed 96 to 0. Judge Paul J. Watford of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; confirmed 61 to 34.) Such a choice would put pressure on Republicans by allowing the president to argue that blocking it is an act of pure obstructionism.Or conversely, maybe Obama only has a prayer if he goes bold, and comes up with someone outside the appellate courts who he can \u201creally whip up support for, and make the Republicans nervous about the consequences if they won\u2019t bring up for a vote,\u201d says Lee Epstein, a political scientist and law professor. For instance: a politician or other figure from a swing state, or from a minority group, who could lay claim to a constituency that Republicans \u2014 or at least some senators who are up for election \u2014 care about. Obama could try to come up with his own Earl Warren: a politician with a source of popular support, who would bring firsthand knowledge of how the other branches of government operate.The campaign finance case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission is another example. Could a justice who\u2019d held elected office have prodded the majority to think harder about its claim that political contributions to \u201cindependent\u201d groups \u201cdo not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption\u201d?The last justice with experience in elected office was Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who had served in the Arizona State Legislature. \u201cShe was always vaguely looking for where the public was,\u201d Epstein said. \u201cI think that affected her decision making. We haven\u2019t had someone like that in a long time.\u201d\u201cWhen you think about the increased likelihood that African-Americans will be stopped and arrested, it\u2019s fairly astonishing that a perfectly innocent person who has been arrested, and has made no indication that he is a threat, can be strip searched,\u201d Ifill told me. \u201cWhat Marshall did on the bench, when the justices conference about a case, was to say, \u2018Let me tell you how it happens.\u2019\u201dThere\u2019s no way to eliminate an individual\u2019s blind spots; we all have them. But a group of nine people offers the possibility of correcting for at least some of them. Ifill argues that rather than accepting the narrowed constraints on the nominees for today\u2019s court, Obama could view the Republican opposition as freeing. \u201cI\u2019m struck by Reagan\u2019s appointment of Sandra Day O\u2019Connor,\u201d Ifill says. \u201cHe probed and he found someone who wasn\u2019t obvious.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s time for a magic ingredient \u2014 one that would bring a kind of wisdom to the court it currently lacks and would shake up the inevitable political battle to come, by introducing an element of surprise.An earlier version of this article misstated Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s experience prior to her appointment to the Supreme Court. While she was nominated to the federal appeals court, she never served as a federal appellate judge. The earlier version also described Sherrilyn Ifill currently calling the Supreme Court \u201cout of touch.\u201d That phrase appeared in the headline of a 2012 article by Ifill.Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine and the Truman Capote fellow at Yale Law School.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airlines Reap Record Profits, and Passengers Get Peanuts", "Date": "2016-02-06", "News": "Supported byHelped by falling oil prices, airlines are reporting record profits, but for many passengers this sudden bonanza has meant little more than extra bags of free peanuts and pretzels.The four biggest domestic carriers \u2014 American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines \u2014 together earned about $22 billion in profits last year, a stunning turnaround after a decade of losses, bankruptcies and cutbacks. A big reason for this is the plunging price of jet fuel, which now costs only a third of what it did just two years ago.But that windfall is only slowly finding its way down the aisles. Days after reporting record profits, for instance, two of the nation\u2019s biggest airlines brought back free snacks in coach.Airfares, however, have remained stubbornly high.At the same time, demand is rising, meaning flights are full and airlines have few incentives to discount fares.\u201cThis is like a perfect storm for the airlines right now, and it could keep going on for the next year,\u201d Mr. Seaney said. \u201cGiving free peanuts and chips is a way to address the issue that consumers think the airlines have been nickel-and-diming them.\u201dFor now, airline executives have been clear about their priorities: to show improvements in their financial performance.This means emphasizing acceptable returns on invested capital by raising dividends, buying back more shares and paying down debt. It does not mean using the savings from fuel costs to finance the type of market share battle that proved so damaging before the industry began to consolidate.What managers want to avoid is the kind of price war that devastated the airlines\u2019 economic well-being in the decades after the industry\u2019s deregulation in the late 1970s. While this period of unfettered competition pushed down ticket prices and benefited consumers, it proved unsustainable.When the Great Recession hit, airline executives reduced the number of flights and successfully argued for the industry to consolidate. Successive mergers between Delta and Northwest Airlines, United and Continental, Southwest and AirTran Airways, and American and US Airways left four big domestic airlines in control of 80 percent of all seat capacity.\u201cThis is a period of good health like we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Ed Bastian, Delta\u2019s president, who will become chief executive in May. \u201cWe will want to stay disciplined to make sure we don\u2019t repeat the errors of the past.\u201dAs a result, airlines have placed extraordinary emphasis on what industry insiders call \u201ccapacity discipline\u201d \u2014 not adding seats faster than demand. The Justice Department, though, is investigating whether this industry practice amounts to possible collusion among the big airlines.In addition, airlines are finding more creative ways to wring more money from passengers, including charging for aisle and window seats, shrinking legroom to pack in more seats on each plane, and offering priority boarding for a fee.\u201cThey simply folded them into the fares,\u201d Mr. Hobica said. \u201cThey call them carrier surcharges and fees. They just don\u2019t call them fuel surcharges.\u201d\u201cFor the past several years, I\u2019ve just had the genuine feeling that we\u2019re all being overcharged,\u201d Mr. Perosi said. \u201cMost of the time, all the extra add-on fees are more expensive than the actual airfare.\u201dRepresentatives from the major airlines insist that the extra charges are part of the cost of doing business and are not tied just to the cost of fuel.Gasoline prices and home heating bills have not fallen as fast as oil prices, but those declines have still been much more substantial than the drop in airfares.Airlines maintain that consumers are benefiting from their improved financial performance, and that airfares are shrinking, albeit slightly. Average ticket prices fell 3 percent to $385 in the second quarter last year, the most recent period for which figures are available, according to the Department of Transportation. Airlines have reported that the trend has since continued.Carriers also point out that they are improving their services by buying new planes, installing larger overhead bins, upgrading their entertainment systems and refurbishing airport lounges \u2014 all improvements that customers can see. At the same time, rank-and-file employees are getting bonuses, and new labor agreements show gains that were unimaginable just a few years ago.If there is any crack in the airlines\u2019 fare structure, it is, not surprisingly, in markets where upstart carriers have provided vigorous competition.Low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air have passed the savings from lower jet fuel prices on to consumers by offering discounted tickets \u2014 including $80 round-trip fares on dozens of routes like Chicago to Atlanta, and Dallas to San Diego \u2014 prompting a response from the major airlines.American said last October that it would offer \u201cno frills\u201d fares on routes where it competes with Spirit. The tactic resembles Delta\u2019s \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares, which are nonrefundable and do not allow for any changes or even seat selection.\u201cThe big airlines are sending a message: \u2018If you do this to us, we will cause you pain,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Hobica said. \u201cI don\u2019t think American is happy to fly from Dallas to San Francisco for $40 one-way, but it will do it to show it won\u2019t be bullied around by some upstart.\u201dBut such bargains have not trickled down to Jonathan Aberman, a venture capitalist in Washington who flies often. He said he had seen \u201cabsolutely no change\u201d in the cost of his airline tickets in recent years.Indeed, Delta last month successfully pushed through a $6 fare increase \u2014 which was quickly matched by the other major carriers \u2014 although it was lower than previous increases of $10 or more by other carriers.\u201cIt\u2019s very straightforward,\u201d Mr. Aberman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the industry to monopolize. As a result, they have enormous pricing power.\u201dMartha C. White contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Today\u2019s Republicans Don\u2019t Get About Reagan", "Date": "2016-02-24", "News": "Supported byOp-Ed ContributorHE supported the biggest amnesty bill in history for illegal immigrants, advocated gun control, used Keynesian stimulus to jump-start the economy, favored personal diplomacy even with the country\u2019s sworn enemies and instituted tax increases in six of the eight years of his presidency.He was Ronald Reagan.The core beliefs that got Reagan elected and re-elected were conservative: lower taxes, smaller government and a stronger, more assertive military. But Reagan was also a pragmatist, willing to compromise, able to improvise in pursuit of his goals and, most of all, eager to expand his party\u2019s appeal.The current field of Republican presidential candidates invokes Reagan as a patron saint, but the characteristics that made him a successful politician seem lost on them. Instead, they\u2019ve turned his party into a swamp of nativism, ideological extremism and pessimism about the country\u2019s future, in direct opposition to Reagan\u2019s example. And they\u2019ve transformed primary season into a reality show of insults, betrayals and open feuds, defying the so-called 11th Commandment that Reagan espoused: Thou shall not speak ill of any fellow Republican.Once in office, Reagan said that anytime he could get 70 percent of what he wanted from a legislature, he\u2019d take it. Today\u2019s congressional Republicans won\u2019t settle even for 99 percent: Their mentality has shifted away from having policies and governing and toward a kind of bitter-end obstructionism.In the early days of the presidency of Bill Clinton, congressional Republicans essentially went on strike, treating any legislative accomplishment as a Republican defeat, but they came to the table for a budget deal in 1997. With President Obama, they have largely refused to accept the basic legitimacy of a Democratic president. The tactical obstinacy of the 1990s has curdled into the belief that any compromise constitutes betrayal, a dynamic now playing out in the primaries.The issue that shows the divide most sharply between Reagan and the current crop of presidential hopefuls is immigration. In the past, Republican candidates have been justly criticized for deploying racially coded messages around crime and welfare. But in the main, the party has for decades embraced Reagan\u2019s notion of American identity based on immigration, assimilation and economic opportunity. Every Republican presidential nominee since Reagan has been a moderate on immigration, and has wanted to bring Latinos into the Republican fold.How did the inclusive, forward-looking Republican Party of Reagan become the crass, xenophobic party of Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz?The rise of super PACs and the right-wing media has disempowered the party\u2019s gatekeepers, while wage stagnation has widened the opening for populist demagogy. This year\u2019s primary candidates have learned the lesson not only that exploiting prejudice around immigration and terrorism works politically, but so, too, does defying the party\u2019s elders and its official apparatus. Thus Mr. Trump thrives and the establishment favorite, Jeb Bush, is already out.A more surprising reason for the shift? Money. In economic terms, Republican politicians see increasing returns to extremism. The Citizens United decision has raised the potential financial stakes of presidential elections for media companies, political professionals and candidates alike. The presidential campaign of 2016 will most likely cost upward of $5 billion, more than 10 times the one that elected Reagan in 1980.A lot of people get rich in a $5 billion industry, and some are politicians. Mr. Trump is not the only contender to make the calculation that running for president is win-win, burnishing \u201cbrand\u201d value even for the losers. Ben Carson \u2014 yes, still in the race \u2014 seems more interested in selling books than in attaining higher office. Marco Rubio has already enjoyed years of patronage from a billionaire auto dealer in Florida.The examples of Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee underscore the point that a no-hope presidential run has more upside than downside. A career as a right-wing celebrity \u2014 a stint on Fox News, speaking fees, book advances \u2014 is more profitable than one in the Senate. These incentives have helped to shift the Republican Party from a party of opportunity to a party of opportunists.The loser could be the party itself. Unless it repudiates the inflammatory rhetoric of the primary, it will lose Reagan\u2019s claim to the center and become more like one of Europe\u2019s chauvinistic right-wing parties. In the 1980s, it was said that the Democrats looked for heretics while the Republicans looked for converts. To watch the spectacle in the 2016 primaries is to see those tendencies reversed.Jacob Weisberg is chairman of the Slate Group and the author of the Ronald Reagan volume in the American Presidents series.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nikkei Plummets in Japan on Yen Strength", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byThe benchmark Nikkei 225 average fell as much as 5.4 percent before closing 4.8 percent lower as investors continued their flight from relatively risky stocks and into bonds and other assets seen as havens. The shift has rattled markets around the world, but Japan is particularly vulnerable because of a jump in the value of the yen. A stronger currency hurts profits at companies like Toyota and Hitachi, which earn much of their income abroad.The yen climbed as high as 110.9 to the dollar Friday before settling back to about 112 in late-afternoon trading. The currency\u2019s value has increased about 10 percent since its most recent low in December.Investors\u2019 embrace of the yen has been little affected by the Bank of Japan\u2019s introducing negative interest rates two weeks ago. The move pushed the yield on 10-year government bonds into negative territory this week and should in theory make holding yen less attractive. But investors appear to believe that the alternatives are worse.The Nikkei more than doubled between late 2012 and the middle of last year, buoyed by an improving global economy and the loose monetary policy of the central bank. Under Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor appointed in early 2013, the bank has been flooding financial markets with cash by buying large amounts of government bonds. The policy led to a sharp devaluation of the yen, but its weakening effect on the currency appears to be waning.The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, sought to calm the market turbulence on Friday.\u201cThe flight from risk is spreading to financial markets around the world, but the Japanese economy is in very solid shape, so investors\u2019 psychology is too pessimistic,\u201d he told reporters after a regularly scheduled Cabinet meeting.He added that \u201cabrupt exchange rate movements are undesirable\u201d \u2014 a phrase often used by the Japanese authorities to signal displeasure with the yen\u2019s direction, which has sometimes been followed by actual financial intervention to reverse its course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vaginal Ring With Drug Lowers H.I.V. Rates in African Women", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byThe protection was not complete: Overall infection rates were reduced by only 27 percent and 31 percent, though women who were over 21 fared better. But researchers said that the device was still a major advance and that the results were the most promising to date in H.I.V. prevention for African women. They said they would press ahead to get the ring approved and widely distributed as quickly as possible.Dr. Baeten said the two trials, similar in design, but independent of one another, were done in parallel because regulators usually require data from two studies to approve a new product.\u201cIn science, replication is incredibly important,\u201d Dr. Baeten said. \u201cYou have to show something and show it again to know it\u2019s real. This is the first time we have replication for this kind of prevention tool in women.\u201d\u201cI remember really vividly talking with some of the participants in Zimbabwe partway through the study, and they would say, \u2018This ring is mine,\u2019\u201d Dr. Baeten said. \u201cThere was ownership of the ring because she could control it.\u201dStudy participants used the phrase \u201cset it and forget it\u201d to describe the ring, he added.In the Aspire study, over all there were 27 percent fewer cases of H.I.V. in women who received drug-treated rings, compared with those given placebo rings. The actual numbers of infections were 97 in the placebo group and 71 in the treated group.But when the women were sorted by age, researchers found that the device was considerably more effective in those over 25: Their infection rate was cut by 61 percent. In those over 21, the reduction was 56 percent.In the Ring Study, the infection rate was reduced by 31 percent over all and 37 percent in women over 21.The ring offered little or no protection to women under 21 in either study.Researchers think the results were better in the older women because they used the devices more consistently. But the scientists also say more research is needed to find out whether there is some biological factor making younger women more susceptible to H.I.V. infection and harder to protect.\u201cClearly, we would have liked to have seen a higher efficacy over all,\u201d said Zeda Rosenberg, the founding chief executive officer of the International Partnership for Microbicides, which developed the ring. \u201cWe would have liked to have seen more women in the trial be able to use it consistently.\u201dThe studies revealed that the ring was not \u201cforgiving,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said: It has to be used full time, or it does not work.Tests done during the study, measuring dapivirine levels in the women\u2019s blood and in the rings that were returned after they were supposed to have been used for a month, revealed that some of the women must have removed the rings for significant periods of time.About 25 percent of the women apparently used the ring \u201chighly consistently,\u201d Dr. Rosenberg said, adding that the figure was consistent with other studies in sub-Saharan Africa involving pills and gels offered for H.I.V. prevention. With pills and gels, that low level of use translated into no protection. But with the ring, the same amount of use resulted in a 30 percent reduction in infection, which was \u201ccomforting,\u201d she said.She said her group would submit applications for approval of the ring early next year to regulators in South Africa and Europe. Future versions will last three months, she said, and some will combine antiviral medication with birth-control drugs.An earlier version of a picture caption with a photograph of people in a South African town misidentified the woman speaking.

{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Last Budget, and Last Budget Battle With Congress", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byThe deficit would increase in this fiscal year to $616 billion from $438 billion last year, the budget projects, in part because of tax cuts that Mr. Obama and Congress agreed in December to make permanent. That would make this year\u2019s shortfall equal to 3.3 percent of the economy\u2019s output, or gross domestic product, up from 2.5 percent and exceeding the 3 percent threshold that economists consider sustainable for a growing economy.Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed 10-year savings \u2014 some spending cuts, but primarily almost $3 trillion in higher taxes from wealthy individuals and some businesses, including a $10-a-barrel fee on crude oil \u2014 would push deficits down again for a couple years and offset costs of the president\u2019s proposed initiatives.Then deficits would begin increasing again with the retirement and health costs of aging Americans. The administration says annual deficits would remain below 3 percent of the gross domestic product through the decade to 2026. The accumulated debt held by the public would grow from $14 trillion currently to $21.3 trillion in that time, but measured against a growing economy, the debt would be stable at about 75 percent of gross domestic product.While Mr. Obama has achieved little to restrain the growth of the entitlement programs that many consider unsustainable, deficits would not return to levels exceeding $1 trillion, and nearly 10 percent of the gross domestic product, like the deficit he inherited in 2009, his budget projects.That prompted the legacy-minded president to take something of a victory lap in his budget\u2019s opening message. Striking an optimistic tone that contrasted sharply with the doomsday talk from Republican presidential candidates and congressional Republicans, he wrote, \u201cTogether, we have brought America back.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress over the past seven years on our economy,\u201d he later said at the White House. \u201cUnemployment is down. Deficits are down. Gas prices are down. Job creation, wages, the rate of Americans with health coverage are all up.\u201d\u201cAmerica is as strongly positioned as any country on earth to take advantage of the opportunities of the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Obama added.Republicans disagreed.\u201cThis budget joins his others by placing America on a fiscal path that is unsustainable and threatens our long-term economic growth,\u201d said Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.Mr. Enzi and the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, have said they will not invite Mr. Obama\u2019s budget director, Shaun Donovan, to testify before their panels, That is a break with a tradition dating to the start of the modern budget process in 1975 and a snub that captures the hostility that Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda faces.Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, dismissed the president\u2019s budget as \u201ca progressive manual for growing the federal government at the expense of hard-working Americans,\u201d noting that the oil tax alone could add 24 cents a gallon to gasoline prices. Mr. Obama proposed the tax to pay for more than $300 billion in infrastructure improvements over 10 years.The president said he had spoken to Mr. Ryan about the cybersecurity initiative, which is the centerpiece among new proposals that could garner bipartisan support, administration officials say, despite Republicans\u2019 condemnation of the budget as a whole. \u201cThis is not an ideological issue,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The $19 billion cybersecurity request reflects a 35 percent increase above current spending. Part of that, a $3.1 billion proposal to overhaul the government\u2019s computer systems, was prompted by a huge embarrassment: the Chinese theft of security records on 22 million Americans from the system run by the Office of Personnel Management.The discovery prompted a major review of the government\u2019s \u201clegacy\u201d computer systems that concluded, as numerous government-sponsored reports had warned for years, that the systems were simply not designed to withstand modern cyberattacks.On Tuesday, Mr. Obama said the problem was so severe that some government systems, including for Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service, were running on software systems dating to when he was a child in the 1960s.As for the rest of the $1.2 trillion in discretionary spending in the budget, about half would go to domestic programs and half to the military.To pay for his initiatives and reduce deficits, Mr. Obama added to a raft of tax proposals he has made for years to close loopholes and limit breaks for the wealthy and some businesses. Cigarette taxes would go up to finance universal prekindergarten, and other new revenues would go toward initiatives including worker retirement savings options, wage insurance, college assistance and an expanded earned-income tax credit for childless workers \u2014 an idea Mr. Ryan has proposed.Some administration officials said the nearly $3 trillion in tax increases over 10 years would achieve rough parity in deficit reduction efforts after five years in which Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans have cut $4 trillion in spending to reduce deficits.Republicans rebuffed the proposed tax increases, as they have in the past. Yet a few of Mr. Obama\u2019s revenue ideas in the past ultimately have been embraced in bipartisan budget deals to offset the costs of initiatives popular in both parties.Administration officials pointed to a number of initiatives that could draw support from some Republicans, especially senators vulnerable in this election year. Such initiatives include increased spending to treat people addicted to opioids and heroin, cancer research, efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system, and stepped-up fighting against the Islamic State.An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of the budget that would be set aside for discretionary spending. It would be $1.2 trillion not $1.2 billion. The article also misstated the amount of the deficit last year. It was $438 billion, not $503 billion. The error was repeated in a summary of the story on the homepage.David E. Sanger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Breed of Trader on Wall Street: Coders With a Ph.D.", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byHOLLYWOOD, Fla. \u2014 The mood in the markets may be getting grimmer, but in the booming world of exchange-traded funds, people just want to party.It was an invitation-only party (crabs, cocktails and a D.J. on a moonlit dock) thrown by Jane Street, a secretive E.T.F. trading firm that, after years of minting money in the shadows of Wall Street, is now pitching itself to some of the largest institutional investors in the world.And the message was clear: Jane Street, which barely existed 15 years ago and now trades more than $1 trillion a year, was ready to take on the big boys.Much of what Jane Street, which occupies two floors of an office building at the southern tip of Manhattan, does is not known. That is by design, as the firm deploys specialized trading strategies to capture arbitrage profits by buying and selling (using its own capital) large amounts of E.T.F. shares.It\u2019s a risky business.And in many cases, some of the most popular E.T.F.s track hard-to-trade securities like junk bonds, emerging-market stocks and a variety of derivative products, adding an extra layer of risk.These dangers were brought home last August, when markets were rattled by China\u2019s decision to devalue its currency; some of the largest E.T.F.s sank by 50 percent or more.While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls.\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable what they can do,\u201d said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. \u201cIf you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, it\u2019s fewer and fewer firms.\u201dIt is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion.And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader \u2014 one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firm\u2019s capital.In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop.Here is a small sample of Jane Street\u2019s main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (master\u2019s in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (master\u2019s in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelor\u2019s in computer science, Carnegie Mellon).For large asset management firms like BlackRock, Vanguard and Invesco, the business of rolling out one E.T.F. after another has become a major profit center. But in many ways, the real money is being made by the trading firms that specialize in making a market in these securities.For example, Jane Street, which is privately held, has increased its shareholder\u2019s equity, or net worth, to more than $1 billion today from $228 million in 2007.That cash cushion handily surpasses what such established investment banks as Evercore, Moelis and Greenhill have (as of 2014) as well as that at money management firms like Eaton Vance.Moreover, it supports just 450 people in offices in New York, London and Hong Kong.Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business.Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level.Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firm\u2019s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading.A star trader for the company, he also oversees its hiring process.Jane Street has acquired a reputation for being perhaps the toughest interview in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street.This is in part because the firm hires only a handful of new employees each year. To survive, candidates have to ace brain-twisting math riddles and game theory tests.But as Mr. Lehoczky has said when asked what he is looking for in an E.T.F. trader, the ideal candidate possesses what he calls second-order knowledge \u2014 a form of intellectual humility in which really smart people can accept being wrong and own up to mistakes.In that vein, a prospect might be fed a math problem that cannot be answered, just to gauge reaction to failure.Because Jane Street finds itself competing more with Facebook and Google for talent than with, say, Goldman Sachs, the firm lays on the perks. These include a catered breakfast and lunch, a substantial gym right off the trading floor, generous child care benefits and an in-house speaker series that has featured the likes of Salman Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens and Garry Kasparov.As for compensation, how much Jane Street\u2019s rocket scientists get paid is as closely guarded a secret as its trading formulas. Still, it is apparently quite a bit.\u201cAs a trader, if you do well, you will retire before you turn 30,\u201d said one employee on an industry message board.A number of larger banks, Goldman in particular, have been involved in exchange-traded funds for some time now, but the rest of the Wall Street banks are seeking to recruit their own E.T.F. hotshots.One such trader is Monish Shah, a 31-year-old native of Mumbai, who was hired by the Japanese bank Mizuho to build a trading desk in its New York office.Mr. Shah fits the profile of the up-and-coming E.T.F. trader: He is young, has a master\u2019s degree in quantitative finance at Georgia Tech and is as much a writer of code as he is a trader.On an old-school trading desk of mostly white men in their 50s buying and selling common stock, Mr. Shah stands out.Ensconced at the far end of the firm\u2019s equity desk, his four computer screens flash an array of color-coded execution cues, and he is a frequent target of good-natured trading-room banter, sending up his supersize console, his youth and even his Indian accent.As stocks tumbled yet again on a Friday this month, curses rang out up and down the desk. An E.T.F. that Mr. Shah had been eyeing was down more than 3 percent, and now his color-coded signals were flashing green for buy \u2014 which is what he did, just as the market bell rang at 4 p.m.Within a half-hour, the desk was empty as his colleagues rushed to catch the early train home. But Mr. Shah was not going anywhere; he had a business to build.\u201cThere are so many moving parts; if just one thing goes wrong, you get killed,\u201d Mr. Shah said, letting out a slow sigh. \u201cSo yes, it is stressful \u2014 but it is also my passion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After 14 Years at Odds, Argentina Aims to Settle Debt With Hedge Funds", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byAfter a bitter face-off for more than a decade between Argentina and a group of disgruntled New York hedge funds, both sides have come to the negotiating table with fresh hopes of a resolution.But the dispute, which has left Argentina largely cut off from international markets, still promised a few twists as a new round of talks took place this week in Manhattan.On Tuesday, Argentina struck a deal to pay $1.35 billion to a group of Italian investors whose bonds the country defaulted on in 2001, according to news reports.The deal is the first settlement with so-called holdout creditors who have not\u00a0participated in earlier restructurings over debt from nearly 15 years ago. But Argentina has yet to come to an agreement with the New York hedge funds \u2014 holdouts led by the billionaire Paul E. Singer\u2019s Elliott Management.A stalemate involving the creditors and Argentina\u2019s last president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, led the country to default on its debt again in 2014. The new administration of President Mauricio Macri has indicated that it wants to resolve the debt as part of a bigger move to reform Argentina\u2019s economy.Luis Caputo, the newly appointed finance secretary, and other senior government representatives met this week with principals at the hedge funds \u2014 including Mr. Elliott\u2019s NML Capital unit, Aurelius Capital, Montreux Partners, Dart Management and Davidson Kempner \u2014 in Manhattan, according to a court-appointed arbiter Daniel A. Pollack. The group is seeking a resolution for claims totaling around $9 billion, he added.In dispute is how much Argentina should pay in interest.At a news conference in Buenos Aires announcing the deal with Italian bondholders, Argentina\u2019s economic minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, touched on the question of interest payments. \u201cWe have said that we will respect the bond principal and that we are going to be firm in negotiating the interest, and in this particular agreement we have achieved just that.\u201dBut, Mr. Prat-Gay added, \u201cThe difficulty that we have right now is that some bondholders want to be paid an interest rate that, under any type of judicial criteria, is unacceptable.\u201dThe battle between Argentina and its holdout creditors stems from 2001, when the country defaulted on billions of dollars in debt. Argentina offered to exchange the bonds it defaulted on for new bonds worth significantly less, a move that holdouts rejected. NML Capital sued Argentina seeking full repayment \u2014 principal and interest \u2014 and a Manhattan district court judge ruled that whenever Argentina paid one group of bondholders, it would also have to pay the holdouts.This ruling could complicate Argentina\u2019s deal with Italian holdout creditors. As part of the deal reported on Tuesday, Argentina will pay 150 percent of the original $900 million that the Italian bondholders hold from Argentine debt issued more than a decade ago. These details were reported by Bloomberg and Reuters, citing Task Force Argentina, the representative for the bondholders.There are other issues that stand to complicate negotiations. Mr. Caputo is expected to publicly announce a proposal for the New York hedge funds this week. But these holdouts have requested that Argentina sign a nondisclosure agreement promising not to discuss the negotiations publicly.Under President Macri, who was sworn in as president in December, the government has already taken steps to reform the economy, removing capital controls on its currency, the peso. It has also made efforts to rebuild relationships with the financial community. Representatives from Argentina held meetings with members of the International Monetary Fund during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, seeking to reset frayed relations under Ms. Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner.\u201cI want to insist that after so many years of conflict, we are ready to reach a settlement agreement in fair conditions,\u201d Mr. Macri said at a news conference during the forum in Davos on Jan. 22.The negotiations between Argentina and its creditors are being watched closely by the investment world. On Tuesday, another New York hedge fund, Gramercy, filed a $1.3 billion claim against Peru over what Gramercy claimed is that government\u2019s refusal to properly repay defaulted debt.Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Clash of the Populists", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byTHE Book of Daniel predicted it. The Book of Revelation confirmed it. The Necronomicon spelled it out in language too terrible for human ears to hear. And if you read \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d backward in the original Sanskrit, you\u2019ll find it foretold there as well: Before the seventh seal is opened, before Famine and Pestilence are loosed, the Man in White must do battle with the Combed-Over Titan, amid the ravening shrieks of Twitter and beneath the unblinking eye of Cable News.Or, for the less mystically inclined: It was only a matter of time before Pope Francis tangled with Donald Trump.Their war of words came about the way you would expect. It began with a rambling press conference on the papal plane, where Francis suggested that Trump (or at least his zeal for an amazing border wall) \u201cis not Christian.\u201d It escalated with a rambling press release from the mogul turned presidential candidate, which Trump-splainedto the pope that only a Trump administration can protect the Vatican from ISIS.The obvious drama of the collision lay in the contrasts between the two men: The celibate and the lecher, the ascetic and the billionaire, the mystic and the frank materialist. But their similarites are also fascinating. For all the ways in which Francis and Trump differ, as figures on the global stage they\u2019re also strangely alike \u2014 in the forces that they\u2019re channeling, their style of public salesmanship, and their relationship to the institutions they either head or aspire to lead.The public style that produces these \u201csay what?\u201d moments can get them both into a kind of trouble. But the billionaire and the pontiff both seem to believe \u2014 on some evidence \u2014 that a little troublemaking is the best way to make the disaffected pay attention.And by reaching people who usually tune out churchmen and politicians, they have become leading populists in our increasingly populist moment. The popular constituencies they speak for are very different, of course. Trump is a nationalist, speaking on behalf of the unhappy Western working class, while Francis is a Latin American and a globalist, speaking for the developing world\u2019s poor \u2014 which is why immigration policy naturally puts them at loggerheads.Neoliberalism needs critics, as the Republican Party needs reinvention and the Catholic Church needs reform. At the same time, as Schmitz notes, what both Trump and Francis promise \u2014 deliverance \u201cfrom inconvenient and unresponsive institutions, with all their strictures and corruptions\u201d \u2014 downplays the value of rules, customs, and traditions in protecting people from the rule of novelty and whim.This is always populism\u2019s peril: That it relies too much on the power of charisma, and tears down too much in the quest to make America or Catholic Christianity great again.Of course neither Francis nor Trump have broken anything yet. The populist pope may be remembered as a great reformer, and the populist billionaire as the unlikely catalyst for the Republican Party\u2019s long-delayed reform.But for now, the last thing they have in common in this: Everything that makes them interesting makes them dangerous as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. and Democrats at Odds Over Dismissal of Perry Indictment in Texas", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byHOUSTON \u2014 It was unusual for a judge on the highest criminal court in Texas to start his opinion by quoting Omar Little, the shotgun-wielding character in the HBO series \u201cThe Wire\u201d with a knack for robbing drug dealers. But the quote, strangely enough, seemed to encapsulate one of the most politically charged legal cases in recent Texas history and to vindicate former Gov. Rick Perry: \u201cCome at the king, you best not miss.\u201dThat street-tough warning was used by Judge David Newell, one of the Republican judges on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals who ruled in favor of Mr. Perry last week and dismissed the criminal case against him. A grand jury in Austin in 2014 indicted Mr. Perry while he was still in office on two felony charges of coercing a public servant and abusing his official capacity, but the criminal appeals court tossed out one of the charges and upheld a lower court\u2019s dismissal of the other charge.And just as Republicans and some legal observers attacked the indictment as being politically motivated, Democrats criticized the dismissal of the charges as being equally partisan. The Republican majority of judges appeared to end the case before it ever went to trial and before any hearings were held to present evidence.Mr. Perry\u2019s lawyers, the special prosecutor and legal experts were as divided in their views of the court\u2019s decision as the court itself, whose eight judges involved in the case issued one majority ruling, two concurring opinions and two strongly worded dissents. The ruling was 6 to 2, with six Republicans deciding for Mr. Perry, and one Republican and one Democrat dissenting. Some saw political motivations in the dismissal while others did not.\u201cEverything about this case is unusual,\u201d said Shannon Edmonds, a former prosecutor who is the director of governmental relations for the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, which represents thousands of local prosecutors. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-in-a-century type of case.\u201dIn 2013, Mr. Perry pressured the Democratic district attorney in Austin\u2019s Travis County to step down by threatening to cut off state financing to the anticorruption Public Integrity Unit in her office. The district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, had been arrested on a charge of drunken driving. Mr. Perry followed through on his threat by vetoing $7.5 million for the unit. In dismissing the indictment, the six judges found that the charges restricted Mr. Perry\u2019s First Amendment free-speech rights and infringed on his veto power in violation of the Texas Constitution. They also made a procedural decision that upended a longstanding legal principle \u2014 a move that Mr. Perry\u2019s critics said created new law specifically to benefit him. But his supporters and some legal experts said it amounted to a proper solution for a unique set of circumstances. Typically, defendants in Texas cannot claim before a trial that the crimes they are charged with are unconstitutional as applied to their situation and must wait until after their conviction to raise those issues on appeal. The court allowed Mr. Perry to make a so-called as-applied challenge before the trial, citing \u201cthe disruptive effects of a criminal prosecution\u201d and stating it was necessary to ensure public officials can effectively perform their duties.\u201cHe absolutely got special treatment,\u201d said Michael McCrum, a San Antonio lawyer who was appointed by a Republican judge to serve as the special prosecutor. \u201cThey have created new law especially for him. I thought the criminal justice system and existing law was strong enough to withstand the force of political pressure. I guess in this case I was wrong.\u201dTony Buzbee, Mr. Perry\u2019s lead defense lawyer, disputed Mr. McCrum\u2019s assertions and described the majority opinion as appropriate. \u201cMr. McCrum is a sore loser,\u201d Mr. Buzbee said. \u201cHe took this silly case, wasted a ton of taxpayer money and got publicly beaten. He stretched the bounds of ethics in bringing this case, and there should be ramifications for him doing so.\u201dSusan R. Klein, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and a former federal prosecutor, said she saw nothing political in the ruling.\u201cYou can\u2019t prosecute a governor for using his veto,\u201d said Professor Klein, who helped Mr. Perry\u2019s legal team prepare for oral arguments by playing the role of a judge. \u201cI\u2019m a liberal Democrat. I have no love for Perry as a person. I don\u2019t agree with any of his politics.\u201d But she said she liked to think that a court composed \u201cof all Democrats would have come to exactly the same result.\u201dYet the political tenor of the case was clear in elements of the judges\u2019 opinions. Judge Newell wrote that everyone was \u201cmaking this case more complicated than it is because of who it involves.\u201d In her dissent, Judge Cheryl Johnson, a Republican, took exception to how the majority referred to Mr. Perry not as appellant but as Governor Perry, which \u201ccould well be seen by the public as an inference that appellant\u2019s position in life entitles him to special privileges and special treatment by this court that others might be denied.\u201dIn his dissent, Judge Lawrence E. Meyers, the only Democrat on the court, called the majority opinion a \u201cfairy tale\u201d that \u201crepealed more statutes and made more new law than Governor Perry\u201d had in a legislative session. Judge Meyers, 68, switched parties in 2013, becoming a needle in the Texas Republican haystack. Of the 27 men and women who hold statewide elected office, Judge Meyers is the sole Democrat. The rest are Republican.It was Judge Meyers who noted that the court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Perry\u2019s case marked the second time in the last two years that the majority had given \u201cspecial treatment to a government official,\u201d a reference to Tom DeLay, the former Texas congressman and House majority leader. Mr. DeLay, who had been indicted in 2005 for violating state campaign finance laws, had his conviction on money-laundering charges thrown out by an appeals court in 2013. The Court of Criminal Appeals upheld overturning the convictions in 2014.Elements of Mr. DeLay\u2019s case had paralleled the one against Mr. Perry. The same watchdog group, Texans for Public Justice, filed the complaints that began both cases, and the same anticorruption unit in Austin was central in both. The Public Integrity Unit led the investigation against Mr. DeLay, and Republicans had long accused it of politically motivated prosecutions. After Mr. Perry\u2019s indictment, the Republican-dominated Legislature limited the unit\u2019s authority and put the Texas Rangers in charge of investigating corruption by state officials and state employees.Mr. Edmonds of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association said he was skeptical, however, that partisan politics was driving Mr. Perry\u2019s case any more than any other legal process involving a prominent politician. \u201cAny time you are alleging that a politician broke a law, you are by nature wading into politics,\u201d Mr. Edmonds said.Advertisement"}

Its notable innovation \u2014 the conversion to a more compact format, in 2003 \u2014 was emulated by broadsheets across the world, including The Times of London, seeking to look more nimble and less unwieldy.While \u201cThe Indy,\u201d as it was commonly called, initially attracted a new generation of newspaper readers, Mr. Greenslade argued that it became overstretched when it decided, in 1990, to start a Sunday edition as an economic downturn was gathering pace.

{"Headline": "Cuomo-de Blasio Feud Threatens New York City\u2019s Plans for Affordable Housing", "Date": "2016-02-29", "News": "Supported byFor most of the last two decades, financing affordable housing in New York City has been a predictable process, instrumental in adding tens of thousands of apartments for lower-income households in a city where rents continue to soar out of reach for more people every year.In the latest round of city-state jousting, developers, bankers and de Blasio administration officials said they were told in meetings with aides to Mr. Cuomo that the city would lose a sizable share of up to $900 million a year that the state provides in federal tax-exempt bonds for affordable housing projects in the five boroughs.Developers and bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from Albany, said they were told that the Cuomo administration planned to use the bonds for the governor\u2019s own recently announced $10 billion statewide housing plan.The shift would alter a decades-long arrangement that has provided the city with a critical source of financing for housing and that in just the last two years has played a role in nearly half of the roughly 40,000 affordable housing units built or preserved in the city. Officials and developers say that a major change would create uncertainty for projects underway and for many others on the drawing board.At a time when one-third of New York City renters spend more than half of their income on housing and when each subsidized apartment coming on the market draws hundreds of applicants, Mr. de Blasio is trying to rezone parts of the city to encourage more residential development and promising thousands of new affordable units a year.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office confirmed the meetings, and state officials who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter confirmed that the state would be using a greater share of the bonds than in the past. But they denied that they planned a wholesale takeover of the bond program.In an interview last week, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, declined to say how much less the city would receive under his housing plan, which his administration expects to describe in detail in April. \u201cThere is no state housing plan that has been discussed with either the Assembly or the Senate, so this is pure groundless speculation,\u201d he said.The bond program is only the latest blow the state has dealt, or threatens to deal, to the de Blasio administration\u2019s housing policy.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important an issue to get caught up in a world of politicking.\u201dLast week, lower-level officials from the state and the city began meeting to try to resolve the differences.But developers and city officials say dozens of shovel-ready projects may not be financed this year if the state ends up withholding the bulk of the tax-exempt bonds the city uses to leverage other federal financing, along with city subsidies, to pay for new housing.The battle over the bonds had been brewing since November, when the state told city officials that it would provide only $90 million in additional bond financing for remaining 2015 projects, not the $300 million it had expected, putting a dozen projects in jeopardy. That led Alicia Glen, deputy mayor for housing and economic development, to rebuke Bill Mulrow, the secretary to the governor.A group of developers, hoping to head off the tensions, met on Feb. 3 with Mr. Mulrow and James Rubin, the state\u2019s housing chief. Several participants said they were told that to finance the deals envisioned, the state would need the bulk of the bonds it would have allocated to the city.Most housing deals include various sources of financing, but the bonds are valuable because they leverage federal tax credits for the same projects. Still, developers often seek tax breaks, zoning changes and grants for projects where all of the apartments have below-market rents.A few days after the Feb. 3 meeting, a group of bankers met with Mr. Rubin and other officials to express their confusion about whether New York City projects that they were underwriting could count on bond financing and other subsidies that come from the city or the state. \u201cThe result is that stuff that should be getting done isn\u2019t getting done,\u201d one participant said.A banker at that meeting said Mr. Rubin assured participants that the state would be in a position to back projects, with ample bond financing available, along with subsidies. But the group was not reassured, the banker said, and urged state officials to work with the city.Ms. Glen said the state conveyed a similar message to \u201cvery senior level people in the administration.\u201d She said they were told to expect a substantial reduction in the flow of tax-free bonds.Traditionally, the state has provided tax-free financing for large luxury projects that set aside 20 percent of apartments for poor and moderate-income tenants, while the city has focused its financing efforts on projects where all of the units would be affordable.The city received $868 million in bond allocations in 2014 and $694 million in 2015. Over the last two years, the city produced about 14,000 new units and kept another 26,000 existing ones affordable for lower-income households, using bond financing in 40 percent of the projects.But if the state is going to build affordable housing in the city, it needs resources from the city like additional subsidies, zoning changes and property tax breaks.\u201cFor us to be in a situation where there\u2019s going to be uncertainty around what we can produce at a time when we\u2019re at the biggest affordable housing crisis in the history of New York, to me there\u2019s no way to square that,\u201d said Ms. Glen, who also served as a senior housing official for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.During an interview on Wednesday with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Mr. de Blasio said he opposed the shift the state was planning. \u201cAnything that fundamentally undermines our affordable housing plan will not be met with public approval,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number one issue on people\u2019s mind is the city\u2019s affordability.\u201dBut Mr. Cuomo said talk that the state would substantially cut the city\u2019s allocation of bonds was overstated. \u201cThe city has done very, very well on the bond cap under my administration and will continue to.\u201dHe said it was important to revive the tax abatement program known as 421a.For housing advocates, the main question is whether the governor\u2019s plan will bring in new resources and add housing, rather than simply do what the city would otherwise have done.The governor, in the interview, said his intention was to supplement the city\u2019s efforts, not supplant them.\u201cObviously, it doesn\u2019t make sense for the state to do a program that would be duplicative of a city program,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill Clinton Defends Welfare Law From Bernie Sanders\u2019s Attacks", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Repeatedly saying that the law did \u00e2\u0080\u009cway more good than harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton, in brief remarks to The New York Times, offered a striking contrast to his fiery outbursts against Barack Obama in South Carolina before the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary eight years ago. Back then, Mr. Clinton sharply defended himself and Mrs. Clinton from attacks by supporters of Mr. Obama, comments that upset many African-American Democrats who liked the Clintons but were supporting Mr. Obama.With Mrs. Clinton in far better political shape heading into the South Carolina primary on Saturday than she was in 2008, Mr. Clinton surely saw less need to lace into Mr. Sanders. But his care with his words was notable given the harshness from Mr. Sanders, who said on Wednesday that Mrs. Clinton had rounded up votes for a welfare bill that, in his view, harmed \u00e2\u0080\u009csome of the weakest and most vulnerable people in this country.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton, in pushing back against Mr. Sanders, noted that during his presidency, median incomes for African-Americans rose sharply and the poverty rate declined; a record number of African-American-owned businesses opened; and the homicide rate for African-Americans tumbled. But he bemoaned cuts in federal subsidies to state assistance programs, which had been promised stable financing in the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened was, the people who still needed some assistance didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were able to restore virtually all the cuts to legal immigrants that the Republicans demanded, we kept the guarantee of nutrition and health care. But the law needs to be changed to help the poorest of the poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that it did far more good than harm, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that subsequent events showed it needs some improvement.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMr. Clinton, who never mentioned Mr. Sanders, made his comments after a campaign rally here where he barely mentioned the Vermont senator, instead offering a glimpse of a general election argument that Mrs. Clinton might make against Donald J. Trump. Mr. Clinton took issue with Mr. Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political tagline, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake America Great Again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d saying that America is a strong country that needed to do more to help people of all races and incomes, from struggling coal miners and small-business owners to African Americans and police officers who are divided by a lack of trust.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think America ever stopped being great \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have to make America whole again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton told a couple of hundred supporters in Rock Hill, a modest-size city near the North Carolina border.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do we make America whole again? Well, we shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build a wall around this country. We should do what Hillary wants to do. We should tear down the barriers and build ladders to prosperity.\u00e2\u0080\u009dWhile Mrs. Clinton has been decrying \u00e2\u0080\u009csystemic racism\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the criminal justice system ahead of the South Carolina primary, where more than half of Democratic voters are likely to be black, Mr. Clinton took a different tack here. He praised police officers generally and said that communities needed \u00e2\u0080\u009cneighborhood councils\u00e2\u0080\u009d and other groups that would build closer ties with beat cops and law enforcement officials.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to put more police on the street that look like the communities they are policing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all know that anytime people have a lot of guns, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s violence, and drugs are being sold, once in a while something\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen that shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did not pass judgment on who was to blame in such incidents, but focused instead on the need for the police and community officials to work together.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need the police, we need the police, but we need a police that people trust are on their side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.Throughout his speech, Mr. Clinton seemed to be reaching out to white voters at a time when Mrs. Clinton is explicitly courting African-Americans and Hispanics. Mr. Clinton said the government needed to do more to help coal miners whose livelihoods were being threatened by the steady decline in coal production. He called for making greater high-speed Internet broadband available in \u00e2\u0080\u009cevery small town in rural America,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which would lead to new job opportunities for miners and others.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose coal miners in West Virginia didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey kept the lights on for decades, their children fought in our wars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Referring to miners as \u00e2\u0080\u009cour brothers and sisters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added that people of all races \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeserve the chance to begin again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sounding a little like Mr. Trump \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whom he never mentioned by name \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mr. Clinton also called for tougher enforcement of trade deals and a tougher stance against China on currency manipulation.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to say, \u2018Look, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play us for suckers anymor\u2019e,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said.The former president also drew strong applause when he backed President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constitutional authority to nominate a new justice to the Supreme Court after the recent death of Antonin Scalia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe should do his job and put up somebody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Mr. Clinton repeatedly praised Mr. Obama while also noting that many Americans still had not rebounded with the improving economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes 10 years to fully get over a financial crunch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Clinton said. Referring to Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s State of the Union address last month, Mr. Clinton continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe painted this beautiful picture of the future, but the problem is, a lot of Americans are staring at this picture but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find themselves in it.

{"Headline": "Inklings of a Chill in the Art Market", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "Supported bySotheby\u2019s and Christie\u2019s, which both reported slightly lower sales in 2015 last month, faced their first major stress test of the year this past week with the February sales of Impressionist and modern works in London, followed by their contemporary auctions a week later.Demand was more selective, but so, too, was the supply. Much of the drop-off in totals can be explained by owners\u2019 reluctance to consign trophy-quality works when buyers are nervous or distracted \u2014 and when the auction houses and third parties are less willing to risk guaranteeing sales. Only four lots were financed in this way at these evening auctions.\u201cThere are so many concerns in the world at the moment,\u201d said Patrick Legant, a London-based art adviser. \u201cPeople would have felt it wasn\u2019t the right time to sell.\u201dWhen high-quality works were offered, and were not fresh to the market, the math could be sobering.Christie\u2019s did find a telephone buyer for Max Ernst\u2019s important and much-exhibited 1941 Surrealist landscape, \u201cThe Stolen Mirror,\u201d for a top price of \u00a37.6 million, or about $11 million, with fees, just above the low estimate. The only lot in the sale to be guaranteed by the auction house \u2014 two others were backed by third parties \u2014 this vision of moss-encrusted figures in a ruined port, painted in the year when the German artist fled Nazi-occupied France for the United States, had been bought by its London-based seller for $16.3 million at Christie\u2019s in New York in 2011.There was also a shortfall between some of the values put on works in late 2015 and what the market was prepared to pay in early 2016. Matisse\u2019s historically interesting but visually uninspiring 1923 painting, \u201cLa Le\u00e7on de Piano,\u201d had been owned by the same Scottish family since 1926. It carried a low estimate of \u00a312 million at Sotheby\u2019s and fell to a single bid of \u00a310.8 million from the international dealer David Nahmad.\u201cThere were no blockbuster lots,\u201d said Abigail Asher, partner at the New York art advisers Guggenheim Asher, who was at Christie\u2019s. \u201cIt looks like a retrenchment, but there was bidding from real end-users and some strong prices. These are people who want to live with a picture.\u201dAt Sotheby\u2019s, there was a protracted duel between a telephone bidder and the Oslo dealer Ben Frija for one of the last two large-scale lifetime casts of Rodin\u2019s 1890-91 bronze, \u201cIris, Messag\u00e8re des Dieux,\u201d left in private hands. This extraordinarily modernistic female nude, once owned by the actor Sylvester Stallone, was eventually bought by Mr. Frija for \u00a311.6 million, almost double the low estimate of \u00a36 million.Oliver Barker, a senior specialist in contemporary art at Sotheby\u2019s, gave a winning bid of \u00a37.3 million on behalf of a client for Paul Delvaux\u2019s 1936 surrealist masterwork, \u201cLe Miroir,\u201d showing a fully clothed woman gazing at the reflection of her naked self. The painting achieved an auction record for the Belgian artist, just as it did in 1999 when its American seller bought it at auction in London for \u00a33.2 million.The Delvaux was typical of the sort of work that appeals to serious buyers of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art.Impressionist and modern, known as \u201cImps & Mods,\u201d was the biggest-selling category at auction until 2005, when it was overtaken by contemporary. With some collectors now wary of the high prices being paid for works by living artists, the new crossover category of \u201c20th Century\u201d \u2014 combining the later works from Imps & Mods with earlier pieces from postwar and contemporary \u2014 has become the key money-making market for international auction houses. Sotheby\u2019s, which last month announced its acquisition of the formidable New York art advisers Art Agency, Partners, and Christie\u2019s promoted this February fortnight of sales as a celebration of 20th-century art.But where does this leave early Impressionism? Totally out of collecting fashion, judging by results at these London auctions. At Christie\u2019s, the third-party guarantor bought Camille Pissarro\u2019s 1869 landscape, \u201cLe Village \u00e0 Travers les Arbres,\u201d with a single bid of \u00a3602,500, while Sotheby\u2019s saw all four of its Impressionist paintings from the 1860s and \u201870s fail to sell. Monet\u2019s 1871 landscape, \u201cUn Moulin \u00e0 Zaandam,\u201d estimated at \u00a3800,000 to \u00a31.2 million, was among the casualties. It had been bought three years earlier at Sotheby\u2019s, when Russian and Chinese buyers were much more active, for \u00a31.1 million.\u201cIt\u2019s not a collapse,\u201d said Mr. Legant, the art adviser. \u201cPeople are taking a breather. They\u2019re watching the market, and auctions tell you where the market is heading.\u201dWherever it is heading, it looks as though the destination is going to be different from what it was in 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cond\u00e9 Nast Adapts to New Forces, Leaving Some Employees Unsettled", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byThe economy had crashed. The publishing industry was fighting a financial crisis that amounted to an existential threat. Mr. Newhouse, in his 80s, was approaching the end of his career. They were concerned, they told him at his apartment, decorated with selections from a postwar American art collection, about Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s future. To succeed, they said, Cond\u00e9 Nast needed strong creative leadership across its portfolio of disparate magazines, the kind of leadership that Mr. Newhouse himself and his longtime artistic director Alexander Liberman had provided for decades.It was Ms. Wintour herself, the longtime editor of Vogue and one of the most powerful figures in fashion and publishing, who was eventually appointed as Mr. Liberman\u2019s heir \u2014 artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, overseeing its portfolio. She and Bob Sauerberg, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s chief executive, have introduced a rash of changes, both cultural and structural, that have left some in the company reeling.New editors have been appointed at Allure, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, Architectural Digest and Self. And in recent months, a round of layoffs struck GQ, Teen Vogue, Glamour, Self and Allure. Details, the men\u2019s lifestyle magazine, was shuttered entirely after 33 years.In a separate interview, Mr. Sauerberg confirmed that Cond\u00e9 Nast took in over $1 billion in revenue in 2015. The company said that while its print business, spread across nearly 20 magazines, remained profitable, revenue there had been flat since 2012. Its digital business is up nearly 70 percent over the same period but that component, as with virtually every other legacy media company, represents a much smaller percentage of overall revenue, which has declined in recent years.Mr. Sauerberg\u2019s plan focuses on maintaining print share, and increasing digital revenues through a focus on video and selling some publications to advertisers as a bundle, for example, and by increasing web traffic. Shortfalls in the meantime mean cutting costs, as Cond\u00e9 Nast is required by its parent company, Advance Publications, to show a profit.In interviews, nearly a dozen current and former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters, lamented a focus on the bottom line and a relentless pursuit of web traffic. Many acknowledged that the era of lavish spending at Cond\u00e9 Nast, with clothing allowances and town cars idling outside the headquarters, waiting to whisk employees to appointments, was not sustainable. But they suggested that financial survival and journalistic swagger \u2014 the kind that made Cond\u00e9 Nast an emblem of the golden age of publishing \u2014 need not be mutually exclusive.Mr. Sauerberg defended the recent upheaval as vital restructuring. His aim, he says, is to ensure that his company continues to influence the world. \u201cI am the top of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cI am incredibly competitive. I want to win. I want to be the best.\u201dCathy Horyn, a critic at large for New York magazine and a former fashion critic for The New York Times, says that Cond\u00e9 Nast is \u201ca delicate organism, and historically that company has proven that it gets along better with an artistic director.\u201d Ms. Wintour, she says, \u201cbrings the most institutional knowledge, but the big question is that the outside world has changed so much and can Anna play catch-up?\u201dThe decisions made in recent months have been Mr. Sauerberg\u2019s. But for those who work at Cond\u00e9 Nast, or follow the company, it is Ms. Wintour, or at least the myth that surrounds her, that looms behind every change.In addition to editing Vogue, she oversees magazines as varied as Brides and Golf Digest (Mr. Remnick, at The New Yorker, and Mr. Carter, at Vanity Fair, are largely left to their own devices). She has also grown increasingly influential in Democratic politics. And she has been involved with the recently named Anna Wintour Costume Center at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the annual Costume Institute Benefit at the Met. It is easy to forget that she has been making magazines for decades.Half a dozen current and former Cond\u00e9 Nast employees described working with Ms. Wintour as a privilege in some ways \u2014 she has access to improved budgets, the best photographers, and celebrities and socialites to fill pages \u2014 and a fraught experience in others. She gravitates toward her own distinctive visual style and can be dismissive when displeased, some staff members said.When asked about those accounts, Ms. Wintour stared stonily and asked whether The New York Times was a tabloid newspaper. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cI am decisive, you know. I don\u2019t believe in wasting anybody\u2019s time. I like to be honest. I like to be clear. In my own personal career, I have felt almost the most difficult thing to deal with is someone who doesn\u2019t tell you what they are thinking.\u201dShe agreed, when asked, that there was an element of sexism in the way she is viewed. \u201cBut I decided long ago that I can\u2019t let any of that bother me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my style is too direct for some, maybe they should toughen up a bit.\u201dShe strongly disagreed that the magazines she most closely oversees have begun to resemble Vogue, saying each of them has \u201ca very original voice.\u201dIn some ways, Ms. Wintour and Mr. Sauerberg make an unlikely pair. He is quiet and studied, and speaks with pride about the technical aspects of the business that he has worked on for some years, including a new content management system, growth on the digital side of the business and improved offerings for advertisers.He is an avid golfer who studied finance at the University of Arkansas. At Cond\u00e9 Nast, he oversaw consumer marketing then served as president before formally taking over as chief executive this month.He does not believe in motivating his staff, he said. \u201cI believe in hiring motivated people and giving them the rein and the authority to do great work.\u201dWhen asked about a view among some of his staff that he is more of a business figure than a creative leader, he conceded that his career had drawn him in that direction, but that he was looking forward to showing more. \u201cYou can make the statement that the guy came up this way,\u201d Mr. Sauerberg said, referring to his background, \u201cand it is my job to show them that it\u2019s not this way.\u201dIn recent emails to the staff, he drew attention to companywide internal awards as well as National Magazine Award nominations, and pointed to a social media advertising campaign based on a series of videos Cond\u00e9 Nast had put together about its creativity.Mr. Sauerberg, Ms. Wintour said, was not the same as Mr. Newhouse. But she says he is passionate about the magazines, and has his own skills: \u201cEverybody brings something different to a position. And it\u2019s not cookie-cutter. Nobody is ever the same.\u201dShe spoke warmly of Mr. Newhouse and Mr. Liberman, who she said had always encouraged her to take risks.

{"Headline": "Railing Against Graft, a Georgian Leads Calls for a Cleanup in Ukraine", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported by\u201cBlah, blah, blah,\u201d Mr. Avakov responded.\u201cBlah, blah, blah?\u201d Mr. Saakashvili snapped back. \u201cNobody ever talked to me that way.\u201dMinisters and their aides looked awkwardly down at their feet or twirled pens.Mr. Avakov returned to his speech, but Mr. Saakashvili stopped him again, shouting, \u201cI will prove that you are a thief!\u201dWith that, Mr. Avakov hurled a glass of water at Mr. Saakashvili. \u201cYou are a bastard and a circus artist,\u201d he yelled. \u201cGet the hell out of my country!\u201dMr. Saakashvili, 48, stared down Mr. Avakov for a few moments, then spat out the word \u201cthief\u201d and strode out of the room.While the water ended up on the Ukrainian foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, not on Mr. Saakashvili, the confrontation that many later compared to an elementary-school fight succeeded in bringing to light a dangerous fault line in Ukraine\u2019s leadership, one that threatens the West\u2019s $40 billion effort to build the country into a bulwark against President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia.President Petro O. Poroshenko\u2019s appointment of Mr. Saakashvili and a number of foreign technocrats created tension between anticorruption forces and those who want to respect a tacit agreement made with the country\u2019s business elite in exchange for their support against pro-Russian forces.The tension surfaced again on Tuesday when Ukraine\u2019s economic minister resigned to protest pressure on his ministry from an oligarchic businessman with ties to Mr. Poroshenko.The minister, Aivaras Abromavicius, a Lithuanian and one of the foreign technocrats appointed to root out corruption, said that a businessman, Ihor Kononenko, had lobbied to have his loyalists appointed managers of a government-owned ammonia fertilizer company to skim off the profits.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a smoke screen for obvious corruption or a marionette for those who want to return control in the old style,\u201d he said.Standing astride that chasm is Mr. Saakashvili, one of the post-Soviet era\u2019s most contentious and best-known politicians in the region, a graduate of Columbia Law School who came to power in his native Georgia after the bloodless Rose Revolution in 2003. So impressed were Western politicians that Mr. Saakashvili once joked that when he walked through Congress he turned more heads than Britney Spears.At home in Georgia, though, he was a lightning rod for debate, steering a pro-Western course that culminated in a disastrous war with Russia and an electoral defeat. After a self-imposed exile in Brooklyn, he is now reinventing himself in Ukraine.That is little surprise to most Ukrainians, since the new government of Mr. Poroshenko is padded with people drawn from the same corrupt business circles as the old government.And now it has fallen to the unlikely person of Mr. Saakashvili, an outsider in Ukraine, to try to break the economic stranglehold of those ultrarich insiders.\u201cI\u2019m close to them, but I wasn\u2019t part of them,\u201d Mr. Saakashvili said in an interview here last month. \u201cPeople tend to trust outsiders more than the decades-old insiders.\u201dIn addition to Mr. Saakashvili, the president has appointed Natalie Jaresko, an American-born financial expert, as his finance minister, and Maria Gaidar, a Russian advocate of overhauls, as Mr. Saakashvili\u2019s deputy after he was appointed head of Odessa by Mr. Poroshenko.\u201cPeople expected with a real revolution comes real change,\u201d Mr. Saakashvili said. \u201cBut we had the revolution that basically didn\u2019t produce real change. Now is the time to resolve this.\u201dMr. Saakashvili said he saw his role as unwinding a central compromise of the postrevolution government.That deal, attributed to a former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, offered the oligarchs a chance to retain their wealth and influence in return for loyalty in the fight against Russia.In exchange for appointments as governors, the oligarchs agreed to deploy their wealth to finance private militias to fight the separatists. Igor V. Kolomoisky, a gas station and airline tycoon, was appointed governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, where he founded Ukraine\u2019s most powerful private militia, the Dnipro-1 battalion.Mr. Kolomoisky is now out of office, and Mr. Poroshenko has taken steps to incorporate Dnipro-1 and other private militias into the army.But with the war now seemingly winding down, Mr. Saakashvili argues, it is also time to strip the oligarchs of their ability to pull revenue out of Ukrainian state companies, lest the public lose faith in the new government.It is time, Mr. Saakashvili said, to renege on the deal.\u201cThe problem is, they had this agreement with the old elite,\u201d Mr. Saakashvili said, not with ordinary Ukrainians.Rather than renationalize assets, as Mr. Putin did to sideline Russia\u2019s oligarchs a decade or so ago, Mr. Saakashvili suggested that Ukraine could elbow the ultrarich from politics by cleaning up state-owned enterprises.\u201cYou can just cleanse them of their oligarch manager and basically destroy or abolish this joint stock company of oligarchs that is what they see, what they regard, as Ukraine,\u201d he said.Mr. Saakashvili has faced some resistance to his plans, and not just from the oligarchs. Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, the prime minister who speaks fluent English and portrays himself as a Westernizer, has insisted that the government stand by its agreement with those who backed the fight against Russian separatism, including the interior minister, Mr. Avakov.Mr. Saakashvili, a shrewd politician with a populist streak, has set about organizing rallies around Ukraine to build a grass-roots anti-oligarch movement called Cleaning Up Ukraine. And he started the movement, pointedly, here in Mr. Avakov\u2019s hometown, Kharkiv, in January.\u201cWhat I hear from Ukrainians, unfortunately, is it\u2019s never been this bad in Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Saakashvili told the crowd in Kharkiv. \u201cWe need to change this government. Who do we need to change it for? For us, for you and for me.\u201dMr. Saakashvili spoke of post-Soviet malaise, of kleptocrats and party hacks who steal the people\u2019s money and hope. The crowd soon warmed to his heavily accented Russian. Given the anger at corruption, it seemed to work.The oligarchs who feed the rotten politics of Ukraine, even now, he said, must go. People chanted and cheered.Afterward, Mr. Saakashvili waded into the crowd. The poor and elderly in frayed sweaters and cheap overcoats pressed in, asking him to lead them out of the mess.Women sidled up to snap pictures. In the swirl, Mr. Saakashvili smiled and soaked up the attention. \u201cHe\u2019s our last chance!\u201d somebody yelled.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Drivers Up Against the App", "Date": "2016-02-19", "News": "Supported by\u201cWe want to show Uber that without us full-time drivers, they won\u2019t have any cars on the road,\u201d Abdoul Diallo shouted from atop a concrete stage. Mr. Diallo, a Guinean immigrant who has emerged as a leader of the strikes, was holding up his own sign: \u201cNo Drivers, No Uber \u2014 It\u2019s That Simple.\u201d\u201cThis is the formula!\u201d he hollered to the crowd.\u201cIn the beginning, your company was great for both drivers and customers,\u201d Mr. Diallo and his partners wrote this month in a letter to the service. \u201cYou treated drivers well and we loved you for that. Little did we know that it would be a short-lived momentary ecstasy that you used to lure us in in great numbers, just so that you can execute your plans and strategies toward world domination.\u201dUber, mostly through the voice of Josh Mohrer, the 33-year-old general manager of Uber New York, has said it is pained by the grievances of the drivers, who, while not employees of the service, are known as \u201cdriver-partners\u201d in the company\u2019s jargon. Like most tech operations, Uber has a data set for everything, and Mr. Mohrer said his numbers proved that January\u2019s price cut, like a steeper one two years ago, increased the demand for rides and therefore led to larger driver paychecks.\u201cIt\u2019s not intuitive to think that lower fares will mean more money, but that is the reality,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added that he understood why the drivers might be anxious. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ask to say, \u2018Just trust us.\u2019\u201d\u201cUber treats its drivers however it wants,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the ones who do everything except provide the technology.\u201dA former import-export trader who studied for a business degree, Mr. Diallo, 29, has been driving for the company for three years in a $50,000 Chevrolet Suburban. At first, he said, the job was great: He could afford his lease and still make money because he was taking in as much as $5,000 a week.But in 2014, Uber cut its rates by 20 percent and not long after that it increased its commissions. Last year, it forced new drivers working for its luxury arm, Uber Black, to pick up passengers through its less expensive option, UberX. On top of this, Mr. Diallo claimed that Uber\u2019s aggressive hiring has flooded the city with too many drivers chasing too few fares.\u201cPeople can\u2019t make a living,\u201d Mr. Diallo said on the phone after a meeting to coordinate the New York actions with others in London and San Francisco. \u201cThey\u2019re picking up $8 fares. They\u2019re driving their cars into the ground. Collectively, there\u2019s a lot of money coming in, but no one individual is making much.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere it\u2019s literally unbearable.\u201dUber likes to say that its drivers, not its riders, are its customers. And while the company might not give its customers health care or a pension, it does provide them access to high-tech support centers, modeled on Apple\u2019s Genius Bars, where they can ask questions about commercial licenses, receive free medical exams or get a can of soda. Uber also helps its drivers negotiate leases with car dealers.Uber also disputes the claim that there are too many drivers in New York. There are still more taxi riders that the company could woo, and, according to Mr. Mohrer, after the recent cuts were made, trips in the Bronx and Queens, where many drivers live, went up by nearly 25 percent.But if all this data has the weight of scripture for Uber executives, it has been less persuasive to the drivers, who say the statistics do not fully describe the experience of working for the company. Though lower prices might increase their workload and thus their gross, they say, the increased revenue will be eroded by a corresponding increase in expenses.At the Super Bowl rally, a driver named Mustafa, who declined to give his last name because he feared reprisals from Uber, said he expected to make about $40 an hour after the cuts. But that was before he paid for higher costs of maintenance, gas and washes; for his car lease, insurance and sales and income taxes; for emissions inspections and the 2.5 percent of earnings he gives each year to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation; and, of course, for his commissions.\u201cWhen you put it together, the numbers don\u2019t add up,\u201d Mustafa said. \u201cI\u2019m taking home less than minimum wage.\u201d\u201cWe stood behind them,\u201d said Ronnie Paulino, a driver who has worked for Uber for a year. \u201cThen they turned around and cut our pay.\u201dAfter speaking this month to an economics class at New York University, Mr. Mohrer acknowledged that when he first came to Uber, there were fewer drivers and stronger bonds between them and his management team. But as the fleet has grown, he said, he has tried to remain responsive to the drivers, who, on average, work 30 hours a week \u2014 or triple the rate of their peers in smaller cities.\u201cThey\u2019re more vested and engaged in Uber, so we take a more careful approach here,\u201d Mr. Mohrer said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a deeper relationship.\u201dBut deeper doesn\u2019t necessarily mean easier. A few weeks ago, Mr. Mohrer met with the leaders of the strikes at his office on West 27th Street in Chelsea\u2019s gallery district. He said they had a frank discussion about the rate cuts, which could be rescinded if the cuts do not achieve their goals. While he was not explicit about what those goals might be, he insisted that the conversation had been useful. \u201cI want to do this regularly,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving drivers the opportunity to speak to me and my staff can result in more rapid change.\u201dThe strikers found the meeting less successful. \u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThey treated us like jokers.\u201d From his perspective, Mr. Mohrer offered no concessions on the cuts and was firm on only one position: that there would never be a tipping option on Uber\u2019s app.And that was the message Mr. Krasniqi delivered to the crowd in Queens on Super Bowl Sunday. Cupping his hands to his mouth, he reported on the meeting, then told the drivers to call their friends and relatives who also worked for Uber and urge them to stop driving.\u201cThat\u2019s how we built them up \u2014 with our friends and families,\u201d Mr. Krasniqi roared. \u201cAnd if we built them up, we can destroy them!\u201dIt is hard to tell at this point just how serious the threat to Uber from sustained unrest would be. The challenges of organizing a work force composed of men and women of disparate ethnicities and languages loosely connected by a cloud-based app are significant. \u201cIf the drivers can come together in a block causing problems, they might get something,\u201d said Evan Rawley, a professor of strategy at the Columbia Business School who studies the taxi industry. \u201cBut this is not West Virginia coal miners who all grew up together in the same small town.\u201dThere is a potential wild card: Class-action lawsuits have been filed against Uber, including in the federal courts in Brooklyn and San Francisco, which seek to make the drivers full employees. If the suits are successful, they could cripple Uber\u2019s business model, though some legal experts have said they are skeptical that the drivers could prevail when they use their own vehicles, and decide themselves when and whether to pick up passengers.\u201cThe solution is not to stay with Uber,\u201d Mr. Diallo said. \u201cThe solution is to have our own platform \u2014 to build a real partnership and really be partners.\u201dFor now, however, they are still planning strikes, even if the one on Super Bowl Sunday was of questionable effectiveness. The drivers celebrated the action on their Facebook page, posting a screen shot of Uber\u2019s app that night \u2014 accompanied by the hashtag #SHUTDOWNSUPERBOWL \u2014 that showed a wait time at Kennedy Airport of 72 minutes.But the very next morning, Uber sent an email to its drivers announcing that the day before, it had broken its record for the most trips on a Sunday.\u201cThanks to you, our driver-partners,\u201d the email read, \u201chundreds of thousands of New Yorkers moved safely around the city this weekend.\u201dA cover article this weekend about Uber drivers\u2019 dissatisfaction with the company misstates, in some editions, the percent of earnings that Uber drivers pay to the Black Car Fund, a drivers\u2019 trade group, for workers\u2019 compensation. It is 2.5 percent, not 3 percent. And an accompanying timeline in some editions misstated the month and the year that Uber began UberPool, its carpooling service.

{"Headline": "Bill Clinton Unleashes Stinging Attack on Bernie Sanders", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byMILFORD, N.H. \u2014 Bill Clinton uncorked an extended attack on Senator Bernie Sanders on Sunday, harshly criticizing Mr. Sanders and his supporters for what he described as inaccurate and \u201csexist\u201d attacks on Hillary Clinton.\u201cWhen you\u2019re making a revolution you can\u2019t be too careful with the facts,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, deriding Mr. Sanders\u2019s oft-mentioned call for a political revolution.The former president, addressing a few hundred supporters at a junior high school here, portrayed his wife\u2019s opponent for the Democratic nomination as hypocritical, \u201chermetically sealed\u201d and dishonest.He even likened an incident last year, in which Sanders staffers obtained access to Clinton campaign voter data, to stealing a car with the keys in the ignition.Mr. Clinton discussed the race for nearly 50 minutes, and his comments took on a harder edge the longer he spoke. What began as a testimonial to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s leadership and a statesmanlike lecture on her approach to issues evolved into an angrier recitation of grievances against Mr. Sanders and his fervent supporters.\u201c \u2018Anybody that doesn\u2019t agree with me is a tool of the establishment,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Clinton said, mocking what he described as the central critique of Mrs. Clinton by Mr. Sanders.14 PhotosMr. Clinton\u2019s comments represented an escalation in the language that he and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign have used to attack Mr. Sanders, who has maintained a sizable advantage in the polls here. Mr. Clinton made headlines in 2008 for fiercely defending his wife, and leveling tough attacks on Senator Barack Obama, but he has been largely restrained so far in this campaign.Criticizing Mr. Sanders\u2019s hastily presented health-care plan, which Mr. Clinton claimed the Vermont senator had already disavowed, the former president asked: \u201cIs it good for America? I don\u2019t think so. Is it good for New Hampshire? I don\u2019t think so.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThe New Hampshire I knew would not have voted for me if I had done that.\u201dBut Mr. Clinton\u2019s most pointed remarks may have been when he took aim at Sanders supporters who, he said, use misogynistic language in attacking Mrs. Clinton. He told the story of a female \u201cprogressive\u201d blogger who defended Mrs. Clinton online through a pseudonym because, he said, the vitriol from Mr. Sanders\u2019s backers was so unrelenting.\u201cShe and other people who have gone online to defend Hillary, to explain why they supported her, have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often, not to mention sexist, to repeat.\u201d Mr. Clinton, growing more demonstrative, added that the liberal journalist Joan Walsh had faced what he called \u201cunbelievable personal attacks\u201d for writing positively about Mrs. Clinton.In a demonstration of how engrossed he is in this campaign, Mr. Clinton recited the names of the regional newspapers that are backing his wife\u2019s campaign and, in a rarity, mentioned Mr. Sanders by name.\u201cBernie took what they said was good about him and put it in his own endorsements,\u201d said Mr. Clinton, fuming that Mr. Sanders used complimentary language from a Nashua Telegraph endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in his own campaign appeals.Then, reflecting the fury among Clinton campaign advisers over what they see as the kinds of behavior Mr. Sanders gets away with, Mr. Clinton noted that the senator\u2019s campaign had used the image of an American Legion officer in New Hampshire without his permission.A week in February 1992 revived Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and made the state hallowed ground for the Clintons.\u201cIf you point it out, it just shows how tied you are to the establishment,\u201d he said.In a response, Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, called it \u201cdisappointing that President Clinton has decided to launch these attacks\u201d and said Mr. Sanders would continue to focus on his message against the rigged economy, campaign finance corruption and income inequality. \u201cObviously the race has changed in New Hampshire and elsewhere in recent days,\u201d Mr. Devine said.The appearance by Mr. Clinton, absent the entourage and crowds that usually surround the former president, was striking and somewhat poignant, and it felt far apart from the frenzied final campaigning happening around the state on Sunday. The junior high school\u2019s small gym was not full, and only a handful of reporters showed up, at a time when campaign events are being flooded with dozens of national and international journalists.But with Mrs. Clinton in Flint, Mich., and other Clinton staffers absorbed in the primary, Mr. Clinton seemed almost on his own: He was introduced by a local mayor and Larry Lucchino, the former chief executive of the Boston Red Sox.Recalling his own, formative experience in this state, Mr. Clinton sounded wistful in reminiscing about his duels with Paul Tsongas, the Massachusetts senator who beat him here.\u201cWhen I campaigned against Paul Tsongas we actually had substantive debates,\u201d he said with perhaps a selective memory given the intense attacks at the time over allegations of Mr. Clinton\u2019s sexual misconduct and his avoidance of the draft.Now, he complained, Mrs. Clinton is suffering through attacks from a would-be purist who, he said, is in reality a veteran politician hardly unfamiliar with the ways of politics. Citing Mr. Sanders\u2019s attendance at a lobbyist-filled Democratic Party fund-raiser, Mr. Clinton expressed astonishment.\u201cI practically fell out of my chair when I saw it,\u201d he said.Turning to a vivid metaphor, Mr. Clinton suggested that Sanders staff members\u2019 obtaining Clinton campaign voter data amounted to grand theft. Mr. Sanders apologized for the incident, but the former president dismissed that. He said that \u201cin private they sent an email out\u201d noting that the Democratic Party had left \u201cthe keys in the car, and all I did was drive off.\u201dThat line won laughs, which seemed to be what Mr. Clinton was going for. \u201cI want you to laugh,\u201d he told the crowd. But he did not seem to be in the mood for levity.Advertisement"}

Trump, reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday showed.In the last six months of 2015, F.E.C. records show, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing Mr. Rubio raised $14.3 million, including $2.5 million each from the hedge fund founders Paul Singer and Ken Griffin. The super PAC also drew significant support from donors who previously gave to groups backing Jeb Bush, among them Chris Cline, a coal executive, and Brian Ballard, a prominent Florida lobbyist.Mr. Cruz\u2019s backers include the Wilks family of Texas, who made a fortune in the shale oil boom and are prominent donors to anti-abortion groups; Edward Czuker, a Los Angeles real estate developer and board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition; and the Illinois businessman Richard Uihlein, who gave $1 million to a pro-Cruz super PAC in January.See how the latest fund-raising numbers from the campaigns and outside groups stack up.\u201cI think we\u2019re rewriting history,\u201d said Mica Mosbacher, a longtime Republican fund-raiser with ties to the Bush family, who decided to back Mr. Cruz because she was tired of the party nominating \u201cmoderates and career politicians.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve got a civil war within the party,\u201d Ms. Mosbacher added. \u201cAnd people want someone who is strong.\u201dMr. Trump has responded to their largess with an influx of his own money: In the last quarter of 2015, the billionaire businessman lent his campaign $10.8 million, according to F.E.C. reports, and raised just $2.7 million from other donors.Yet as caucusgoers gather in Iowa on Monday, Mr. Trump is at the top of the polls, and most of the money flowing into the Republican primary has been spent on attack ads targeting candidates other than the leader.Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Mr. Rubio, has spent $3.2 million attacking Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey \u2014 an effort to stifle Mr. Christie in New Hampshire \u2014 and $3.3 million against Mr. Cruz. The main group supporting Mr. Bush, Right to Rise USA, has spent $1.5 million against Mr. Rubio and $366,000 against John Kasich. Super PACs backing Mr. Cruz have spent more than $1.4 million against Mr. Rubio.The expensive five-way shootout is a sharp departure from 2012, when virtually all of the Republican donors inclined to write seven-figure checks rallied behind a single candidate, Mitt Romney. And it presents a stark contrast to the Democratic contest, where the biggest checks raised by outside groups have all gone to Priorities USA, a super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton. Priorities reported that it had raised $51 million since the beginning of last year, including a $6 million contribution in December from the liberal hedge fund billionaire George Soros. The biggest outside group supporting Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is funded entirely by a nurses union, pooling small contributions from members.The vast amounts of money still flowing into the race \u2014 combined with Mr. Trump\u2019s knack for running an effective campaign without the benefit of substantial super PAC support \u2014 suggest that there may be no quick end to the nomination battle, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s lead in most of the early Republican contests.While Mr. Bush raised less money for his campaign in the last quarter of 2015, the super PAC supporting him, Right to Rise, had $59 million on hand at year\u2019s end, and likely has enough remaining to bludgeon other Republicans. Many of the group\u2019s donors could move to support Mr. Rubio if Mr. Bush falters in New Hampshire.The pro-Rubio group, Conservative Solutions, had $14 million cash on hand, not including money held by an affiliated nonprofit that is not required to disclose its fund-raising. Mr. Cruz\u2019s groups have recently spent another $1.4 million attacking Mr. Trump, who has overtaken Mr. Cruz in Iowa, a state where 60 percent of the Republican electorate identifies as evangelical. But the Cruz groups remain flush: As of the end of December, they had $32 million in cash on hand.David Barton, an evangelical activist in Texas who runs Keep the Promise, an umbrella group of pro-Cruz super PACs, said the group\u2019s success was a reaction to earlier outside groups that wasted money on candidates uninspiring to conservative voters. Anti-establishment donors, he said, \u201cfinally have something that is closer to where they would like to give. And it is also closer to what they believe.\u201dYet the filings on Sunday reflect another reaction, as well. Mr. Sanders reported raising more than $33 million during the three months ending in December, most of it from grass-roots donors. In January, his campaign announced on Sunday, he took in an additional $20 million. The money has sustained him against Mrs. Clinton, who has built a more traditional campaign operation relying far more on donors giving the maximum contribution of $2,700. In Iowa, the two candidates are neck-and-neck, with Mr. Sanders holding on to a lead in New Hampshire. Both have enough money to compete effectively in the primaries and caucuses that follow.And Mr. Trump, beyond his loans to himself, has raised most of the rest of his money from small donors, including $2.7 million in the final quarter of 2015. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have appealed to smaller donors in part by promising supporters they cannot be bought by the bigger ones. Both have eschewed the dominant super PAC model of the 2016 cycle, where candidates typically have dispatched a trusted aide to raise unlimited money for an outside group. Neither has set up committees of wealthy \u201cbundlers\u201d drumming up checks from friends and family members. Neither man spends much time at fund-raisers.\u201cThe traditional campaign spends most of its time raising money so that it can pay to get its message out,\u201d said John Pudner, executive director of Take Back Our Republic, a conservative group that promotes small-donor giving. \u201cTrump broke down the means, which is collect a lot of money. He\u2019s found a different means to the same end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dropbox May Not Be LeBron James, but It Is Still in the Game", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byState of the ArtSo what\u2019s really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying?Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley\u2019s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear.According to Dropbox\u2019s executives, nothing too terrible \u2014 it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron.\u201cSentiment about companies goes in cycles,\u201d Drew Houston, Dropbox\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, told me in an email. \u201cGoogle, Apple, Facebook all went through multiple rounds of this. First, you can do no wrong, then you can do no right. Then people are like, \u2018Actually this is a pretty good company,\u2019 and around it goes. So you have to ignore the noise and stay focused on building great products and making customers happy. The rest will take care of itself.\u201dOther numbers are also promising, they said. More than 400 million people use the company\u2019s service \u2014 a place to keep documents online, so they can easily be shared and synchronized among different people and different computers \u2014 and the service is adding 10 million users a month. Dropbox also has 150,000 business customers, who pay annual fees of about $150 for each employee, and those ranks are growing by about 25,000 businesses a quarter.Insiders declined to specify Dropbox\u2019s revenue and growth rate, other than to say there had been increases since its last funding round, when the company\u2019s annual revenue was reported to be $400 million.Executives also said employee retention and hiring have not been hurt by the recent news. I asked several tech recruiters if they had noticed a diminished interest in working for Dropbox; none had. In the last year, Dropbox has hired from Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter.\u201cDropbox is growing on the same trajectory as the best software-as-a-service companies ever \u2014 like LinkedIn or Salesforce,\u201d said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and a partner at the investment firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in the company. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we couldn\u2019t be thrilled with that kind of performance.\u201dBut if Dropbox can still thrill its backers, it has also accumulated a chorus of skeptics. The company is one of several looking to ride two tidal waves now sweeping the business world \u2014 the trend toward business software that doesn\u2019t stink, known as the \u201cconsumerization of information technology,\u201d and the rising willingness of companies to store their most precious data on online servers, or in the cloud.Dropbox\u2019s issue is that its products for business customers are relatively new compared with those of its rival Box, which was founded before Dropbox and began focusing on business users earlier. Dropbox is behind Box in attracting the most lucrative segment of the market \u2014 the largest companies who will pay the most to get their data online.Dropbox argues that the comparison with Box doesn\u2019t take into account the differences in the two companies\u2019 business models. Sure, Dropbox is developing its sales team and expanding its product offerings for businesses. But Dennis Woodside, Dropbox\u2019s chief operating officer, said that its broad brand recognition makes the sales process more efficient \u2014 and thus cheaper \u2014 than Box\u2019s. When Dropbox visits a company\u2019s chief information officer on a sales call, it has something Box struggles to show \u2014 a large base of the company\u2019s employees who are already using its service.\u201cWe fish in a pond that\u2019s used to our product,\u201d Mr. Woodside said. In the last quarter, Dropbox signed up 13 large companies with more than 1,000 users each, he said, three times as many as in the same period last year.Mr. Schreier of Sequoia Capital said Dropbox\u2019s potential for profit was more attractive than Box\u2019s, and argued that when Dropbox eventually goes public, investors will recognize that difference.Aaron Levie, Box\u2019s chief executive, disputed this assertion. \u201cOur differentiation and maturity in the enterprise market is what wins those customers,\u201d he said. A large and costly sales team also makes a difference, Mr. Levie argued, which is why he seemed to scoff at the notion of Dropbox as a competitor. \u201cWe\u2019re mostly competing with Microsoft in the enterprise, not Dropbox,\u201d he said.Because one company is public and one is private, and because they operate so differently, it is difficult to say whether Box or Dropbox \u2014 not to mention Google or Microsoft \u2014 will ultimately run away with the enterprise cloud services business. Analysts say that at the moment, the market is big enough, and wide open enough, for all of these companies to thrive.The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox\u2019s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.An earlier version of this column misstated the fees Dropbox charges its business customers. The fees are about $150 annually for each of the business\u2019s employees, not for each business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Killed the Sheridans?", "Date": "2016-02-05", "News": "FeatureThe police say a prominent New Jersey lawyer killed himself and his wife of 47 years. Their sons refuse to believe it.Supported bySmoke billowed from a window on the second floor. Firefighters did not have to bust down the front door to get inside, because it was unlocked, as were several other entrances to the house. The dense smoke slowed them as they climbed the stairs to the second floor, but once inside the burning master bedroom, they extinguished the flames quickly. The fire had been confined to this one room, even though it was fed by an accelerant \u2014 gasoline, poured on the floor from a container that had been carried up from the garage. Two bodies lay on the floor, face up.The couple immediately threw their clothes and belongings back in their bags; when their car did not come quickly enough after Mark called for it, he went down to the garage to get it himself. They weren\u2019t out of Manhattan yet when Matt, who was getting updates from a neighbor, called again and told Mark that his parents were dead.Mark began making his own calls as he drove. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know how fast I was going, but I was flying,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018I think my first call was to Chris Porrino\u2019\u2019 \u2014 who was Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s chief counsel \u2014 \u2018\u2018and I say: \u2018Chris, my mom and dad died, and nobody\u2019s answering my questions. I understand the Somerset County prosecutor is at our house. I don\u2019t know the Somerset County prosecutor, but can you have him call me?\u2019 And Chris is a great guy, and he says, \u2018Sure,\u2019 and I\u2019m literally pulling into my parents\u2019 neighborhood when the prosecutor calls me.\u2019\u2019The prosecutor, Geoffrey Soriano, told him that the deaths were no accident. \u2018\u2018He says to me: \u2018It\u2019s not just a fire. It looks like it was set intentionally, and it looks like your parents were stabbed.\u2019 And I say, \u2018All right,\u2019 and I thank him.\u2019\u2019Mark went into \u2018\u2018lawyer mode.\u2019\u2019 He was determined to keep his emotions at bay, to ask questions, sift through information and begin to make some sense of what had just happened to his parents. He had picked up one of his younger brothers, Tim, along the way. Another brother, Dan, was already in front of the house amid what was now a crush of people: neighbors, curious onlookers, the police and news media. Matt was the one brother still absent; he lived at home with his parents but had left the day before to go fishing on Fishers Island in Long Island Sound.A detective approached Mark Sheridan as he was getting out of his car and told him that family members were not allowed in the house. It was an active crime scene. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re asking us a lot of questions, but we\u2019re not getting a lot of information,\u2019\u2019 Mark says. \u2018\u2018They say, \u2018Where\u2019s Matt?\u2019 And I tell them he\u2019s on 287, just crossing from New York into New Jersey, and it will be about an hour before he\u2019s here. And they say, \u2018O.K., when he gets here, we would like to talk to you all.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Standing with other family members in a neighbor\u2019s driveway, Mark did not have much to do but peer up at the bedroom where his parents died. Smoke was no longer visible, but he could still smell it.Later reports described the scene that emergency responders encountered in the master bedroom. John Sheridan, 72, had been found on the floor at the foot of the bed, with a partly burned armoire on top of him. Joyce, 69, was found to the left side of the bed. Matches, knives and a gas can lay nearby. Both husband and wife were dead at the scene. Joyce\u2019s autopsy, performed by an assistant state medical examiner, Eddy Lilavois, showed that she suffered first- and second-degree burns and 12 stab wounds, mostly to her scalp, forehead and hands. The one that killed her was a wound to the chest that perforated her aorta. Her death was ruled a homicide. John, according to Lilavois\u2019s autopsy, had five knife wounds to his neck and torso and a blunt-force injury that caused five broken ribs. The presumption was that the fractures came from the armoire falling on top of him. Unlike Joyce, he had soot in his mouth, nose and lungs, which indicated that he was alive when the fire started.John\u2019s cause of death was listed as \u2018\u2018pending further studies,\u2019\u2019 and the manner of death \u2018\u2018pending investigation.\u2019\u2019 Yet the Somerset County prosecutor\u2019s office was already giving strong hints that detectives were no longer searching for suspects \u2014 if, in fact, they ever had been. \u2018\u2018We are quite confident that there exists no threat to either the immediate neighborhood or to the local community,\u2019\u2019 Soriano\u2019s spokesman told reporters four days after the fire. The medical examiner had concluded that the cuts on John Sheridan were \u2018\u2018hesitation wounds,\u2019\u2019 a term of art that Mark Sheridan first heard three days after his parents died, during a tense meeting at Soriano\u2019s office in Somerville.\u2018\u2018I say: \u2018What\u2019s that? What are hesitation wounds?\u2019 And one of the prosecutors says that\u2019s what typically happens when someone tries to kill themselves and can\u2019t accomplish it. And so that\u2019s a powder keg. I\u2019m thinking to myself: What are you saying? What are you talking about? Speak up if you\u2019ve got something to say. Don\u2019t lawyer me.\u2019\u2019The detectives laid out their theory: John Sheridan had killed his wife, set fire to their bedroom and then killed himself. \u2018\u2018They told us, \u2018If this is what we think it is, we\u2019ll find the reason,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Mark Sheridan says. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018We\u2019ll go through the emails and phones and other records, and there\u2019s always something. Dad\u2019s got a girlfriend, Mom\u2019s got a boyfriend, there\u2019s financial problems, a record of violence, there\u2019s always something.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019After the initial shock wore off, Mark and his brothers were furious. A horrific crime had occurred. Two people dead with stab wounds. A fire deliberately set. Where was the urgency? Was a manhunt underway? Why had the detectives settled so quickly on such a preposterous theory of the case? Nothing could seem more unbelievable to the family than the idea that John Sheridan killed his wife and himself. The Sheridan brothers felt themselves being thrust from the role of grieving sons to that of amateur detectives.The family hired its own pathologist, Michael Baden, a consultant on numerous high-profile cases, formerly the chief medical examiner in New York City and the host of the HBO program \u2018\u2018Autopsy.\u2019\u2019 With Lilavois, the state\u2019s medical examiner, in the lab with him, Baden re-examined the bodies. The two doctors looked at the shape and depth of the wounds and considered whether they could have been caused by the two knives recovered at the scene, of which at least one, a kitchen carving knife, was used on Joyce Sheridan. The other was a serrated knife for slicing bread, with a rounded end. It would not have been an ideal weapon, and it wasn\u2019t clear if it caused any of Joyce\u2019s wounds. Most significant, Baden and Lilavois agreed that a third knife caused John Sheridan\u2019s wounds, but investigators had not recovered it. How, in a murder-suicide, could a weapon be missing?When the Sheridan brothers were allowed to enter the house midweek, after detectives were done taking evidence from the location, they came upon a piece of metal on the bedroom floor. It had melted, then resolidified. It could have been a piece of the armoire or some other metal item in the bedroom. Or it could have been a knife. The recovered knives, however, were kitchen knives, made of metal alloys that burn at only very high temperatures \u2014 the kind of intense heat that quickly engulfs an entire room, if not a house. Only part of the bedroom was burned.John Sheridan\u2019s body was found near the melted metal. He still wore his cotton undershirt; it was charred but not burned. A month later, an insurance adjuster discovered a fire poker in the adjoining bathroom, even though there was no fireplace upstairs. Could that, rather than the tumbling armoire, have been the cause of John Sheridan\u2019s broken ribs?The family was angry. Why hadn\u2019t these items been recovered by detectives? Mark Sheridan described his reaction to the melted metal: \u2018\u2018I pick it up and I fling it across the room. Danny comes in and throws it across the room the other way.\u2019\u2019 A week after the deaths, he wrote the prosecutor an email, which was not composed with his usual lawyerly detachment. In the midst of enumerating what he perceived as a string of investigative shortcomings, he wrote, \u2018\u2018I am on the verge of losing my mind.\u2019\u2019Sheridan took naturally to the role of wise man and mentor. \u2018\u2018To the day he died, if I had a problem, I\u2019d go see John and talk about it,\u2019\u2019 his brother Peter says. \u2018\u2018How do we deal with it? What should I do?\u2019\u2019 John advised him on how to get into law school; years later, he steered the political process that led to his brother\u2019s appointment to the federal bench by President George W. Bush.In 2005, John Sheridan moved into management at Cooper Hospital in Camden. The position was a departure from previous jobs, but his dexterity in the overlapping spaces of government and commerce proved to be no less useful. Cooper had ambitious plans but needed regulatory approvals and public financing. In partnership with the hospital\u2019s chairman, George Norcross III, who is often described as the Democratic boss of South Jersey, Sheridan helped build Cooper into a health care powerhouse. During Sheridan\u2019s tenure, the hospital opened a medical school and teamed up with the MD Anderson Cancer Center to build a $100 million treatment center. \u2018\u2018In my next lifetime,\u2019\u2019 Norcross says, extolling Sheridan\u2019s uncommon serenity amid the hurly-burly of high-stakes business dealing, \u2018\u2018I would want John Sheridan\u2019s personality.\u2019\u2019Joyce Sheridan was feistier than her husband, whom she met when he was tending bar in West Orange to pay his law-school tuition at Rutgers. Once, when Governor Whitman called the house looking for John, Joyce held the phone out just a few inches from her face and said to her husband, \u2018\u2018I thought I told you to tell her to stop calling at dinnertime.\u2019\u2019 Joyce had been a high-school social-studies teacher. She volunteered for the classes with the most-challenged students, those who struggled academically or had trouble in their backgrounds.On Sept. 25, 2014, a Thursday, three days before the fire, John Sheridan spent a rare workday afternoon at home. A neighbor, Marsha Stencel, walked by with her granddaughter and saw both Sheridans outside, decorating the home for Halloween. Joyce made the kind of fuss over Halloween that some people do for Christmas. She invited Stencel and her granddaughter inside and showed them displays set out on tables: lit-up houses, ghoulish figurines. A set of antique papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 pumpkins sat atop the mantelpiece.The Sheridans were neighborly, but they weren\u2019t an especially social couple. They spent almost all their free time together, either with their sons and grandchildren or buying antiques for their New Jersey home and for the Federal-period house near Cooperstown, N.Y., that they had painstakingly restored. Some years back, John delighted his wife with a gift that he fetched for the Cooperstown property on a drive up to New Hampshire: a double-seated outhouse from the 1800s. He had a hole dug and set it up in the backyard, because he didn\u2019t consider it authentic unless it could be used.\u2018\u2018Joyce ran the place,\u2019\u2019 says Stencel, who was their neighbor and friend for almost four decades. \u2018\u2018She was in charge. They had someone cut the grass, do repairs. I don\u2019t know if John would have known the right end of a screwdriver to use. That wasn\u2019t him. He worked, and he worked a lot. But he did what good husbands do. When Joyce needed him, he was there.\u2019\u2019Stencel had no sense that day that anything was amiss. \u2018\u2018They were joking around with each other,\u2019\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2018They were normal, just John and Joyce.\u2019\u2019The next day, a nephew of the Sheridans who had a lawn-care business came by to work on the yard and gently chastised Joyce when he saw her carrying grocery bags in from the car. Near the end of her teaching days, she took a serious fall at school that precipitated a cascade of orthopedic problems and over the last 15 years underwent more operations than her family could count \u2014 on her back, shoulders and neck. She rarely complained, but she took a mix of painkillers. John was back at work at Cooper Hospital. He met with Gary Lesneski, the hospital\u2019s general counsel, about a pending negative report on Cooper\u2019s cardiac unit, a matter that was said to be troubling him. But, Lesneski says, \u2018\u2018It was business as usual when I left his office that Friday.\u2019\u2019John Sheridan bought a couple of new dress shirts earlier in the week. He picked up his dry cleaning. He had a meeting scheduled at Cooper on Sunday afternoon. On Saturday evening at 6:36, less than 12 hours before the fire, he sent an email from his iPhone in response to a question from Norcross about whether Cooper was eligible for some post-Hurricane Sandy disaster-preparation grants. His answer went on for a couple of hundred words. It still reads like a cogent and clearheaded piece of writing.The report did not speculate about the couple\u2019s last hours. About whether, for instance, they had gone to sleep that night, and John at some point crept out of the bedroom to gather the knives and other materials, or if he instead hid the knives in advance. Or if, perhaps, there had been some kind of all-night row that culminated in blood and fire. In writing about the knife wounds on each of the Sheridans, Soriano emphasized the contrasts in their location and severity. Joyce had cuts on her hands, which were considered defensive in nature; John had no hand wounds. Referring to John, he wrote: \u2018\u2018All five wounds have been characterized by the assistant medical examiner as superficial in nature, consistent with self-infliction. However, one wound to the neck caused a small perforation to the right jugular vein and would be fatal without medical treatment.\u2019\u2019 Two causes of death were given for John Sheridan: \u2018\u2018sharp force\u2019\u2019 injury \u2014 the cut to the jugular \u2014 and smoke inhalation.The toxicology reports revealed no surprises. Joyce had a mix of prescription painkillers in her system \u2014 \u2018\u2018Mom was on enough meds to kill a small farm animal,\u2019\u2019 Mark Sheridan says \u2014 and John tested positive for what were described as cardiac drugs. DNA evidence was not conclusive. The report said samples collected from the knives were \u2018\u2018consistent with that of John Sheridan\u2019\u2019 or could not \u2018\u2018exclude\u2019\u2019 him as a suspect. But the actual lab reports indicated the swabs did not yield a usable sample and revealed not much more than that they probably came from a white male.No motives were put forward. Detectives looked at the couple\u2019s cellphones and computers and conducted what they said were more than 180 interviews with family members, neighbors, friends and co-workers. They did not uncover any of the usual explanations, the ones that they told the sons would probably turn up: girlfriend, boyfriend, terminal disease, mental illness, financial woes. The best they came up with was that John was unusually agitated at work, over the pending state report regarding fatality rates after cardiac operations at Cooper. \u2018\u2018With regard to work-related issues, family members and colleagues characterized John Sheridan as \u2018disproportionately concerned,\u2019 \u2018genuinely worried\u2019 and \u2018overly worried,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Soriano wrote.The report did not name the people who provided this information, nor did it say what John Sheridan had said or done specifically to leave an impression that he was not himself. Soriano concluded his report with several bullet points, which amounted to a sort of connect-the-dots finding of murder-suicide. Several related to the absences of things: no evidence of forcible entry to the home; no indication anything was stolen (six folds of cash totaling $950 were found on a night stand); no one having noticed any suspects departing the house or neighborhood.By the time the report was issued, the Sheridans knew what would be in it. This did not lessen the sting. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the goodness in people\u2019s lives that you hang on to,\u2019\u2019 Peter Sheridan, the federal judge, told me. \u2018\u2018The prosecutor\u2019s conclusion destroyed their legacy and the good that John and Joyce had done in their lives.\u2019\u2019Not that it helped the Sheridan family. After Soriano\u2019s report came out \u2014 and Mark Sheridan attacked it in local newspapers \u2014 Raymond Bateman seemed to support his son\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by writing a column in The Home News Tribune, a Middlesex County daily, that made the assumption that John Sheridan was mentally ill. It went on to compare him with the German airline pilot who deliberately crashed a commercial airliner into the Alps, killing everyone onboard. \u2018\u2018As I write with tears about my friend, John, and, yes, as I, in horror, think about the innocent lives lost in the airplane crash,\u2019\u2019 Bateman wrote, \u2018\u2018I recognize that mental depression must just completely overwhelm a person\u2019s normal judgment.\u2019\u2019Mark Sheridan didn\u2019t see anything that had impinged on his father\u2019s state of mind or warped his judgment. The way it looked to him, an unimaginable family tragedy was now being compounded by official incompetence and rank stupidity. His interactions with the detectives left him exasperated. He would lay out his lawyerly arguments and try to convince them that they had put their facts together illogically or had not even gathered all the pertinent facts, but they were unmoved. He considered himself to be dealing with \u2018\u2018misfits.\u2019\u2019Joyce Sheridan\u2019s brother, Peter Mitchko, had urged Mark to publicly take on the prosecutor sooner, go after him in the newspapers rather than continue to lobby him privately while waiting for the final report. \u2018\u2018The boys were fighting for their dad\u2019s reputation,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018My issue is: Who killed my sister?\u2019\u2019Could it have been his brother-in-law?\u2018\u2018No, it\u2019s not conceivable. Anyone who knew John and Joyce doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s conceivable. And the complicated way they said he committed suicide? You stab yourself? Burn a building? The only thing he didn\u2019t do is eat poison. He doesn\u2019t leave a note. Nothing makes sense.\u2019\u2019Last spring, less than three weeks after Soriano released his report, Mark Sheridan filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and his brothers. It sought to have their father\u2019s manner of death changed from suicide back to undetermined, which would have the effect of reopening the question of who killed their parents. A three-judge panel instructed the family to instead pursue the case with the state medical examiner\u2019s office, and in December, the Sheridans sent Baden\u2019s written report to the medical examiner and formally requested a change in the manner of death. The matter could yet end up back in court.The state\u2019s answer to the initial lawsuit did not address the merits of the investigation; it just argued that the family had no standing to mount a challenge. \u2018\u2018The court should dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction because no legal basis exists to compel a medical examiner to change his opinion about manner of death,\u2019\u2019 states the response, which was filed by the attorney general\u2019s office.Matt left for his fishing trip the day before the fire. He favored an extreme form of the sport in which participants wear wet suits, swim several hundred yards from shore and cast for striped bass from rock formations, sometimes at night when the bass are thought to be most interested in feeding. He said goodbye to his mother on the way out and gave her a kiss. The last thing he remembers her saying to him was, \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u2019\u2019 When he got back to Meadow Run Drive, after the deaths, the police searched his car. According to court documents, they found a small amount of cocaine, a digital scale and plastic bags coated with white powder. In one twist the Sheridan case would take, he was arrested that day. He has not been charged, and no trial date has been set.On one of the occasions I met with Mark at his Newark office, Matt joined us, wearing a sport jacket and tie. \u2018\u2018He\u2019d get mad if I wasn\u2019t dressed correctly,\u2019\u2019 he said, referring to his brother. The twins have a similar manner: direct but wisecracking, with an inclination toward dark humor. They still talk about their parents in the joking way that adult children often do. Matt said he was usually in close touch with both his parents during the day and often responded to what his mother would call \u2018\u2018emergencies.\u2019\u2019 I asked what kind of emergencies, and both brothers laughed. \u2018\u2018Everything was an emergency with Mom,\u2019\u2019 Matt said. \u2018\u2018She\u2019d call me up and say: \u2018I\u2019ve got an emergency. Can you get some Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups on the way home?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Matt said his father had indeed been troubled by the negative report about Cooper\u2019s cardiac unit, but he did not consider those work issues to be even remotely plausible as an explanation. (Nor did anyone else I talked to who knew John Sheridan.) Had they considered the possibility that their mother initiated some kind of episode that ended in the two deaths, because by all accounts, she was the more hot-tempered of the two? \u2018\u2018We did,\u2019\u2019 Matt said. \u2018\u2018We\u2019ve had to have some miserable conversations among ourselves about the different possibilities, but we\u2019ve had them.\u2019\u2019 They concluded it wasn\u2019t possible. Because of her injured shoulders, Joyce, at 5-foot-2, could not have raised the knife high enough to cause the wounds on her husband\u2019s chest and neck. And they didn\u2019t think she could have created much force even if she had.Soriano\u2019s report does not speculate on whether the murder-suicide was planned or a result of some sudden rage. The presence of the gas can, which came from the garage and was used to fuel a generator that powers a basement sump pump, would suggest planning, as would the knives carried up from the kitchen. But nothing else \u2014 neither forensic evidence nor interviews \u2014 suggests that John Sheridan was planning anything other than continuing to work.\u2018\u2018So he went into a rage and got a gas can?\u2019\u2019 Mark said. \u2018\u2018And then he did a few wounds and stopped being in a rage? Rage killings don\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s not one and done.\u2019\u2019Matt added: \u2018\u2018He switched knives? Why did he do that?\u2019\u2019They went back and forth like this for a few minutes. I felt as if I were listening in on a conversation they had been having for months. Where was the other knife? If the fire was hot enough to melt a knife, why didn\u2019t their father\u2019s shirt burn? Why didn\u2019t the whole bedroom or even the whole house go up in flames? Matt sighed and said, \u2018\u2018We\u2019re not detectives, but we\u2019re not idiots.\u2019\u2019In their telling, the whole Sheridan universe holds together. Their parents were civic pillars. Collectors of antiques. Their marriage made it through the inevitable bumps and endured for nearly a half-century. The prosecutor turned up not even a shred of a motive for John Sheridan. All four brothers were where they said they were \u2014 their cellphones had been examined; they were nowhere near Meadow Run Drive \u2014 and none were under suspicion.What about Matt, with his supposed possession of cocaine, and the scale and plastic bags? In the absence of alternative theories as to who killed the Sheridans, his arrest and whatever involvement he did or did not have with drugs has been a source of speculation and rumor. On the advice of his criminal lawyer, Matt would not talk about the drug arrest or anything related to it, so it was up to his brother to address it. I asked Mark Sheridan if he was upset when his brother was arrested on drug charges a few hours after his parents\u2019 deaths. \u2018\u2018Yeah, I was pissed,\u2019\u2019 he said. His tone of voice indicated he might still be.Had they considered that their parents were murdered by someone looking for Matt? \u2018\u2018Yeah, absolutely we\u2019ve talked about it,\u2019\u2019 Mark said. \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t believe it. First of all, Matt\u2019s car wasn\u2019t there. Matt wasn\u2019t there on weekends, or hardly ever. So I don\u2019t believe it, and nobody\u2019s going to convince me otherwise.\u2019\u2019The family, however, strongly believes that the police never seriously considered any other suspects \u2014 that they zeroed in on John Sheridan and then spent months trying to prove their initial hunch. In light of that, how could the family eliminate any theory? \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 Mark Sheridan said. \u2018\u2018Anything\u2019s possible.\u2019\u2019Sheridan had just arrived at his office after an hour-plus commute from his home in Tewksbury. We sat in a conference room across from a big window overlooking Newark\u2019s Penn Station. He has his father\u2019s facial features but not his conciliatory, bring-everyone-onboard personality. \u2018\u2018My dad was the cool hand,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m the drop-the-gloves guy.\u2019\u2019 Sheridan is a litigator who defends insurance companies against large claims. He has been referred to as an \u2018\u2018attack dog\u2019\u2019 in his role as lawyer for the state Republicans. He does not object to the portrait. He characterized the numerous lawsuits he filed against New Jersey governors when his party was out of power as \u2018\u2018torturing one Democratic administration after another.\u2019\u2019 His side gig was rich in entertainment value, a front-row seat to the theater of New Jersey politics. \u2018\u2018You\u2019ve got two choices,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You either take it all seriously, or you laugh at it.\u2019\u2019He put a paper coffee cup down in front of him when we started talking but never touched it. We happened to be meeting on the same day that David Wildstein, a former Port Authority executive and Christie ally, was in court to plead guilty on charges connected to the politically motivated lane closures on the George Washington Bridge. Two others were criminally charged at the same time. After his parents\u2019 deaths, Sheridan stepped down from his role as counsel to the state Republicans, but he continued to represent the party\u2019s interests in the scandal and is defending Christie\u2019s 2013 gubernatorial campaign committee in a civil suit brought by people who were stuck in traffic on the bridge. He checked his cellphone just twice. He returned one call, to his wife, over the course of four hours. He is consumed with restoring his family\u2019s reputation. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to allow them to tarnish my father and my mother and their legacy based on this half-assed investigation,\u2019\u2019 he said.The state\u2019s theory makes no sense to Mark. His father lived an orderly life, and yet his supposed crime was inefficient and sloppy. He set a fire, a common tactic only when a perpetrator intends to flee and not be tied to a crime. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve said to the prosecutor, \u2018It\u2019s bad enough you\u2019re calling my father a murderer, but you\u2019re also calling him a moron, as though he weren\u2019t smart enough to work this out,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Mark said. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018You\u2019re telling me this was planned, but he\u2019s better than that.\u2019 This would be the worst plan he ever came up with.\u2019\u2019Various experts have looked at the evidence in the case and found it unconvincing. Lawrence Kobilinksy, chairman of the department of sciences at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, noted, in particular, the missing weapon \u2014 \u2018\u2018that\u2019s huge,\u2019\u2019 he said \u2014 as well as the lack of a motive, the unpersuasive DNA findings and an arson that \u2018\u2018makes no sense\u2019\u2019 in the context of a murder-suicide. The case, he told me, should be reopened.Mark acknowledges that at times he may sound detached from the horror of what happened to his parents. It is a coping mechanism, a way to avoid being emotionally wrecked. He spent his entire childhood inside the house where his parents died. He told me, almost offhandedly, that he and his brothers had been planning to have the structure \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2019dozed\u2019\u2019 \u2014 bulldozed \u2014 so they could sell the vacant lot. But they have delayed doing so. There are still bloodstains everywhere: a bloody fingerprint outside the door of the master bedroom, stains on the walls downstairs. Was it all really tested by investigators? Might it reveal the identity of the killer? These are the kinds of questions he contemplates. Knock down the house and have the rubble trucked to a landfill, or preserve it for the forensic value of the blood on its walls?The family is now waiting to see if the medical examiner\u2019s office will change John Sheridan\u2019s cause of death. \u2018\u2018This is my shot at the prosecutor,\u2019\u2019 Mark said at one point in our conversation, referring to one of his recent court filings. \u2018\u2018My shot at the medical examiner is going to come next.\u2019\u2019 I asked him about Christie, who oversees the state\u2019s medical-examiner system and who appointed the acting state attorney general, John Jay Hoffman, whose office was opposing the appeal of the manner-of-death finding. Isn\u2019t there some way for Christie to help him? \u2018\u2018I am trying my best not to take shots at the governor,\u2019\u2019 he said.Sheridan understands why people are intrigued by the mystery of what happened to his parents: \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve said to my brothers, if we weren\u2019t living this nightmare, it would be an interesting thing we\u2019d be following.\u2019\u2019 He knows some will find it odd that his privileged and politically connected family feels badly served by law enforcement. \u2018\u2018I get it,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I totally get it. I know it sounds offensive, but how do you deal with it if you\u2019re not this family? If you don\u2019t have the education, the knowledge, the connections, the financial wherewithal to fight the fight? I\u2019ve got access. I\u2019m sitting at the police station on the day my parents died, and the governor is calling to offer condolences. Not many people get those calls, right? And at the same time, you\u2019re just getting screwed over, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u2019\u2019Sometimes, at night, he dwells on an alternative explanation for his parents\u2019 deaths. The backyards in the Sheridans\u2019 neighborhood in Skillman are heavily wooded, and few of them are fenced. Anybody could have crept through the night, walked into the house and killed John and Joyce Sheridan. An almost prosaic explanation. Some crazed stranger did it, a person so unhinged he didn\u2019t even bother taking the wads of cash in full view. Awful, but comprehensible.Michael Sokolove is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u2018\u2018Drama High,\u2019\u2019 about a drama teacher who transformed a school.Advertisement"}

And if we catch on fire, we have a long-distance shot at first.\u201dThe importance of doing well here is more than just a matter of changing the narrative for a campaign that needs something that looks like a win, even if that is only third place, behind Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Increasingly, with expectations for success growing, Mr. Rubio\u2019s ticket out of South Carolina is looking like second place.Mr. Rubio sees a second chance to sew up the support he expected to break his way when he was riding high into New Hampshire. But that all came crashing down.After the debate, \u201cthose calls stopped,\u201d said one supporter with deep ties to the campaign. \u201cTotally frozen,\u201d said another.Mr. Rubio\u2019s campaign manager, Terry Sullivan, explained in a conference call with donors last week that he and his staff had badly miscalculated by advising their candidate there was little to be gained from a confrontation with Mr. Christie. And the fallout was more damaging than they could have anticipated: the worst news coverage, Mr. Sullivan joked, since O. J. Simpson made his getaway in a white Ford Bronco.The voters he needs to persuade are almost exactly the same groups he targeted in Iowa: higher-income, well-educated, younger and living in suburban and exurban areas. And his campaign has surveyed and targeted them extensively.A look at the latest results for Iowa and New Hampshire, and how this year compares to previous election seasons.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a Suburban and a sticker on it saying what cheer camp your kid went to,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said, \u201cyou are a Marco Rubio voter.\u201dAs in Iowa, many potential Rubio voters are evangelical or born-again Christians who are drawn to Mr. Rubio\u2019s religiousness, but who might be leaning toward Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz.Even the background noise is the same: Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz are tearing each other apart again. And as they trade accusations over who is the more trustworthy and authentic conservative \u2014 a fight Mr. Rubio\u2019s advisers believe is seriously damaging to both, especially among undecided women \u2014 Mr. Rubio believes he can emerge largely unscathed.\u201cWhen you see what happens in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Scott said, \u201cit will carry momentum into Nevada, and then into Super Tuesday.\u201dHis renewed confidence seems to be loosening Mr. Rubio up as he speaks to his crowds here, unlike in his final days in New Hampshire when he looked rattled and sounded exhausted. He wears a big smile. People who come to see him are grabbing yard signs and literature.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.He has started to improvise his remarks more frequently.As he spoke in North Myrtle Beach on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio tried a new, slightly more humorous explanation of what it means to live paycheck to paycheck: \u201cIt\u2019s when you write a check on Wednesday but you know you\u2019re not going to get paid until Friday, so you date it Saturday,\u201d he said, insisting with a knowing smile that he had never done anything of the sort when he was younger.Turning a joke about his caffeine dependency into a dig at Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio recited the old Red Bull slogan, \u201cGives You Wings,\u201d saying, \u201cWhen I\u2019m president, everyone will have wings. Everyone. And Mexico is going to pay for them!\u201dAnd as he introduced his older brother to the crowd, he laughed off their two-decade age difference. \u201cSame dad,\u201d Mr. Rubio cracked, then told a story of how when his mother was in labor with him, and his brother accompanied her to the hospital, the staff asked him to sign the birth certificate, thinking he was the father.The campaign\u2019s biggest priority is undecided voters, who polls suggest make up perhaps a third of the Republican electorate. A plurality of voters who made their minds up at the last minute in Iowa broke for Mr. Rubio, accounting for his unexpectedly strong finish there.After he spoke to a crowd of several hundred outside Charleston on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio seemed to be making some progress.\u201cWell, it was going to be Trump. But now I\u2019m leaning towards Marco,\u201d said Daniel Lewis, 24, a hospice administrator from Charleston, who almost perfectly matched the profile of the voters Mr. Rubio is trying to reach here: young, professional and from a densely populated area.Mr. Lewis said he was drawn to Mr. Rubio\u2019s uplifting message and to his desire to make the American dream more attainable.Illustrating how fluid the campaign remains, however \u2014 and how easily high expectations can be dashed \u2014 Mr. Lewis said he was not totally sold just yet: \u201cRubio, I still don\u2019t know if he has what it takes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Bond Yield Slides Below Zero and Stocks Fall", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byTOKYO \u2014 Given Japan\u2019s outsize public debt, holding an i.o.u. from its government might seem like a risky proposition that would require the promise of a substantial reward.But this week, as global economic fears drove money into safer assets, investors in Japanese debt began essentially performing that service for free.On Tuesday, the yield on Japanese 10-year bonds, the benchmark of government borrowing, dropped to zero for the first time. They quickly fell into negative territory, meaning some investors were buying bonds despite knowing that if they held them until maturity, they would come away with less money than they paid.And on top of that, a strong yen dragged Japanese stocks down more than 5 percent in the worst trading day this year. The market opened lower again on Wednesday.The move was intended to bolster the Japanese economy, but the flight by global investors to perceived safe assets is complicating the effort.Like savers depositing money at a local bank, banks keep their own unused cash at the central bank. The interest they earn on those reserves \u2014 or do not earn, as the case may be \u2014 helps determine the cost of other kinds of borrowing and lending.The Bank of Japan\u2019s new policy is intended to stimulate the economy, which narrowly avoided falling into recession last quarter. By making it unprofitable for banks to hold cash, Mr. Kuroda hopes to encourage them to lend more freely and get businesses and households to spend. He also wants to give a lift to consumer prices, which have been sagging after a welcome but short-lived bout of inflation.In other countries that have introduced negative interest rates, like Sweden and Switzerland, government bond yields have also been pushed below zero.Masamichi Adachi, a former central bank official who is now an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said that the reversal in bond yields was bound to happen eventually, given the negative interest rate policy, but it occurred more quickly than many expected. The imposition of negative rates on bank reserves will not even take effect until next week.The speed, he said, was because of a factor that is complicating Mr. Kuroda\u2019s stimulus program: a rush by global investors to buy the yen, which is seen as a safe currency at a time of economic uncertainty. The resulting rise in the yen\u2019s exchange rate has hurt the Japanese stock market and darkened the outlook for inflation, canceling out much of the efforts of the Bank of Japan, or B.O.J.\u201cThe China slowdown, falling oil prices, fears about a U.S. recession \u2014 the headwinds facing the B.O.J. are very strong,\u201d Mr. Adachi said.One goal of negative interest rates is to redirect investors\u2019 money from bonds into more theoretically productive assets like property and stocks. But in at least one sector, finance, the policy has deepened the equities rout. Banks are reluctant to pass the costs of negative rates on to depositors, for fear they will pull their money out of their accounts en masse. Instead, the banks are absorbing the penalties themselves, cutting into profits.This week the yen has strengthened to a little over 114 to the dollar, about 10 percent stronger than its most recent low. That is bad news for the many Japanese companies that earn revenues outside Japan: the stronger the yen, the less their foreign-currency earnings contribute to profits.The Nikkei 225-stock average dropped 5.4 percent Tuesday, its biggest one-day drop since May 2013, as investors reacted to the potential blow to corporate earnings. It was down a further 0.7 percent in early trading Wednesday morning.Easy money from the central bank had kept the yen relatively weak since 2013, but a reversal appears to be gathering pace despite the central bank\u2019s latest move.Japan\u2019s status as a haven for investors can seem puzzling. It is carrying the heaviest government debt load in the world, at the equivalent of about two and a half years\u2019 economic output. But most experts are sanguine about the risks. The debt is still amply funded by local savings. And taking the private sector into account, Japan as a whole is a major net creditor, not a borrower. That greatly reduces the risk of instability.For now, the bigger danger appears to be that efforts to get its economy growing again will stall. Stimulus by the Bank of Japan has played an outsize role in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic policy, known as Abenomics. One concern for government and central bank officials is that companies will resist demands to increase workers\u2019 pay as the stronger yen eats into profits. That would block what the bank and many economists see as a crucial means of promoting spending and inflation.\u201cCorporate management now has many excuses for not raising wages,\u201d Mr. Adachi said. He added that the Bank of Japan would likely impose even steeper negative rates, something Mr. Kuroda hinted was possible in a policy speech last week.\u201cOne purpose of the B.O.J.\u2019s move was to dispel the idea that it lacks ammunition,\u201d he said. \u201cKuroda will continue to try and surprise the market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robin Chandler Duke, Philanthropist Who Championed Women\u2019s Rights, Dies at 92", "Date": "2016-02-07", "News": "Supported byRobin Chandler Duke, a rags-to-riches grande dame who married an ambassador and became one of America\u2019s best known advocates for women by championing reproductive rights and international family planning, died in Charleston, S.C., on Saturday. She was 92.Her daughter, Letitia Lynn, confirmed the death, at Bishop Gadsden, a retirement community. Ms. Duke for many years had homes in New York and the Hamptons, on Long Island.Ms. Duke\u2019s life was full of storybook improbabilities: a lawyer\u2019s daughter left destitute, a teenage model who lied about her age, a reporter, the wife of a fading actor, a single mother of two who succeeded as a television newscaster, a stockbroker and a public relations executive when women in those roles were rare.At age 39, she became the fourth wife of Angier Biddle Duke, the scion of two American dynasties. He was President John F. Kennedy\u2019s chief of protocol, had already served as ambassador to El Salvador and would later become President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s chief of protocol and the ambassador to Denmark, Spain and Morocco.With the wealth, prestige and connections of her second husband, Ms. Duke led the glamorous life of an ambassador\u2019s wife for two decades, accompanying him to White House dinners and on assignments in Copenhagen, Madrid, and Rabat, Morocco, entertaining world leaders and royalty abroad and the cr\u00e8me of society at the Duke homes in Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y.But starting in the 1970s when she was in her 50s, Ms. Duke also independently embraced social and political causes, and for much of the remainder of her life she promoted and led organizations supporting abortion rights and legal equality for women, the stabilization of rising global populations and health and education programs in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.She was the national co-chairwoman of the Population Crisis Committee/Draper Fund, which financed International Planned Parenthood; the president and, later, the chairwoman of the National Abortion Rights Action League; the president of its successor, Naral Pro-Choice America; a founder of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities; and the chairwoman of Population Action International.In 1980, President Jimmy Carter asked her to lead America\u2019s delegation to the 21st United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization conference in Belgrade, Serbia, a five-week gathering of 2,000 delegates from 154 countries focusing on the clashing public policies of developed nations, third-world countries, the Soviet bloc and Western democracies. She was accorded ambassadorial rank.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t Mrs. Angier Biddle Duke,\u201d her husband said. \u201cShe was the Honorable Robin Chandler Duke.\u201dMs. Duke was a co-founder of the United States-Japan Foundation and was a director of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the World Childhood Foundation and the Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation. She was also a trustee of the Institute of International Education and an overseer of the International Rescue Committee.In 2000, she became a full-fledged ambassador herself. President Bill Clinton named her his envoy to Norway, and she served in Oslo in the final year of his administration.She was born Grace Esther Tippett in Baltimore on Oct. 13, 1923, one of two daughters of Richard Edgar and Esther Chandler Tippett. Her parents called her Robin, and she used the nickname all her life. Her father left his law firm when she was 15, and the family fortunes went into a tailspin. Robin had to drop out of a private school for girls. Her parents split up.Her mother moved with the children to New York, rented a room and found work as a tearoom cashier. Robin\u2019s older sister, Peggy, became a photographer\u2019s model, and at 16, Robin lied about her age and got a job modeling dresses for the clientele at Lord & Taylor. She was found out and fired, but managed to get other modeling jobs, including one at the New York World\u2019s Fair in 1939, to help sustain the family.She also made contacts with editors at The New York Journal-American and in 1944 got a job as a writer for the women\u2019s page. She used the byline Robin Chandler and covered society news, fashion and the occasional murder.As Mr. Lynn\u2019s film career dwindled, it largely fell to Robin to support the family. With her background in journalism, she got a job at WCAU-TV, the CBS affiliate in Philadelphia, reading the evening news. The Lynn marriage came apart in the early 1950s, although the couple did not divorce until 1958.Robin\u2019s struggle as a single mother echoed her mother\u2019s experience. In 1952, she joined NBC\u2019s new \u201cToday\u201d show, with Dave Garroway, as an anchor-reporter. She covered the national political conventions and Jacqueline Bouvier\u2019s 1953 marriage to Senator John F. Kennedy. From 1953 to 1958, she was a broker at Orvis Brothers, and then, for four years, she was vice president for public relations at Pepsi-Cola.In 1962, she married Mr. Duke. His father, Angier Buchanan Duke, was heir to part of the American Tobacco Company fortune, most of which went to his cousin, Doris Duke. Mr. Duke\u2019s mother was Cordelia Drexel Biddle, a Philadelphia socialite and writer. Mr. Duke had been President Harry S. Truman\u2019s ambassador to El Salvador, and in 1963 he handled protocol for world leaders at President Kennedy\u2019s funeral.Ms. Duke\u2019s husband retired from diplomatic service in 1981. He died in Southampton in 1995 after being hit by a car while rollerblading.Besides her work for women\u2019s rights, family planning and health and education programs, Ms. Duke was on the boards of the Guggenheim Museum, American Home Products, Rockwell International, the Emigrant Savings Bank, International Flavors and Fragrances and other organizations.She raised money and campaigned for presidential, congressional, state and local candidates, mostly Democrats, and was on a first-name basis with leaders in government, business and the arts.She received many awards and was often in the news, even in her 80s, attending fund-raisers for her causes.Besides her daughter Letitia, Ms. Duke is survived by two other children, Jeffrey Lynn and Biddle Duke; two stepchildren, Marilu Duke Cluett and Dario Duke; and four grandchildren.In an interview with New York magazine in 2005, Ms. Duke said her favorite job was working for The Journal-American when Fiorello H. La Guardia was mayor.She said: \u201cWhat a delight he was! Bloomberg has some of the same personality, you know. But I really loved La Guardia. I was one of the lone women wandering around, and I guess if you\u2019re a young, pretty blond girl, that helps, but he was so nice to me.\u201dAn obituary on Monday about the socialite and women\u2019s rights advocate Robin Chandler Duke referred incorrectly to WCAU, the Philadelphia television station where she once worked. Although it is now an NBC station, it was a CBS affiliate at the time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Capitalism More Appealing", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byPolitical EconomyCapitalism is under attack. Witness the popularity of Bernie Sanders, the socialist running neck and neck in the opinion polls with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa on Monday. To rehabilitate the system of free enterprise, it needs to be buttressed by a modern conception of fairness.Viewed from Mars, capitalism has been a huge success. Free enterprise has generated wealth and removed hundreds of millions of people from poverty. But viewed from Earth, what often stands out is how many have been left behind by the march of globalization and technology, while others have gotten ahead by methods more foul than fair.The classic left-wing response to the perceived unfairness of capitalism has been to tax and spend. That doesn\u2019t work well. High taxes can sap entrepreneurial spirit, while high welfare spending can leave poorer people dependent on handouts.Just because that response has been tried and failed doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be tried again. The success of left-wing populists like the Syriza party in Greece and the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party in Britain shows that such ideas still have appeal.This makes it important for centrists \u2014 whether they consider themselves left-wing progressives, radical centrists or liberal conservatives \u2014 to articulate a credible middle road. It should be based less on the view that fairness is the same as equality and more on the idea that people should get a fair crack at a good standard of life.There are two main aspects. First, it is important to tackle the foul methods by which people and companies get ahead and that make it tougher for hard-working, honest people to make progress.One example of this is evading or avoiding tax. This is rife in some countries, like Greece. But it is a global problem that makes people furious everywhere. Witness the anger in January in Britain over how Google, the Internet giant, was seemingly able to run rings around the authorities and pay what looks like a tiny amount of tax.Corruption, which is again widespread across the world, also creates indignation. Sweetheart deals between politicians and business line the pockets of the few to the detriment of the many.Another justified target of ire is the existence of markets that favor insiders at the expense of the general public. Finance is at the top of the list. The global financial crisis exposed how many bankers had a one-way bet: During the good times, they raked it in; during the bad, the state picked up the pieces. This was a mockery of how capitalism is supposed to work.Monopolies and vested interests are yet another source of resentment. Sometimes, the culprits are the oligarchs who pull the strings in government to get the rules written in their favor by giving bribes to politicians or senior officials.But often the beneficiaries of vested interests are not particularly rich or powerful as individuals. Greece is one of the best examples of this phenomenon. Over decades, it perfected the art of doling out special privileges to such an array of groups \u2014 farmers, notaries, pharmacists, civil servants, teachers and ordinary retirees as well as shipping magnates \u2014 that its economy gummed up.Such practices sap entrepreneurial spirit, but they do so by locking people out of opportunity rather than by using the methods of old-fashioned socialism. They also inflict bigger taxes on honest citizens and higher prices on consumers.A modern conception of fairness would put an assault of foul methods at its heart. But it would do more than that.Although successful societies need welfare states, most of Europe\u2019s welfare states need refocusing. Part of the problem is that too much government spending is directed to what Europeans call the middle class rather than the needy.The situation varies from country to country, but the main goodies are generous state pensions for middle-to-high earners and tax breaks that benefit relatively well-off people. To be fair, some countries are reining these in. For example, Britain no longer offers such attractive incentives for rich people to save for their retirement. But in many countries, there is a lot that could be done.The money saved from funding this middle-class welfare state could be redeployed where it is needed. The priority would often be to invest in schools, so children get a fair start in life, and in adult education, so that older people whose skills become obsolete as a result of technology can retrain.Such a conception of fairness is not really new. It has a lot in common with classic liberalism. Nor is it dead. Successful politicians around the world \u2014 like Narendra Modi of India with his fight against corruption or Matteo Renzi of Italy with his willingness to confront some vested interests \u2014 are deploying some strategies from this playbook.It is a rich source of ideas with which to tackle the unfairness of capitalism without falling for the inefficiency of socialism.Hugo Dixon writes a biweekly column for Reuters Breakingviews.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Might Not Keep Paying for His Campaign Himself, Chris Christie Suggests", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey told his finance team late Friday that he anticipates that Donald J. Trump, who often boasts that he is funding his own campaign, will begin to solicit campaign contributions as the race heads into a general election if Mr. Trump becomes the nominee.In a conference call hours after Mr. Christie endorsed Mr. Trump, his onetime rival, the governor was asked about what could be done to help Mr. Trump, who says he is a billionaire many times over.Mr. Christie replied that Mr. Trump, who has won three of the four first nominating contests, is currently self-funding.But, he added, \u201cI sense that once we get to a general election campaign, that his posture may become different\u201d given the scope and demands of a national campaign, and \u201chow well-funded Hillary Clinton will be on the other side.\u201dA Times reporter was allowed to listen in on the call by one of the participants.It was the first time there has been any indication that Mr. Trump might look to raise money in earnest. As of Jan. 31, he had lent his campaign $17 million, federal election reports showed. He has also raised several million dollars, primarily from smaller contributors. Most of his money has gone toward television ads.But Mr. Trump has said that he is mindful of his costs, and he has repeatedly talked about not wanting to spend money on a pollster or on advertising if he does not have to.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mr. Trump has used \u201cself-funding\u201d as a selling point to voters at his rallies. The claim is only partly true, as money he has raised from donors represents about a third of all the money his campaign has brought in over seven months. The rest is money he lent to his campaign.That has prompted a number of major donors, who backed other candidates and are now uncertain of what to do, wondering in private conversations about whether Mr. Trump will ultimately seek to secure their support down the road. But doing so would undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s claim of independence from the party\u2019s major figures, and potentially fuel lingering questions about how much money he has to spend personally. Yet the Trump campaign is said to be aware of potential pots of money that may be available eventually. According to people briefed on the exchanges, Trump campaign officials have appeared intrigued by how much money would be available to the nominee, and when, through the Republican National Committee should he become the nominee. A spokesman for the party committee did not immediately respond to an email. Meanwhile, on the finance network call, Mr. Christie also continued his slash-and-burn attacks on Senator Marco Rubio. When a person on the call asked how he would respond to Mr. Rubio\u2019s concerns that Mr. Trump as the nominee would tear apart the Republican Party, Mr. Christie replied, \u201cI would say to Marco that that\u2019s what desperate people say in the last throes of a losing campaign.\u201d He also pointed out that there was increased turnout in the Republican nominating contests in the first four states, and added that Mr. Rubio had also signed the loyalty pledge that all candidates put their names to last August vowing to support the eventual nominee.  Mr. Christie demurred when asked whether he would appear on a ticket with Mr. Trump, adding, \u201cDonald and I haven\u2019t had any conversations like that at all.\u201d One donor on the call later was struck by the rawness of Mr. Christie\u2019s anger at Mr. Rubio, whose supportive \u201csuper PAC\u201d ran devastating ads that blunted Mr. Christie\u2019s efforts at a political comeback in the New Hampshire primary.\n\t\tFirst Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Wellness App Aims to Improve Workplace Nutrition", "Date": "2016-02-21", "News": "Supported byA growing number of companies are offering their employees digital tools to help improve their eating habits in hopes of increasing productivity, reducing sick days and cutting health care costs.With an app and a website, Zipongo, a small digital start-up, is aimed at helping employees navigate a company\u2019s cafeteria menu to find choices that best meet a set of preferences and health goals set by the workers themselves.But Zipongo also extends its reach to takeout meals and the home kitchen, offering recipes, shopping lists and discounts on grocery items like fruits and vegetables.Since it made its debut in 2011, Zipongo has connected with some 125 companies to let employees try it, although none have made it mandatory.While Google was an early adopter a few years ago, IBM was among the most recent and began offering Zipongo to its tens of thousands of United States employees in January. Like other companies, IBM has long worked to steer its employees to healthier eating, even using a \u201ctraffic light\u201d system to indicate which cafeteria foods might be good choices. In 2007, the company offered a $150 cash rebate for IBM families recording their healthier eating habits in a confidential online system for eight weeks.\u201cWe strongly believe eating healthy is a social endeavor, both at work and at home,\u201d said Dr. Kyu Rhee, chief health officer at IBM. \u201cIt makes no sense if you eat healthy at the office and then eat badly at home.\u201dJason Langheier, the founder of Zipongo, noted that the National Center for Health Statistics had estimated that the average cost of a nutrition counseling session was $73.\u201cI thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a useful set of digital tools first,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Langheier said.Zipongo is a private company. It has raised roughly $10 million in financing since its start in 2011, including a $5 million investment by Excel Venture Management in late 2014, according to CrunchBase. It currently is raising more money.On average, Zipongo charges employers a little more than $50 a year per employee for a complete set of its services, Dr. Langheier said.Zipongo and other digital start-ups offering such wellness apps to employers and employees continue to raise concerns among health advocates as to whether these types of tools pose problems for protecting employee privacy.\u201cAre they going to share your information with restaurants in your neighborhood? Grocery stores?\u201d Ms. Pollitz asked. \u201cThe privacy statement is, like most privacy statements, very broad and permissive.\u201dDr. Langheier said his company did not collect any biometric information via its free system. Employees of companies that pay for the system can load it with various biometrics and tie their grocery loyalty cards to it. He said that Zipongo did not sell any information on its users to advertisers and that any data shared with employers for the purposes of analyzing the service was anonymized.Employers have long been trying to find ways to get their employees to eat better, said Michael O\u2019Donnell, director of the Health Management Research Center at the University of Michigan. \u201cNutrition has been one of the challenges in our field,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cIn workplace programs, the same as in national health education programs, it\u2019s been very difficult to get people to eat more fruits and vegetables.\u201dAt Google, which has promoted healthy eating for several years, employees have been using Zipongo since 2013.\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is start saying what people can and can\u2019t eat,\u201d said Michiel Bakker, director of global food services at Google. \u201cBut we do think we can help our employees make food choices that are better for them as an individual.\u201dAbout half of Google employees who signed up for Zipongo used the app at least once a month in 2014, according to a Harvard Business School case study. (One of the study\u2019s authors is an investor in Zipongo.)Users plug in their food preferences \u2014 spicy, gluten-free, protein-rich \u2014 and, if they want, biometric data like cholesterol and blood pressure levels. Zipongo then creates a menu from the choices in Google\u2019s cafeteria.Google employees using Zipongo ate more fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, calcium, fish and fiber-rich foods. Google also saw a dip in red meat consumption among its Zipongo users, which was one of its goals.\u201cWe tried Meatless Monday, but it was very difficult to make that work,\u201d Mr. Bakker said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t respond well if we say, \u2018Eat more of this and less of that,\u2019 but they\u2019re open to suggestions about better food choices like Zipongo provides.\u201dBut Dr. Langheier, who has a degree in public health as well as a medical degree, said he did not invent Zipongo to reach only high-paid workers at tech companies like Google and IBM. Inspiration for the system came from work he did as a pro bono consultant where he first realized the obstacles doctors faced in offering diet advice to overweight patients.\u201cWe spend $8,500 a year in the U.S., on average, for health care for one person, and just $2,200 on food, yet we rank 35th globally for life expectancy,\u201d Dr. Langheier said. \u201cIn Japan, they spend about $3,200 on health care and $3,300 on food \u2014 and they rank second for life expectancy.\u201dAn article on Monday about Zipongo, a start-up aimed at helping companies improve the eating habits of their employees, transposed the numbers in a quotation from Jason Langheier, Zipongo\u2019s founder. He said that Japan spends about $3,200 per person on health care and $3,300 on food, not the reverse. Because of editing errors, the article also misstated the number of IBM employees who can use Zipongo and the year that Google introduced the service. IBM offers the service to tens of thousands of American employees, not to 10,000 workers worldwide, and Google started using Zipongo in 2013, not 2011.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats Tangle in New Hampshire Over Rights to \u2018Progressive\u2019 Label", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byHillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont clashed in heated terms over the meaning of progressivism in America on Wednesday, with her forced to defend positions that he argued are not in line with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.Mr. Sanders criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s credentials as a progressive, claiming that her views on foreign policy, trade, the environment and money in politics separated her from those lawmakers who proudly wear that label.At a town hall forum hosted by CNN less than a week before New Hampshire holds the first primary election of the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Sanders suggested that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s positions sometimes shifted depending on her venue.\u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re a moderate on one day and be a progressive on another day,\u201d he said, noting that Mrs. Clinton described herself as a moderate last year. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a moderate and a progressive. They\u2019re different.\u201dMinutes after Mr. Sanders spoke, Mrs. Clinton pushed back at his assertion, saying that by his definition, President Obama or Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would not be considered progressives.\u201cI am a progressive who likes to get things done,\u201d she said. \u201cI was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up as the gatekeeper of who gets to be a progressive.\u201dMrs. Clinton went on to say that it was inappropriate for the senator to be defining such labels so rigidly.\u201cI know where I stand, I know who stands with me, I know what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she said.The forum was the first direct encounter between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders since she stopped him in the Iowa caucuses by the narrowest of margins.Though she ultimately prevailed in Iowa, the victory offered little satisfaction. Mr. Sanders raised questions about problems at caucus precincts and some votes that were decided by a coin toss. What was supposed to be a night that propelled Mrs. Clinton to the nomination turned out to be a \u201csigh of relief.\u201dWith both candidates trying to seize momentum from a nominating contest that proved barely decisive, the stakes in New Hampshire have grown. Mr. Sanders needs a victory in this, his neighboring state; Mrs. Clinton could use an upset or at least a strong showing.The argument that has boiled over ahead of the town hall forum was over which of the two could claim the true mantle of liberal values. On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders accused Mrs. Clinton of being a part-time progressive and a patron of Wall Street.According to the Associated Press, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have each won enough delegates to claim their party\u2019s nomination for president.\u201cI do not know any progressive who has a \u2018super PAC\u2019 and takes $15 million from Wall Street; that\u2019s just not progressive,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cThe key foreign decision of modern American history was the war in Iraq. The progressive community was pretty united in saying, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to Bush, don\u2019t go to war.\u2019 Secretary Clinton voted to go to war.\u201dEarlier in the day, at a town hall meeting in Derry, N.H., Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, hit back at suggestions that she was not a progressive.\u201cIt was kind of a low blow,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, listing highlights of her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that included standing up for gay and women\u2019s rights around the world.\u201cIt was a good day for progressives when I helped get eight million kids health care,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it was a good day for progressives when I joined with colleagues in the Senate to help stop George W. Bush from privatizing Social Security. I think it was a good day for progressives when I went to Geneva and Beijing to stand up for gay rights and women\u2019s rights.\u201dMr. Sanders has been holding double-digit leads in most New Hampshire polls. Mrs. Clinton considered directing her resources to other states, but after the close call in Iowa she decided to take a serious run at New Hampshire in hopes of pulling off another upset in a place where voters helped her disprove polling data and surprise then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008.Under pressure from Mr. Sanders to demonstrate that she is a progressive, she detailed in explicit terms the fights that she has faced with Republicans over the years, painting herself as the candidate most battle-tested to promote Democrats\u2019 causes.\u201cThey want to control our country,\u201d she said of Republican special interest groups. \u201cThey want to destroy our balance of power \u2014 they want to go after our political system and fill it with people that will do their bidding.\u201dAs she did in 2008 in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton also opened up in personal terms. This time it was about her religion and the meaning of spirituality in her life.She also shared revealing anecdotes, recounting how as first lady she would sneak out of the White House in disguise and, with the Secret Service, wander around the National Mall and help tourists take photos.Still, as she discussed faith and railed against the influence of money in politics, Mrs. Clinton struggled to justify the money she takes from wealthy donors who finance her campaign or why she thought it was ethical to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars to give speeches to firms like Goldman Sachs before she decided to run for president.Pressed on the matter by Anderson Cooper, the forum\u2019s moderator, Mrs. Clinton said that had not decided to run for president when she was accepting such large sums of money.Asked if it was appropriate to take $675,000 for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton stepped backward and said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what they offered.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted Hillary Clinton. Referring to Republican special interest groups, she said, \u201cThey want to destroy our balance of power \u2014 they want to go after our political system and fill it with people that will do their bidding,\u201d not \u201cbilling.\u201dAmy Chozick contributed reporting from Derry, N.H.Advertisement"}
