{"Headline": "Why \u2018Diverse TV\u2019 Matters: It\u2019s Better TV. Discuss.", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "Supported by\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to diverse TV.\u201d So said Idris Elba at the Screen Actors Guild Awards last month. It was a reference, of course, to the furor over the Oscars\u2019 all-white acting nominees. But Mr. Elba, who won awards that night for film and TV performances, was probably also aware that in the debate over whose stories get told on the screen, it\u2019s the small one that seems to have the edge as the more inclusive medium.At least that\u2019s what detractors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have been saying, and in the time since ABC made headlines by programming a slate of comedies (including \u201cblack-ish\u201d and \u201cFresh Off the Boat\u201d) created by and focusing on people of color, the television landscape certainly seems more diverse. But is that true, both in front of and behind the camera? Have more nonwhite actors and creators led to better television? Wesley Morris, a critic at large for The New York Times, and the chief television critic James Poniewozik take a closer look at shows like \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d and \u201cMaster of None\u201d to better understand what \u201cdiverse TV\u201d really means.It\u2019s an ironic line, because we know Mr. Simpson will later lose a wrongful-death case against him. But it\u2019s true, and \u2014 in a mini-series that exemplifies how essential race has become to some of today\u2019s best television \u2014 it speaks a truth about how and why the medium has gotten better about race. Representing more people in more ways is the right thing to do, and it has made TV better. But it happened largely because there was money in it.But she said that while collecting an Emmy. What\u2019s happened, in the years of \u201cEmpire\u201d and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d and \u201cblack-ish\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d is a change of both business and culture. TV audiences for everything are smaller now, which means networks aren\u2019t programming each show for an imagined audience of tens of millions of white people. On top of that, there are younger viewers for whom diversity \u2014 racial, religious, sexual \u2014 is their world. That audience wants authenticity; advertisers want that audience.That\u2019s a practical explanation. I also believe there\u2019s an aesthetic one: Diversity is another way of saying specificity, and specificity is just more entertaining. The less homogeneous TV is, the less boring it is.When people react to these exclusion conversations, you\u2019d think the argument was for confiscation. This isn\u2019t about less \u201cwhite\u201d TV, but about putting on other kinds of people than there have previously been. No one wants to take away anybody\u2019s \u201cThe Affair\u201d or \u201cBachelor in Paradise.\u201d It\u2019s just exciting to watch television in a time when a show will encourage Niecy Nash and Kerry Washington to look at America\u2019s past and roll their eyes.As a television partisan, I\u2019d like to say that the long-form medium has more room to complicate characters and build worlds. But look again at \u201cPeople v. O.J. Simpson,\u201d which lays out an empathetic antagonism between two black lawyers, Johnnie Cochran and Christopher Darden, and shows the push-pull of racial versus gender politics, all within a ridiculously entertaining courtroom thriller: That\u2019s an Oscar-bait movie! (It was even developed by the writers of \u201cThe People vs. Larry Flynt.\u201d) Different business and artistic dynamics notwithstanding, I can\u2019t help feel that the movies are just leaving a lot on the table here, and TV is eating its lunch.Some of what we\u2019re talking about is an end to tokenism, as Mr. Ansari noted. I remember as a teenager thinking that it was interesting that \u201cFriends\u201d had a white sextet. But making one of them not-white always seemed to risk introducing an inorganic realness the show was never meant to have. \u201cFriends\u201d was fine the way it was. It was also the product of the way television was at the time, when so-called black shows were on UPN and, for a minute, WB, implying that most of the rest of TV was white. The antidote to that problem wasn\u2019t a black friend. It was \u201cGirlfriends,\u201d which began in 2000 and at the time was this oasis of bougie dramedy. Now, happily, it would just be another show on TV.What I like about \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cMaster of None,\u201d Jim, is precisely what you point out, which is that there are both imaginative and organic ways to make TV look like parts of the country without \u201calienating\u201d anybody. Despite our unofficially segregated schools and neighborhoods, I like shows that work to achieve integrated casts without making integration look like work. \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d achieves that feat while also keeping the legacies of race and racism on the hook.One rare show that manages to be about both integration and segregation is \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d It\u2019s set in prison, where inmates self-sort by race, but also ally and clash across lines. It belly flops into waters other shows dab a toe in, because behind bars, the normal protocols for talking around race are suspended. Prison is truly where you stop being polite and start getting real.Speaking of which: For all the heat they take, reality shows often did more than scripted shows of their time to cast broadly; in 1994 \u201cThe Real World\u201d aired TV\u2019s first same-sex commitment ceremony, between a black man and a Hispanic man; NBC was still four years away from \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d But the genre has had its own problems of stereotyping and casting: We\u2019re still waiting for a black Bachelor or Bachelorette, but we\u2019re getting one on Season 2 of \u201cUnREAL.\u201dI love that we\u2019re at a place where an esteemed white male creator talks about what he\u2019s learned from an esteemed black female creator. I\u2019d love to get to a place where a black female creator is making an HBO drama series herself.But whether he thought he\u2019d miscast Ms. Warren (whose acting wasn\u2019t a problem), Mr. Lindelof kept going and hired Ms. King, who did some of her best acting on this show. He didn\u2019t stop there, though. He hired a handful of other black actors to explore some weird, otherworldly, grisly stuff: Darius McCrary, as a fortune teller; the veteran Steven Williams as the hoodooing father-in-law of Ms. King\u2019s character; and Kevin Carroll, as her husband.With Mr. Carroll\u2019s firefighter, the show was especially daring. Here was a black man prone to unexplained outbursts of violence that rhymed with the trauma of the show\u2019s main protagonist, a white cop, played by Justin Theroux. These two were soul mates who didn\u2019t understand that violence had cosmically drawn them to each other. Not everything Mr. Carroll was asked to do worked, not because he was black but because some of the character\u2019s moves were false. But that\u2019s entertainment.I don\u2019t want to credit Ms. Rhimes for Mr. Lindelof\u2019s risk-taking \u2014 he was already a gambler. But I do think when it comes to freeing actors of color to be bad, her influence is inevitable. Before \u201cEmpire,\u201d her shows were among TV\u2019s most nuts. And they had black people and Latinos and gay men at peak sociopath. On that front, \u201cEmpire\u201d has already shattered her monopoly. I don\u2019t know whether she feels Cookie and company breathing down her neck, but I\u2019ve noticed an uptick in the insanity in Shondaland.Advertisement"}

We didn\u2019t even get to see William. I know happy endings aren\u2019t very X-ey, but come on!I had actually come around to the idea that alien DNA might be the human race\u2019s salvation. The idea that the thing that scares us the most, that we are led to believe could pose the greatest harm, might be the only thing that can save us? I can work with that. But this episodewas just tedious. (Agent Einstein is back and she and Scully spent precious minutes talking complicated science while trying to find a solution, which they do. This was about as exciting as an episode of \u201cNOVA.\u201d)It was also all over the place. Agent Monica Reyes, who had come onboard in Season 8 and helped deliver William, possibly got more screen time in this episode than Agent Skinner did in the entire miniseries. She wasn\u2019t a character I was clamoring to see again and neither was the infuriating Tad O\u2019Malley, who flailed like a guppy out of water. He\u2019s the voice of reason and he\u2019s been right all along about his conspiracy theories? His advice is to \u201cstay indoors\u201d? Mine is turn him off.The grand threat to our species, the Spartan virus, was spread through the most trite means \u2014 mandatory inoculations, like for smallpox. I really hope Jenny McCarthy and her crew of anti-vaxxers were not watching this episode.I could not stop rolling my eyes at all of this. The breadth and length of the original series made it impossible to wrap up the \u201cmythology\u201d arc in just two episodes in a shortened season. And as bookends, the episodes seemed jarring and out of place. To make this feel more cohesive, it wouldn\u2019t have taken much to seed bits of the Spartan virus plot in the other four episodes.Mulder finally has his day with \u201cOld Smokey\u201d (as he calls the Cigarette Smoking Man), but even though he had a gun, nothing really came of it, except that we see the terrifying sight of the CSM\u2019s face, which was nearly destroyed by fire. Seems fitting, no? For some reason, he chose Agent Reyes as his minion and she went along because he bestowed alien DNA on her, protecting her from the impending virus.Scully, who also has alien DNA, is also safe and so is William. Scully literally gives her blood to save the world!Two small bits of good news: Scully doesn\u2019t get knocked out in this episode and Mulder does actually see a U.F.O. in the presence of many witnesses. So, you know, one off the bucket list.Here\u2019s what we still don\u2019t know\u2022 Does Mulder make it?\u2022 Where is William? What is he like?\u2022 Why would this cabal of men set out to kill of humanity? There has to be a better answer than just playing God?\u2022 And finally, what was the point of it all? I guess I was a fool for thinking I\u2019d get any answers. And after this disheartening ending, I\u2019m not sure that I care see any more. I am happy with my \u201cX-Files\u201d memories and luckily, they are streaming into infinity on Netflix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "O.J. Simpson Drama Depicts an Old Trial, and Renewed Tensions", "Date": "2016-01-31", "News": "Supported byFor the last two decades, O. J. has been on ice.Well, about that O. J. fatigue? FX is convinced that you\u2019re over it.FX is betting that viewers who can vividly recall where they were during the Bronco chase \u2014 as well as a younger audience that is only vaguely aware of the black glove and the famous mantra \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fit, you must acquit\u201d \u2014 will devour the series. The network says early tracking suggests that it will do better than any show it has put on the air.Not only does the series have the potential to reignite discussion about Mr. Simpson\u2019s trial, but the producers anticipate that the issues at the center of the case \u2014 race, celebrity, sexism, domestic violence \u2014 will resonate with the public as profoundly as they did 21 years ago.\u201cIt\u2019s like a perfect, jewel-like reflection of the contemporary dialogue in America,\u201d said John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX.The monthslong trial proved to be a searing collective experience, and the reaction to the verdict showed a country deeply divided over race. Courtney B. Vance, who portrays Mr. Simpson\u2019s defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, recalled how he was filming a movie with Tony Goldwyn, who is white, when the verdict was announced in 1995.\u201cI was in Tony\u2019s trailer when the verdict came down, and I said \u2018Yes!\u2019 and he said \u2018Noooo!\u2019 \u201d Mr. Vance said in a recent interview. \u201cWe looked at each other and realized that\u2019s where we are. And 20 years later we are in exactly the same place.\u201dBut producers believe race will resonate more with viewers than any other theme. \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d opens with footage of the Rodney King beating and the 1992 Los Angeles riots, laying the groundwork for Mr. Simpson\u2019s defense in a trial that largely served as a referendum on the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s treatment of blacks.During the series\u2019s development, its producers thought audiences would be most drawn to how the trial may have given birth to celebrity culture and the 24-hour news cycle. (\u201cKato Kaelin is arguably the first reality TV star, and the Kardashian kids are genuinely part of the story,\u201d said Brad Simpson, an executive producer.) Race \u2014 the through line of Jeffrey Toobin\u2019s 1996 book \u201cThe Run of His Life,\u201d which the show is based on \u2014 was to be a secondary issue.\u201cAs everything unfolded, it affected what we were writing, it affected our conversations,\u201d Brad Simpson said.He said that a scene in the first episode with Mr. Cochran (before he joined O. J. Simpson\u2019s defense team) and the lawyer Christopher Darden (before he was on the prosecution team) discussing police brutality was drawn up only after racial unrest again became a leading national topic.\u201cThroughout the development of the show, national events started bubbling up around this project,\u201d said Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of Fox Television Group, who also heads one of the studios behind the show. \u201cIt just gave a spine to the narrative of why this show is important and relevant today.\u201dThough \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d centers on a crime, the actual murders are not shown. Producers said they were more interested in the trial than the gruesome stabbings, in part out of sensitivity to the victims, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.The producers also insist that the show does not take a position on who committed the murders, even though its source material, Mr. Toobin\u2019s book, concludes that Mr. Simpson was guilty.\u201cIt\u2019s not even really relevant to the show,\u201d said Nina Jacobson, an executive producer. \u201cOur intention was to understand how a verdict was reached that we couldn\u2019t understand at the time. And how all these events came into play that gave rise to the verdict.\u201d\u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d instead leans heavily on character portraits, notably of the defense lawyer Robert Shapiro (played by Mr. Travolta), Mr. Simpson\u2019s friend Robert Kardashian (played by Mr. Schwimmer), Mr. Cochran and the prosecutor Marcia Clark (played by Ms. Paulson).Ms. Paulson\u2019s portrayal of Ms. Clark in particular shows how \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d is an exploration of sexism in America as well as an examination of race. In the show, Ms. Clark comes off as an unexpectedly sympathetic character as she confronts withering criticism from the news media and colleagues about her appearance.\u201cI look back and I cannot believe that women all over the country were not standing up saying, \u2018What is happening?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Paulson said in an interview. \u201cWomen \u2014 women! \u2014 were not even behind Marcia.\u201dShe recalled one scene in which Ms. Clark walks into the courtroom with a new hairstyle, one she is proud of. Ms. Paulson said she did not have a plan about how to perform it.\u201cAnd then Judge Ito says, \u2018Welcome, Ms. Clark, I think,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Paulson said, referring to Judge Lance Ito, who presided over the trial. \u201cAnd there was this tittering of laughter behind me and from the defense table. All of these men. And I burst into tears. I could feel the temperature in my neck rising, I could feel the color change in my face. I remember thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t know how she did this.\u2019 \u201d\u201cPeople were filled up to the point that they were ready to burst,\u201d said Ms. Jacobson, who was also a producer of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d films. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you\u2019ve had too much of a certain alcohol that you can never go back to drinking that alcohol without feeling sick.\u201dAfter much discussion, Ms. Walden gave her blessing. She and Mr. Murphy agreed it was the perfect subject matter to introduce \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d a spinoff of FX\u2019s anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story.\u201dMr. Murphy became an executive producer of the show and also directed several episodes. He orchestrated the casting, including the monthslong process of persuading Mr. Travolta to take his first regular television role in decades.In an interview, Mr. Murphy said that when he works on a show he generally accepts little feedback. On this project, however, he showed scripts and rough cuts of the show to as many people as he could, black and white. He did not want to screw it up.\u201cThese are topics that we\u2019ve never gotten right, and never fully understood,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is such an important conversation in our culture now. And such an important thing to get right.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "PBS Is Creating a Channel Exclusively for Children", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byPBS is starting a new 24-hour channel dedicated solely to children\u2019s programming.The channel, which will be called PBS Kids and will be announced on Tuesday, will be free. It is expected to debut later this year \u2014 most likely in the fall. PBS Kids will also be available online with a live stream.More children\u2019s programming is available than ever, much of it being watched through streaming services and on-demand.Netflix has significantly increased its children\u2019s offerings in recent years, and it is expected to have 35 original series for children by year\u2019s end.Last month, HBO began broadcasting the latest season of \u201cSesame Street,\u201d after it took over first-run rights for the series from PBS. HBO has said more children\u2019s programming is coming, and Amazon has also produced shows aimed at that demographic.PBS will use the channel to broadcast popular shows already on its stations, like \u201cDaniel Tiger\u2019s Neighborhood,\u201d \u201cDinosaur Train\u201d and \u201cWild Kratts.\u201dPBS Kids will exist as a subchannel. Other PBS subchannels include World (which airs mostly documentaries) and Create (which broadcasts shows dedicated to topics like cooking and travel). PBS said the children\u2019s channel was not created with a hope of lifting fund-raising efforts, despite the recent loss of the first-air rights to \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\u201cThis is not designed in and of itself as a fund-raising effort,\u201d said Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS.The broadcaster said the new channel would be distinguished from other children\u2019s programming for the same reason PBS\u2019s programming has always stood out: It is free, with an emphasis on educational content.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge distinction between the content that\u2019s available through other media providers and PBS,\u201d said Lesli Rotenberg, the broadcaster\u2019s general manager of children\u2019s programming. \u201cEven though there may be more, there isn\u2019t necessarily more educational content for kids.\u201dPBS said that its live stream would also offer educational game opportunities for children. Ms. Rotenberg said that PBS\u2019s online games received twice as many page views and significantly more users than videos.The idea for PBS Kids arose, in part, because children are watching programs all day, not just in the morning and after school.\u201cThe challenge is when a lot of kids are available to be watching, we are broadcasting other things like the \u2018NewsHour,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Kerger said. \u201cThere are a lot of children, particularly that are home in early prime time, we aren\u2019t able to accommodate them except for on-demand. Given the fact that there are so many kids where on-demand is not an option, we want to be able to reach those kids.\u201dPBS was once in business with Comcast for the 24-hour children\u2019s channel called Sprout (the two are no longer connected). Ms. Kerger said that partnership was when PBS learned that there was also a valuable place for children\u2019s programming in prime time.\u201cThe assumption was that after 6 at night there wasn\u2019t as much an appetite for kids\u2019 content,\u201d she said. \u201cActually, deep into prime time, there are still a lot of kids watching television. There is an interesting phenomenon that parents talk about that the time they want public television content is during early evening hours when everyone is just getting home, and they\u2019re trying to make dinner, and we\u2019re not there.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Living With Cancer: A Woman Like Me", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "A clip from \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Woman Like Me.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSusan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.We commonly assume that cancer afflicts the aging or aged, but approximately 16 percent of breast cancer deaths involve women under the age of 50.  How can or should an alarming death sentence be confronted in midlife?  The personal challenges posed by incurable disease unfold in an absorbing documentary about movie-making, \u201cA Woman Like Me,\u201d which opened in New York in October and became available on Netflix this January.The co-directors of \u201cA Woman Like Me,\u201d Alex Sichel and Elizabeth Giamatti, consider the roles played by temperament, spirituality and art as two vigorous women attempt to reconcile themselves to a terminal prognosis. The film portrays Ms. Sichel confronting metastatic breast cancer by making two movies.  The first is a documentary of herself in the hospital with medical personnel and at home with her family.  Ms. Sichel, who received the diagnosis just before her daughter started kindergarten, is shown dealing with her ambivalence about the traditional therapies she undertakes.  Her parents, sisters and husband struggle on camera with their ambivalence about the holistic therapies she also undertakes.    Braided with the documentary, the second movie Ms. Sichel makes is fictional: The actress Lili Taylor plays a buoyant alter ego, Anna, who must respond to the same dire diagnosis. The fictional narrative of \u201cA Woman Like Me\u201d centers on a happier version of Alex Sichel so she can watch someone stepping lightly through her fraught terrain. For example, Anna sits with a friend in a restaurant and interrogates the waitress.  Is there dairy in the vegetarian dish? Are there gluten-free options?  Her friend orders the cavatelli, Anna steamed kale without salt.  After a pause, though, she changes her mind; she will have the cavatelli as well as a glass of Cabernet.  In the near future, she says, she does not want to look back on \u00e2\u0080\u009cpointless good behavior.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn contrast, Ms. Sichel presents herself in a series of tortured conversations with a variety of advisers as she hurtles between fear and hope on an emotional roller coaster. She visits a meditation center and consults a Buddhist teacher, but equanimity often eludes her.  Intermittently sad and angry, yet terrified of dying angry, she tries to find serene memories, only to recall her sorrow at her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, whereas Anna remembers her grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooking.\u201cA Woman Like Me\u201d hints that some people may be endowed with a disposition that facilitates their making peace with their imminent demise, although maybe those people exist only in fiction.  Yet both stormy Alex and sunny Anna try to learn how to acknowledge their looming mortality.  In especially poignant scenes, Alex and Anna must come to terms with their grief at losing their young children and also with their children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future grief at losing them.Anna copes with cancer most dramatically when she rehearses her death with her husband.  Enlisting his help, she promises to refrain from moaning, but wants to know what his final words to her will be.  And then she encourages him to drape a white sheet over her head.  Anna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directing the scene with her husband tells us something about Alex Sichel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to spend the last year of her life co-directing a movie.Like Anna\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rehearsing, Ms. Sichel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movie-making is a testament to creativity and to the multiplicity of the self.  Ms. Sichel refutes what cancer will inevitably make of her by imagining what she makes of it.  In \u201cA Woman Like Me,\u201d she offers a defense of cancer art as a way of envisioning and practicing mortality.  Throughout the film she espouses the efficacy of Buddhism, but the creator of Anna provides us proof of the value of story-telling.If Alex Sichel could not become a sunnier person, she could envision herself being one. Through this endeavor, she and her co-director, Ms. Giamatti, illuminate what it means to live with incurable cancer not, as Ms. Giamatti put it during a phone conversation, in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalcion or Hollywood\u00e2\u0080\u009d manner, but in all its messy and contradictory intensity.After watching the movie, I was upset at learning that Ms. Sichel died on June 23, 2014, at the age of 50, and then I was surprised at my distress since the end of the film makes it abundantly clear that she was suffering advanced disease.  Yet somehow I could not believe that this engaged and engaging woman was dead. My reaction also testifies to the power of art, for Alex Sichel and her double Anna continue to touch and instruct people like me by showing us characters like ourselves.  If we cannot attain complete and lasting tranquility in the face of a death sentence, we can nevertheless conceive of a series of precarious, provisional moments of acceptance.  Story-telling serves not as an escape from the reality of disease but as an assertion of the self against what will eventually happen.Terrible as cancer is, it has prompted people to produce astonishing art. The power of this meta-movie resides not in retrospective platitudes about women with metastatic disease but in its representations of their urgent exertions to imagine the unimaginable.Related:Your health questions answered by Times journalists and\u00a0experts.Get Well's Running email for practical tips, expert advice, exclusive content and a bit of motivation delivered to your inbox every week to help you on your running journey.

{"Headline": "Gearing Up for the Cloud, AT&T Tells Its Workers: Adapt, or Else", "Date": "2016-02-13", "News": "Supported byDALLAS \u2014 Thirty-four years ago, Kevin Stephenson got his younger brother, Randall, a job with the telephone company.Kevin, then 23, and Randall, 22, had tried selling cattle feed with their father near their home in Moore, Okla., but that didn\u2019t pan out. Kevin was hired to do accounting at a local Southwestern Bell office. Randall, who was in college, needed a bit more help. \u201cHe had trouble getting hired,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI talked to someone I knew in personnel.\u201dThe brothers had different tastes. Kevin liked to be outside, and now, at 57 years old, he works in Norman, Okla., fixing the decades-old copper lines that still connect to landline telephones in most homes as well as to modern Internet conduits like high-speed fiber optics. Randall liked numbers and stayed indoors, rising through the management ranks.Southwestern Bell became SBC Communications and took on the old AT&T name through an acquisition in 2005. By 2007, Randall was running the place.Today, Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, is trying to reinvent the company so it can compete more deftly. Not that long ago it had to fight for business with other phone companies and cellular carriers. Then the Internet and cloud computing came along, and AT&T found itself in a tussle with a whole bunch of companies.AT&T\u2019s competitors are not just Verizon and Sprint, but also tech giants like Amazon and Google. For the company to survive in this environment, Mr. Stephenson needs to retrain its 280,000 employees so they can improve their coding skills, or learn them, and make quick business decisions based on a fire hose of data coming into the company.In an ambitious corporate education program that started about two years ago, he is offering to pay for classes (at least some of them) to help employees modernize their skills. But there\u2019s a catch: They have to take these classes on their own time and sometimes pay for them with their own money.To Mr. Stephenson, it should be an easy choice for most workers: Learn new skills or find your career choices are very limited.AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.\u201cThere is a need to retool yourself, and you should not expect to stop,\u201d he said in a recent interview at AT&T\u2019s Dallas headquarters. People who do not spend five to 10 hours a week in online learning, he added, \u201cwill obsolete themselves with the technology.\u201dKevin? He admires his younger brother, but he is among the many AT&T lifers who are not that keen to participate in this reinvention of old Ma Bell. \u201cI\u2019m riding the copper train all the way down,\u201d he said.He talks about the changes with obvious affection for both his brother and his longtime employer. In interviews, many veteran AT&T employees around the country showed a surprising amount of emotion toward a company that has been broken up, rebuilt and reinvented several times.But that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is particularly eager to rebuild and reinvent themselves for a new AT&T. Even if it means, as Randall put it, obsolescence.Companies\u2019 reinventing themselves to compete with more nimble competitors is hardly a new story. Many have tried, and a handful have even succeeded. Mr. Stephenson wants AT&T to be among those few.By 2020, Mr. Stephenson hopes AT&T will be well into its transformation into a computing company that manages all sorts of digital things: phones, satellite television and huge volumes of data, all sorted through software managed in the cloud.That can\u2019t happen unless at least some of his work force is retrained to deal with the technology. It\u2019s not a young group: The average tenure at AT&T is 12 years, or 22 years if you don\u2019t count the people working in call centers. And many employees don\u2019t have experience writing open-source software or casually analyzing terabytes of customer data.If you don\u2019t develop the new skills, you won\u2019t be fired \u2014 at least AT&T won\u2019t say as much \u2014 but you won\u2019t have much of a future. The company isn\u2019t too worried about people leaving, since executives estimate that eventually AT&T could get by with one-third fewer workers.Mr. Stephenson declined to project how many workers he might have by 2020, when the cloud-based system is supposed to be fully in place. One thing about cutting people in an aging work force, he noted, is that \u201cdemography is on our side.\u201d Other senior executives say shrinking the work force by 30 percent is not out of the question.Maybe so, but count Kevin among the skeptics of how fast AT&T\u2019s transformation will happen.\u201cI\u2019m proud of my brother,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not going to get rid of this stuff as fast as he thinks.\u201dLong ago, a phone system created wire lines between callers, and operators moved plugs in their switchboards to connect people. Over time, that was automated to become something closer to a computer, with digital fibers and wireless towers. Much of the setup, however, still needed lots of people to tend hardware that had been built for particular tasks, like feeding one neighborhood\u2019s calls into a nationwide backbone of wires, fiber and switches.Mr. Stephenson has concentrated on things related to cloud computing, a technology setup that is more like the computer guts of Google or Amazon than the circuits and switches of a phone company. This cloud system will eventually touch ventures in landline phones, wireless, high-speed online services, cable TV and now satellite, thanks to the DirecTV purchase.Analysts give him good marks but say he has a long way to go. \u201cThey want to be 75 percent done by 2020, and last year they did the first 5 percent,\u201d said Akshay Sharma, an analyst with the research firm Gartner.AT&T wants to build products and services as fast as this competition. Data from satellite TV could be analyzed for viewing habits and someday used, for example, to sell football fans a replay app for their AT&T mobile phones.In 2012, Mr. Stephenson realized, much to his dismay, that his staff was woefully unschooled for the new technology. Vision 2020, as the company calls it, is a program that combines online and classroom-based course work in subjects like digital networking and data science, as well as a look at old skills that can be transferred to new careers.Everything at AT&T is changing, from the services customers are offered to the way they are charged for them. One service called Network on Demand, for example, allows customers to increase the size of their Internet pipes without calling a technician, something that used to take weeks. And Mr. Stephenson\u2019s employees have to be able to deal with all that.\u201cIf we can\u2019t do it, mark my words, in three years we\u2019ll be managing decline,\u201d he said.Inside a glass-walled office where Mr. Stephenson meets presidential candidates and corporate titans, Mr. Thrun gave him a pitch on funding an online master\u2019s degree in engineering that Udacity proposed to teach in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Within five minutes, the two men were cross-legged on the floor, Mr. Stephenson eager to try a physics course.His first online learning began with an unexpected challenge: getting online. AT&T\u2019s own Wi-Fi was too clunky, Mr. Thrun recalled. Eventually they used Mr. Thrun\u2019s smartphone, which ran on the network of T-Mobile, a rival carrier.The building\u2019s Wi-Fi is now said to be better, and elsewhere in AT&T the first employees are getting their online Georgia Tech degrees.Eboni Bell, 24, a product manager for smartphone software in AT&T\u2019s Atlanta office, sees the Vision 2020 retraining as the chance of a lifetime. The company provided tuition assistance for much of her two-year Udacity/Georgia Tech master\u2019s degree in computer science, which it says cost $6,600. Single and childless, she doesn\u2019t mind the hours it takes.\u201cI leave the office at 7 p.m., work at home until midnight, and Saturdays and Sundays are committed to school,\u201d she said.Ms. Bell, who wants to work in software architecture and design, plans to keep taking courses. \u201cI need to know what my competitors are doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t see myself staying with one product too long \u2014 it makes me feel like I\u2019m not growing.\u201dSo far most of the people who have taken the new courses are managers, and seem interested in learning very technical skills. Among the most popular courses are web development, data analysis, introduction to programming and writing apps for the iPhone.\u201cIt\u2019s great for those who want to make the transition,\u201d said Mr. Sharma of Gartner. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to change, it\u2019s a good time to retire and enjoy life.\u201dAT&T\u2019s workers receive weekly emails and video broadcasts about learning online. Vision 2020 includes an internal website where employees can enter their job titles, see what types of careers might be available in a software-driven company, and what courses they need to take to get them. Over time, their grades are logged, and depending on how they do on the schoolwork, different new courses are suggested. Eventually, performance reviews will include data on what people studied, how well they did and whether, like Ms. Bell, they are willing to keep learning.Eventually, the plan is that desire for learning will be taken into account when promotions are considered.Across the country in Orange, Calif., Patti Cunningham, a 61-year-old technician, is struggling. Ms. Cunningham, who has worked at AT&T for 43 years, has not signed up for any courses, and can barely recall receiving emails about the new plans. (An AT&T spokesman produced dozens of such messages, going back to early 2014.) Essentially, she does not see a place for herself.\u201cThis new concept of training on your own time, everything changing all the time, if you want to keep working, do more things on your own time \u2014 I guess they have to do it,\u201d she said, sitting in a run-down room at her union local. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see a need to be involved.\u201dChristopher Shelton, national head of the Communications Workers of America, said the changes were inevitable, and he believed his people would go along with them.\u201cWe realized a long time ago that you can\u2019t fight technology change and win,\u201d he said. \u201cOur contracts spell out training programs and policies to make sure that members get training to update their skills as technology changes.\u201d Still, he thinks the expectations about home study after a hard day\u2019s work are too much.AT&T will reimburse up to $8,000 a year in tuition; the amount was raised just last month. The company claims that a year into the program, over half of the work force, mostly managers, has started training, sometimes with dozens of short online courses.\u201cPeople are going to have to work hard, but it\u2019s not insane,\u201d said William Blase, who oversees personnel for all of AT&T. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an expectation that your compensation will be tied to continuing to learn. We\u2019re at a crossroads as a business \u2014 and a country \u2014 where education has to keep up with technology.\u201dIf there is one thing on which Ms. Bell and Ms. Cunningham agree, albeit with different sentiments, it is that the change is necessary. Eventually phone calls, texts, sensor data and TV shows, along with much else, will all run on fiber-optic networks and be managed largely with software.Ms. Bell works with a lot of older colleagues. \u201cOne of my co-workers has been looking at the same database for 20 years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds harsh, but if she doesn\u2019t adapt, there won\u2019t be room for her.\u201dThat message has not been lost on Jacobie Davis, an 18-year employee in Richardson, Tex., who works in tech support for older-style gear. At 39, he is the youngest person in his office, and is scrambling to study both new networks and data science. \u201cI try to put in 15 hours a week,\u201d he said. \u201cBy 2020, my technology will be gone.\u201dIn some ways, cloud computing is not as radical a technology shift as all the puffy language suggests. Big banks of computers still run software, as they have been doing in many industries since the 1960s. They have more power, because their chips have more transistors that enable them to do more, and they connect to more things thanks to fiber-optic cable and wireless.The big difference is something called virtualization, which amounts to software that allows many machines to operate like one piece of computer hardware. This made it possible to run software that in effect interacted with other software instead of hardware. This, in turn, means the possibility of changing functions around rapidly by typing a few lines of code.The new systems also collect more data, quickly analyze information about what people and things are doing, and react. That is how online ads are personalized for you, and increasingly how maps reflect current traffic conditions, or streetlights adjust to suit parking congestion.Now what once took a year of analysis and deployment can instead happen in days, even minutes.These concepts can be tough in some reaches of AT&T, where lives and work have not changed all that much.In Dayton, Ohio, Kirk Warrenburg came out of a job in a bowling alley and started wiring cards for telegraph systems 40 years ago. Now he works on AT&T\u2019s signaling network, which makes sure billions of calls get through.He has taken 16 courses \u2014 Udacity courses and in-house \u201cnano courses,\u201d each about two weeks long \u2014 in the last year. He doesn\u2019t see himself changing jobs, however, because the old machines still need someone to care for them. Younger workers, he thinks, won\u2019t want to be in his dead end.\u201cWriting a telegraph circuit was like writing a recipe for a field technician,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of legacy systems are still around here. I\u2019ll be long gone before they will.\u201dSome other older employees besides Kevin Stephenson think the 2020 target will come and go, but basics won\u2019t change.The 2020 effort \u201cis just a start,\u201d said Kenny Williams, 64, a testing technician and the head of Ms. Cunningham\u2019s union local in Southern California. \u201cI\u2019ve inoculated my people against worrying. They need a fiber network for this that doesn\u2019t exist out here yet. Seventy percent of my folks are safe; the other 30 have to be found jobs, or they\u2019ll take the golden handshake\u201d and retire.As he sees it, much of the urgency comes from the threat of Google. In 2015 Google Fiber, Google\u2019s high-speed Internet service, caused AT&T to do something uncommon in its history: lower its prices because of competition. \u201cIn 40 years here I hadn\u2019t seen that,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cTheir people aren\u2019t in unions \u2014 we\u2019re a lot more on AT&T\u2019s side than theirs.\u201dWhat happens next at AT&T \u2014 and how fast that will happen \u2014 is a matter of disagreement in the Stephenson family.\u201cI go out to houses away from the cities, and there\u2019s not a lot of fiber there,\u201d Kevin said. Fiber would open the way for all that new technology. He takes comfort in looking at patches linemen did on fiber systems decades ago \u2014 from both the jury-rigged craftsmanship and the way they have endured.But Randall said his brother was not necessarily like the rest of the work force because there will always be hard, outdoor tasks for people like him. \u201cThere will be people turning screws and digging trenches. I\u2019ll be long gone before that is over. But other guys I know in Oklahoma will do a skills pivot\u201d with additional training, he said.Besides, it\u2019s not just about his brother. It\u2019s about most of the economy.\u201cEverybody is going to go face to face with a Google, an Amazon, a Netflix,\u201d he said. \u201cYou compete based on data, and based on customer insights you get with their permission. If we\u2019re wrong, it won\u2019t play well for anyone here.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything About Everything: David Foster Wallace\u2019s \u2018Infinite Jest\u2019 at 20", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byEssaySomething happens to a novel as it ages, but what? It doesn\u2019t ripen or deepen in the manner of cheese and wine, and it doesn\u2019t fall apart, at least not figuratively. Fiction has no half-life. We age alongside the novels we\u2019ve read, and only one of us is actively deteriorating. Which is to say that a novel is perishable only by virtue of being stored in such a leaky cask: our heads. With just a few years\u2019 passage, a novel can thus seem \u201cdated\u201d or \u201cirrelevant\u201d or (God help us) \u201cproblematic.\u201d When a novel survives this strange process, and gets reissued in a handsome 20th-anniversary edition, it\u2019s tempting to hold it up and say, \u201cIt withstood the test of time.\u201d Most would intend such a statement as praise, but is a 20-year-old novel successful merely because it seems cleverly predictive or contains scenarios that feel \u201crelevant\u201d to later audiences? If that were the mark of enduring fiction, Philip K. Dick would be the greatest novelist of all time.How is it, then, that \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d still feels so transcendentally, electrically alive? Theory 1: As a novel about an \u201centertainment\u201d weaponized to enslave and destroy all who look upon it, \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is the first great Internet novel. Yes, William Gibson and Neal Stephenson may have gotten there first with \u201cNeuromancer\u201d and \u201cSnow Crash,\u201d whose Matrix and Metaverse, respectively, more accurately surmised what the Internet would look and feel like. (Wallace, among other things, failed to anticipate the break from cartridge- and disc-based entertainment.) But \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d warned against the insidious virality of popular entertainment long before anyone but the most Delphic philosophers of technology. Sharing videos, binge-watching Netflix, the resultant neuro-pudding at the end of an epic gaming marathon, the perverse seduction of recording and devouring our most ordinary human thoughts on Facebook and Instagram \u2014 Wallace somehow knew all this was coming, and (as the man himself might have put it) it gave him the howling fantods.Theory 3: \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is a peerlessly gripping novel of character. Even very fine novelists struggle with character, because creating characters that are not just prismatic snap-off versions of oneself happens to be supremely difficult. In \u201cHow Fiction Works,\u201d the literary critic James Wood, whose respectful but ultimately cool view of Wallace\u2019s work is as baffling as Conrad\u2019s rejection of Melville and Nabokov\u2019s dismissal of Bellow, addresses E.\u2009M. Forster\u2019s famous distinction between \u201cflat\u201d and \u201cround\u201d characters: \u201cIf I try to distinguish between major and minor characters \u2014 round and flat characters \u2014 and claim that these differ in terms of subtlety, depth, time allowed on the page, I must concede that many so-called flat characters seem more alive to me, and more interesting as human studies, however short-lived, than the round characters they are supposedly subservient to.\u201d Anyone reading or rereading \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d will notice an interesting pertinence: Throughout the book, Wallace\u2019s flat, minor, one-note characters walk as tall as anyone, peacocks of diverse idiosyncrasy. Wallace doesn\u2019t simply set a scene and novelize his characters into facile life; rather, he makes an almost metaphysical commitment to see reality through their eyes. A fine example of this occurs early in \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d during its \u201cWhere was the woman who said she\u2019d come\u201d interlude, which concerns the paranoid weed addict Ken Erdedy, whose terror of being considered a too eager drug buyer has engendered an unwelcome situation: He is unsure whether or not he actually managed to make an appointment with a woman able to access 200 grams of \u201cunusually good\u201d marijuana, which he very much wants to spend the weekend smoking. For 11 pages, Erdedy does nothing but sweat and anticipate this woman\u2019s increasingly conjectural arrival with his desired 200 grams. I suspect no one who has struggled with substance addiction can read this passage without squirming, gasping or weeping. I know of nothing else in the entirety of literature that so convincingly inhabits a drug-smashed consciousness while remaining a model of empathetic clarity. The literary craftsman\u2019s term for what Wallace is doing within the Erdedy interlude is free indirect style, but while reading Wallace you get the feeling that bloodless matters of craftsmanship rather bored him. Instead, he had to somehow psychically become his characters, which is surely why he wrote so often, and so well, in a microscopically close third person. In this very specific sense, Wallace may be the closest thing to a method actor in American literature, which I cannot imagine was without its subtle traumas. And Erdedy is merely one of the novel\u2019s hundreds of differently damaged walk-on characters! Sometimes I wonder: What did it cost Wallace to create him?Theory 4: \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d is unquestionably the novel of its generation. As a member (barely) of the generation Wallace was part of, and as a writer whose closest friends are writers (most of whom are Wallace fans), and as someone who first read \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d at perhaps the perfect age (22, as a Peace Corps volunteer in Uzbekistan), my testimony on this point may well be riddled with partisanship. So allow me to drop the mask of the introducer to show the homely face of a fan, and much later a friend, of David Wallace.As I read \u201cInfinite Jest\u201d in the dark early mornings before my Uzbek language class, I could hear my host mother talking to the chickens in the barn on the other side of my bedroom wall as she flung scatters of feed before them. I could hear the cows stirring, and then their deep monstrous mooing, along with the compound\u2019s approximately 10,000 wild cats moving in the crawl space directly above my bed. What I am trying to say is that it should have been difficult to focus on the doings of Hal Incandenza, Don Gately, R\u00e9my Marathe and Madame Psychosis. But it wasn\u2019t. I read for hours that way, morning after morning, my mind awhirl. For the first few hundred pages of my initial reading, I will confess that I greatly disliked \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d Why? Jealousy, frustration, impatience. It\u2019s hard to remember exactly why. It wasn\u2019t until I was writing letters to my girlfriend, and describing to her my fellow Peace Corps volunteers and host-family members and long walks home through old Soviet collectivized farmland in what I would categorize as yellow-belt Wallaceian prose, that I realized how completely the book had rewired me. Here is one of the great Wallace innovations: the revelatory power of freakishly thorough noticing, of corralling and controlling detail. Most great prose writers make the real world seem realer \u2014 it\u2019s why we read great prose writers. But Wallace does something weirder, something more astounding: Even when you\u2019re not reading him, he trains you to study the real world through the lens of his prose. Several writers\u2019 names have become adjectivized \u2014 Kafkaesque, Orwellian, Dickensian \u2014 but these are designators of mood, of situation, of civic decay. The Wallaceian is not a description of something external; it describes something that happens ecstatically within, a state of apprehension (in both senses) and understanding. He didn\u2019t name a condition, in other words. He created one.As I learned \u2014 as Wallace\u2019s eager imitators learned \u2014 as Wallace himself learned \u2014 there were limits to the initially limitless-seeming style Wallace helped pioneer in \u201cInfinite Jest.\u201d All great stylists eventually become prisoners of their style and, in a final indignity, find themselves locked up with their acolytes. Wallace avoided this fate. For one, he never finished another novel. For two, he created ever more space between the halves of his career \u2014 the friendly, coruscating essayist and the difficult, hermetically inclined fiction writer \u2014 so that, eventually, there was little to connect them. Another way of saying this is that the essays got even better and funnier \u2014 the funniest since Twain \u2014 while the fiction got even darker and more theoretically severe, even if so much of it was excellent.The last time I saw David Wallace, in the spring of 2008, he successfully affected artistic contentment, which I now know was the antipode of his true feelings. Nevertheless, I came away from our encounter excited about the work that was to come, which he\u2019d briefly alluded to. He\u2019d given us one novel of generational significance; surely he\u2019d write the novel that helped us define what the next century would feel like. Our great loss is that he didn\u2019t. His great gift is that the world remains as Wallaceian as ever \u2014 Donald Trump, meet President Johnny Gentle \u2014 and now we\u2019re all reading his unwritten books in our heads.David, where be your gibes now? Your gambols, your songs \u2014 your flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a roar? They\u2019re in the books, where they\u2019ve always been. Will always be. You have borne us on your back a thousand times. For you, and the joyful, despairing \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d we will roar forever amazed, forever sorrowful, forever grateful. I hope against hope you can hear us.Tom Bissell\u2019s new book is \u201cApostle: Travels Among the Tombs of the Twelve.\u201d This essay is adapted from his foreword to the 20th-anniversary edition of \u201cInfinite Jest,\u201d by David Foster Wallace, which will be published later this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Look Back at the Super Bowl, and Three Reforms That Are Needed Now", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported byT.M.Q. \u2014 Tuesday Morning QuarterbackThere\u2019s a distinction to be made between football, which is in the main a wonderful sport \u2014 the most American of games \u2014 and the National Football League, which is insufferable. Subsidized by taxpayers, rich and arrogant owing to antitrust waivers, caring for naught but power and profit, the N.F.L. couldn\u2019t look worse. The game itself remains fantastic for audiences and, for many high school and college players, a good experience.To understand football\u2019s outsize role in American society, we need to make the distinction between the N.F.L., which has no positive qualities, and the sport, which has many. High school and college football games create civic spirit in a fractious world, help teenagers learn teamwork and self-discipline, and can open the door to college for many who wouldn\u2019t otherwise go.Other sports also create civic spirit and college opportunities, but because football involves so many more people than other sports, its positive impacts loom larger. Focusing on the small number of former professionals who experience cognitive decline is the wrong way to think about the social impact of football. What happens to the very large numbers of youth and high school players \u2014 and how to reform the sport to reduce their risk \u2014 ought to be the first concern.Below I\u2019ll suggest three reforms that could make football less risky right away, aiding mainly children, who form the bulk of the nation\u2019s football players. Never forget that there are roughly 1,500 children \u2014 minors under age 18 \u2014 playing organized football for each one N.F.L. professional.Let me preview those reforms by citing the most important one \u2014 youth tackle football must end. This would drastically reduce neurological risk without diminishing the appeal or quality of the sport in the slightest.Six years ago, your columnist wrote on ESPN.com: \u201cNo one under the age of 12 should play tackle football. The brain case has not finished forming at that age \u2014 pediatric studies show that those under age 12 are far more prone to concussions than those over age 12, and also that head trauma in youth has longer-lasting aftereffects than head trauma after roughly age 16. There\u2019s an emerging theory that many of what manifest as concussions in high school or college actually began as blows to the head in youth football, when the brain and brain case are more vulnerable.\u201dAll research since has backed the conclusion that many sub-concussive hits before middle school age are more dangerous than occasional knockout hits in the N.F.L.It\u2019s the thought I want to leave you with \u2014 do not allow children to play tackle football before middle-school age, and support the outlawing of this mistaken enterprise.A generation ago, it wasn\u2019t known that sub-concussive hits to little children could have lifetime neurological consequences. Now that this is known, youth tackle football must stop. To have huge numbers of young boys, and a few young girls, bashing heads simply cannot be a good idea, especially in a society increasingly based on education. Flag football is just as much fun as tackle, with almost no risk. It\u2019s what those below eighth grade should play; there will be plenty of time to learn how to tackle later.I offer more on neurology and football reform below, plus Super Bowl analysis. And I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this column, which concludes its run at The Upshot.The Manning brothers are 4-2 in the Super Bowl, 22-16 in the postseason.The last five teams with at least 15 regular-season wins did not win Super Bowl \u2014 the 1998 Vikings, 2004 Steelers, 2007 Patriots, 2011 Packers and 2015 Panthers.Those five teams opened a combined 82-4 and then closed a combined 0-5.Defenses ranked first over all are on a 8-1 Super Bowl stretch, which would be 9-0 had Seattle not called a pass at the New England goal line in the closing seconds a year ago.As for politics, 18 of the last 20 Super Bowl winners hailed from states that voted for Barack Obama in 2008. Two of the three most recent Super Bowl winners hail from states where marijuana is legal.The Panthers\u2019 500 regular-season points made Carolina the 16th-highest scoring N.F.L. team. Of that top 16, only four \u2014 the 1994 49ers, the 1998 Broncos, the 1999 Rams and the 2009 Saints \u2014 won the Super Bowl.Why does defense trump offense at the last? T.M.Q. believes this is because trophy games are played at maximum intensity. Up till the Super Bowl, players must hold something in reserve for next week. In the Super Bowl, max crank-up is achieved. Quarterbacks are hit harder, receivers are jammed, tackles are more jarring \u2014 detracting from offense but not from defense.Once these mega-flicks are on shopping-mall screens, viewers will have recently encountered at the movies Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman, Iron Man, Ant-Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Spiderman and Green Lantern, plus the too-many-to-count X Men, plus the Fantastic Four, the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Watchmen.On network prime time there\u2019s the Flash, Supergirl and Green Arrow; on Netflix, Jessica Jones and Daredevil. These television and cinematic figures are backed by auxiliary superheroes including Atom, Falcon, Firestorm, Hawk Girl, Luke Cage and Maria Hill, and there\u2019s a literary version coming of Black Panther, penned by no less than Ta-Nehisi Coates. With all this superpower, it\u2019s a wonder there is still a cat stuck up a tree.CBS just rolled out the less-known superhero J\u2019onn J\u2019onzz, who possesses all of Superman\u2019s powers and can also read minds, shape-shift and teleport through walls. He\u2019s practically omnipotent yet constantly frustrated by failing to achieve his goals. Just like America!Computer animation renders possible the preposterous action associated with superpowers: energy bolts, collapsing skyscrapers, doorways to other dimensions. In \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron,\u201d the supervillain levitated an entire city, in order to \u2014 this was never really explained, which perhaps was just as well.It\u2019s risky to impute symbolism to pop culture. Lovelorn teen vampires, for example, probably tell us more about Hollywood desperation for material than about contemporary sexual mores.To the extent the current superhero profusion means anything, it may be that the United States post-Sept. 11 is a nation keenly concerned with might. Our national sport, football, is the most musclebound game while our favorite entertainment fantasy, superheroes, involves being invincible. Though all superheroes have bad luck in romance: They can do anything except get the girl/guy. Maybe that says something about America, too.Reforms in football as played (mainly banning the deliberate helmet-to-helmet hit) and practiced (fewer contact hours) in addition to how head hits are treated (players no longer sent back into the game or practice) create reason to hope that when today\u2019s football athletes reach Wood\u2019s age, they will experience less cognitive decline.So let\u2019s quit messing around with the spot \u2014 a few years ago the N.F.L. moved the spot from the 30 to the 35 in order to reduce the number of returns \u2014 and eliminate the kickoff.Ever-better kickers sail ever-more kickoffs through the end zone anyway. This year in the conference championship round and Super Bowl, there were 30 kickoffs, 22 of which were touchbacks. Let\u2019s cut out the middleman and make this result automatic. After a field goal or touchdown, the opponent takes possession at its 20-yard line. After a safety, the opponent takes possession at its 35. (The post-safety free-kick spot is 15 yards behind the kickoff spot.)Eliminating the kickoff wouldn\u2019t matter much to reducing N.F.L. head injuries, since already so many kickoffs aren\u2019t run back. But eliminating the kickoff would be a huge progressive reform in high school, where most kickoffs are returned because few teen kickers have enough leg to reach the end zone from the standard spot at the kicking team\u2019s 40-yard line.Prep kickoffs are especially bad news given that special-teams units \u2014 some coaches insist on calling them the \u201csuicide squad\u201d \u2014 are composed of reserves who try to impress by recklessly hurling their bodies. A worst-case result is achieved: Brain trauma (and orthopedic injuries and plain old pain, a neglected consequence of football) happen to the backups who have no chance of a college recruiting boost in the first place.If the N.F.L. eliminated the kickoff, college and high school would follow. Purists would grumble, but purists grumbled about the forward pass. Once the kickoff was gone, no one would miss it. There was a time when basketball staged a center-court jump ball after each field goal. The made-basket jump ball was eliminated, and many decades later the jump ball for simultaneous possession was eliminated by the N.C.A.A. Basketball improved after both changes. Kickoffs belong in the sports museum, next to the jump ball exhibit.Bonus: Eliminating the kickoff would end the television tedium of a touchdown followed by numerous commercials, then a kickoff that goes into the end zone for a touchback, then more commercials.Take a look at linemen on both sides just before the snap. Their heads are pointed at each other\u2019s heads, and at the snap, collide. If hands could not be on the ground, heads would be up at the snap. Helmet-to-helmet collisions would diminish.Today many coaches have offensive linemen place hands on their thighs anyway, since the two-point stance is better for pass-blocking. Defenses once had four players in three-point or four-point stances. Today it\u2019s common for defenses to have most of their front seven standing: The standing stance is needed for the zone-rush schemes that are all the rage.Since the trend is toward hands off the ground anyway, let\u2019s make it official and ban the three- and four-point stances. As a nod to traditionalists, the down stance could be allowed on fourth-down or goal-to-go situations.Speaking in the voice of a medical journal, the Boston University researchers conclude: \u201cThese findings suggest that incurring repeated head impacts during a critical neurodevelopmental period may increase the risk of later-life cognitive impairment. If replicated with larger samples and longitudinal designs, these findings may have implications for safety recommendations for youth sports.\u201dThere are complex arguments about the risk-reward situations for college football players who receive scholarships in return for risk, and for pros who receive large amounts of money and a glamorous lifestyle in return for risk. There is no complexity about the situation at the youth football level. It\u2019s all risk, no benefit, and should be banned.Each team gets five field-goal attempts off a tee \u2014 no one on the field except the kicker \u2014 from the 40-yard line. If both kickers hit the same number, the ball moves back five yards and five more attempts. Repeat until one kicker prevails.A penalty-kicks overtime format would reduce injuries \u2014 it\u2019s exhausting to play a fifth quarter \u2014 while creating the supercharged excitement of a soccer shootout. Plus, finally fans would notice the kickers\u2019 names.Triple names sound literary, especially if with a haunting middle name like Garth Risk Hallberg or Cynthia D\u2019Aprix Sweeney. The foreign policy expert Walter Russell Mead produces outstanding analyses: if everything about his thinking were exactly the same but he went by Wally Mead, he\u2019d be perceived differently. If Jonathan Safran Foer went by Johnny Foer, if Isaac Bashevis Singer had gone by Izzy Singer, if Doris Kearns Goodwin were known as Dotty Goodwin, their reputations would be less even if their work were the same.This is one of the reasons T.M.Q. believes books should be published anonymously \u2014 not to deceive readers about authors\u2019 identities, but to remove same from consideration of the work. After an interval of, say, five years, the author\u2019s name would be revealed. That way readers would respond exclusively to the writing, not to the authors\u2019 reputations, lifestyle, politics or promotional campaigns.Denver defensive coordinator Wade Phillips capped his peripatetic coaching career with a near-perfect game plan. The Broncos shifted linebackers repeatedly, often just before the snap. Danny Trevathan, an inside linebacker, often began the play outside, which seemed to confuse the Cats\u2019 offensive line.Things went downhill for that line when left guard Andrew Norwell departed with an injury in the second half. Cam Newton went from being under pressure to getting pounded, and by the endgame it showed in his tenuous behavior, including his odd leaping away from a loose ball. After leaping away, he simply sat on the ground watching, making no attempt to chase down the Denver players trying to recover the fumble.Twice in the first half, Denver showed a double-overload with three players rushing wide of each offensive tackle. This blitz is nearly impossible to block, but leaves the short middle unguarded. Newton didn\u2019t react to the unguarded middle from this set until the second half, a major missed opportunity for the Cats \u2014 who seemed tight early, dropping passes and missing blocks. Ted Ginn Jr. turned back into a pumpkin, dropping two catchable balls while Newton badly missed him once when he was open deep.Denver\u2019s defense neutralized Carolina\u2019s most important weapon, tight end Greg Olsen, who gained just 41 yards. Olsen was jammed on almost every play, often by the Broncs\u2019 Darian Stewart, who at 5-11 is notably shorter than Olsen. The Panthers did not react by putting Olsen in motion or having him fake blocks for a moment before starting a pattern.Especially puzzling was the absence of design runs by Newton. Denver totally shut down Carolina tailback Jonathan Stewart; when Newton ran, he averaged 7.5 yards per carry. Why did he stand in the pocket exposed to the fierce Broncos rush 51 times (that\u2019s attempts plus sacks and scrambles) but run by design just three times? Denver often showed press corners with just one deep safety, daring Newton to throw. Carolina coaches took the dare but it didn\u2019t work \u2014 Newton runs might have.In the regular season and playoffs, the Broncos appeared in 15 close games \u2014 victory margin a touchdown or less \u2014 while the Panthers appeared in eight close games. Coming into the Super Bowl, Denver had compiled an average scoring margin of 3.8 over opponents, while Carolina posted a 13-point average. This meant the Broncs were accustomed to tense contests decided in the closing minutes while the Cats were accustomed to walkovers. When the Super Bowl reached the fourth quarter with the score close, that favored the Broncos.Tickets also read EXEMPT FROM ALL STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, meaning California taxpayers helped fund the event but realized no revenue on the gate, the N.F.L. keeping whatever premium otherwise would have been expressed as a lower ticket price plus tax.The coin toss was accompanied by the Bay Area Super Bowl stars Marcus Allen, Fred Biletnikoff, Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Jim Plunkett and Steve Young \u2014 nary a lineman to be seen. Harris Barton, Charles Haley, Ted Hendricks, Jesse Sapolu, Art Shell \u2014 Super Bowl-winning seasons of the 49ers and Raiders produced several terrific trench players who are still among us. None were honored as the quarterbacks and ball carriers paraded.Several times the stadium videoboard showed scenes of American soldiers overseas, always to huge cheers. During commercial breaks when the national audience couldn\u2019t hear, the P.A. played the Jimi Hendrix version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and the David Bowie song \u201cRebel Rebel,\u201d whose lyrics include, \u201cShe\u2019s not sure if you\u2019re a boy or a girl.\u201d Then during the halftime show the crowd \u2014 holding up colored cards whose purpose was not announced in advance \u2014 formed a rainbow with a heart, the Super Bowl apparently symbolically endorsing gay rights. Only the N.F.L. could combine gyrating pop stars, combat aircraft flyovers, public subsidies, brutal physical contact and endorsement of gay marriage into the most-watched event of the year.Since Carolina\u2019s goose was cooked at 2:08, Ron Rivera\u2019s consequential kicking decision was the failure to perform an onside kick after pulling to 16-10 with 10 minutes remaining. Because the Denver offense was sputtering, there was little risk in not recovering the onside kick, while getting the ball right back would have created a chance to seize the momentum of the contest.An earlier version of this article misstated the combined number of teams from California, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania to be among the last 40 Super Bowl entrants. The number is seven, not five.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Aims for Family-Friendly Nostalgia With New Slate", "Date": "2016-02-25", "News": "Supported byOver the last couple of years, as Netflix has crashed the gates of the television industry, the service has aimed to attract all age groups. It created adult-oriented dramas like \u201cNarcos\u201d and \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d developed more than two dozen original series for children and started a comedy, \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d starring four actors in their 70s.Now, Netflix is prepared to go after another audience, one that it says has been forgotten and abandoned by traditional television networks: families.As prominent family-friendly programming blocks like ABC\u2019s \u201cT.G.I.F.,\u201d faded into oblivion and gave way to reality shows, \u201cit left a significant hole in the market,\u201d said Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, one he said his service was seeking to fill.At a time when there is more television than ever \u2014 there were 412 original scripted series last year, more than double the number seven years ago \u2014 Netflix is spending with abandon, both domestically and internationally.About 18 months ago, Netflix began to develop and invest in the kind of programming that is \u201cexciting to younger adults and more than tolerable for adults,\u201d Mr. Sarandos said. It has at least six new family-oriented shows poised to hit the service by the end of 2017, including yet another revival of a fan favorite (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) and an animated series, \u201cTrollhunters,\u201d created by the filmmaker Guillermo del Toro.Ms. Holland said Netflix decided to go all-in after taking a look at rival networks\u2019 programming and surveying trends on its own service. She said family-friendly fare from the 1980s like \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and \u201cHoney, I Shrunk the Kids\u201d was getting a strong response on Netflix.\u201cWe do see movies taking more of a front seat on the weekend and those family films climbing up the \u2018top list\u2019 ladder,\u201d Ms. Holland said. \u201cOur conclusion was families are looking for things to watch together when they\u2019re home.\u201dEven though there are more shows than ever, the sort of family-first programming that used to dominate network lineups has become increasingly elusive. (There are exceptions, including ABC comedies like \u201cModern Family,\u201d \u201cBlack-ish\u201d and \u201cFresh Off the Boat.\u201d)\u201cThere used to be the family hour,\u201d said Preston Beckman, a former network executive at NBC and Fox. \u201cYou had family-friendly programming at 8 to 9, or 7 to 9 on Sundays. Is there less of that? There\u2019s less of that on the big channels. It\u2019s rarer, and it\u2019s rarer that families sit down and watch anything together.\u201dMs. Holland said she thought this was partly because of the growth of darker dramas and unconventional comedies, as well as the rising number of cable networks. As that has occurred, family viewing has been increasingly limited to sports, reality competition shows like \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cSurvivor\u201d and live musical events like \u201cGrease: Live!\u201d and \u201cThe Wiz Live!\u201d\u201cThe proliferation of cable channels really led to niche specialization,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of a channel the whole family can watch, you saw the advent of a whole series of channels for each member of the household individually.\u201dNetflix is kicking off its new family slate this week with the reboot of \u201cFull House,\u201d the popular, syrupy comedy from the late 1980s and 1990s. \u201cFuller House,\u201d which stars many of the actors from the original series, takes the first iteration of the sitcom and flips it around: Instead of three men (including a widower) raising three girls in San Francisco, three women (including a widow) raise three children in the same house they grew up in.\u201cIt\u2019s made to be shared by families, and not necessarily by the media elite,\u201d Ms. Holland countered.Regardless, Netflix is convinced the family-friendly strategy will work for its 75 million subscribers worldwide, and it says user surveys suggest that families will watch the shows together.Netflix is also developing \u201cHaters Back Off,\u201d a show starring the popular YouTube character Miranda Sings, created by Colleen Ballinger-Evans; a revival of the old animated series \u201cVoltron\u201d; an animated series, \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d based on the Dr. Seuss book; and \u201cStranger Things,\u201d starring Winona Ryder, which Ms. Holland likened to the 1980s movie \u201cStand by Me\u201d with an added supernatural element.And if a lot of the programs tend to be inspired by or directly lifted from movies and TV shows from the 1980s and 1990s, providing that sort of catnip to Generation X viewers is not exactly an accident.\u201cThere\u2019s a little element of nostalgia at play in gaining parents\u2019 interest,\u201d Ms. Holland said. \u201cIt\u2019s also thematically the kind of programming that was made of the time. Parents are searching for the evolution of that and the 2016 version of that kind of programming. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to provide.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Privacy Fight Tests Relationship With White House", "Date": "2016-02-26", "News": "Supported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, was relentless during a private meeting of tech giants and President Obama\u2019s top national security officials last month. Encrypted devices like the iPhone are here to stay, he insisted. Law enforcement needs to find a way to do its job in a new world.James B. Comey Jr., the director of the F.B.I., and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch pushed back, but Mr. Cook stood firm, several participants said.\u201cWith all due respect,\u201d Mr. Cook told those around the table, including Mr. Obama\u2019s counterterrorism chief and the heads of the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security, \u201cI think there has been a lack of leadership in the White House on this.\u201dDenis R. McDonough, the president\u2019s chief of staff, took exception and said so. Law enforcement officials described him as stung by what they called Mr. Cook\u2019s \u201crant,\u201d although tech executives in the room insisted that Apple\u2019s chief executive was respectful.Either way, what started as a cordial two-hour discussion about combating Islamic extremism ended with the White House and Mr. Cook agreeing to disagree \u2014 foreshadowing a bitter battle between a president long enamored of Apple products and Silicon Valley and a tech titan who has spoken enthusiastically of Mr. Obama.Although the president and Mr. Cook are not personal friends, associates say they have developed a relationship of professional admiration and mutual self-interest. At the least, the two share similar traits: discipline, a cerebral nature and impatience with office drama. Now they find themselves in roles no one ever imagined, as the central antagonists in the raging debate between personal privacy and the nation\u2019s security.By refusing demands from Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to help unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists, Mr. Cook has become the leading voice in Silicon Valley for encryption. By voicing strong support for his F.B.I., Mr. Obama is now the effective chief prosecutor of the administration\u2019s case for allowing law enforcement to penetrate iPhones.If Apple had more of a presence in Washington, as do Google, Facebook and Microsoft, technology executives say there is a chance the dispute might have been quietly resolved. But few top Apple veterans have moved through the revolving door that has brought engineers and executives from other technology companies to the Obama White House to serve in a variety of security, technology and scientific positions. Apple\u2019s lobbying budget in Washington is far smaller than its competitors\u2019.\u201cI have not talked to the president. I will talk to the president,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview with ABC News last week, a day before his company filed legal papers opposing the government. Mr. Cook said he planned to ask Mr. Obama \u201cfor his help in getting this on a better path.\u201dAn Apple spokesman said he had no idea when such a call might happen, and White House officials offered no indication that Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook were scheduled to talk anytime soon.It is unclear when Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook first met, but in the four years since Mr. Cook succeeded Steven P. Jobs as Apple\u2019s chief executive, he has visited the White House at least a half-dozen times.In the summer of 2013, soon after Edward J. Snowden revealed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs, Mr. Cook joined 16 other technology executives and privacy advocates for a grievance session with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room. Two participants said Mr. Cook told the president that the Snowden revelations had led people to believe that Apple was helping the government spy on Americans.The exchange was an early indication of the tensions with the White House that would eventually develop.\u201cHe was concerned about the misperception in the public about the extent to which Apple was cooperating,\u201d recalled Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor and privacy activist, who was also at the meeting.Four months later, Mr. Cook attended another meeting with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room on a similar topic. The following year, in December 2014, White House visitor logs show that Mr. Cook spent two days in the West Wing, where he met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office and shared a meal in the White House mess with John D. Podesta, who was then counselor to Mr. Obama as well as the president\u2019s environmental czar.In September 2015, Mr. Cook was again at the White House, where he had a prime seat at the state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China.Current and former White House officials say Mr. Obama appreciated the attention that Mr. Cook brought to issues like immigration, gay marriage and climate change. When Mr. Obama solicited Apple and other companies to support his ConnectED program for technology in schools, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to pledge $100 million worth of iPads and MacBooks, calling it \u201can enormous commitment.\u201dThere were also tensions. White House officials were not happy about Apple\u2019s decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and have repeatedly pressed Mr. Cook to explain the company\u2019s need to build its blockbuster products in China rather than in the United States.But the encryption debate, and the government\u2019s legal action against Apple last week, are testing the relationship with the company more than any other.\u201cA company thinks very hard before it defies the government,\u201d said Nicole Wong, who was Google\u2019s lead lawyer when Google resisted a Justice Department request for user data. But if a disagreement happens, \u201cit\u2019s not bad for this policy conversation to happen transparently in a court proceeding.\u201dAt the same time, there was a growing alliance between this White House and Silicon Valley. Although other presidents have looked to the valley\u2019s innovators and venture capitalists for money, political support and ideas, this administration has wooed tech executives in far greater numbers.

Short of a patient in a dentist\u2019s chair, it\u2019s hard to find a more captive audience than airline passengers.\u201cIt was a little bit of a surprise to us, early on, how much time people spent shopping,\u201d he said.Airlines are counting on nimbler technology and faster, more reliable Wi-Fi in the air to deliver virtual catalogs, promotions and a host of goods and services.They are betting that passengers will warm to the idea of browsing via the seat-back entertainment console or their own devices at cruising altitude \u2014 and are counting on getting a piece of what GuestLogix, a travel retailing technology company, says is a $5 billion annual business, either directly or through affiliate programs.\u201cWhere we\u2019re starting to see this is in the airlines that have made the big investments in in-flight Wi-Fi,\u201d said Michael Reyes, director of customer centricity at Sabre Airline Solutions.\u201cThey\u2019ve always been chasing ways to find new revenues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big difference now is the connectivity. They can have a lot more data piped up to the plane.\u201dThe onboard retail market is growing at a 13 percent rate, year over year, according to Craig Proud, senior vice president for platform at GuestLogix.\u201cThe technology is there,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on our experience, the market opportunity is still really huge, but merchandising is the key to success.\u201dIn November, LSG Sky Chefs, an airline catering company and a division of Lufthansa Group, acquired one of its partners, the Irish technology company Retail inMotion, to help it expand into what it called the \u201cincreasingly important onboard retail business.\u201d In a release, LSG Sky Chefs said its intention was to sell passengers everything from merchandise to tickets for events or attractions at the flight\u2019s destination.\u201cWe see the growth rate much bigger than the growth of passengers,\u201d said Stefan Patermann, Retail inMotion\u2019s chief commercial officer, estimating the onboard retail market in Europe alone to be worth about 1 billion euros, or about $1.09 billion, a year.Analysts say this evolution was only a matter of time: The unbundling of services and amenities like food and preferred seats in coach cabins made the buy-on-board retail model standard. At the same time, a fast, unbroken Wi-Fi connection eases onboard shopping and allows airlines to process credit card transactions in real time.\u201cCarriers are finding more ways to push more offers through that technology,\u201d said Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant.What airlines see as a new revenue stream, though, some travelers see as an irritant, especially in a market in which airlines are already earning eye-popping profits.\u201cEverybody\u2019s pushing retail at you,\u201d said James Condon, a consultant who lives in the Washington area and travels frequently for work. He said that marketing seemed heaviest on international flights, where the airline\u2019s window of time to make pitches to customers is longest.\u201cWe\u2019re always looking for bespoke and unique products that are exclusive to Virgin Atlantic,\u201d a representative for that airline said via email.Late last year, JetBlue teamed up with Amazon to make Amazon\u2019s library of media available to Prime members as well as to passengers who sign up for a free trial or a subscription to the service, which a surprising number do.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very high uptake of Amazon Prime from people who were not previously Prime,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cIt seems that the carrot of free video streaming onboard is quite an attractive one.\u201dThe airline also has promoted a sweepstakes that passengers enter by signing up for J. Crew\u2019s mailing list, and giveaways from Dunkin\u2019 Donuts for joining the chain\u2019s loyalty program through JetBlue\u2019s platform. By the middle of this year, Mr. Perry said, JetBlue hopes to let members of its frequent-flier program earn loyalty points when they shop on Amazon in flight.Unlike most other airlines, JetBlue offers its basic Wi-Fi free. (Passengers can pay for more speed.) The carrier calculates that its investment will pay off in the long run as more people browse and buy items or subscribe to services, effectively subsidizing the Wi-Fi and earning JetBlue extra revenue.\u201cOnce you have a free model, essentially what you\u2019re monetizing is eyeballs,\u201d Mr. Perry said.Abby Lunardini, vice president for brand marketing and communications at Virgin America, said that a technology upgrade the carrier began last year would let it offer an array of goods and services, along with promotions for media and entertainment providers like Netflix and Spotify.\u201cIt certainly opens up a whole new range of possibilities,\u201d she said, adding that Virgin America wanted to make its offers in an unobtrusive way. For travelers like Mr. Condon, anything that makes the in-flight offers less obtrusive would be an improvement. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s annoying,\u201d he said. \u201cEssentially, they\u2019ve taken the SkyMall catalog and put it in electronic format.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The second, a little cloying. The third, the fourth\u2026 something is off. Maybe the recipe has changed, or you have. \u201cFuller House\u201d begins as a sitcom family reunion. It becomes a self-conscious, dated and maudlin reminder of the ceaseless march of time and your inevitable demise.The premiere is a 35-minute frog-march down memory lane. The studio audience goes wild when John Stamos and Lori Loughlin take the stage and Dave Coulier dusts off his catchphrase \u201cCut\u2014it\u2014out!\u201d Not returning are Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen; when someone mentions Michelle (the youngest sister, whom they played together), the cast turns and glares through the fourth wall.Mr. Stamos reprises \u201cForever,\u201d his character\u2019s wedding song. The theme song returns, twice: once in original form, once belted by Carly Rae Jepsen over footage of the characters today and a generation ago. The same split-screen device returns at the episode\u2019s end, which recreates a scene from the original series. It\u2019s not so much a pilot as a premature In Memoriam reel.But the episode also has to set up a series, as the older characters shuffle off and the middle sister, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and wacky neighbor Kimmy Gibbler (Andrea Barber) move in to help D. J. Kimmy has a sassy daughter (Soni Nicole Bringas) and an ex-husband (Juan Pablo Di Pace), an excruciating Latin-lover caricature who still pines for \u201cKimberlina, mi amor.\u201d (Ms. Barber herself is a bright spot, playing Kimmy big and to the cheap seats.) D. J.\u2019s middle son, Max (Elias Harger), has his own catchphrase \u2014 \u201cHoly chalupas!\u201d \u2014 and the show works so hard to cutesify him that at one point it actually buries him in puppies.So your personal experience of \u201cFuller House\u201d will depend on how it interacts with your memories. If you loved \u201cFull House,\u201d I can no more review this experience for you than I could your first kiss (a little sloppy) or your grandmother\u2019s cookies (raisins, really?).But you\u2019ll have to adjust to the major change to \u201cFuller House\u201d: its shiny new coat of cringe-making innuendo. Do you want to know that Kimmy Gibbler is now an expert in the ways of the Kama Sutra? Forget I said anything, then. An online-dating-mistaken-identity plot, in which D.

Or without them.Then again, it\u2019s not entirely clear who the audience is meant to be for the new \u201cFuller House.\u201d Are grown-up fans watching with their kids?

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Better Call Saul,\u2019 Quirky and Absorbing in Season Opener", "Date": "2016-02-14", "News": "Supported byThe song is a curious choice, because \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d does anything but let time slip away. It grabs on to it, jumping backward to 2002, when Saul was Jimmy McGill, a small-time con artist trying to go straight as an attorney in Albuquerque. It slows time down, stretches out key moments like taffy, as if Saul, in his sugar-glazed prison, were holding his past up to the light, trying to find the exact spot where everything went wrong.Season 1 made Jimmy into both a sleazebag and a hero, trying to parlay the flimflam skills he picked up as a onetime street hustler (they called him Slippin\u2019 Jimmy, for a fake-accident scam he favored) into a straight career in the courtroom. Despite resistance \u2014 not least from his judgmental older brother, Chuck (Michael McKean), an accomplished lawyer turned shut-in \u2014 he managed to do his weasel work for good, blowing open a case of fraud at a senior citizens\u2019 home.Is Jimmy a good guy overcoming bad tendencies, or a bad guy who\u2019s fooling himself? The opening of Season 2 slyly raises that introspective theme, as the protagonist\u2019s face is reflected in a mirror on a Cinnabon employee-motivation sign. It asks, \u201cWould you want this person to serve you?\u201dEven in triumph, he can\u2019t shake the feeling that he will always be Slippin\u2019 Jimmy.Now, he\u2019s weighing a job offer from the head of a top Santa Fe law firm (Ed Begley Jr.) against the feeling that going back to the hustler\u2019s life would be easier, more comfortable and more true to himself. As he says to his colleague and sometime sex buddy Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn): \u201cPeople tell me how they see me. And it\u2019s not as a lawyer.\u201dThe line implicates the audience, too: We half want Jimmy\u2019s better self to win out, half want to be entertained by his palaver-spewing Saul side. \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d is a more fun, picaresque show than \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d but it\u2019s every bit as moral, a travelogue of the smooth-paved desert road to perdition.The show has a con man\u2019s view of human nature: People are easy marks, because they\u2019re greedy and willing to take shortcuts. It\u2019s full of crooks next door, including a headset-wearing, stock-trading jackass whom Jimmy swindles and a pharmaceutical employee selling meds on the black market.The most powerful story of everyday moral failing in Season 1 came in the episode \u201cFive-O,\u201d focused on Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a laconic piece of gristle who will later become Saul Goodman\u2019s hired gun. (Jimmy meets him as a cranky parking lot attendant who moonlights as freelance muscle.) The episode flashed back to Mike\u2019s days as a Philadelphia policeman, when he persuaded his son, also a cop, to take a bribe rather than blow the whistle on corrupt officers. The dirty cops killed Mike\u2019s son anyway, and Mike realized, wrenchingly, that his advice cost his child\u2019s life and soul: \u201cI broke my boy.\u201dThe experience changed Mike, who is oddly the series\u2019 moral center: He does his job, however dirty, but he doesn\u2019t steal or double dip. His rigidity is as much a survival mechanism as Jimmy\u2019s bubble-gum pliability. \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d makes the most of Mr. Banks\u2019s rough dignity, just as it brings out the pathos that underlay Mr. Odenkirk\u2019s verbal tap-dancing in \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d (Ms. Seehorn also has a big role in the new season, as the no-nonsense foil who prods Jimmy to be better than he thinks he is.)Though \u201cSaul\u201d is a cable series, its pacing is reminiscent of a Netflix show, parceling out plot slowly. But it feels confident rather than meandering, full rather than dull. When it lets scenes play out at length, it allows space to show how a con is played or a lie falls apart. Of all the assets it shares with \u201cBreaking Bad \u2014 the visual playfulness, the A-bomb-bright New Mexico exteriors \u2014 the greatest is its ability to suspend time.\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d could have simply cashed in quick, giving a curtain call to the glib fan favorite Saul from \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d Instead, it took the risk of taking Jimmy McGill seriously. Like Jimmy, Mr. Gilligan and Mr. Gould know an opportunity when they\u2019re handed one. Unlike him, they don\u2019t seem inclined to screw it up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pee-wee\u2019s Big Comeback", "Date": "2016-02-10", "News": "FeatureAfter disappearing for nearly three decades, Paul Reubens\u2019s subversive alter ego returns \u2014 and seems more radical than ever.Supported byWe began our Walgreens tour in the vast liquor department, moving from there to its cosmetics aisles, where he took great pleasure in showing me that, in order to see the prices, you had to raise hinged cardboard panels, as if you were reading an enormous children\u2019s flap book. We lingered at a display devoted to \u2018\u2018As Seen on TV\u2019\u2019 products, by far the most Pee-wee-ish part of the store. There were trompe l\u2019oeil stretch pants made to resemble denim. There were fitted slip-on garments called Sleevey Wonders, designed for those who wished to wear sleeveless dresses while covering their arms. Reubens read aloud from another box with glee: \u2018\u2018Suzanne Somers\u2019s 3-Way Poncho!\u2019\u2019 The three ways were \u2018\u2018professional,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018casual\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018dressy.\u2019\u2019 At the Walgreens, it turned out, magic was everywhere.Reubens drifted away from Wound Care and arrived at a rack of tourist junk: Walk of Fame shot glasses; vinyl Clippers purses. He considered these, then nodded upward, toward the fluorescent lights. \u2018\u2018There are apartments upstairs \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be amazing to live here?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019d never have to leave.\u2019\u2019Rewatching old episodes of \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 affirms Pee-wee\u2019s comic resilience. Reubens was ahead of his time in his breezily progressive handling of identity politics, which dominate the comedy we consider most relevant today, though his strategies were vastly different. On contemporary hits like, say, \u2018\u2018Broad City\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Transparent,\u2019\u2019 gender norms are explicitly and unapologetically assailed, whereas on \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 the sabotage was largely implicit. Because the show\u2019s more radical elements were refracted through \u2014 and secreted within \u2014 an upbeat, candy-colored atmosphere, \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 could be consumed and adored not only by those who \u2018\u2018got it\u2019\u2019 but also by \u2018\u2018squares\u2019\u2019 (not to mention their children, whom Pee-wee indoctrinated into a cult of extreme acceptance). Judd Apatow, who helped to shepherd \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 into production, identifies this spirit, along with the ingenuity of Reubens\u2019s performance, as central to what he sees as Pee-wee\u2019s evergreen appeal, and to a new movie\u2019s viability. \u2018\u2018When I was younger, I didn\u2019t put my finger on why I liked Pee-wee so much \u2014 it just made me laugh,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018But looking back, it\u2019s a group of strange people who are having a great time and being really nice to each other, and as a slightly weird kid I must have understood that. I liked watching someone so different whom the audience loved. The idea that unique people were getting applause, that the crowd was going crazy for Pee-wee, made me feel you didn\u2019t have to be the football-team quarterback.\u2019\u2019Reubens has been plotting Pee-wee\u2019s big comeback for years. He wrote several scripts, appeared as Pee-wee in stray television cameos and amassed nearly two million Twitter fol\u00adlowers, for whom he posts pictures of gold-plated Slinkys and sleeping bags that resemble pizza. The most important step in this plan was the hit \u2018\u2018Pee-wee Herman Show,\u2019\u2019 a stage production that Reubens mounted in Los Angeles in 2010, which led to a 10-week Broadway incarnation later that year. Reubens intended for these shows to drum up movie interest, and they did: Apatow saw a Los Angeles performance, and soon afterward he and Reubens formed a partnership.Nonetheless, Reubens\u2019s desire to return remains in some tension with his bunker mentality \u2014 from the start, Pee-wee offered Reubens a way to transform into, and armor himself within, his own ventriloquist dummy; when Pee-wee grew popular enough to attract interviewers, Reubens often insisted on receiving them in character, and in the credits for Pee-wee projects the character was listed as played by \u2018\u2018Himself.\u2019\u2019 The reason for this self-erasure, he explains, was that Pee-wee worked better if audiences believed he might be real, but the feint also let Reubens hide in plain sight. Between seasons of \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 \u2014 by which point Pee-wee had hosted \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019\u2019 appeared on the covers of Rolling Stone and Life and released ubiquitous merchandise (T-shirts, action figures, magnets, windsocks) plastered with his face \u2014 Reubens took to growing his hair and wearing a goatee to go incognito: Peter Pan turned bus-stop drifter. \u2018\u2018I once went up to Steve Martin, whom I knew fairly well by that point, and said, \u2018Hey, Steve!\u2019 and he had no idea who I was,\u2019\u2019 Reubens recalls. \u2018\u2018Finally he said, \u2018Wow, you\u2019re really lucky \u2014 you can go around unrecognized.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Which made what came next feel all the more catastrophic. In July 1991, police arrested Reubens at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, where he was visiting his parents, and charged him with indecent exposure. The media, titillated as ever by the gap between public image and private behavior, seized on Reubens\u2019s distinctly un-Pee-wee-ish mug shot: the stringy hair, scruffy chin and white gym shirt of his off-set disguise. The arrest\u2019s afterlife, in tabloids and late-night monologues, was toxic, and even though Reubens had already ceased production on \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 (he says he intended a break from show business), CBS killed the final weeks of reruns, adding to the sense that the scandal torpedoed his career. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have any feeling about it at all that I want to share,\u2019\u2019 he told me when I brought up the arrest. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t really think about it \u2014 or I try not to.\u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018The only thing I\u2019ll say is that it was stupid not to do anything. I never spoke out. I just went and hid, and in hindsight \u2014 I mean, that was my true response, but I don\u2019t think it was smart \u2014 if I had to do it over again, I would figure out a way to get out there, talk about it, take control of it.\u2019\u2019 When he disappeared, he took Pee-wee with him, camping out for a time at the New Jersey estate of the billionaire tobacco heiress Doris Duke, whom he\u2019d befriended, and in the Hollywood Hills, among his funny things. (He has always denied the charges and entered a plea of no contest at the time to avoid trial.)\u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 represents, on some level, Reubens\u2019s attempt to refigure the events of 1991 once and for all as a mere footnote in Pee-wee\u2019s story, rather than its deflating coda. \u2018\u2018Part of the reason why I wanted to come back,\u2019\u2019 he says, \u2018\u2018is that I didn\u2019t have a real good ending to my career.\u2019\u2019 In the years since, he has delivered acclaimed supporting performances \u2014 in the \u2018\u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019\u2019 movie, \u2018\u2018Murphy Brown,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u201830 Rock\u2019\u2019 and Ted Demme\u2019s \u2018\u2018Blow,\u2019\u2019 among other projects \u2014 but such work has felt minor compared with what he accomplished with Pee-wee, and a whiff of exile, self-imposed or otherwise, has long clung to Reubens. \u2018\u2018To be honest, there have been times when I\u2019ve had a foot out of the business altogether, with no plans of continuing,\u2019\u2019 he says.Paul Reubens as a high-school student in 1967.That somebody turned out to be Netflix. The production arm of the content-streaming service has become a reliable home for well-pedigreed comedy reboots \u2014 like \u2018\u2018Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp,\u2019\u2019 the fourth season of \u2018\u2018Arrested Development\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018W/ Bob & David\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that might seem too offbeat for more traditional avenues of backing and distribution. The company remains relatively unproven in the feature-film category, however; John Lee, the director of \u2018\u2018Big Holiday,\u2019\u2019 surmises that it was partly for this reason that Netflix approved a budget of just under $30 million, on par with comedy budgets at big studios. \u2018\u2018They wanted to be sure that they weren\u2019t cheap,\u2019\u2019 Lee jokes. (A burly, 30ish guy, Lee grew up a Pee-wee fan and was a creator of the mid-aughts MTV comedy \u2018\u2018Wonder Showzen,\u2019\u2019 a demented mock children\u2019s show \u2014 far darker in its humor than \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 but with some Pee-wee in its DNA all the same.)The movie they made is of a piece with other Pee-wee projects, each of which takes place in a world distinct from the others. In \u2018\u2018Big Adventure,\u2019\u2019 Pee-wee lives in a suburban town and loves his bicycle; in \u2018\u2018Big-Top Pee-wee,\u2019\u2019 he\u2019s a farmer in rural nowhere; in \u2018\u2018Playhouse,\u2019\u2019 he inhabits a fantastical realm called Puppetland. The premise of \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 is that Pee-wee, having suffered some unspecified trauma earlier in life, refuses to leave his hometown, where everyone knows and likes him. And yet he also feels inarticulably different from his fellow townspeople and yearns to escape. Pee-wee\u2019s stifled urge to bust out is drama\u00adtized in a wonderfully bizarre opening dream sequence featuring a naked alien with six moist nostrils, and is ignited in his waking life when a motorcycle-riding hunk \u2014 the actor Joe Manganiello, from \u2018\u2018True Blood\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Magic Mike\u2019\u2019\u2014 rolls through town and inspires Pee-wee to embark on a cross-country pilgrimage. (If you wish to trace parallels here with the traumas, retrenchments and re-emergences in Reubens\u2019s career, they are available, but not belabored.)Production on \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 lasted 36 days. Last July, Reubens joined Lee and his editor, Jeff Buchanan, to fine-tune the scene in which Joe and Pee-wee first meet, at a diner. The two men bond over their shared fixation with the same uncommon candy (root-beer barrels), and Pee-wee makes Manganiello a milkshake. Decades in, Reubens retains his masterful, almost perverse, sense of comic timing. He distends certain beats you expect to whiz by, accelerates others you expect to linger and exerts precise control over his outsize character; his motions are clipped but surge with weird, spastic joy, and in the diner scene he makes a process as mundane as pouring milk over ice cream riveting. \u2018\u2018We trimmed down the shake-making,\u2019\u2019 Lee told Reubens after the scene played through. \u2018\u2018You thought it was a little long. And we leaned on the two-shot more when you and Joe are in sync.\u2019\u2019 Reubens told me that the root-beer-barrel motif is set up early in the movie: \u2018\u2018It\u2019s Pee-wee\u2019s favorite candy, and he has a little red-and-white straw that goes into the barrel. Then there\u2019s a red-and-white straw I put in the milkshake in this scene. Then later there\u2019s a dream sequence where Joe and I are jousting and our poles look like the straws.\u2019\u2019The context for such winks and nudges has always been an air of childlike innocence and a storybooklike narrative economy. Like \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 and its road-trip premise, \u2018\u2018Big Adventure\u2019\u2019 needed no plot machinery more elaborate than a nation-spanning hunt for a stolen bike; entire episodes of \u2018\u2018Playhouse\u2019\u2019 rested on premises as wispy as \u2018\u2018It\u2019s raining.\u2019\u2019 For Reubens, plots are excuses to pile up gags and set pieces. In his most famous moment, from \u2018\u2018Big Adventure,\u2019\u2019 Pee-wee, in platform shoes, dances with manic verve to \u2018\u2018Tequila\u2019\u2019 in a motorcycle bar. The scene\u2019s subtextual purpose, to the extent it has one, is to ratchet up and then dissolve the tension between dainty Pee-wee and the macho bikers: It barely registers that the sequence serves zero narrative function.As Lee and Buchanan examined \u2018\u2018Holiday\u2019\u2019 footage, a skin-colored strip of fabric was visible on the back of Reubens\u2019s neck; it was something like a tiny girdle, tugging excess flesh back from his sexagenarian jawline. This would eventually vanish in postproduction, thanks to digital retouchers whom Reubens had hired to pore over the film frame by frame. \u2018\u2018I feel I\u2019m too old to be in a Pee-wee Herman movie without that,\u2019\u2019 he explained. \u2018\u2018Pee-wee doesn\u2019t work, to me, with age mixed into it. So I knew I wanted digital retouching, and that was my biggest concern from the get-go, with Judd, when it came to budgeting, because it costs a fortune. I could have had a face-lift and we would have saved two million dollars.\u2019\u2019If Reubens often seems like a man out of time \u2014 his close association with the \u201980s; the way that, despite owning an iPhone, he still records personal reminders on Post-it Notes stuffed into his wallet \u2014 his age is a surprisingly poignant element of the new movie, and he was without vanity in discussing it. \u2018\u2018We\u2019re looking at so many images of myself on a giant screen and fixing them, and it\u2019s a buzzkill,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not as limber as I was, I\u2019m not as skinny, I don\u2019t have that energy, I don\u2019t have that body.\u2019\u2019 He said that, when pitching the movie, he \u2018\u2018was constantly saying, Get Michael Cera in here to be Pee-wee. Do what they did with \u201821 Jump Street\u2019 and cast Jonah Hill instead of Johnny Depp.\u2019\u2019In the end, software intervened. Reubens called digital retouching \u2018\u2018a huge secret in Hollywood. People aren\u2019t really aware that stars have secret riders in their contracts\u2019\u2019 stipulating that money will be devoted to preserving their youthful appearances with computers. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going to be forced to talk about it\u2019\u2019 in television appearances promoting the film, Reubens said, because \u2018\u2018Pee-wee\u2019s not older in the movie, but I am.\u2019\u2019 Lee agreed: \u2018\u2018I think it would be weird to ignore it. It\u2019s the elephant in the room.\u2019\u2019Reubens considered this and grimaced. \u2018\u2018One of the elephants.\u2019\u2019Reubens\u2019s focus, from youth, has been on performance. His high-school history teacher, Lou Ann Palmer, recalled for me his \u2018\u2018phenomenal\u2019\u2019 turn as Nathan Detroit in a school production of \u2018\u2018Guys and Dolls\u2019\u2019 \u2014 evidence of a theatrical streak that carried into the classroom. \u2018\u2018I wouldn\u2019t call him a class clown; he was a comic,\u2019\u2019 Palmer says. \u2018\u2018He would plan tricks and make the other kids laugh \u2014 not at him but with him. I loved it. Who laughs in history class?\u2019\u2019 In addition to school musicals, Reubens performed in local theater, studied trapeze at circus camp, volunteered at the art museum and was a television fiend: Pee-wee descends from Captain Kangaroo, Pinky Lee, Howdy Doody and Rocky & Bullwinkle.Pee-wee also owes debts to experimental theater, cabaret and the conceptual prankishness of the artist Allan Kaprow, whose Happenings Reubens discovered in the early 1970s when he enrolled in the theater program at California Institute of the Arts, where Kaprow taught. One of Reubens\u2019s friends there was Michael Richards, who went on to play Kramer on \u2018\u2018Seinfeld.\u2019\u2019 Richards described the prevailing spirit at CalArts \u2014 where the faculty included artists like John Baldessari and Alison Knowles \u2014 as one of fecund transgression. \u2018\u2018On my very first day,\u2019\u2019 Richards says, \u2018\u2018as an introduction to the faculty, there was a pool party, and everyone was naked. What school do you go to and see that kind of liberation?\u2019\u2019 He recalls Reubens\u2019s seriousness when it came to doing character work. \u2018\u2018There was a student film where Paul wanted me to play his husband, and he played the wife and wore a dress. His performance wasn\u2019t pushed, it wasn\u2019t broad \u2014 he committed to it. He and I would talk about how a character\u2019s doing you, you\u2019re not doing the character.\u2019\u2019After graduation, Reubens changed his surname and rented an apartment in Echo Park, on the east side of Los Angeles. He conceived of Pee-wee as a jittery, joke-botching idiot savant, and his other creations at the Groundlings were similarly so-bad-they\u2019re-good entertainers. Among these were the \u2018\u2018syndicated Jewish cartoonist\u2019\u2019 Moses Feldman, the Native American lounge act Jay Longtoe (the racial insensitivity of which Reubens came to regret) and a hokey sound-effects team named the Fabulous Betty and Eddy, whom Reubens developed with his fellow improviser Charlotte McGinnis: They mimicked leaky faucets and delivered dialogue in the style of old commercials.\u2018\u2018We all grew up with so much cheesy variety on television, and when we got into our 20s we said, Oh, my God, there\u2019s nothing organic happening here,\u2019\u2019 says Phyllis Katz, of the Groundlings. \u2018\u2018We started making fun of it.\u2019\u2019 She recalls Reubens coming up with Pee-wee Herman in one of her classes, before developing the character further with the troupe\u2019s founder, Gary Austin, who crucially lent Reubens his glen-plaid suit. \u2018\u2018Pee-wee sort of seemed like a gimmick, and that\u2019s what I was looking for,\u2019\u2019 Reubens says. \u2018\u2018A simple thing to hang a bunch of stuff on.\u2019\u2019 Pee-wee was an instant hit with audiences, and Reubens ditched his other characters; this, he says, angered his friend and fellow Groundling Phil Hartman, who was a writer on \u2018\u2018Big Adventure\u2019\u2019 and an actor on \u2018\u2018Playhouse,\u2019\u2019 and whose career, through \u2018\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\u2019 in the \u201990s, featured an army of personas. Hartman, Reubens recalls, thought he was bowing to crass careerism and squandering his gifts. \u2018\u2018He hated that I was drilling into one character,\u2019\u2019 Reubens says. Katz says that Reubens, \u2018\u2018unlike many of us, understood business. Getting your ducks in a row. He had head shots made for Pee-wee before anyone knew who he was!\u2019\u2019In the early days of Pee-wee, Reubens built a stage show at the Roxy that eventually attracted the attention of HBO, which broadcast a Pee-wee special in 1981. (The 2010 stage productions in New York and Los Angeles leaned on the same script.) Pee-wee appeared in interstitial segments on the fledgling MTV and as a favorite guest of David Letterman\u2019s. Amid the frequently cynical atmosphere of stand-up, Reubens saw how sweetness could be counterintuitively provocative: Working comedy clubs, he gave out pirate hats and deputized audience members to distribute candy. \u2018\u2018It was one of the greatest performances I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\u2019 says Apatow, who caught a Manhattan show.Reubens\u2019s club buzz led to a contract for his first film, \u2018\u2018Big Adventure,\u2019\u2019 which earned more than $40 million on a budget of $6 million and, in turn, led to \u2018\u2018Playhouse.\u2019\u2019 There, Reubens revitalized Saturday-morning programming, a wasteland of cheap animated series that served mostly as glorified toy commercials, by discovering an aesthetic wormhole connecting late-night comedy and early-morning children\u2019s programming. The sensibility of stoned 20-somethings at midnight, he realized \u2014 marked by an unreasonable love of repetition, absurdity, narrative disjuncture and jokes that either last way too long or flit by in a short-attention-span-accommodating blink \u2014 had significant overlap with that of little kids in pajamas, laughing themselves silly over breakfast cereal. \u2018\u2018Those are the times of the day when there aren\u2019t rules,\u2019\u2019 Reubens said of morning and night, standing as they do in idiosyncratic opposition to the more conventional prerogatives of the prime-time dial. \u2018\u2018Rules are for the other times.\u2019\u2019One day in Burbank, I met Reubens at a recording studio where he was scheduled to do some voice-over work. As \u2018\u2018Big Holiday\u2019\u2019 was winding its way toward completion, he was keeping busy with other jobs. Steven Soderbergh had cast Reubens in a coming HBO project, and he had also booked multi-episode arcs as a guest actor on \u2018\u2018The Blacklist\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Gotham.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018When it rains, it pours,\u2019\u2019 he said happily.Reubens was particularly excited about one bit of rainfall: NBC had ordered a pilot for what he hoped would become a brand new Pee-wee prime-time variety series. The pilot was supposed to be taped in October, and he was feeling good about its chances \u2014 \u2018\u2018It\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve written\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but in late September he called me to say that NBC had pulled the plug. He cited scheduling and budgetary issues, blaming the network and theorizing that the poor ratings of \u2018\u2018Best Time Ever With Neil Patrick Harris,\u2019\u2019 a recently begun and rapidly canceled variety show, had weakened NBC\u2019s resolve. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m better off in a situation where people are going to let me do what I want,\u2019\u2019 he said, discussing the pilot\u2019s demise. \u2018\u2018I had such a lucky, fluky experience with the kids\u2019 show, where they never said anything, and I got spoiled.\u2019\u2019Reubens has influential champions \u2014 not just Apatow and Soderbergh, but also Todd Solondz, David O. Russell and Tina Fey, who have all cast him in projects. His C.V. also includes a list of credits for voice acting in dozens of cartoons and video games \u2014 roles with names like Screwy Squirrel, Bat-Mite and Gnome Ruler. It was a gig of this kind that took him to the Burbank studio: dialogue for a forthcoming Minecraft video game. Inside, an engineer worked a computer while a director, Khris Brown, patched in remotely and led Reubens through his 26 lines. He was to portray a villain named Ivor, who had an argument, and forged a tentative alliance, with the games\u2019 heroes.The session lasted less than an hour. With each take, Reubens shifted emphasis and emotional inflection, offering up different flavors of ham here, unexpected subtlety there. In the darkened booth, hunched over his script with his reading glasses on and his arms crossed, Reubens appeared very small. For Ivor he mustered a voice not so different from that of his best-loved creation: antic, petulant, silly. \u2018\u2018Hey \u2014 these attacks are starting to feel a little personal!\u2019\u2019 he cried. \u2018\u2018Hey! These attacks are starting to feel a little personal!\u2019\u2019 he growled. If you closed your eyes, it was easy to imagine that Pee-wee himself had burst into the room, engaged in some nonsensical game of repetition and that it was him, not Reubens, mouthing every line.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renewed Efforts to Stop Subway Sex Crimes", "Date": "2016-02-22", "News": "Supported byFanning out along the platform at the City Hall subway station in Manhattan, the plainclothes police officers blended in with the morning commuters. As they prepared to board a northbound train, they watched closely, their eyes darting from rider to rider.The team of seven officers was searching for men who use the subway\u2019s crowded confines to get too close to women. Some furtively touch female passengers, while others rub up against the women they have targeted.At Union Square, Detective Marquis Cross saw a man he recognized from a previous sex-offense arrest standing suspiciously close to a female passenger. As the woman left the train, Detective Cross jogged after her to ask if she had felt anything unusual. She said that she had not, but that the man did seem too close.Offenders will often step off a car and get back on just before the doors close so they have to squeeze next to other riders, Detective Cross said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for a particular crowd or person that they want to get behind,\u201d he said.Opportunistic sex crimes aboard subways are not new, nor are they news to many women. Some have been grabbed or leered at by a man who is masturbating. Many others have heard a story from a friend who felt an uncomfortable touch but was unsure if she should say something.But cellphone cameras and social media have given women tools to fight back and provided the police a way to identify some offenders. Last year, in an effort to encourage more victims to come forward, the police began training more female officers to work the cases.Reported sex crimes on the subways rose 19 percent last year, to 738 from 620 in 2014. Many of those crimes were forcible touching and public lewdness, the offenses most commonly charged in connection with the sort of sexual misconduct that Detective Cross and his colleagues were on the lookout for that morning on the Lexington Avenue line.Joseph Fox, the chief of the Transit Bureau, said he believed the increase in reported sex crimes was a result of more women coming forward. He expects the number of reports will keep rising as the police continue to talk about the problem.\u201cMany men don\u2019t know this issue exists; far too many women do,\u201d Chief Fox said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime that goes largely unreported.\u201dSubway announcements have long warned riders about sexual misconduct, and social media and pop culture have amplified attention to it. The phenomenon was a plotline on the Netflix series \u201cMaster of None\u201d when Aziz Ansari\u2019s character confronts an offender on the subway.The police made about 400 arrests last year for sex offenses on the subways, nearly three-fourths of which took place when officers witnessed an episode or a victim sought out a nearby officer who located the suspect. Victims are often embarrassed, confused or rushing to work, so they may not stop to tell a transit worker or go to a police station, Chief Fox said.One of two female officers on the recent patrol, Lt. Angela Morris has become well versed on sex crimes in the two and a half years she has worked on such cases. Victims are frequently crying and express shock and humiliation, and they often appear more comfortable speaking to her rather than to her male colleagues, she said.\u201cShe\u2019s more free to tell me everything that she felt happen to her,\u201d Lieutenant Morris said, adding that she had taken women whose clothing was damaged to buy a new outfit.The most common reports in 2015 were for forcible touching (340 cases) and public lewdness (223 cases), both misdemeanors. There were 130 episodes of sexual abuse, which can be a misdemeanor or a felony. Rapes, which are felonies, are rare on the subway, Chief Fox said. One was reported last year, and five were reported the previous year.In September, Tiffany D. Jackson, a 33-year-old fiction writer who lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said that a man followed her onto a No. 3 train in Brooklyn, exposed himself and masturbated while staring at her. She told the train operator and filed a report at a police station, though it was only after she posted an explicit photo of the man on Instagram and it circulated online that he was arrested.At the Brooklyn station where Ms. Jackson first reported the encounter, the train operator directed her upstairs to a station booth for assistance. But she did not find that booth, and then, Ms. Jackson saw the offender standing next to her.She said she hopped the turnstile, raced down to the platform and jumped on the next train toward Manhattan. At Times Square, she went to a police station, where she said officers wrote down her information and a description from the photo on her phone.But Ms. Jackson said it felt as though they did not take her seriously. After she posted the photo on Instagram and her story spread, Chief Fox emailed her to say that he was sorry she had been victimized on the subway and that he took such cases seriously.\u201cWhat\u2019s so disturbing is that if I hadn\u2019t posted the picture, one: He wouldn\u2019t have been caught,\u201d Ms. Jackson said. \u201cAnd two: Nothing would have happened.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important to build that empathy and understanding that it is a very traumatic experience,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The share was worse in films: About 29 percent of the parts went to female actors.Minority groups represented a little more than 28 percent of speaking characters in films and series, about 10 percent less than their share of the general population, according to the study. Just 2 percent were identified as L.G.B.T.Women were heavily outnumbered by men behind the camera, making up about 15 percent of directors, about 29 percent of writers and about 23 percent of series creators, the study found.The researchers said they hoped to broaden the discussion about diversity in Hollywood. Stacy L. Smith, a professor at the University of Southern California and an author of the study, said the findings mapped out an ecosystem of inequality in which the Academy Awards was just one of the most visible outcomes.\u201cIt becomes really important to think about not just the awards but \u2014 from television, streaming and cinematic content \u2014 who gets opportunities onscreen and behind the camera. Who gets hired,\u201d she said.\u201cThis is providing a larger frame around the Academy Awards, and why, at the end of that whole series of decisions, we might see a very, very narrow slice of humanity getting nominated because the entire ecosystem has a problem and that\u2019s what the data speaks to.\u201dThe Annenberg researchers also, for the first time, analyzed 10 major media companies, including old-guard firms like Sony and 21st Century Fox, along with the newcomers Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, and scored them for diversity in five categories. Each one failed to meet the study\u2019s definition of \u201cinclusive.\u201dWomen represented about 20 percent of the companies\u2019 corporate boards, chief executives and executive management teams.Several of the studios, including Time Warner, which fared the worst, declined to comment on the study.Twenty-First Century Fox highlighted its efforts to deepen the diversity of the industry, pointing to its part in setting up the Fox Writers Intensive and the Fox Global Directors Initiative.The study\u2019s authors suggested that media companies grappling with diversity problems would be well advised to start behind the camera. When women are directing or creating the series, casts tend to reflect greater diversity, the study found.\u201cIf we see a tilted view of humanity onscreen, the question becomes, \u2018Who\u2019s getting opportunities behind the camera?\u2019 \u201d Dr. Smith said. \u201cAnd what we see is there is a tilted opportunity behind the camera as well.\u201dBarbara Schock, a filmmaker and chairwoman of the graduate film program at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, said the challenge of diversifying the ranks of film directors, did not trace to a lack of talented women.Media companies just need to open their eyes, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking.

{"Headline": "Apple and Dr. Dre Are Said to Be Planning an Original TV Show", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is working on an original television show with Dr. Dre, the co-founder of Beats Music and an Apple executive, according to a person with knowledge of the project.The show, currently titled \u201cVital Signs,\u201d will be an Apple Music project offered through Apple TV, the company\u2019s streaming video device, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the plans because they are private.Apple has been trying to make inroads into the living room, where viewers still watch tremendous amounts of content and advertisers still jockey for screen time. But the company trails competitors. The streaming device category is dominated by smart TVs, the Roku box and Google\u2019s Chromecast, data from the research firm eMarketer shows.\u201cThere has been such a proliferation of video streaming services and hardware in the past year that the only way Apple can get a leg up in the market is to differentiate with original content,\u201d said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer.But Apple has struggled with content, while companies like Netflix and Amazon already have award-winning original shows.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for Internet software and services, has been trying to put together a bundle of television shows for Apple TV that would be smaller than what cable companies offer, said a person with knowledge of the plan who declined to be identified because the discussions are private. But television and cable companies have balked at a deal. Apple has also held talks with film and television executives about financing original programs to be offered exclusively through Apple TV.Creating a show with Dr. Dre, whose real name is Andre Young, would help Apple overcome some of its content difficulties. Dr. Dre joined Apple after it acquired his Beats Music for $3 billion in 2014. In addition to working with Apple Music, he produced the 2015 film \u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d which is based on his musical career. The television show is Dr. Dre\u2019s project and Apple is backing it, one person said.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the project, but noted that the last quarter of 2015 was the best for Apple TV sales.Apple Music recently signed its own content agreements, including a deal to stream a concert film from Taylor Swift\u2019s world tour.\u201cLike so many Apple products, Apple TV wants to be a self-sufficient ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Verna said. \u201cIf a company has to look within to find entertainment industry talent, thanks to Apple Music and the company\u2019s tremendous entertainment industry contacts, Apple is as well positioned as any company to do so.\u201dKatie Benner reported from San Francisco and Ben Sisario from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Watch the Super Bowl When You Don\u2019t Have Cable", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byTech FixThis year\u2019s Super Bowl, the 50th, will be the second that CBS has streamed free, though it will be the first time its streaming apps play the commercials while they are shown on television, Mr. Gerttula added.That the Super Bowl is so easily streamable should only accelerate the consumer revolt against big cable. The research firm eMarketer estimated that last year about five million American households that once paid for TV no longer did, up about 10.9 percent from the previous year. The firm estimated that by 2018, one in five American households will not subscribe to cable or satellite TV.Fret not, brave cord-cutter. I tested several other options, including digital antennas and the Slingbox, a device that can connect to a friend or family member\u2019s cable box to watch the game on a streaming device. The antennas were simple to set up, and the picture quality was excellent. The Slingbox was a bit rougher to set up and will not be an ideal method for watching the Super Bowl, but is a useful device to keep in your back pocket if you are often abroad and don\u2019t want to miss out on live national sports.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.After some experimentation, I found that sticking the antenna to a wall around the corner from my television pulled the clearest signal from CBS. I got about 40 channels, including ABC, various home shopping channels and a station that plays only Korean pop music videos.Consumers will have to do their homework before buying an antenna by looking up their proximity to nearby transmitters. Antennas Direct says that with an outdoor antenna like the 2V, you\u2019ll probably get poor reception if you\u2019re more than 70 miles from transmitters. For indoors antennas like the Eclipse, 35 miles is outside the comfort zone.If you are reasonably close to TV transmitters, the benefits of an antenna make the technology a sound investment. It\u2019s cheap, for one, and when you get a clear signal, the high-definition channels can look even better than digital cable because the image you get with an antenna is raw video broadcast over the air, unlike the compressed video sent over digital cable.\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting the raw video, it might be double or triple the quality of satellite or cable,\u201d said Richard Schneider, the founder of Antennas Direct, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more detailed picture than what you\u2019d get through paid TV.\u201dAntennas and free online streaming of the Super Bowl aren\u2019t viable options for international fans, but the Slingbox is one workaround. If you have friends or family members with a cable subscription, you can hook a Slingbox up to the back of their cable box.The Slingbox pulls in whatever is playing on the cable box, and you can watch the video live on a web browser or on a device that supports the Slingplayer app, like Apple and Android mobile devices, Roku boxes, Chromecast or Amazon\u2019s Fire TV. The Slingplayer apps also have a remote control, allowing you to change the channel on the cable box.I plugged a Slingbox M2 ($200) into a cable box and had a rough time getting the remote control to work inside the Slingplayer app. Still, as long as the cable box is set to CBS, the Slingbox is an easy method for tuning in to the game from abroad.\u201cSlingbox works anywhere in the world,\u201d said Mark Vena, a Sling Media executive. \u201cYou have a right to use it wherever you are\u201d as long as you or your family members are already paying for cable, he added.Email: brian.chen@nytimes.com; \nTwitter: @bxchen Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet, Google\u2019s Parent Company, Grows Briskly to Close In on Apple", "Date": "2016-02-01", "News": "Supported byDespite spending $3.6 billion a year on projects like self-driving cars that don\u2019t make much money, Alphabet\u2019s advertising business propelled the company to a strong last three months of 2015, outpacing expectations and sending the stock up in after-hours trading.Now, when Wall Street opens for business on Tuesday, Alphabet will most likely be worth more than Apple, which has been the most valuable company in the world for nearly four years. Apple is still generating enviable profits but is dealing with concerns that its franchise iPhone business is slowing down.If investors are sending any sort of signal to big tech companies, which have taken their lumps from shareholders this year, it is simply this: You are free to spend on side projects so long as your main business is not showing signs of weakness.\u201cThe main thing is the core business,\u201d said Josh Spencer, who manages T. Rowe Price\u2019s Global Technology Fund.Alphabet\u2019s total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, increased 24 percent to $21.3 billion, when compared with the same period in 2014.The revenue rise was attributed to strong growth in mobile search and YouTube, which is significant because investors had long been looking for signs that the core search business was making a smooth transition from desktop computers to mobile phones, and that YouTube was becoming a driver of new growth.\u201cAbove all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google\u2019s range of businesses,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of the Google business, during the call.Net income was $4.9 billion versus $4.7 billion for the same period a year ago, beating Wall Street expectations. The company said its \u201cother bets\u201d category \u2014 the moonshots \u2014 had revenue of $448 million.Shares of Alphabet were up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street. But Alphabet has been a model student, reining in its expenses, using $5 billion of its $73 billion cash hoard to repurchase company stock and, with this latest report, giving investors more insight into how Google\u2019s core business is performing.In fact, many Alphabet investors are hoping that merely disclosing new information will give the stock price an extra lift. In a recent report, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, called segment reporting \u201cthe most identifiable near-term catalyst in Internet land,\u201d which is to say that when companies give investors more information, it makes them more eager to buy in.The benefit of segment reporting for Alphabet and other high-growth Internet companies is that when investors are allowed to take an unvarnished look at how profitable one side of the business is, it tends to make them more forgiving of losses elsewhere.Mr. Spencer, of T. Rowe Price, which holds Alphabet shares, said he had been happy with Alphabet\u2019s progress but wanted the company to give back more of its cash pile to investors.\u201cI would like to see more developments in terms of capital return, but not this year,\u201d he said. \u201cBaby steps with this company.\u201dOf course, the reality is that, in revenue terms, nothing about Alphabet\u2019s business has changed. Google began 2015 as a giant advertising company connected to a collection of intriguing science projects. Alphabet ended the year as a collection of intriguing science projects connected to a highly profitable advertising business.Advertising continues to account for the lion\u2019s share of the company\u2019s revenue, and search advertising is about three-quarters of total revenue, according to estimates by Mr. Mahaney. For now, most everything investors are excited about also has to do with advertising.This includes YouTube, whose annual revenue is now estimated at somewhere from $4 billion to $8 billion, and the Google Play store, Google\u2019s mobile app store, which takes a cut of app revenue but recently started selling in-store advertisements.\u201cFor a company of this size to continue to be able to grow at 20 percent a year \u2014 that\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities.What about those other bets, like the self-driving car? Right now they are just big losses. For investors, then, this report was less about the future than it was about reassuring them that the old Google is continuing to grow quickly, and that other products like YouTube are going to pick up the growth when search advertising starts to mature.If one of the moonshots should work out, then great.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Love\u2019 and \u2018Togetherness\u2019 Capture the Arc of the Romantic Pursuit", "Date": "2016-02-18", "News": "Supported byIn comedy, they say timing is everything. That goes double for romantic comedy. The genre is built on the tension between fate and circumstance: Two people are meant to be together, but the plot keeps them out of sync until divine order is restored.\u201cLove,\u201d whose first season arrives Friday, is created by Judd Apatow, bard of the pop-savvy rom-com, along with Lesley Arfin (\u201cGirls\u201d) and Paul Rust, who also co-stars. Sweet and awkward, hopeful and cringe-inducing, it slows down the arc of a single romance like a frame-by-frame replay of a car crash and asks whether that collision is a disaster or a happy accident.Mickey is a little self-centered and a lot self-destructive. Gus hides his own nice-guy toxicity under a smooth layer of victimhood. (As he puts it, \u201cSometimes, if a waiter\u2019s really bad, I\u2019ll just tip them like 30 percent, so they go like, \u2018I didn\u2019t deserve this.\u2019\u201d) They make a connection, but if they go together, it\u2019s not like a hand to a glove; more like a foot to a doormat.\u201cLove\u201d is hardly the first revisionist rom-com to hit TV. Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d embraces movie myths while dismantling them, FXX\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst\u201d explores the chemistry of self-destructiveness, Amazon\u2019s \u201cCatastrophe\u201d is a variation on the gimlet-eyed raunch of Mr. Apatow\u2019s movies.But \u201cLove\u201d is a funny, winning version of the format, and the casting is spot on. Ms. Jacobs\u2019s Mickey has a prickly melancholy, like a more naturalistic version of her Britta Perry from \u201cCommunity.\u201d Mr. Rust is well-cast to nerd-connoisseur type: He\u2019s skinny and floppy-haired, like a mop that a wizard brought to life, and carries himself like he would like to have an intense discussion of his ranked list of Coen Brothers films.The season (I\u2019ve seen all of it) brings Mickey and Gus together and apart, together and apart, until they confront the possibility that they really hooked up to satisfy a conception of themselves: he dating the erratic Mickey so he can feel more dangerous, she seeing a \u201cnice guy\u201d so she can feel she\u2019s getting her life together.It\u2019s a heavy recognition, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the end. Sometimes, \u201cLove\u201d suggests, romance doesn\u2019t need candlelight to grow so much as an honest fluorescent glare.But as the show grew, the title seemed to refer to the elusive ideal of any long-term relationship: being in the same emotional space at the same time.In the first season, Brett and Michelle knew their marriage was in trouble, but they were out of sync \u2014 she feeling overwhelmed and neglected, he, lost in a funk. It was as if he were having an affair, but with himself. (Mr. Duplass\u2019s placid manner makes him a good introvert, a personality type TV has a hard time with.) By the time Brett was ready to work on their marriage, Michelle was in a hotel room with David (John Ortiz), a single dad she developed a crush on while working on a charter-school project.\u201cTogetherness\u201d wasn\u2019t an easy series to like at first; it seemed like a show about self-involved whiners (lightened by Mr. Zissis\u2019 and Ms. Peet\u2019s sharp comic turns), but revealed itself as an empathetic story about how circumstances can turn you into a self-involved whiner.This year, \u201cTogetherness\u201d has positively bloomed. (HBO sent critics the full season.) It\u2019s sadder and funnier, welling over with feeling. It\u2019s insightful not just about marriage but friendship; as Alex lands a big movie role, Brett feels them drifting apart, too. Meanwhile, Tina is seeing an older man, who\u2019s simpatico in every way but a big one: She wants kids, and he doesn\u2019t.Like \u201cTransparent\u201d (in which the co-creator Jay Duplass appears), \u201cTogetherness\u201d has a sympathetic eye for its specific breed of Los Angeles bourgeois. Brett, a movie sound engineer, drives an electric car; like him, it\u2019s so quiet it seems to want to efface its existence, and it\u2019s continually threatening to run out of charge.The cast is uniformly strong, but Ms. Lynskey is just staggering. She lets you inside Michelle\u2019s frustration \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t even know how we lost each other,\u201d she says \u2014 and makes the story feel personal, like you\u2019re watching friends go through a rough patch and know them both too well to take sides.For all that, \u201cTogetherness\u201d is no downer. Like \u201cThirtysomething\u201d or \u201cParenthood,\u201d it knows when to leaven its heart-heaviness. (A running story line in which Alex and Brett plan a puppet-theater production of \u201cDune\u201d is a font of great sight gags.)It\u2019s not necessarily the stuff of a mass hit, even by HBO standards, and the season ends on what, if necessary, could be a satisfying, cathartic series finale. Love, \u201cTogetherness\u201d suggests, is not about being constantly together. It\u2019s about having bonds that stretch as you inevitably drift apart, and faith that they might eventually snap back.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Steve Burke, Old-Media NBCUniversal Shows Off Some New Tricks", "Date": "2016-02-04", "News": "Supported byCommon SenseBut Comcast startled investors and analysts on Wednesday with earnings that suggested there was still growth potential in old media. Not only did the cable giant stem the tide of so-called cord cutters by adding video subscribers, but results from NBCUniversal were every bit as dazzling as the latest financials from Amazon or Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet.Universal theme park revenue jumped 39 percent for the quarter and the movie business rose 26 percent. Over all, NBCUniversal revenue rose more than 13 percent. Comcast doesn\u2019t break out earnings for NBCUniversal, but operating cash flow rose 8.7 percent.Since 2009, when Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal from its former parent General Electric (an acquisition completed five years ago), NBCUniversal\u2019s cash flow has doubled. The NBC television network, which had been in fourth place for so long (seven years) that many doubted it could be resurrected, is the leading network for the coveted 18-to-49 age group, powered by high ratings for \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and \u201cThe Voice.\u201d Strong franchises \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d and \u201cToday\u201d have recouped the top spots in the ratings that had been threatened by scandal (Brian Williams at \u201cNightly News\u201d) and a tearful on-air departure (Ann Curry at \u201cToday\u201d).I sat down this week with Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, in his spacious, light-filled office at NBCUniversal\u2019s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Despite the pressures of running a media giant with $28.5 billion in revenue, he looks younger than his age of 57 years. In our conversation, one thing stood out about NBCUniversal, which is true of all old-media companies: It\u2019s all about the people. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cIt\u2019s about talent. If you get that wrong, the whole enterprise goes bad very quickly.\u201dMr. Burke grew up in broadcast television \u2014 his father, Dan Burke, was a former president of CapCities ABC, and Steve Burke worked at Disney under the former chief executive Michael Eisner and then at Comcast, where he was president of the cable division, under the chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts.Today much of Mr. Burke\u2019s time seems to be spent courting, coaxing, stroking, cajoling \u2014 and in some cases ejecting \u2014 high-paid, high-profile stars and executives, many with outsize egos. In 2011, Mr. Burke had to replace the prominent NBC Sports head, Dick Ebersol, just four weeks before the rights to the Sochi Olympics were auctioned.Last year, when the NBC Nightly news anchor, Brian Williams, acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in Iraq, Mr. Burke had to put their close friendship aside and deliver an in-person ultimatum to take a six-month leave without pay. (\u201cAgonizing,\u201d Mr. Burke told me.)He flew to California and spent a weekend with Jay Leno to negotiate the delicate transition to Jimmy Fallon as host of the \u201cTonight\u201d show a year before Mr. Leno\u2019s contract was set to expire.Still, dealing with stars like Mr. Leno and Mr. Fallon can\u2019t be delegated. It was Mr. Burke who coaxed Steven Spielberg back to his production roots at Universal Studios. And some deals \u2014 NBC\u2019s multibillion-dollar, nine-year extension of \u201cSunday Night Football,\u201d for example \u2014 are so big they require the presence of Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burke\u2019s boss.While Mr. Burke comes across as genial and low-key, he\u2019s a demanding boss. Of the 16 NBCUniversal executives Mr. Burke inherited from G.E., only four remain.Early in his tenure, he summoned the top 200 managers to Orlando and told them they had to do better. \u201cI had to be stern,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cPeople thought everything was fine. It wasn\u2019t. I had to paint reality. I ranked our top 10 businesses based on operating cash flow. Eight of the 10 were in the third quartile,\u201d meaning they woefully lagged their competitors. He charged them to act like owners, not renters \u2014 which means to invest for the long term, to take responsibility and to fix problems themselves \u2014 a mantra now printed on the back of every NBCUniversal business card. It\u2019s also one emphasized by Warren E. Buffett to the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr. Burke serves on the board. (Disclosure: I\u2019m a weekly contributor to CNBC, the NBCUniversal-owned business channel.)Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks & Resorts, has been at Universal for 46 years. \u201cThe previous mentality was, How can we take cash out of the business?\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cComcast encouraged, even mandated, reinvestment. We\u2019ve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers. Steve and Brian have said, \u2018Keep reinvesting.\u2019 The returns are stellar.\u201dUniversal recently acquired 51 percent ownership of Universal Studios Japan, is opening another Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood and is building a new park in Beijing.With NBCUniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders, Mr. Burke has been able to turn his attention to the digital revolution. He said he was looking to hire digital talent, had personally interviewed 25 people in the last month and would probably establish an NBCUniversal digital headquarters in Santa Monica, also known as Silicon Beach. The company has taken $200 million stakes in the digital media companies BuzzFeed and Vox Media, and has started Seeso, a digital comedy channel.\u201cIt\u2019s my biggest challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cBig media made the transition from broadcast to cable. But we were still dealing with channels. Now we have to move to digital. Digital is different. The DNA doesn\u2019t already reside in the company.\u201dInvestors have already declared a winner in this emerging showdown: Comcast stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18; Netflix\u2019s is 324 and Amazon\u2019s is 425, meaning that investors are anticipating much higher growth at those companies.Still, as old and new media converge, and talent increasingly rivals engineering prowess in importance, it may be worth asking how much old-media DNA resides in digital media giants like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet. Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Bezos and Larry Page, their respective chief executives, aren\u2019t primarily known for their people skills, let alone the ability to cultivate Hollywood celebrities and TV stars.Mr. Burke typically shuns the spotlight, and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains NBCUniversal\u2019s recent success and momentum. He said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclical.Still, it\u2019s obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal. \u201cI\u2019m a product of my dad\u2019s influence at CapCities ABC, my time at Disney, and then at Comcast,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cI developed all these theories about how to run a big media company and I finally got an opportunity to try them.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misstated Mr. Burke\u2019s title at Comcast. He is senior executive vice president, not president.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaving \u2018Full House\u2019 Was His Biggest Regret. So He Rebuilt It.", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byIn one of the valleys between the peaks of his career, Jeff Franklin had an idea for a TV series. Called \u201cHouse of Comics,\u201d it would follow three aspiring stand-ups living together in Los Angeles. \u201cIt was three single guys trying to cause trouble, and then turning it into material for their act,\u201d Mr. Franklin explained. \u201cThat was the show I wanted to do.\u201dIf \u201cHouse of Comics\u201d did not turn out as planned for Mr. Franklin, a 61-year-old writer and producer who lives in Los Angeles, nor has the rest of his professional life. Though he is not a household name, he has enjoyed an estimable success with sitcoms that were long-lasting audience pleasers if not critical smashes.Recalling a subsequent meeting with a top studio executive, Mr. Franklin said, \u201cHe sat me down and said, \u2018I understand you\u2019re running \u2018Laverne & Shirley\u2019 now \u2014 who are you? We\u2019ve never heard of you.\u2019\u201dExpecting to transition to a movie career (he contributed to screenplays for \u201cSummer School\u201d and \u201cJust One of the Guys\u201d), Mr. Franklin was steered back to television by a studio where a film deal had gone awry, and he conceived the idea for \u201cHouse of Comics.\u201d But ABC wanted a family comedy, and \u201cFull House\u201d was born.\u201cThey smelled good,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no diaper accidents. They didn\u2019t drool on me.\u201dFor the show\u2019s rakish Uncle Jesse, Mr. Franklin chose someone who seemed like a kindred spirit and fellow playboy \u2014 John Stamos, who was coming off a short-lived sitcom, \u201cYou Again?,\u201d with Jack Klugman.At their first lunch meeting, Mr. Stamos said, \u201cWe talked about Elvis. We talked about girls. We made sure we hadn\u2019t dated the same girls.\u201d\u201cWhen the appetizers came,\u201d Mr. Stamos continued, \u201che said, \u2018So you want to do this show?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d\u201cFull House\u201d caught on as ABC surrounded it with harmonious comedies like \u201cFamily Matters,\u201d \u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d and \u201cMr. Belvedere.\u201dBehind the scenes, Mr. Franklin said, he was focused entirely and obsessively on his \u201cFull House\u201d work.\u201cI would work all day, work all night, go to bed and dream about the lives of the characters,\u201d he said. \u201cI never had a dream that I was in anymore.\u201d(Mr. Stamos said he had never heard Mr. Franklin say this before. \u201cI would have told him he\u2019s a weirdo and leave me alone,\u201d Mr. Stamos said with a laugh. \u201cGo dream about the \u2018Growing Pains\u2019 cast.\u201d)\u201cHangin\u2019 With Mr. Cooper\u201d ran more than 100 episodes, and while \u201cFull House\u201d continued for three more seasons, Mr. Franklin said it suffered in his absence as it constantly tinkered with the romantic and professional lives of the characters.\u201cPeople didn\u2019t like what was going on, and they abandoned the show,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was sad to see that happen.\u201d(\u201cFull House,\u201d a Top 10 show in Mr. Franklin\u2019s final year, slid to 25th place by its eighth season, after which it was canceled.)Though Mr. Franklin never withdrew from the industry outright, he said there was a period of about \u201ceight or nine years where I just didn\u2019t work so hard,\u201d and focused on travel and charity work.\u201cMy life was very out of balance,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked around the clock. I put everything I have into these shows. It was just time to take a break.\u201dFor some of the young \u201cFull House\u201d stars, who on the show understood him only as a friendly face and a giver of bicycles, these intervening years have allowed them to better appreciate him as adults.Ms. Bure said that, for the cast members, Mr. Franklin \u201cwas a significant factor in keeping all of us connected over the years,\u201d usually at get-togethers at his mansion.Though Mr. Franklin is \u201cone of my wealthiest friends,\u201d Ms. Bure said, he shares his opulence generously.A few years ago, when Mr. Franklin realized he would be vacationing in Greece at the same time as Ms. Bure and her family, she recalled with a chuckle, \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this yacht \u2014 why don\u2019t you guys come join me?\u2019\u201d\u201cIt was totally not the vacation that Jeff had intended,\u201d Ms. Bure added. \u201cI think he was expecting lots of beautiful women and other friends. Here we were, banana-boating and jet-skiing off private islands.\u201dMr. Franklin has never married and has no children of his own, details that he said do not preclude him from writing about families. \u201cI was a child at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cI am still part of a family.\u201dBut he said that, over time, he had come to regard the \u201cFull House\u201d cast \u2014 particularly Ms. Bure, Ms. Sweetin and Ms. Barber \u2014 as a second family, and felt that it was especially important to get \u201cFuller House\u201d on television for them.\u201cObviously they\u2019re not my kids,\u201d he said of these actresses, \u201cbut I feel that attachment to them. I care about them that much.\u201dStill, it took several years for Mr. Franklin and Mr. Stamos, who is also an executive producer of \u201cFuller House,\u201d to pitch the project around and to find a network willing to make a sizable commitment to a series that would focus principally on these women.Netflix, which has made revivals of dormant series like \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d a staple of its original programming, said it was not interested in \u201cFuller House\u201d purely for its name recognition, calling it an ideal show for the streaming service as it looks to expand into family and young-adult programming.\u201cIf the proposition of \u2018Fuller House\u2019 was simply a nostalgia play, I don\u2019t think it would last beyond, probably, a reunion special,\u201d said Cindy Holland, Netflix\u2019s vice president for content. \u201cWhat attracted us to the proposition is that Candace and Jodi and Andrea would not only be back, but they\u2019re all grown up and they have a really compelling story to tell of their own.\u201dShe said it was important that \u201cFuller House\u201d retain the aesthetics of the original show. Though the new series has embraced some serialized storytelling elements, it is still shot in a traditional, multicamera format with a boisterous laugh track.Mr. Stamos said he and Mr. Franklin sometimes disagreed about how much to contemporize \u201cFuller House,\u201d but ultimately retained many of the original writers and directors of \u201cFull House.\u201d\u201cI just wanted to infuse some, maybe, hipper talent around it,\u201d Mr. Stamos said. \u201cWe just went with what worked before. That was Jeff\u2019s thing.\u201dMr. Franklin said that \u201cFuller House\u201d had changed to reflect contemporary sensibilities, and was not as \u201csaccharine\u201d as its predecessor. \u201cWe\u2019re not running sappy music every time somebody says \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d he explained.In particular, he said that the new show understood how children \u2014 those appearing on \u201cFuller House\u201d as well as those watching it \u2014 had grown even savvier since the days of \u201cFull House.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The lawsuit had not gone very far.Custom TV is considered a \u201cskinny bundle,\u201d a trimmer version of more robust and expensive cable subscriptions that have led consumers to cut the cord to their pay-TV providers and pursue Internet options like Netflix and Amazon. By keeping ESPN out of its original Custom TV offering, Verizon was cutting out cable\u2019s most expensive network.Despite its cost, ESPN is nonetheless included in Sling TV, another skinny bundle that was created by Dish Network and costs $20 a month for 23 channels. ESPN2 is also part of Sling, as are other Disney channels like Freeform.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Animals,\u2019 an Animated Comedy From the Duplass Brothers", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byThe series begins with two rat buddies heading to a party, on the hunt for mates. (One of them has procured a saltine. We can\u2019t all be Pizza Rat.) It\u2019s the hookup-anxiety stuff of a dozen singles-hangout sitcoms, but intensified by the rodents\u2019 much faster biological clocks. (\u201cThis guy is the king of making babies!\u201d is how a rat wingman talks.)Underneath its fur and feathers, \u201cAnimals\u201d is a pretty familiar species: Comedicus bohemiana, the observational, urban comedy. Its animation is soot-tinged and static, with the unpretty, distressed look of an alternative graphic novel. It enlists a menagerie of indie film and comedy guest voices, including both Duplasses, Molly Shannon, Nick Kroll, Wanda Sykes and Marc Maron (playing a rat version of himself).At its best, the show uses animal life to send up specific city-living situations and subcultures. A story about two cat brothers that have never left their apartment gradually lays bare the creepy, codependent relationship behind the cuddly exterior; a bit about moths gathering around an electric sign imagines the experience as a kind of trippy insect Burning Man. (\u201cThis is my favorite part, right when the light starts hitting. This moment is all there is, and then you see the light.\u201d)Because of its anthology format, \u201cAnimals\u201d doesn\u2019t have much time to develop any particular character. (There is a continuing, superfluous story line about a seedy bunch of people; unlike the animals, the humans mostly don\u2019t speak.) This is the kind of loose, talky slacker comedy that needs razor-sharp observations and originality to work. Unfortunately, the writing isn\u2019t consistently funny enough to make up for the, well, shaggy dog storytelling. Too often, the conceit of an \u201cAnimals\u201d vignette is to take a familiar setup \u2014 an awkward dinner party, say \u2014 and add the joke: But they\u2019re fish!\u201cAnimals\u201d has inspired moments, and it deserves credit for trying to expand beyond the millions of human stories in the naked city. But simply being a rat is not enough to make you an interesting person.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nahnatchka Khan on \u2018Fresh Off the Boat,\u2019 Chinese New Year and Michael Chang", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byAsk a ShowrunnerQ. Why did you initially want to tell Eddie Huang\u2019s story? Why did you decide to do a Chinese New Year\u2019s episode?When we got the Season 2 order, it initially was for 13 episodes. We didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d get a full order, with the back nine. We knew Episode 13 was going to end up around Chinese New Year, so we\u2019ve always had that earmarked. Even if we don\u2019t do any more, we definitely want to hit that, because it\u2019s such an important holiday for so many people. The fact that it hasn\u2019t been represented at all makes it such a great opportunity for our show. Hopefully, this will become part of our show\u2019s canon; every year, we\u2019ll do our Chinese New Year episode.How familiar were you with the holiday\u2019s traditions?The writer of the episode, Sheng Wang, is Taiwanese-American, and he grew up in Houston around the same time that the show is set, so a lot of his experiences were like this. We have Korean writers, Chinese writers, Indian writers, and I\u2019m Persian. Some of us would go to school and explain about our New Year\u2019s and get made fun of by our classmates. \u201cWhat are you talking about? New Year\u2019s is in January.\u201d It was unexpectedly emotional for people to talk about that. Hopefully, after this episode airs, more kids on the playground will know what this is. That\u2019s kind of a cool thing.I feel really satisfied that so many people can relate to it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever stop feeling like somewhat of an outsider, because my experience is not the majority\u2019s. Being a woman, Persian and gay, I become more and more of an outsider with every click of the microscope. But what\u2019s fun for me is to take the way I\u2019ve seen the world and have it inform the way I write the characters. It feels different to me than maybe the way a white guy experiences the world through his prism.Because of successes like \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d \u201cDr. Ken, \u201cMaster of None\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d there will be more shows like these, and then you can get more nuanced with what you talk about. As far as dealing in stereotypes, you can\u2019t control viewers or know what their inner thoughts or beliefs are, but we are always telling stories from the inside out. The family is not the butt of the jokes. They\u2019re not the ones in the fishbowl being pointed at. We see the world through their eyes. They control the narrative. That is kind of revolutionary.Randall Park is one of the funniest comedic actors working today, regardless of race. I obsessively watched \u201cVeep\u201d for his performance. Randall understands this character, and he knows how to be funny, emotional and real, and how to carry story weight. He\u2019s like a utility knife. He can bring it all. I\u2019m so grateful and lucky that he\u2019s part of this show because of his skills.Constance Wu is such a powerhouse, yet she hadn\u2019t done much comedy before you cast her. Did you see this kind of potential in her?I remember seeing her picture, and she looked so young. She\u2019s got to be the mother of three boys, and I thought, \u201cI\u2019m never going to buy it.\u201d She came in, and from the first second she opened her mouth as Jessica, she nailed it. She inhabited that character. The choices she makes are so unusual, and she elevates everything. She makes it so much funnier than you thought it ever could be.Luckily, we have a lot of Chinese-Americans on staff, from executive producers to writers to cast members. We always try to make sure the show has an authenticity and a specificity, because we want it to feel like these are real people. This is just one family. They\u2019re not going to represent everyone\u2019s experience ever, but we really spend time making sure we get these characters correct.Oh, no, I love the song! It makes me so happy. It doesn\u2019t sound like any other theme song on TV. Some people said, \u201cIt\u2019s a little loud,\u201d and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right.\u201d We have to announce ourselves. We need to make a little noise.Absolutely. I love that show so much. We\u2019re talking about possibly doing some sort of Christmas special. There\u2019s been a lot of interest in it. We felt like we didn\u2019t have enough time with that show. We only got to do 26 episodes, and there are so many more stories we want to tell. I\u2019d love to do it.Always try to stay yourself. When you start out as a TV writer, you get a lot of pressure from outside forces to fit into what they think people want. Writing in another person\u2019s voice is a skill you have to develop when you\u2019re working on someone else\u2019s show. But if you can maintain your perspective, that\u2019s what will make you stand out. And as you move up, that will serve you more and more.What kept you going early on?Just paying the bills. I never had a backup plan. I\u2019ve only been good at one thing. I admire people who are jacks-of-all-trades. That\u2019s not me. I\u2019ve always been passionate about movies, TV and writing, and I\u2019ve been working so hard at it for so long. There were lots of setbacks, but I loved it so much, there was no alternative. I just picked myself up and kept going.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s harsh but true. Buzz comes and goes fast in the social media age.But David Larkin says he believes he has a digital solution.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that more people read about and are interested in Sundance films than actually go to Sundance, but the challenge is converting that buzz into paying customers,\u201d Mr. Larkin said. \u201cGenerating awareness is great, but it does very little good unless the consumers you have made aware are then escorted to a purchase.\u201dGoWatchIt expanded its partnership with Sundance this year \u2014 there was a GoWatchIt button on each page of the festival\u2019s digital program guide \u2014 and Mr. Larkin said that \u201clow tens of thousands\u201d of people added films to queues. For the art films that play Sundance, that could be an impactful number, \u201chelping kick-start word of mouth for a limited theatrical run or helping get on the iTunes top-seller list,\u201d he said.Mr. Larkin said that tests showed that GoWatchIt users opened emails notifying them of film availability in theaters, or on sites like Amazon, Netflix and iTunes, at a rate of up to 62 percent and then click through to a movie service where a film can be bought or rented in up to 18 percent of cases. Those rates are sharply higher than the industry norm for entertainment-related emails, according to Constant Contact, an online marketing company.Advertisement"}

The video was one of nine that Mr. Gordon and a crew of 15 conceived, styled and shot over two days in lieu of a traditional runway show. Presenting a show via Instagram-only may open it to a wider viewing public, but it does feel like a smaller, less-enveloping experience than to see it happen live. Yet Mr. Gordon sees advantages to opting out of the runway hurly-burly.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t replace seeing the garments in person,\u201d Mr. Gordon said of the videos in a statement, \u201cbut it can be difficult to create a world in six minutes and four white walls.\u201dThe world he created on video isn\u2019t, perhaps, all that more narrative than the one on the runway.

The Cinderella dress, in white crepe, is $2,950, with a $1,475 deposit required.MATTHEW SCHNEIERNew York Fashion Week has always been the place where actresses on the spectrum of underemployed to world famous show up to be photographed and poked and prodded and sometimes gifted with a free outfit.At the Jason Wu show on Friday afternoon at Spring Studios, Diane Kruger was in the front row, between Jaime King and Jennifer Hudson, who is starring on Broadway in \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and who had a handler hovering, ushering away those pesky little flies who buzzed about, wishing to speak with her.\u201cNo interviews,\u201d the publicist said, swatting them away and toward Ms. Kruger.Ms. Kruger had on something borrowed (a pale blue pleated dress from Mr. Wu\u2019s pre-fall collection) and something her own (one of Mr. Wu\u2019s short black winter coats), and said she wasn\u2019t planning on doing much this fashion week.\u201cJust my friends. Jason and Prabal,\u201d Ms. Kruger said, referring to Mr. Wu and his fellow designer Prabal Gurung. She has known Mr. Wu since his first collection when she was on her way to the Cannes Film Festival and requested a dress. \u201cHe showed up himself with it to fit it on me.\u201dShe is heading to Los Angeles in a couple of weeks for the Oscars. Although the lack of black nominees and the paucity of movies about women nominated for Best Picture have led to talk that people will sit out the festivities, Ms. Kruger is planning on at least making an appearance at Vanity Fair\u2019s Sunday night party.Does it feel strange to get blinged out and celebrate this year?\u201cI think if anything, it\u2019s good to have the conversation,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what\u2019s different. People are more aware of it than usual. Maybe.\u201dJACOB BERNSTEINGabriela Hearst walked guests through a small presentation in her 11th Avenue studio wearing a knit top and skirt of her own design. They were chic, oatmeal colored and, she revealed, hard at work.\u201cI designed it after I gave birth,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, \u2018What can suck you in? I want wearable Spanx.\u2019\u201dThis being luxury, her corseting comes in a wool-cashmere blend.But Ms. Hearst, whose line is only a year old but has been steadily attracting attention, is nothing if not a pragmatic designer, one who harps on women\u2019s experiences in her clothes. There is a refreshing lack of fuss to her pieces, which balance luxuriousness and tough-minded utility. Her jackets are reversible, her knitwear voluminous but plush.\u201cI grew up on a farm, so I wear rough knits like it\u2019s nothing,\u201d said Ms. Hearst, who was born in Uruguay and inherited her family\u2019s beef farm there. \u201cBut here in America, everyone likes soft.\u201dHer collection is not all homespun heartiness (though she does have some of her knitwear handmade in Uruguay). There were simple column dresses, fluttering blouses and soft-shouldered tailoring, too. The hope, she said, is to strike a balance between gentle and tough.\u201cMy sister is at Cornell,\u201d Ms. Hearst said. \u201cShe\u2019s a Ph.D. veterinarian. I design things for her to go to the dairy farm at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning. She could wear one of the cashmere puffy sweaters and be O.K.\u201d More to the point, for the farmless luxury consumer, Ms. Hearst added, \u201cSomeone uptown can be eating at Sant Ambroeus in the same piece.\u201dMATTHEW SCHNEIEREarly Thursday evening, a few dozen fashion week regulars ducked in from the suddenly bitter cold to take a look at the newly renovated Louis Vuitton store on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue.But the talk was not of architecture, or prohibitively expensive leather goods, or even what the falling global stock market may mean for luxury retailers. Instead, the opening salvo of almost every conversation was roughly the same, largely along the lines of: \u201cDid you just come from Yeezy?\u201dThen it was back to the store, gazing upon the merchandise (as well as a colorful Yayoi Kusama sculpture, \u201cFlowers That Bloom Tomorrow, 2010,\u201d displayed right under the first floor staircase) and nibbling on passed canap\u00e9s while wondering just how much money had been spent to make even more glamorous a 20,000-square-foot store that had opened in that location just 12 years earlier.Then, quickly, the crowd dispersed into the cold, eager, perhaps, to get back to their phones and another glimpse of Kanye.STUART EMMRICHEven when courting the dark side, Mr. Selman can\u2019t cloister his better nature. Murder-scene \u201cevidence\u201d was the trick-or-treat offering on every seat, but it was made of artisanal (of course) hard candy.

{"Headline": "Oscars 2016: Chris Rock Scores and \u2018Spotlight\u2019 Takes Center Stage", "Date": "2016-02-28", "News": "Supported byMichael Sugar, a \u201cSpotlight\u201d producer, said he hoped the win would \u201cresonate all the way to the Vatican.\u201dUntil the surprising finish, it seemed as if little attention would be paid to the movies. The limelight, at least in the early hours, was squarely on Mr. Rock and prickly questions of race in Hollywood.Chris Rock provoked, \u201cSpotlight\u201d stunned \u2014 and not every joke landed quite right. Here are some of the most memorable moments of the night.\u201cIf they nominated hosts, I wouldn\u2019t even get the job,\u201d Mr. Rock snapped as the show opened.In a politically contentious year, Mr. Rock, the evening\u2019s host, took the only safe course: He unloaded on everyone.\u201cJada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna\u2019s panties,\u201d Mr. Rock said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t invited!\u201dIt was a jab at Jada Pinkett Smith, and at those who had called for a boycott, because the Oscar acting nominees, for the second consecutive year, were all white.19 PhotosMoving on to the awards, he said, \u201cYou want diversity? We got diversity. Please welcome Emily Blunt and somebody whiter, Charlize Theron,\u201d and the two actresses appeared to present the night\u2019s first award, for best original screenplay.It went to Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer for \u201cSpotlight.\u201d That award was immediately followed by the best adapted screenplay Oscar for Charles Randolph and Adam McKay for \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d an arch primer on financial collapse. It, like \u201cSpotlight,\u201d was widely considered to have a shot at the night\u2019s top prize, best picture, so the two came out of the gate neck-and-neck.Thirty minutes into the show, Mr. Rock was still hitting the diversity theme, hard. He introduced a skit that had Whoopi Goldberg and others trying to edge their way into acting roles reserved for whites. Ms. Goldberg swished a mop next to Jennifer Lawrence in a scene supposedly from \u201cJoy.\u201d In another spoof, Jeff Daniels declined to spend $2,500 to save a stranded black astronaut, played by Mr. Rock, on Mars, in a takeoff on \u201cThe Martian.\u201dMs. Goldberg was back later to introduce a video recap of the Governors Awards, which went to Gena Rowlands, Debbie Reynolds, and Spike Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to be president of the United States as a black person than be head of a studio,\u201d Mr. Lee had said then. Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academy\u2019s president, immediately followed Ms. Goldberg with comments addressing the diversity issue.56 Photos\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just listen and agree,\u201d Ms. Isaacs said. \u201cWe must take action.\u201dThe split in top prizes capped a chaotic year in which \u201cSpotlight,\u201d seen as a front-runner after its debut in a string of September festivals, watched competitors win key awards from the producers guild, the directors guild and the British film academy.But voters from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences embraced the confusion, honoring \u201cSpotlight\u201d as the best picture, while spreading its acting awards among four films. Brie Larson was named best actress for \u201cRoom\u201d; Alicia Vikander was named best supporting actress for \u201cThe Danish Girl\u201d; and Mark Rylance was best supporting actor for \u201cBridge of Spies.\u201dMr. DiCaprio, who had long been considered a lock for his performance as Hugh Glass, a real-life frontiersman left for dead, in \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d seemed to be the main event, however.\u201cMaking \u2018The Revenant\u2019 was about man\u2019s relationship to the natural world,\u201d Mr. DiCaprio said, adding a political theme that was matched, if not one-upped, by others as the night moved on.\u201cClimate change is real, it is happening right now,\u201d Mr. DiCaprio said.He also paid tribute to Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who in turn played a diversity theme that dominated the night.What an opportunity, to \u201cmake sure for once and forever that the color of the skin become as irrelevant as the length of our hair,\u201d said Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who is from Mexico.While Hollywood may have owed Mr. DiCaprio one after four prior acting nominations, including those for \u201cThe Aviator\u201d and \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d it apparently figured his prize and the directing award for Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu were enough.A best picture trophy for \u201cThe Revenant\u201d would have made Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, whose \u201cBirdman\u201d was best picture last year, the first director in Oscar history to direct back-to-back winners. In fact, he was only the third, after John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz, to win consecutive directing awards.Ms. Larson, as was widely expected, won the best actress award, her first Oscar, for \u201cRoom.\u201d Her performance as a mother kept captive with her young son by a sexual predator was extraordinary, in that much of it was confined to a tiny room.The earlier awards had gone to a scattershot group of films that was dominated by a run of six craft awards for the brutal action fable \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201dThat had left only one early Oscar, for cinematography, to \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d a supposed front-runner. Other winners included \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d \u201cBridge of Spies,\u201d \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cInside Out.\u201dThe \u201cSpotlight\u2019\u2019 win was particularly sweet for Open Road Films, a small distributor that was formed in recent years by two theater companies, AMC Entertainment and Regal Entertainment. In the rough-and-tumble world of Oscar campaigning, Open Road was matched against 20th Century Fox and its allies, which backed \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d \u201cThe Martian,\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d all of which had best picture nominations.The statistics are unequivocal: Women and minorities are vastly underrepresented in front of and behind the camera. Here, 27 industry players reveal the stories behind the numbers.One question that would not be answered until Monday is whether the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d sequence would keep its traditional spot as a ratings high-point of the evening. Those remembered included Jerry Weintraub, Maureen O\u2019Hara, Omar Sharif, David Bowie, Leonard Nimoy and Wes Craven.For the most part, they were as white as the evening\u2019s presenters were black. At the same time, they represented the academy\u2019s past, while Ms. Isaacs promised that new processes and rules would create a different, more inclusive future.As the evening wore on, the causes began to stack up. Vice President Joseph R. Biden added yet another when he showed to introduce Lady Gaga\u2019s performance of \u201cTil It Happens to You,\u201d from \u201cThe Hunting Ground,\u201d a documentary about campus sexual assault. \u201cI really mean this, take the pledge,\u201d Mr. Biden urged, as he begged attention for that issue, as Mr. McCarthy, of \u201cSpotlight,\u201d and Mr. McKay, of \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d had urged attention for theirs.The original song Oscar went instead to \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall\u201d from \u201cSpectre.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a political award, but Sam Smith, one of the composers, dedicated his Oscar to the L.G.B.T. communities around the world.Ms. Vikander\u2019s win, as best supporting actress for \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d was the night\u2019s first acting award. Ms. Vikander, a Swede who lives in London, underscored the international quality of the nominated actors. For only the second time since the 1960s, fully half of the 20 acting nominees were not just white, but from countries that belong to the Commonwealth.Mr. Rylance won the best supporting actor for \u201cBridge of Spies.\u201d He, too, hails from London, but played a Soviet spy \u2014 that ethnic twist was a tribute to the craft of those Commonwealth players, who spoke more about the challenges of performance than the politics of casting. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful time to be an actor, thank you,\u201d said Mr. Rylance.The best foreign language film, \u201cSon of Saul,\u201d a Holocaust film from Hungary. The win, widely expected, was another reminder that the movie culture is international, and the woes it examines are larger, even, than racial concerns in the United States.Six early wins for \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d \u2014 for costume design, production design, editing, sound editing, sound mixing and makeup and hairstyling \u2014 soon signaled that the evening would be an uphill climb for \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d which had been in the running for those same Oscars. But the string of wins brought tribute after tribute not for Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, but for George Miller, the seasoned filmmaker behind the brutal, kinetic \u201cMad Max\u201d series.In one of the night\u2019s oddest moments, Pixar \u2014 through its characters Woody and Buzz Lightyear from the \u201cToy Story\u201d trilogy \u2014 presented itself in a best animated feature Oscar for \u201cInside Out.\u201d The film, about moody characters in a girl\u2019s brain, was filled with colors \u2014 red, blue, yellow, green and purple \u2014 but not black.In the best documentary feature category, \u201cAmy,\u201d about the singer Amy Winehouse, who died of substance abuse, took the award. It was a rarity among documentaries \u2014 a popular film that drew a substantial audience at the box-office for A24, and sold well in home markets. The film had edged aside \u201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\u201d and \u201cWinter on Fire: Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Freedom,\u201d both of which had lavish campaigns from their backer, Netflix.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the winners of the Governors Awards. It was Gena Rowlands, not Meryl Streep.Advertisement"}

She did it as Britta Perry, the self-absorbed hipster with grand delusions on NBC\u2019s \u201cCommunity.\u201d She did it as Mimi Rose Howard, the self-serious performance artist na\u00eff on HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls.\u201d She even did it in lingerie, in \u201cChoke,\u201d a 2008 adaptation of a Chuck Palahniuk novel, in which she played Cherry Daiquiri, a stripper with a sardonic smirk.Ms. Jacobs, for her part, says that while she has become an expert at portraying maladjusted characters, the women she embodies on screen couldn\u2019t be further from her private self. \u201cIn real life, I am so boring,\u201d she said over a recent lunch near Gramercy Park in Manhattan. \u201cI don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t smoke. Dinner out of the house is a big night for me. I love books and NPR.\u201dPaul Rust, Ms. Jacobs\u2019s co-star in \u201cLove\u201d and one of the show\u2019s creators, says he wrote the part of Mickey with her in mind: \u201cI was a huge fan of her work on \u2018Community,\u2019 and had never seen someone be so funny and bright while playing this really broken person.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe needed someone to play Mickey that wouldn\u2019t stand in judgment of her, because she does a lot of things that most people would consider bad.\u201d (Mickey crashes a church service on Ambien, curses out an ex-boyfriend\u2019s mother and tries to steal coffee from a convenience store \u2014 and that\u2019s just in the first episode.) \u201cGillian,\u201d he said, \u201chas this way of infusing empathy into the damaged people she plays.\u201dJudd Apatow, an executive producer of \u201cLove,\u201d echoed this sentiment. \u201cThe challenge of a show like this is to make the character feel both honest and complex,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I heard that \u2018Community\u2019 might be ending or she might be available, I immediately said that we should try to get her before someone grabs her. I knew that she would be between gigs for a microsecond.\u201dThe tortured history of NBC\u2019s \u201cCommunity\u201d is well documented. Its creator, Dan Harmon, was removed as show runner for one season before being rehired; the show was then canceled, only to be picked up by Yahoo\u2019s nascent video streaming service, where it ran for a short season before being canceled yet again. But the beloved show served as a starting place for several young actors, including Ms. Jacobs.Though she had done a few independent films before landing the part of Britta, Ms. Jacobs says that she can\u2019t imagine her acting life without \u201cCommunity,\u201d which she calls her \u201creal graduate school\u201d and the training ground for her comedic chops. The character was written as a simultaneous ditz and blowhard, and Ms. Jacobs learned how to play the character\u2019s blowsy confidence for laughs.\u201cI had never done television when I walked onto set to film the pilot,\u201d she said. But after six seasons: \u201cI felt this huge freedom and permission to get weirder. No one in that cast ever judged one another for going big. It\u2019s where I learned to undo what Juilliard had taught me.\u201dMs. Jacobs says that despite her obsession with classical theater as she grew up in Pittsburgh (\u201cI dragged my family to the George Bernard Shaw festival every year. What 13-year old does that?\u201d), she felt she never fit in with the classical training at Juilliard.After graduating in 2004, she spent her early 20s in New York auditioning for plays and festival films. But Ms. Jacobs soon realized that television might be a good match for her comedic gifts. \u201cI remember making this tiny independent film in the dark woods of New York State and thinking, the moment this thing wraps I am getting on a plane and flying to Los Angeles for pilot season. Pilot season was almost over, but I knew I had to try it.\u201dThe moment she landed in Los Angeles, she says, she got a terrible flu. She went on her audition for \u201cCommunity\u201d nauseous, in baggy jeans, with no makeup on. \u201cI sat in a room full of women who had blowouts and full faces of makeup, and just decided I didn\u2019t really care anymore,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cAnd I guess that is what Dan liked about me.\u201dMr. Harmon said: \u201cI never perceived that she had the flu. I just thought she was more real than the other girls. When I wrote Britta, she was kind of the two-dimensional dream girl, like a fake rabbit dogs have to chase. And Gillian made me believe that my horribly written character was a real person.\u201dThough everyone who has worked with Ms. Jacobs would agree that she has mastered the dysfunctional millennial, she finds herself wanting to stretch. Last year, she directed \u201cThe Queen of Code,\u201d a documentary about a computer-science pioneer named Grace Hopper, a project that brought her to the White House to speak to young women in the tech industry.But for now, Ms. Jacobs says, she is focused on playing Mickey. The second season of \u201cLove\u201d starts shooting in March.\u201cIt\u2019s not your usual rom-com,\u201d she said, referring to the incredibly flawed Mickey and Gus, played by Mr. Rust. \u201cThey both have a lot of anger under the surface, a lot of frustration. I find that when you date someone who is messier on the surface, you feel like, oh, I\u2019m the good one. That\u2019s just like, easier.

{"Headline": "Delivery Start-Ups Face Road Bumps in Quest to Capture Untapped Market", "Date": "2016-02-11", "News": "Supported byDoorDash, one of a multitude of start-ups with a mobile app that lets people order and get food sent to their doorsteps, relies on contract drivers like Brian Navarro to make the deliveries. The problem is that workers like Mr. Navarro don\u2019t always stick around.\u201cDrivers do jump around,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. \u201cThe general consensus is that drivers really only stick around for three to six months.\u201dThat churn has become expensive for DoorDash. A large number of drivers left the start-up less than a year after they joined, according to two people who have seen the company\u2019s driver data. DoorDash spends upward of $200 in recruitment and referral bonuses for some drivers, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Other delivery companies, like Postmates and Instacart, face similar retention challenges, these people said.The issue is just one headache now troubling delivery start-ups, which have been among the hottest sectors of start-up activity in recent years. Based on a belief that the companies would succeed once they grew to enormous scale, investors poured more than $730 million into delivery firms like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, up more than 1,100 percent from the same period a year and a half ago, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm.But entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to find that the economics of making a delivery service work are far from easy.The problems are rooted in the high operating costs of the start-ups, which typically act as middlemen between consumers and restaurants or grocery stores. The companies not only have to pay for large fleets of drivers, they also have big groups of employees who receive customer orders from the apps and who then manually make calls to the restaurants to order food. At the same time, to attract customers, many of the start-ups offer introductory prices and discounts, often making delivery free for first-time users.As DoorDash\u2019s experience with drivers shows, the start-ups\u2019 costs don\u2019t necessarily decline over time. For some drivers, who are paid a fee per delivery, it can be difficult to make enough deliveries in an hour to make it financially worthwhile for them. And when drivers move on, the companies must spend again to recruit replacements.\u201cEnsuring drivers have the best possible experience on the DoorDash platform is one of our top priorities,\u201d Eitan Bencuya, a DoorDash spokesman, said in a statement. He said the company has proprietary technology that helps drivers increase the amount of deliveries they can make in a single trip, increasing their commissions per hour.\u201cPrivate companies doing last-mile delivery rely on charging high consumer fees, which make the services untenably expensive for the average consumer,\u201d Dean Prissman, an Internet analyst for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note to clients in October.Some investors said the start-ups have the potential to capture a relatively untapped multibillion-dollar market, one that is also being eyed by tech behemoths like Google, Amazon and Uber. The companies see opportunity in bringing delivery to millions of retailers and restaurants that do not now offer it, all for a slice of the fees.Alfred Lin, a partner at the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which has invested in DoorDash and Instacart, said the start-ups are also amassing a very valuable asset: consumers\u2019 purchasing data. \u201cThe advent of the smartphone gives a company the ability to track all the information about your purchasing habits, and where you are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty dramatic what a company can do to utilize that information.\u201dMr. Lin compared DoorDash\u2019s trajectory to those of Netflix, Amazon and Zappos, which all required huge early spending toward a bet on future growth. He added that DoorDash is seeing a lot of growth now.\u201cIt\u2019s still kind of a premium service,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike the early days of Uber, when they only had black cars.\u201dMr. Lehmann said he imagines a future in which Postmates cuts deals with 60 to 70 percent of the restaurants in its app. As Postmates grows more popular, drivers will be able to make more deliveries to more people in shorter amounts of time, eventually earning them \u2014 and the company \u2014 more money.\u201cWe can and will be profitable as a company in 2017,\u201d he said.Mr. Lehmann added that its drivers do jump to adjacent services from time to time but frequently return to working for Postmates.DoorDash is trying to keep a lid on costs another way: By paying its drivers less per delivery. According to an email from the company to drivers that was reviewed by The New York Times, DoorDash said that starting on Monday, it would change the pay per delivery in Los Angeles to $5, down from $6, excluding tips.\u201cWe know this is an important change, so we want to be transparent about why we are making this adjustment,\u201d DoorDash said in the email. The company said drivers would make up what they lose in fee cuts through an increased order volume.Mr. Navarro, the driver in Los Angeles, said he could make only about two deliveries an hour, though that has increased at peak mealtimes. While he is unhappy with the fee change, he said he plans to keep working for DoorDash and Postmates for now because it beats the alternative.\u201cI\u2019d rather do this than be driving for Lyft or Uber,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Farhad and Mike Have a Big Story (Apple), and Some Scraps", "Date": "2016-02-20", "News": "Supported byBitsI\u2019m curious if the other tech giants will stick by Apple\u2019s side as the showdown with the F.B.I. gets more heated. What I mean is: I have no idea what will happen.Here\u2019s the big thing I want to get to: Kanye West. Or more specifically, what Kanye is doing for Tidal, the streaming music service that most everyone thinks is completely doomed, save for Jay-Z, who owns the service, and a handful of pop stars who support it.Kanye teased his newest album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d this week before releasing it more widely through the classic modes of distribution \u2014 namely, the music labels. Tidal got an exclusive window in which the album is only available through its service, something that other stars have pledged to do on Tidal in the future. As a result, Tidal has shot to the top of the download charts on the App Store.So does this make Tidal a viable service? Can it actually have a shot with this celebrity practice of \u201cwindowing,\u201d something that other companies like Vessel are trying as well?About Tidal: Yes, I think that it can have a shot at getting subscribers with these high-profile, short-term exclusives \u2014 but I\u2019ve got to say, I really hate it. I think what we\u2019re seeing here is the terrible future of media: Lots of different services with slightly different libraries of stuff, so that consumers have to either get several of them or just live without access to certain entertainment (or wade into the sin of torrenting).This is already the case with TV. Unbundling and cutting the cord and Internet streaming was supposed to make everything cheap and available, but in fact I probably pay more for media today than I ever have. I like the exclusives on Netflix, Amazon, HBO enough that I subscribe to all three. They\u2019re all getting better, and I don\u2019t see myself relying on any single one of them for all my TV any time soon.That\u2019s probably going to happen with music, too. The highest-profile artists will always have an incentive to offer exclusivity periods to one or two services. We listeners are either going to have subscribe to several or just do without. I really, really, really like Taylor Swift. I agonized for months about whether to go with Apple Music, which has Taylor but an annoying interface and not-great playlists, or Spotify, which has a wonderful user interface and an amazing weekly playlist tailored to a user\u2019s tastes \u2014 but no Taylor.I chose Spotify in the end. But I really miss Taylor.But there is zero indication that structure will ever go away. Even \u00e0 la carte options in the TV world add up to ultimately be much more costly than it would be to buy a cable subscription. I don\u2019t think cord-cutting is worth it, unless you\u2019re willing to go all-in on one or two networks.And that\u2019s sort of the point, right? Independent networks exist because they look for the best content and differentiate themselves based on providing that content as a service. If you find the shows \u2014 or music, or whatever \u2014 good enough, you will pay for it.That\u2019s why I think exclusives and windowing is a fair practice, even if it is a pain for me having to sign up for a new service. In this case, it\u2019s the artists essentially fighting against Spotify and the labels which, in the former case, artists claim they see too little in royalties for each song played. In the latter case, artists see little after the labels and distributors take their cut. The whole reason Tidal exists is to put some of the leverage back in the hands of the artists themselves with their own distribution platform.The big problem with that is that there are not enough artists who create huge enough albums to maintain that leverage in the long term. There is only one Lady Gaga, only one Jay-Z, and so on. And if Apple can cut a deal with Taylor, Tidal loses even more leverage when it sees other huge pop stars work with competing services.In sum, Tidal is doomed, but I do think it is a noble effort. Maybe the artists will figure out a different way to gain leverage in the wake of physical album sales falling and profits from streaming music not able to make up for that gap.Or maybe not. I won\u2019t cry for Kanye. He\u2019s famous.Advertisement"}

Developed by the Press Up Entertainment Group, it opened in late 2014. Its sedate red brick facade belies the hipster-rocker aesthetic that pervades the interior, where a ceiling fashioned out of slabs of concrete, track lighting and a handsome backlit bar make the lobby feel more like a clubby drinking den. That bold, edgy sensibility extends to the rest of the hotel, which features rooms with bunk beds, record players and vinyl, along with paintings and photographs by Irish artists.The hotel, in the Dublin 2 district, is about 300 yards from St. Stephen\u2019s Green. Many other attractions are a short stroll away, including the shops of Grafton Street (eight minutes) and Trinity College Dublin (13 minutes). Take note, however: The Dean is on Harcourt Street, home to popular nightclubs (a boon to some, an annoyance to others).Our fourth-floor basic Mod Pod room gave off a cool, bachelor-pad vibe with its wooden herringbone-patterned floor, dark turquoise walls, wall-mounted flat-screen TV, Marshall speakers and a bright orange mini Smeg fridge that provided a pop of color as well as Irish liquors like Baileys, for a price. While there are considerably larger units, our small double, at 136 square feet, felt cramped, especially when it came time to sleep in the double bed, lined on three sides with tufted, cushioned board. All that plushness looked cozy but took up valuable real estate: When lying down, my husband, at just under six feet, could touch the footboard with his toes, while his hair practically scraped the headboard. Our night only got worse: A steady bass beat blasted from one of those nearby clubs into the early morning hours. Upon checkout, the concierge informed us that guests seeking a quieter stay \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t? \u2014 should ask for a south-facing room.Glass partitions looked onto the room and a stylish stall featured a rain shower head. Bath products by the Grafton Barber, a local chain, were a nice touch.My breakfast order consisted of three slices of thick-cut French toast, two juicy sausages, a medley of plump berries and a tall glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. It arrived in less than 20 minutes and the bill came to a reasonable 13.80 euros.Sophie\u2019s, the hotel\u2019s top-floor, glass-walled restaurant with a modern Italian menu, has sweeping views of the Dublin skyline. During our visit last spring it was buzzing, even on a drizzly Sunday night. I tucked into crisp, lightly battered squid and flavorful chile-flecked veal meatballs on a bed of orzo studded with sun-dried tomatoes and green olives. The handsome open-air bar has a trend-conscious cocktail list, with drinks including an old-fashioned prepared with bacon-infused bourbon. Among the complimentary amenities: fast Wi-Fi in all the rooms, Netflix and cruiser bikes custom made for the hotel.A tasteful, reasonably priced crash pad for those who want to be in the heart of the night life district. Anyone seeking a quiet night\u2019s sleep might pass.The Dean, 33 Harcourt Street; 353-1-607-8110; deandublin.ie.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Stocks Have Fallen Faster and Further Than Broader Market", "Date": "2016-02-09", "News": "Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As the United States economy muddled along over the last few years, investors paid handsome sums to get in on high-flying technology companies that were among the few pockets of steady growth. Now comes the payback.As the stock market continues its 2016 slide, technology stocks are falling even further, victims of their own success as well as fears about the global economy and a slowdown in business spending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9.4 percent this year. The index\u2019s technology components are down about 12 percent, and the closely watched so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 are down even further, falling 17 percent on average this year after an 83 percent rise in 2015.\u201cThey go faster on the way up, they go faster on the way down. That\u2019s about as simple as I can make it,\u201d said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners.Shares of Twitter, the popular social media service, for example, are down about 40 percent so far this year. And some analysts worry it could tumble even more after the company announces quarterly results Wednesday afternoon.The overall market has been hit by a slowdown in China and a collapse in the price of oil prices and other commodities.Many technology companies continue to produce strong profits, and for the most part they have strong balance sheets with lots of cash to fund future growth. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, for example, added close to $10 billion to its $73 billion cash reserve over the last year.But since these companies\u2019 shares are priced high relative to their profits \u2014 that is, because investors are willing to pay more now in hopes of getting in on future growth \u2014 they become more vulnerable when there is a broader market downturn.\u201cThe market is doing a general sell-off, everybody is looking at things,\u201d said Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Technology Fund. \u201cTech stocks are pretty expensive, so they are more prone to correction.\u201dTake, for instance, the price-to-earnings ratio of Amazon and Facebook. P/E, as stock analysts call it, is a measurement of a company\u2019s stock price divided by earnings a share. For Amazon, that number is 388. Facebook? It\u2019s 78. But for the whole S.&P. 500, it is a more modest 17.Wage growth has been slow for years, but consumers always seemed to have enough for a new iPhone or to try out new gadgets like a FitBit, all while shifting more of their spending to online outlets like Amazon and Netflix. Businesses embraced cloud computing and bought ever more ads on Google and Facebook.No doubt, technology stocks were to some extent being lifted by the same low interest rates that had propelled the broader stock market, but they also had good stories to tell their investors, as well as the numbers to back it up.Now some investors are wondering how long they can keep it up in the face of slower growth. The economy ended last year on a whimper, expanding less than 1 percent for a number of reasons including weaker trade and falling business investment.Worried about a broader slowdown, investors have become quick to punish any company that looks as if its upward trajectory is flattening out, particularly if that company looks susceptible to the decline in businesses spending.That thinking helps explain big drops for LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, and Tableau Software, a maker of business software. Both companies have lost more than half their market value after weaker-than-expected revenue forecasts.Shares of Salesforce, the cloud software company, have been caught in the undertow and are down close to 30 percent this year.\u201cPeople are starting to anticipate a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and a slowdown in related technology spending,\u201d said Scott Kessler, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence.Still, with consumer spending and job growth remaining healthy, the market continues to give special consideration to consumer-focused companies that are making their numbers.Netflix also disappointed Wall Street with American subscriber growth that was lower than investors had hoped. The stock is down about 25 percent this year.What is not yet clear is how the decline in public company shares will affect the herd of tech \u201cunicorns,\u201d or private companies worth more than $1 billion, like the ride-hailing service Uber. Whatever the result, it is unlikely to be good.\u201cThat whole thing that you\u2019re going to hide out from the volatility in the public market \u2014 this is where they are going to find out that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, a technology investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif.Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Michael Pollan and Pangs of Guilt, Not Hunger", "Date": "2016-02-17", "News": "Supported byMichael Pollan is food-shaming us again, this time in a four-part Netflix docu-series. It\u2019s a gentle sort of shaming, and informative, but unless you\u2019ve previously been converted to Pollanology through his books (\u201cThe Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma\u201d) or his other screen appearances (\u201cFood, Inc.\u201d), you\u2019ll come away feeling mighty guilty about what you eat.It\u2019s a long-view history lesson in how innovations that we take for granted transformed the human species. Cooking with fire relieved us of the chore of chewing raw food for hours, among other things. The invention of pots that could withstand flame made it possible to cook with liquids, to mix things in soups and stews.\u201cIt opens up a whole new palette of possible flavors,\u201d Mr. Pollan says, \u201cand suddenly you have the birth of cuisine.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s bread (the subject of the \u201cAir\u201d episode).\u201cBread requires a civilization,\u201d Mr. Pollan says. \u201cYou need people to grow the grain. You need people to harvest the grain. You need people to mill the grain and shape the dough, and it\u2019s a cooperative venture.\u201dThis is Michael Pollan the food historian, but Michael Pollan the crusader is always hovering, ready to remind us how far we have wandered from our culinary roots. In one way or another, each of these episodes mourns our detachment from our food and how to prepare it.We have, Mr. Pollan notes (especially in \u201cWater\u201d), bought into the idea that we are way too busy to cook, and by \u201ccook\u201d he means create something, not thaw something out and microwave it. We\u2019ve ceded the kitchen to the food industry, which helped create the no-time-to-cook mind-set with its advertising and stood ready to assist our busy selves with processed foods of dubious nutritional value.Mr. Pollan\u2019s messages are important to hear and are engagingly presented in this series. Still, there\u2019s a disconnect that\u2019s never addressed. It would be great if all 7.4 billion of us could hunt our own lizards and cook them over an open fire, spend hours baking our own bread from grain milled on stone, and so on. But there\u2019s a gentrification to Mr. Pollan\u2019s brand of culinary advocacy.The world\u2019s poorest people \u2014 some seen in idyllic imagery here \u2014 have to devote long hours to basic subsistence, and the world\u2019s relatively well off have the luxury to indulge in artisanal cooking. Yet applying his ideas across the whole range of human circumstances is a trickier subject than this pretty series wants to tackle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Record Number of False Convictions Overturned in 2015", "Date": "2016-02-03", "News": "Supported byThe review by the National Registry of Exonerations said the inmates had spent more than 14 years behind bars on average, with some serving more than three decades. The registry is a project of the University of Michigan\u2019s law school and aims to correct problems in the criminal justice system.The annual tally of false convictions has more than doubled since 2011, the registry said. All told, its researchers have recorded 1,733 exonerations since 1989.\u201cThe most notable thing is another increase in the rate of exonerations,\u201d said Samuel R. Gross, the editor of the registry and a University of Michigan law professor. \u201cThat just shows that the problems that are causing convictions of innocent people happen on a regular basis.\u201dThe bulk of the exonerations in 2015 came from just two states: Texas, where 54 people were cleared, and New York, with 17. The registry linked that trend to efforts by individual district attorneys in Brooklyn and in Harris County, Tex., to review questionable convictions.Since taking office in 2014, Brooklyn\u2019s district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, has overseen a broad review of potentially wrongful convictions, an undertaking that has been watched closely across the country by prosecutors, defense lawyers and inmates.\u201cIf that same effort were put in across the country,\u201d Mr. Gross said, \u201cwe\u2019d find many more of these cases.\u201dOfficial misconduct played a role in 65 of the exonerations in 2015, the registry said, and false confessions were seen in 27. The most common reason inmates were cleared, in 75 of the cases, was that no crime had even occurred.Two of the men, William Vasquez and Amaury Villalobos, spent almost 33 years each in prison on arson and murder charges. The third defendant, Raymond Mora, died in prison.The exonerations in Harris County, which includes Houston, largely involved drug offenses. Last year, 42 people who had pleaded guilty to possession were cleared after retesting found that the substances were not in fact drugs.Inger Chandler, who heads the county\u2019s conviction integrity unit, told the registry that many of the defendants might have chosen to plead guilty because they were stuck behind bars, unable to make bail, and feared risking years in prison at trial.The registry found that more than two-thirds of those exonerated in 2015 were minorities, and half were African-American. Five defendants had death sentences.Mr. Gross said that the country\u2019s attitudes about the dependability of criminal justice outcomes were reflected in the greater attention paid to wrongful-conviction cases. The number of conviction integrity units like those in Brooklyn and Harris County grew to as many as 24 in 2015 from one in 2007, he said.\u201cAs a society, we have become much more willing to acknowledge mistakes that we\u2019ve made,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Kennedy.\u201dAl had hoped to do so himself, but cancer got in the way. So he sells Jake on the idea, giving him a short course on what he has learned from his trips through the portal.\u201cEach time you go in, everything resets,\u201d he says. It\u2019s always the same time and date \u2014 like \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d with much higher stakes. Oh, and another thing, an important one: \u201cThe past doesn\u2019t want to be changed,\u201d Al explains. It tends to push back, seeming to want to foil the meddler. Sometimes it pushes back frighteningly hard.Making an attention-getting opening installment is the easy part. Once the gimmick is established, though, \u201c11.22.63\u201d slows down as it becomes less a science-fiction story and more a period drama. This particular period has been mined repeatedly since \u201cHappy Days,\u201d so by now we\u2019re thoroughly familiar with its signature elements: the cars, the hats, the gathering social revolution, the ominous feel of the early nuclear age that always hangs in the air.Thus \u201c11.22.63\u201d isn\u2019t particularly revelatory. But time displacement is always good for a gag \u2014 Jake\u2019s cellphone falls out of his pocket; he references a pop song that hasn\u2019t been written yet \u2014 and there\u2019s a certain comfort to revisiting the hues and hairstyles of the 1960s once again. Plus it\u2019s interesting to see how writers and actors conjure the real historical figures who begin to populate the fictional world as Jake makes his way toward Dallas.Daniel Webber is a creepy Lee Harvey Oswald, whom Jake and a confederate named Bill (George MacKay) track to try to figure out whether he is acting alone as the fateful day approaches. Lucy Fry gives real substance to Oswald\u2019s wife, Marina. Good news for conspiracy buffs: The C.I.A. is well represented. But amid the gathering paranoia \u2014 both Oswald\u2019s and Jake\u2019s \u2014 there is still room for occasional winking, most notably in a hilarious scene in a brothel in Part 4. The going rate back then: $15 for 15 minutes.Jake is there only for research purposes, because by that point in the story he is in the process of giving his heart to Sadie (Sarah Gadon), a young woman who works at the school where he has taken a teaching job. Way back in the diner, Al had warned him not to grow too close to anyone \u2014 \u201cIt never ends well,\u201d he advised \u2014 and he had a point. Love is complicated, and in this case it certainly complicates Jake\u2019s assassination-prevention mission.Many pieces of the book have been omitted here, including some of its more rewarding threads, and as the pace slows in the middle of the series, fans of the novel might wish different choices had been made. But things quicken again by Part 6 as the rendezvous with history nears and the question of what happens if you alter the past is put to the test. And the finale is beautifully done and beautifully carried by Mr. Franco, thought-provoking and heartbreaking at once.The real question is how best to consume this series. Hulu is doling it out, one episode per week. But it may be best suited to binge-watching. As Jake discovers, the past has a pull that makes you reluctant to resurface in the present.Advertisement"}

HBO has about 50 million subscribers in the United States, and 130 million subscribers worldwide.Analyst forecasts for how many people would sign up for the offering were varied. For its long-term target, HBO projected that about half of the 10 million homes in the United States with web service but no traditional cable or satellite television subscriptions would subscribe to HBO Now.\u201cWe see an enormous amount of opportunity ahead,\u201d Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, said during the call.Growth, Mr. Plepler added, would be propelled by an injection of new programming, more marketing firepower and global expansion. New shows meant to appeal to HBO Now viewers include series from the comedian Jon Stewart and the sports personality Bill Simmons, \u201cSesame Street\u201d and a daily newscast from Vice.Some analysts viewed the 800,000 figure as low, especially when compared with the 43.3 million paid subscribers that HBO\u2019s rival Netflix has in the United States.During the call, one analyst asked Mr. Plepler why HBO Now had \u201conly\u201d 800,000 subscribers.

{"Headline": "Nielsen Plays Catch-Up as Streaming Era Wreaks Havoc on TV Raters", "Date": "2016-02-02", "News": "Supported byDennis Cheatham said he felt as if he were receiving a message from the past last May when a package arrived in the mail from Nielsen asking him to participate in the survey that for decades has detailed the television viewing habits of Americans. \u201cI just kind of shoved it in there and wrote Netflix wherever I could,\u201d said Mr. Cheatham, 40, a professor of graphic design at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. \u201cIs Nielsen not paying attention to technology? Don\u2019t they notice that something has changed?\u201dMr. Cheatham is not the only one asking that question.The stakes are high. Some $70 billion in advertising dollars are traded in the United States each year based on Nielsen\u2019s ratings, and hundreds of television programs live or die based on that viewership data.Chief among the complaints about Nielsen is that viewers across the country like Mr. Cheatham and his family are streaming billions of hours of video on outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, but that their behavior is not being captured in industry ratings based on Nielsen data.\u201cThe TV ratings system as we know it is outdated,\u201d said Tim Nollen, a Macquarie analyst.Nielsen executives promise that they are paying attention and are ready and able to track the myriad ways people consume media. They also underscore that paper diaries are deployed to measure viewing in local television markets, which account for a small part of the business, and that panels with more sophisticated electronic meters measure national viewing.\u201cWe\u2019re not arrogant about the landscape and about the needs of marketers and media companies and agencies to have better, more comprehensive data,\u201d said Steve Hasker, Nielsen\u2019s global president chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019re much more focused on meeting those needs and executing against our road map than we are looking over our shoulder.\u201dFor a long time, the only real recourse television and ad executives had was to grumble. They still relied on and paid for Nielsen measurement because it was their main option.Whether any of the new players will dethrone Nielsen is unclear. Some industry analysts like Mr. Nollen and other executives said that because of its legacy, Nielsen remained best positioned to provide a single source of ratings data across TV and digital. Others question whether ratings will even be relevant in a not-too-distant digital future, when ads are bought and sold based on specific data about viewers, such as location, occupation, salary and purchases, rather than broad audience metrics.\u201cThe road is littered with the roadkill of companies that have tried to compete with Nielsen over the years,\u201d said Alan Wurtzel, president of research at Comcast\u2019s NBCUniversal. \u201cNow, some of these new entities might wind up being able to do things in a way that Nielsen can\u2019t. If they have figured out a better mousetrap, they could give the industry something to seriously think about.\u201dIn the last year, Nielsen has released 69 new products and technology innovations \u2014 most notably introducing a measurement called total audience metric to track TV viewing across video on demand, mobile and streaming.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Yet Nielsen is established on an inherent conflict that can impede the adoption of new measurement methods. Nielsen is paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year by the television industry that it measures. And that industry, which uses Nielsen\u2019s ratings to sell ads, is known to oppose changes that do not favor it. \u201cPeople want us to innovate as long as the innovation is to their advantage,\u201d Mr. Hasker said.Some television and advertising executives have said that Nielsen has started to address their concerns. CBS, for instance, announced in September that it was working with Nielsen to measure viewers across streaming and mobile.Another major initiative from Nielsen was the expansion of its national television ratings panel, which deploys electronic devices to track minute-by-minute viewing. To capture more diverse and splintering audiences, the company increased its panel to nearly 41,000 households, or about 100,000 people, from 21,000 households. Again, some executives said that the change came too late. When it is possible to track the websites people visit, what products they buy and which shows they stream, advertisers say they are seeking much more detailed information.Mr. Hasker said that Nielsen was exploring ways to incorporate more digital data, like Facebook registration information and direct feeds from set-top boxes, into its ratings.The battle between the old and the new measurement establishment already is playing out across the local television market, which is measured separately from the national market. For years, Nielsen deployed its paper diaries to measure viewing. Rentrak entered the market and won a number of clients by offering an alternative: using the data from set-top boxes to measure what people are watching on the television. After closing its deal with comScore, the new company is expected to include more complete and accurate digital viewing data by merging Rentrak\u2019s television metrics with comScore\u2019s digital data. But even that new method is not perfect. Some critics point to holes in Rentrak data, stating that set-top box measurement does not represent the total population.\u201cWe have heard from our clients across the industry, and the message has been very clear: Measurement needs to evolve,\u201d Serge Matta, comScore\u2019s chief, said Monday in announcing the closing of the merger.Nielsen plans to phase out the use of unreliable television diaries \u2014 like the one Mr. Cheatham received \u2014 in the local markets where they are used and replace them with more accurate electronic devices. The decision, Mr. Hasker said, was not spurred by the competition but was made because \u201cusing paper diaries in an increasingly digital world is an incredibly difficult thing to explain and justify.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Rise and Fall of the Unicorn", "Date": "2016-02-12", "News": "Supported byAnother ViewJeremy G. Philips is a general partner at Spark Capital.For a moment, there was no more prestigious endorsement for a technology start-up than joining the so-called Unicorn Club, consisting of more than 150 private technology companies valued at a billion dollars or more. Now, with valuations deflating, it\u2019s often viewed as more of a scarlet letter.However, because the only membership criterion is valuation, the members of this club have about as much in common with each other as a gram of gold has with a barrel of oil.Some private market valuations got ahead of themselves, requiring adjustment. But that\u2019s hardly remarkable; this happens frequently in public markets, too. The issue is that many unicorns are not sustainable; they have a shiny veneer of revenue growth, without a sufficiently durable competitive advantage to create substantial, long-term value.Several well-known Internet companies, particularly the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now a unit of Alphabet \u2014 have built powerful positions. The market recognized this by adding more than $250 billion in market cap to this group over the last 12 months \u2014 even while the broader market was down more than 10 percent.The huge success of the FANG stocks, however, distracts from the reality that the web has ground down the barriers to entry in many technology markets, increasing transparency and competition. For new entrants, lower barriers create opportunity. But they create the same chance for scores of other start-ups, too, making it challenging to build a durable advantage.Just when a firm seems to be getting a dominant foothold, a plethora of start-ups emerge to erode its advantage. Less than a year ago, GrubHub had a market cap of more than $4 billion and seemed to be on the way to a powerful monopoly in food delivery. But myriad start-ups, backed by billions of dollars, have been competing for its market. Investors no longer see GrubHub as a putative monopoly. Accordingly, its stock is down more than 60 percent over the last year.There are limited sources of genuine competitive advantage in Silicon Valley, as with other businesses. Most significant are economies of scale. McDonald\u2019s buys ingredients more cheaply than a stand-alone burger joint, and its marketing costs are spread across tens of millions of customers.For technology companies, the holy grail is a specially durable subset of scale advantage: network effects, virtually unknown in the rest of the economy. The most potent flavor is on the consumer side, where a service\u2019s utility increases as more people use it. That creates a powerful barrier: If one\u2019s friends and family are all on Facebook, an alternative social network, even with superior features, is unlikely to be tempting \u2014 which is why Facebook has more than 1.5 billion users each month, and rising. A Big Mac, in contrast, does not taste any better even with millions of simultaneous consumers.In Silicon Valley, virtually every pitch deck claims network effects \u2014 but they are rarely spotted in the wild. The largest on-demand home cleaning service in any locale may have a cost and speed advantage versus competitors, which helps attract more consumers and more cleaning people.But this virtuous cycle, despite the common misconception, is just a garden variety impact of local scale \u2014 not network effects. A large customer base does not make any service even a smidgen more valuable to someone getting their home cleaned. For a small discount, customers will happily try an alternative cleaning service, on-demand car valet or flash sale. Monopolies in these categories, like most others, are unlikely. In contrast, it\u2019s unclear what \u2014 if anything \u2014 it would take to pry Snapchat out of a teenager\u2019s hands \u2014 but it sure wouldn\u2019t be a cheap coupon.It\u2019s not just start-ups that find it hard to build a monopoly. Even in the rarefied air of the FANG stocks, monopolies are hard to come by.Amazon is a powerhouse with substantial scale advantages \u2014 its latest quarterly revenue was $36 billion, and it has increasing customer loyalty, including more than 50 million paying Prime subscribers. But Amazon is far from a monopoly. In retail, beyond a few narrow categories where it dominates (notably: books), Amazon is a leading player in intensely competitive markets. In cloud computing, its innovative Amazon Web Services is the leading player serving start-up customers and is making inroads with enterprises. But it does not have the cloud to itself. It is locked in ferocious competition with Microsoft, Google and several others. Unsurprisingly, in the decade since its debut, the service has cut prices more than 50 times.Similarly, Netflix is the leading subscription video distributor. It has more than 75 million subscribers and is producing hundreds of hours of original content. Netflix has scale advantages and strong customer captivity, but zero network effects; it does not become more entertaining with more subscribers. It is well placed to create enormous value as a long-term leader in this market but is far from a monopoly. It\u2019s too late for start-ups to enter the fray, but there are already formidable competitors, such as HBO and Amazon, driving up content acquisition costs and keeping a lid on consumer prices. Netflix is already on track to spend more than $5 billion on content this year \u2014 more than half its forecast revenue. And other deep-pocketed players, such as YouTube and Apple, have adjacent businesses that are strong enough to be potentially serious future players as well.That Silicon Valley is not all bulletproof billion-dollar companies and \u201cwinner take all\u201d markets is no cause for gloom. The current environment is a reminder of the primacy of business economics and market structure. At least for the moment, investors will revert to saving billion-dollar valuations for exceptionally defensible, growing businesses. That closes the chapter on the ill-fated unicorn experiment, which valued growth at any cost. Hopefully, it also spells the end of the term itself \u2014 which predictably turned out to be as useless a descriptor on the way down as it was on the way up.Advertisement"}
